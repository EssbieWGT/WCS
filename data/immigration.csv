(WFLA) — The Pinellas-Hillsborough Interfaith Coalition, a branch of the Florida Interfaith Coalition, along with other groups, is calling for changes to immigration enforcement across the state and the nation.

The groups have been holding weekly vigils to bring attention to their cause.

Reverend Wesley Snedeker of the Church of the Isles, United Church of Christ, is one of the organizers of the weekly vigils. He said the coalition’s most pressing request is to provide pastoral care to those being detained at Alligator Alcatraz, the migrant detention center near the Everglades.

“We’re seeing the separation of families,” Snedeker said.

“There have been reports of human rights abuses in state detention facilities, especially the one that has been called Alligator Alcatraz,” he said.

In mid-July, some migrants told The Associated Press they were being held in what they described as “zoo cages,” adding they were given toilets that would not flush, along with insects surrounding them and worms in their food. Shortly after, Florida Division of Emergency Management officials said those claims were false.

Protesters such as Brandt Robinson are also calling for an end to the detainment and deportation of non-violent criminals.

“The vast majority of undocumented immigrants to our country are doing the kinds of things that, frankly, a lot of us American citizens don’t want to do for a living,” Robinson said. “If you’re harvesting fruits and vegetables, if you’re processing our nation’s meat supplies, if you’re building the homes.”

Snedeker added to Robinson’s concern.

“Many of those folks end up living here in the United States as island citizens, working and paying taxes, who don’t have run-ins with law enforcement,” Snedeker said. “And these are some of the same folks that we’re seeing, who are detained.”

Since the beginning of President Trump’s second term, the White House has said entering the country illegally is the initial crime.

“If you are an individual, a foreign national who illegally enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal, so therefore you are subject to deportation,” a White House official said.

Lieutenant Governor Jay Collins has also been open about his stance on assisting the federal government.

“That doesn’t mean we don’t have empathy,” Collins said. “That means we have to follow through it, which we told them we were going to do. People ran on the ballot to solve these problems, and if they aren’t putting those actions, those words into action, what are they doing?”

A Turkish man who pleaded guilty to alien smuggling in a US federal court has exposed the growing reach of Turkish-run syndicates moving migrants into the United States through both the Mexican and Canadian borders.

The criminal complaint against Serkan Gökce, a Turkish national with prior US immigration violations, reveals a structured network relying on handlers in Canada, digital coordination via WhatsApp and prearranged pick-ups along remote border roads in upstate New York.

According to the complaint filed in the Northern District of New York, US Border Patrol agents detected movement near the Canadian border shortly before 3 a.m. on April 18, 2025. Remote sensor imagery captured several individuals walking through the woods toward the intersection of Scriver and Bush Road in Mooers Forks, an isolated crossing point known for frequent smuggling activity.

When agents arrived, they found three Turkish nationals who immediately admitted they had crossed into the US without legal documents. All three were taken into custody.

As the migrants were being processed, an agent observed a dark sedan behaving suspiciously near the same intersection. The vehicle slowed as if anticipating a rendezvous, then sped away. Agents followed and stopped the driver, identified as Gökce, who claimed he was trying to get to Plattsburgh, a statement inconsistent with his location, which matched the migrants’ description of the planned pick-up point.

The criminal complaint filed against a Turkish national for smuggling migrants into the United States:

At the Border Patrol station, one of the migrants, identified as D.C., agreed to a search of his phone. WhatsApp messages revealed he shared live GPS coordinates with Gökce throughout the crossing. D.C. also identified a Canada-based facilitator named T.Y., who arranged the smuggling operation and instructed migrants to look for a waiting Honda Civic, the same model Gökce was driving.

The three men apprehended with Gökce were not newcomers to illegal border crossings. Homeland Security records showed that all had previously been arrested for entering the United States illegally, two in Tecate, California, after crossing from Mexico in 2023, and one in El Paso, Texas, who later moved to Canada before attempting re-entry.

D.C. admitted he had earlier entered the US illegally from Mexico, lived there, then moved to Canada, from which he sought to re-enter the United States through an organized smuggling route run by Turkish nationals in Montreal and across the Quebec–New York border. He told investigators he paid $1,500 to T.Y. in Canada, and another $1,500 was to be paid to Gökce after the successful pick-up.

The arrangement mirrors patterns US authorities have increasingly documented since 2023: Turkish migrants paying large sums to well-organized cross-border facilitators who exploit the relative openness of the US–Canada frontier and the heavily trafficked Mexico routes.

Gökce himself had a known history with US immigration authorities. He was previously arrested in El Paso in 2022 and issued a Notice to Appear after entering the United States unlawfully. The new complaint shows he later became involved in transporting migrants, serving as a driver instructed to retrieve border crossers based on real-time digital location updates.

The case, signed by US Magistrate Judge Gary L. Favro and sworn by Border Patrol Agent Chase D. Beatty, offers a rare inside look at how Turkish smuggling networks operate with logistical hubs in Mexico, Canada and Turkey and use US borderlands as staging grounds for coordinated, technology-enabled crossings.

Gökce pleaded guilty to federal alien-smuggling charges, a felony that carries significant prison time. His cooperation, according to sources familiar with similar cases, may assist investigators in mapping a broader transnational smuggling structure that has moved thousands of Turkish nationals into the United States in recent years.

US immigration enforcement data reveal a dramatic rise in the number of Turkish nationals entering the United States over the past five years. The shift reflects a fundamental change in Turkey’s outward migration patterns, driven by political repression, economic instability and the rapid expansion of transcontinental smuggling pipelines stretching from Istanbul to Mexico and Central America.

US Customs and Border Protection data show that encounters with Turkish nationals at US borders surged to 18,986 in fiscal year (FY) 2023, which runs from October 2022 to September 2023, before easing to 13,311 in FY 2024 and then falling further to 5,192 in FY 2025. In FY 2026 encounters with Turks stood at 304 so far.

In fiscal year 2024, according to official data, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 37 Turkish nationals on criminal convictions, pending criminal charges or other immigration violations. The figure for fiscal year 2025 stands at 10 so far. Detentions involving Turkish nationals totaled 707 in FY 2024 and rose to 1,198 in FY 2025. In terms of removals, ICE deported 547 Turkish nationals in FY 2024, compared with 151 removals recorded in FY 2025.

The trajectory points to a sharp spike in irregular migration by Turkish citizens in 2023, followed by a marked decline over the subsequent two years, a shift that coincides with tighter border controls, changing smuggling routes and evolving US enforcement practices, while still leaving Turkish nationals as a visible component of non-traditional migration flows at the border.

Meanwhile, the Turkish government’s crackdown on human smugglers under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has remained largely ineffective. Most investigations have ended in dismissals, acquittals or the release of suspects, including individuals who profit from migrant smuggling in partnership with international criminal syndicates, underscoring the persistent failure to hold key actors accountable.

Publicly, Turkish authorities continue to boast about the number of detentions, prosecutions and court cases involving migrant smuggling. In practice, however, convictions remain rare, and the criminal justice system appears to have failed to stem the flow of illegal migration.

According to Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya, who briefed lawmakers in parliament on November 17, 2025, 3,627 migrant smugglers were arrested in 2025. In 2024 Yerlikaya announced a comparable figure, stating that 3,924 individuals were arrested in connection with migrant smuggling. The near-identical arrest numbers from one year to the next suggest that the government’s strategy of targeting organizers has failed to produce any meaningful deterrent effect.

Rather than declining, the caseload in Turkey’s judicial system continues to expand. According to the latest available data from the Justice Ministry, 26,314 prosecutions related to migrant and human smuggling were underway nationwide, involving 45,976 suspects. In 2024 alone prosecutors launched 13,140 new investigations, targeting 19,735 suspects.

Of these cases, 15,424 were brought before criminal courts, charging 32,538 suspects, while 7,776 new cases were filed in criminal courts in 2024 alone. At the appellate level, the dysfunction is even more apparent: More than 700 convictions were overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeals in the same year, further weakening the judicial response.

Taken together, the figures underscore a systemic failure under the government of President Erdogan. Despite thousands of arrests and a growing prosecutorial backlog, migrant-smuggling networks, often operating in coordination with international criminal syndicates, continue to function with near impunity, highlighting the gap between official rhetoric and meaningful enforcement.",https://nordicmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AFP__20251105__83376G4__v1__MidRes__UsMexicoBorderSecurity.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 20:56:19.886997

The federal government, offering up to $280 million, has recently signed at least two contracts with private surveillance firms to hunt down immigrants at their homes and places of work, according to various reports.

One of the companies, BI Incorporated, is a subsidiary of GEO Group, a for-profit prison company that currently does business with the government jailing detained immigrants, according to The Intercept.

Trump administration proposals to use private tracking and investigative services have been circulating for months. Lawmakers in two states, Missouri and Mississippi, introduced legislation to create their own bounty hunter programs, but those bills stalled.

The new federal contracts broaden the administration’s use of the private sector in immigration enforcement. For instance, BI Incorporated has had past government contracts in immigrant surveillance with ankle monitor-based tracking.

The new contracts, one of which goes to a company called AI Solutions 87, mostly seek software and artificial intelligence investigative services, but the door is open for on-the-ground tracking. However, reporting by The Intercept and 404 Media suggests once the immigrant targets are pinpointed, federal agents would move in to detain and arrest them.

In requesting bids, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was looking for private “Skip Tracing and Process Serving Services using Government furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification and physical observation services . . .”

In general, skip tracing is the process of tracking down people who are missing, unresponsive, or hard to find, according to Bosco Legal Services. Often, the practice is used to find individuals who have unpaid debts or failed to meet other obligations and may have “skipped” town.

ICE considered “performance-based incentives” for the contractors, but the final proposal for request apparently did not include bonus language or specific per-head bounties, according to Snopes, nor did it include the term “bounty hunter.”

But the contracts call for hunting down people for money.

“Under ICE’s proposed system, vendors would be given 10,000 noncitizens to identify, verify, and/or serve with documents, with a potential to receive ‘further increments of 10,000 aliens,’” according to the Immigration Policy Tracking Project.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has been an outspoken critic of the private tracking program, which he said “would effectively establish a ‘bounty hunter’ model.”

He sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem expressing “grave concern” about the initiative, according to his office.

Krishnamoorthi warned the proposal would “outsource one of the government’s most coercive powers to actors who operate with little oversight and limited public accountability.” He wrote that such an arrangement “risks creating an enforcement apparatus that functions beyond the reach of ordinary checks and balances.”

“When citizens can no longer discern who acts in the name of government, trust gives way to fear,” he added. “A government that rules through confusion and coercion rather than law and consent erodes its own legitimacy and the freedoms it exists to protect.”

Some of the tactics of federal agents and officials have already come under fire at times as overly aggressive, lacking due process and failing to clarify who the enforcers work for. In some cases, U.S. citizens and immigrants with legal authority to be in the country have been jailed for days with little or no information as to why they were detained.

The bills in Missouri and Mississippi appeared to be bonified bounty hunter proposals, with a $1,000 reward for assisting in the arrest of an undocumented immigrant.

“I’m finding a tremendous amount of support. It’s actually gaining support across the country,” state Sen. David Gregory, a Republican from St. Louis, told Newsweek early this year.

That didn’t happen. The two bills, which were similar, went nowhere.

The legislation also had language that allowed law enforcement in the states to assist the federal government in enforcing immigration violations. Yet Gregory, the author of the Missouri bill, noted police departments are stretched thin.

“The federal government, ICE, has been asking, in fact, begging for support from the state and local law enforcement officers across the entire country,” Gregory said. “So, part of this bill is the framework that requires that cooperation, number one.”

“But number two, what we’re looking for is some sort of supplement, some sort of augmentation to the program, because a lot of major cities across the country are short on police. We’re already short. We’re already overwhelmed.”

The United States has had a checkered history deploying bounty hunters, who at times were compensated for capturing, or killing, individuals. This notably happened during the Civil War with enlistment bounties to track down deserters. Governments in the expanding country offered money for Native American scalps in the 16th through 19th centuries.

In recent and far less violent times, bail bondsmen have employed private detectives and bounty hunters to track down bail jumpers, and the U.S. Department of Justice has rewarded whistleblowers who uncover immigration violations in the workplace.

There are laws across the country that allow intervener lawsuits with potential payouts for the third parties, including a statute in Texas that “deputizes” citizens to sue people providing or aiding in an abortion.

The tracking contracts focus solely on immigrants. Right now, a lot of news media and citizens are monitoring immigration enforcement by federal officials.

No doubt that focus will be extended to this new high-tech immigrant tracking chapter.

A series of immigration raids across California in 2025 had one thing in common: Most of the federal agents detaining people wore masks over their faces.

In January, the state of California and its largest county will ban law enforcement officers from covering their faces, with a few exceptions, putting local and state police at odds with masked immigration agents.

The state law gives law enforcement officers a choice: If they cover their faces, they lose the ability to assert “qualified immunity,” the doctrine that protects officers from individual liability for their actions. That means they can be sued for assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest or malicious prosecution, and the law adds a clause that says the minimum penalty for committing those offenses while wearing a mask is $10,000.

Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez, a Los Angeles Democrat who co-authored the law, said it was necessary to rein in anonymous federal agents.

“We initially were under the understanding that, oh, they’re only targeting folks who were not citizens,” Gonzalez said, “And then actually over time, you learn they don’t give a s— who you are, they’re attacking you no matter what, with no due process.”

The Trump administration has sued to block the bill, and more than a century of federal court precedent is on its side. An 1890 Supreme Court case provides that a state cannot prosecute a federal law enforcement officer acting in the course of their duties.

The Trump administration said in its brief to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California that forcing agents to reveal their identities would put the agents at risk.

During Immigration and Customs Enforcement “actions, individuals can be heard threatening to doxx and find out who officers and their family members are and where they live,” the administration’s lawyers said in the Nov. 17 brief. “There are even public websites that seek and publish personal information about ICE and other federal officers to harass and threaten them and their families.”

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law, said the issue may not be as cut-and-dried as one or two Supreme Court cases. He pointed to a 2001 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision that allowed the case of a federal sniper who killed a woman during the 1992 Ruby Ridge, Idaho, standoff to go to trial.

“It basically says that a federal officer can be criminally prosecuted for unreasonable actions,” Chemerinsky said. “Federal officers, by virtue of being federal officers, do not get immunity from all state civil and criminal laws.”

Brian Marvel, president of an organization that represents California police unions, said the law will make life harder for local cops and county sheriffs’ deputies. The organizations that represent police chiefs, sheriffs, agents in the Attorney General’s office and California Highway Patrol officers opposed the law too.

“I think that the state has put us in a tenuous position with this battle they’re having with the Trump administration,” said Marvel, of the Peace Officers Research Association of California. “We don’t want to be in the middle of this fight. But unfortunately, (with) the desire for higher name recognition and elections in 2026, they decided to create things that are much more political and not geared toward legitimate public safety issues.”

Marvel said another drawback of the law is giving “a false sense of hope to the immigrant community in California” that the law will force federal agents to leave the state.

Los Angeles County supervisors have also approved a local mask ban on law enforcement for unincorporated areas of the county, a measure that will go into effect in mid-January, unless a court decision comes sooner.

Gonzalez noted that masks have played a significant role in recent California history. First, during the pandemic, California temporarily made masks mandatory in public and at work. Then, a couple of years later, a rush of smash-and-grab robberies were harder to solve because the suspects all wore masks. Now, California finds itself in its third back-and-forth over face coverings.

The law provides exemptions for N-95 or medical-grade masks to prevent infection transmission, and permits undercover operatives to wear a mask.

“This is specifically aimed to federal agents because we gotta combat these kidnappings somehow,” Gonzalez said, “and this was our way in.”

Early in 2026, the high court is also expected to hear arguments over whether Trump’s executive order regarding birthright citizenship is constitutional.","Trump gets dozens of wins on the emergency docket

The Supreme Court’s emergency docket is designed as a way for parties in lower court proceedings to seek a pause of that court’s ruling or injunction, and the justices typically reject most petitions they receive. Through the first 11 months of the second Trump administration, the high court has received more than 30 petitions to its emergency docket from the Justice Department and has sided with the DOJ all but three times.

Trump’s victories on the emergency docket span a variety of issues, including massive plans to trim the size of the federal workforce. In July, the high court granted stays in two petitions, allowing mass layoffs at the Department of Education, along with a more sweeping reduction-in-force effort at various federal agencies.

The Trump administration was also successful in a trio of emergency petitions over the firing of independent agency heads, beginning with a lawsuit over the firing of Democrat-appointed members of the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board. The May order in Trump v. Wilcox found that the president “may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents.”

The two later emergency petitions, dealing with firings of members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, respectively, were also granted by the high court. The FTC firing case, Trump v. Slaughter, was taken up by the justices on an expedited basis to the merits docket, with the justices appearing likely to expand presidential firing power within the executive branch based on December 2025 oral arguments in the case.

The other wins the Trump administration got on the emergency docket included allowing the policy of banning transgender people from the military, mandating that the gender listed on passports is that person’s biological sex, and allowing the deportation of illegal immigrants to countries other than their country of origin.

The decisions have largely been on ideological lines, with the six justices appointed by Republican presidents largely siding with the administration, while the three justices appointed by Democratic presidents generally said they would deny the emergency requests.

While the Trump administration has been overwhelmingly successful on the emergency docket, it has had a mixed track record on emergency petitions regarding immigration policy. Two key losses on the emergency docket for the Trump administration included the high court ordering the administration to “facilitate” the return of illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia, after he was deported to El Salvador despite a withholding order against such action, and halting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in Texas in May.

Limiting universal injunctions is first win on the merits docket for Trump

While the Trump administration had dozens of cases on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, it only saw one case argued and decided by the justices on their merits docket in 2025. The lone ruling was a significant victory in the fight against universal injunctions.

One of the issues that emerged during the early months of Trump’s second term was lower courts’ prolific use of universal injunctions, which blocked administration policies and actions nationwide, instead of just the parties to the lawsuit. The administration brought to the Supreme Court a trio of universal injunctions blocking the president’s birthright citizenship order, asking for the high court to limit lower courts’ ability to issue these sweeping orders.

In the 6-3 ruling in Trump v. CASA, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, dismissed the idea that lower courts have the broad ability to issue universal injunctions, significantly limiting their ability to do so.

“The universal injunction was conspicuously nonexistent for most of our Nation’s history,” Barrett wrote in the June 2025 ruling. “Its absence from 18th- and 19th-century equity practice settles the question of judicial authority. That the absence continued into the 20th century renders any claim of historical pedigree still more implausible.”

“Had federal courts believed themselves to possess the tool, surely they would not have let it lay idle,” she added.

The ruling was celebrated by the Trump administration, but since the CASA ruling, lower courts have still found other ways to issue sweeping injunctions, including through class action lawsuits and through lawsuits where states are parties against the federal government. Despite the continued lawsuits and court-ordered pauses of policies post-CASA, the June ruling still marked a major win for the Trump administration.

2026 may be a mixed bag for Trump at the Supreme Court

While the Trump administration got a favorable ruling for the one case it brought to the merits docket, the upcoming cases the high court will consider could be unfavorable to the president.

At the end of 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases brought against the Trump administration over two major issues: the president’s sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs and his ability to fire independent agency heads. Early in 2026, the high court is also expected to hear arguments over whether Trump’s executive order regarding birthright citizenship is constitutional.

Richard Pierce, a law professor at George Washington University, previously told the Washington Examiner he believes the administration is likely to lose the tariffs case and the birthright citizenship case, but would likely prevail in the independent agency head firing case.

SUPREME COURT GRAPPLES WITH HOW MUCH EXECUTIVE POWER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES REALLY EXERT

During oral arguments over Trump’s tariffs in November 2025, the justices appeared skeptical of the president’s ability to levy sweeping tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Conversely, in oral arguments over Trump’s bid to fire independent agency heads without cause in December 2025, a majority of the justices seemed likely to side with the administration.

Oral arguments in the birthright citizenship case, Trump v. Barbara, are expected to occur sometime between February and April 2026, with decisions in all three major Trump cases expected by the end of June 2026.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25087712274742.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2025-12-28 15:56:40.160236

Leaning over Samar, Yogan saw that he was wide awake.
“I’m a dead man,” Samar said.
I’ve barely eaten today, man.” Yogan started to give Samar what he could.
It was Roshni that Yogan was thinking of that day with Samar, Roshni he imagined when their fingers were intertwined.","They were young men when they first met. Both of them in skinny jeans and American-branded T-shirts, purchased at a greater cost than either would have admitted to his family. Samar’s T-shirt read “GUESS?,” and Yogan’s “American Eagle.” The meaning of these inscriptions did not matter to them, though Yogan suspected that his had something to do with the American postal service, and this excited him. Samar’s T-shirt was tight around his chest in a film-hero kind of way, the polyester adhering to the curves of his boyish biceps, and he later admitted to Yogan that this elasticity, rather than the English word on his chest, was what had convinced him to make the purchase.

It was the T-shirts that had sparked their first conversation, each asking the other, “Do you speak English?” English was necessary in order to navigate the airport, and, they expected, life in this new city called Dubai, which was in so many ways an imitation of a major Western city. But English had come to both men only piecemeal, from the dazzling, incongruous lines in Bollywood films. The plots of those movies and their many twists had vanished; what Yogan and Samar recalled was Shah Rukh Khan, with his signature wide-eyed look, ordering Kajol to “take a chill pill!” And Kajol, mocking her hoity-toity London neighbors with “Would you like some tea?” Thanks to a joint effort drawing on both men’s vocabularies, they made it through immigration and baggage claim and out to the arrivals hall, where a red-haired woman with a laminated sign motioned for them to wait for the shuttle that would take them to their accommodations.

Only a few months earlier, Yogan’s wife had sent him out to look for more long-term work. His last construction contract had recently ended, and Roshni had suddenly vomited a hot stream of bile onto her bare feet after her morning tea. That afternoon, a drug-store test had informed them that she was pregnant with their second child. And so Yogan had been sternly dispatched to pass under a sign that read “KISMAT JOB AGENCY,” and into a roadside shop that smelled of a sporty, masculine cologne. Inside, another banner in lowercase English script read “quick overseas enquiry all welcome.”

Overseas, quick: the words themselves had a certain voltage.

The shop had a running air-conditioner, pristine white walls, and a statuette of Lord Ganesh attached to the plastic desk with a hardened dollop of liquid glue. Behind the screen of a laptop was a heavyset man, sitting as still as an oracle.

“Your name, your date of birth, your phone number,” the man said. He wore a thick gold chain over his collared shirt and repeatedly clicked one of two buttons on his wired mouse. Once Yogan had delivered the requested information, the man licked his index finger and handed him a sheet of paper setting out the conditions of his potential employment. The compensation, converted to rupees, was more than triple what he had made on his last contract.

“This is the only job I have available at the moment. You’ll go abroad?” the man asked.

Thanks to local gossip, Yogan already thought of the man as someone he needed to impress. He had worn his American Eagle T-shirt to the appointment. But the possibility of this new future made him aware of his own timidity. “What is it like over there, uncle?” he asked.

“Big, big buildings,” the man said, not once looking up from the screen of his computer. “And the roads are clean. Food and all is expensive, of course, but the quality is much better. Everything is imported, no? You’ll see, beta.”

It relaxed Yogan to be called “son.” He wondered if delivering this word, so affectionately, was part of the man’s training. But he felt disarmed enough to hint at his other question, which had been weighing on his mind since Roshni had broached the idea of his working in Dubai.

“My wife is expecting, uncle. Our second. We have one girl. I thought I should tell you that. I’ve heard the stories, you know.”

“What stories?” the man asked. Now he looked up from his computer and caught Yogan’s eye. No longer fatherly, Yogan thought, but shrewd, gruff.

“These men who hire us—I’ve heard they might arrange things so we can’t come back.”

“Rubbish!” the man said. Small, yellowish teeth appeared under the heft of his mustache; he was silently laughing. “If they did all that nonsense, then why would I have so many applications to process, hmm?” He pointed at a towering stack of folders behind him.

“Times have changed,” the man added. “Those stories are old. Bygone.”

Relieved, Yogan filled out his application and waited, over the next few weeks, for his phone to ring.

It had all happened differently for Samar.

Samar was from Mumbai, itself a big city, one that Yogan had always imagined as a sparkling place, the backdrop of his favorite movies, where A-list actors could be spotted sauntering through bazaars with their big sunglasses and hotheaded bodyguards. Samar wouldn’t have been as easily swayed by the hum of a working laptop and unstained white paint, Yogan guessed, for his new friend had laughed in a slightly superior way at these details of Yogan’s story.

“So why did you come then?” Yogan asked.

Sitting against a concrete wall outside the airport, using his duffel as a backrest, Samar told the story of the time he was hired to install a stripper pole in a Bollywood heroine’s Pali Hill flat. “The work order listed it as exercise equipment,” Samar said, “but I’ve seen enough movies. I know what people do with something like that.”

The actress was not there at the time of the installation, Samar said, but her home was decorated more extravagantly than he could have imagined. There, he saw furniture that he hadn’t known existed beyond film sets. A circular mattress, a crystal chandelier, lavender carpeting throughout. Samar had looked around not with envy, he said, but with reverence. The pole was to be installed in a third bedroom, which was also a dressing room, or so he guessed from the light bulbs around the mirrors and the many racks of frilly clothes. Later, in the chawl where he shared a single matchbox room with his wife, Samar began compulsively picturing the actress moving through her flat as he moved through his own. As he refilled the water drum at the communal taps for their morning tea, Samar imagined the actress draping her shoulders with the impossibly soft shawl that had been flung over the sofa, before dropping a tea bag into one of her many porcelain cups. In a moment of contemplation, she might hold the cup against her chest for warmth, he thought, for her air-conditioner would be rattling fiercely, set to a temperature of seventeen degrees Celsius.

“Seventeen degrees!” Samar said, bringing his hands together to clap at the number. “We were sweating and shivering at the same time as we worked!”

Yogan listened to his new friend with a dignified silence. He had never known anyone who had seen a stripper pole in person before. “Wow,” he said.

Samar appeared relieved to have told someone. He’d had to keep all this a secret, he admitted. He was newly married to a woman named Chanda, and it had been enough of a scandal that they’d met in a park and not through a relative’s introduction. The story of the actress’s apartment would have infuriated Chanda’s brothers, who had never liked Samar and, he predicted, would never try to.

It had been difficult not to talk to his wife about that day, how it had changed the way he looked at his life, Samar continued. The next morning, he had shaved his head to a greenish stubble in front of the bathroom mirror—a way of taking fewer trips to the barber. When Chanda saw him, her first reaction had been to howl for help. In their dimly lit room, she’d thought him a stranger. When she’d finally accepted that it was him, she placed her hands on his shoulders, his neck, the base of his skull, and, finally, his prickly scalp, which Samar rubbed now, sitting outside the airport. He wondered aloud if Chanda had been able to tell that there were desires in him that hadn’t been there before, if she had worried about what this could mean for her own life.

“I came home and really saw everything,” Samar said. “I saw where we lived, and it hurt me to see so clearly.”

What did he see? Cracks in the walls, rat pellets in the cupboard, a sudsy creep of water under the door, because the aunties outside were forever washing their saris and utensils. For once he was bothered by the many abuses that the warring grandfathers who lived above them hurled at each other through the night.

Chanda had unrolled her thin bedding on the floor, to sleep. Her long braid, tossed behind her when she turned, was held at the end with a knot made of her own hair. For months, Samar had heard her complain about her hips and knees, tender after her days of squatting in rich people’s flats with a wet rag, wiping their marble floors from end to end. He had always dismissed these aches as inevitabilities of their lot, but now he felt his wife’s pain under his own skin.

Samar had expected this new clarity to pass, the way drunken bouts of insight and sadness often did, but visions of the actress’s apartment continued to follow him. Nights when he got home, he could hear her blowing air-conditioner. He could see her silky two-piece pajamas, hanging from a crystal hook in the bathroom. Samar understood that Chanda and the actress were two women separated by money and luck. He had control over one of those things; he could find better paying work.

Some days later, he told Yogan, he woke up to his heart pounding with impatience, which told him that it was time to find a solution. He went to a recruiting agency down the road and signed a contract that very day. It was still early when he got home. In clouded morning light, he lay on Chanda’s mat with her and told her the news: soon he would start working for a construction company in Dubai.

Sixty or so men had flown in that day from Karachi, Kathmandu, and Mumbai. The red-haired woman appeared again a few hours later to usher them onto the bus that would take them to their camp, about an hour outside the city. But, before that could happen, some men were called by name and asked for their passports. The company needed to process their visas, the woman said, but Yogan already suspected that he’d got himself a different deal than the men obediently lining up before him. Could he, from where he sat, a flutter in his own chest, issue some kind of warning? Yogan silently watched as Samar placed his blue-black booklet into the woman’s outstretched palm.

On the bus, one or two men tried to broach the subject, curious as to whether the others had been made to give up their papers earlier, at immigration or baggage claim. No verdicts had been reached yet, but already the passports were a touchy subject. Those with elderly parents or young children put an end to the discussion: “Brother, if I keep thinking about this, I’ll fall into a depression.”

She wanted to know whether he’d arrived safely, if he could send her any pictures. He slipped his phone back into his pocket without responding. Watching the bright, silvery buildings, Yogan wanted to enjoy the solitary bolt of desire that was beginning to course through him. He imagined that this was how Samar must have felt as he walked around the actress’s flat—as if something divine and chemical were taking shape in his body, the birth of a new ambition.

Behind and in front of him, there were conversations about how clean the city was. Not a single crushed bottle of Coke or a billowing plastic bag, just miles and miles of pure asphalt. The men wondered where the poor without homes slept, where the stray dogs with bitten ears and tragic faces prowled.

“Maybe they bring out cleaners at night,” one man suggested. “They must have machines that do it.”

“I’ve heard they make the prisoners do it,” a voice from the back said.

The silver buildings grew smaller and smaller, until they became like motes of dust on the horizon. As the bus turned in to their accommodations, the men’s chatter began to slow. In their silence was the realization that the streets surrounding where they were going to live were as littered as the others had been spotless. Here, it seemed, were all the city’s tossed water bottles and flattened cartons. Rumbles coursed through the bus as the men understood this, one by one.

There were well-circulated rumors about the camps—the unlivable conditions, the filth. White men making documentaries had uploaded clips to YouTube. On his phone, months ago, Yogan had watched one of those men, retching at the smell of the camp bathrooms, fight his way past disgruntled security guards to an open courtyard where he could breathe fresh air. It was an old video, from the early twenty-tens, but it was still the one that had the most views. These days, a new generation of vloggers, armed with hair gel and smartphones, were uploading their own clips detailing their day-to-day lives inside the camps, as a way of encouraging other men to make the move. One vlogger, a man from Kabul, went live on Facebook once a month to counsel other men from the region on how to secure employment in the Gulf. Yogan and Roshni had spent hours, after their daughter was asleep, watching this man’s pixelated face as he walked the halls of his accommodations, answering questions.

Yogan suspected that everyone on the bus had watched the man from Kabul’s videos, and felt, as he had, their plans for another life coming joyously together. Though the man had been careful to temper his viewers’ hopes. Recently, he had begun signing off at the end of each of his videos with a disclaimer: “This is only one humble man’s experience, please remember. God has different plans for each of us.”

As Yogan disembarked from the bus, he recalled the man from Kabul’s warning. The sight of the accommodations heavied his chest. Here were stout buildings of cement, not shimmering glass; men already residing in some of the rooms had fixed yellowing newspapers to the windows, to block out the heat. Others had gathered to watch the slothful procession of newcomers file out of the narrow bus doors and into the courtyard, where fallen wickets lay from an abandoned game of cricket. Yogan leaned into Samar’s shoulder to try to put words to what they were both feeling: “You think we’ll ever see the inside of those nice buildings?”

Samar seemed to eye him with a twinge of anger. “I’m just here to work,” he said.

In the room, they agreed to share a bunk, Samar at the top, Yogan at the bottom. They’d known to expect it, but still, as the door kept opening and closing, and one man after another walked in with suitcases and basmati-rice sacks stuffed with clothing, with burners and steel pots, with statuettes of Krishna and leather-bound Qurans, they grew more and more disheartened, until the last man entered and looked at Yogan’s bottom bunk with entitlement, and Yogan knew to climb up and lie beside his new friend, too exhausted by then to care that their calves and elbows were touching.

In the dark, they looked at each other wordlessly, all the rapture of their stories blunted. The man from Kabul had warned about the number of men assigned to each room. “I won’t lie to you,” he had said. “You’ll be uncomfortable. You’ll have to adjust.” But Yogan had hoped—though he didn’t admit it—that this, too, was a story of bygone times. When Samar began to cry, a mewling, stifled sound, Yogan brought his friend’s head into his chest. He whispered that they’d arrived, not only to a big city but to a new country. They were abroad, and the sun would bring them a new start. He was sure of it.

“Listen, blokes, we’re on a tight schedule, everything is very tight, including my pants and my shirt, and as our time gets tighter we’ll be in tight shit.”

Scattered laughter.

It was late one night, almost a year after they’d arrived. Samar was impersonating his supervisor, a beer-bellied foreigner who, the men had decided, hailed from either Australia or New Zealand. They weren’t sure of his origins, in part owing to his confounding accent, which required him to repeat instructions five different times at five different speeds, but they had eliminated the possibility of England because of the supervisor’s coffee flask, a ceramic blue-lidded thing with the emblem of a crown on its front.

“No British person actually cares about the Queen,” one of the men declared, his legs dangling from his top bunk across the room. “To them, it’s just another loaded family living in a big house, running a family business.”

Samar said, “In one of the houses where Chanda does her cleaning, there’s a glass cabinet under lock and key. Inside there are plates of every size and color, with the Queen’s face on them. They are not for eating, her madam said. They are for dis-play.”

At night, the men usually returned to the accommodations in silence. Most of them worked construction in different sites across the city. Samar’s group, which included a couple of the other men in their shared room, was building a highly anticipated sporting stadium that was already six months behind schedule. This meant that their work was now proceeding at double speed, for there was some kind of televised event nearing, something glamorous and exclusive, that required tickets to be purchased months in advance. Under the new schedule and supervisor, the stadium was expected to open in just a year.

“You come to these places free, and then they put you in chains,” another man said, pursuing his own, separate line of thought.

The others were used to this man’s abrupt, tragic declarations. “Oh, tell Baldy to go write his poems elsewhere!” someone called.

Yogan had heard that the supervisor on Samar’s project had limited the men’s bathroom breaks to once a day. Twelve hours of work, with just one sliver of peace in which to piss. Some men had taken to climbing down to a basement floor, where there was no light, only rubble, to relieve themselves. Their previous shift manager had allowed them to use the bathroom to wash their hands before eating, but the Australian told them to use the water from their bottles to rinse off, and, when those bottles were empty, he said, they would make adequate vessels for holding urine. There was no refilling water bottles during work hours. Men who ran out had to wait until they got home. In just the last week, two men had fainted from heat stroke, and another had coughed up a smear of bloody phlegm.

The men speculated that the heat was making the Australian insane. The high temperatures must have overloaded the synapses of his brain; this was the only possible explanation for his howling and redness and reverence of the Crown.

Yogan listened to all this night after night, shaking his head when a show of disapproval was required. He had yet to encounter any such cruelty in his own working life.

Now Samar said, “You don’t come to places like this already free. You come looking for freedom.”

“Maybe the Australian’s wife left him,” the man with the dangling legs said. “Maybe one day he came home, his skin peeling everywhere, and she said, ‘Enough of this! You think I want to spend my life applying ointment to your red-red nose?’ ”

“Wife! You think a man like that ever had a woman waiting for him at home? Feeding him biryani?”

“Someone is keeping him well fed.”

Laundry was hung on lines across the room, blocking Yogan’s view of some of his friends’ faces. He was lying in his bed beside Samar, freshly bathed. In the next room, the air-conditioner was switched on, and the gentle vibration of it through the wall lulled him closer and closer to sleep.

Hours later, from the darkness of his dreams, Yogan was woken by the sound of cloth snapping against air, a quick, practiced swatting, the kind an overworked mother might deliver to the fat behind of her wailing child. “Shoo!” one of the men was saying, as if to a mosquito. “Go bother someone else.” Others in the room groaned at the noise.

It was difficult for the men to drop back into sleep when they awoke in the middle of the night like this; they became aware of the vivid odor of sweat hanging in the air, the white floodlights seeping through the broken blinds.

“Come fan me for ten minutes and I’ll give you a dirham,” a man on Yogan’s side of the room said.

His eyes now adjusted to the half-light, Yogan sat up and saw a figure cross the floor to where the voice had come from. After the room’s air-conditioning unit had broken weeks ago, the men had started collecting old newspapers to wave in front of their bedmate’s face at night. This way, at least one man in each bed could sleep decently in the heat. Yogan watched as the figure crouched to pick up a newspaper then hit his head on something metal, the railing of the bed, perhaps, on his way back up. “Ouuuch!” the man said. The clang reverberated like a gong, a sound that should have signalled the coming of sunrise or morning prayers, but only reminded Yogan that it was still night, and he’d have to find a way to return to sleep.

Yogan reached over to the other side of his bed, to alert Samar to the scene. This was the kind of incident they liked to feast on together in the daylight, drawing out the small animosities that grew among roommates. Gossip made them feel alive, childlike. Yogan’s hand found only a cool, empty patch of sheet. It took him a moment to understand that Samar was not in the bed, and that, if he wasn’t in the bed, it had to be Samar out in the middle of the floor with the newspaper, Samar getting swatted.

“What are you doing, you idiot?” he called into the dark.

“What do you bastards think this is, a fish market?” another voice said.

Yogan watched his friend drop the newspaper on the floor and return to their bunk. With a sharp breath, Samar hoisted himself up and collapsed beside Yogan, a palm on his forehead, as if he were checking himself for a fever. Countless nights over the past few weeks, Yogan had opened his eyes to the sight of Samar propped up on one elbow, holding a newspaper above Yogan’s bare chest, fanning committedly. “Go back to sleep,” Samar would urge. “Tomorrow it’s my turn,” his voice so sweetly nurturing that Yogan had wondered whether he’d forgotten to mention some secret child back in Mumbai. Now it was Yogan who propped himself up; he unfolded a newspaper from under their mattress and began to create a small wind for the two of them. “What were you doing?” he asked.

“Nothing,” Samar said. “Don’t make everything your problem.”

Yogan lightly smacked Samar’s forehead with the newspaper. “Oho, what drama!”

But Samar wouldn’t speak. Another voice in the room answered for him. “He was asking for spare change. What else does he ask us for?”

At this, Samar clicked his tongue, sending his reply to the middle of the room. “You’re a real son of a bitch, you are!”

“Why do you need their money?” Yogan asked.

Samar again clicked his tongue, that universal sound that meant, Leave it, leave me. Drop the conversation. He turned away from Yogan to sleep.

“Do you have any news?” Roshni’s voice on the phone was booming, blooming, both.

“News, how?” Yogan said.

“You know—news!”

His wife’s questions on the morning bus to work filled Yogan with energy. He bounced his leg without pause, as if he were once again balancing his older daughter upon his knee.

“Yes, yes, I have news,” Yogan said. Now he was whispering. “But we’ll have to talk later, O.K.? I’m on the bus. I can’t talk freely.”

Beyond Roshni, the cry of his infant child erupted like a shard of lightning. He jerked his phone away from his ear for a moment, then brought it back. His daughter’s voice—already hearty and strong.

“You can’t talk freely? Listen to what I have to deal with! I don’t care if all your friends are jealous. I’ve been waiting six full months for your news!”

“Roshni, please, my jaan. Six months is nothing.”

“Six months is nothing? Wait until you see your daughter and you find how little she looks like you!”

Yogan leaned his forehead against the window; he didn’t want the man sitting next to him to witness his pleasure. “So you’ve been naughty with someone else, have you?”

“Don’t start with me now,” Roshni said. “I haven’t even had my tea. Call me later, or else I’ll have to call my new men. Men, you understand? More than one!”

“You deserve nothing less.”

“You don’t know how your oldest child is eating my brains asking for news. But don’t worry, I’ll tell her that her father is a little social butterfly who is afraid of spreading his own good fortune.”

With a laugh, he said, “Maybe I won’t tell you then.”

“Don’t tell! I’ll find another husband! I have so much time to myself these days!”

“And you should spend it wisely. With me, well, you just let your parents decide.”

“Fine, I’m putting up posters to advertise my freedom then. This time, I’ll have a love marriage.”

“Nobody too handsome, O.K.? Two beautiful faces make an ugly duckling.”

Yogan hadn’t told anyone his good news yet, not even Samar. There seemed to be much, these days, that they kept from each other.

No longer did Yogan have any use for his mustard-yellow construction hat, though he walked out of the accommodations with it under his arm each morning. From where the bus dropped off the men, Yogan hailed a taxi to the metro station, then rode the train to a shopping mall at the center of Dubai—a sprawling, bluish structure, which housed the ice rink that Yogan had been contracted to build a year ago. At home in Lucknow, he had helped build football and cricket fields before moving up to glossy hotels and office buildings. Buildings paid more, but Yogan had been happier working on the sporting fields, seeing the skinny young boys swinging wooden bats, sauntering onto freshly rolled grass, adrenaline already running through them. Yogan and his brothers had had to make do with the frequently soggy pastures behind their house. When they ran to retrieve a lost ball, they were guaranteed to feel the splash of mud across their smooth calves. The splattering sound of a bare foot against wet earth was a pleasure Yogan would never forget. When he returned home, his mother would exhale decisively, ordering him to pour water over his legs before coming inside. What had then been an annoyance seemed now an ecstasy—the cold well water licking at his bony knees, sending rivulets of red dirt worming down to the ground around his toes.

Building an ice rink was different from installing a sports field, but the spirit behind it was similar, Yogan thought. He’d been part of the team that had laid the tarp and the ice mat, and opened the water supply to fill the rink. He had checked that the pink antifreeze had made its way through every single tube of the ice mat, a moving wonder that had reminded him of the disco floor he and Roshni had once danced on before their children were born, their arms daringly clasped around each other’s waists.

To make the ice, the men had used ninety thousand litres of water, which felt like more than he’d used in the entire duration of his childhood. The water Yogan had known growing up was trickling, soft, and unalarming, except for the seasonal rains that required his parents’ roof to be re-thatched. What he saw at the ice rink, in comparison, was the water of stories, of cinema. The blast came from a hole twice the size of Yogan’s head, with enough force to drown an encroaching army. As the water exploded out of the pipe, Yogan gave a shocked giggle that swept among the other men, some of whom cheered and clapped, while others quietly removed their hard hats and held them in their hands. Yogan felt as if he had seen a waterfall, the Swiss Alps, all those stills of Europe that were used as backdrops for the best romantic numbers. As he conjured these pictures, he closed his eyes to enjoy the delicate cold spray that hovered above the torrent.

The rink was completed almost three months ahead of schedule. Because the men were being let go on short notice, an opportunity of further employment was communicated through the rink supervisor. If a handful of men wanted to stay on as skating instructors, they would be trained for free.

In a locker room behind the rink, Yogan donned a pair of formal black trousers, a white dress shirt with a slight tea stain on the collar, and a shiny, satin vest with three pearlescent buttons down the middle. He sprayed himself with a strong oud cologne he’d bought on sale at the supermarket, then rolled on his thick woolen socks. The skates he’d been given were made of pristine, stiff leather; the blades were sharpened for him when he hung them up at the end of each week. Now he tottered across the rubber mat of the back room, and in a single, practiced gesture, he was off gliding across the fresh morning ice.

For a long time, like everyone in his family, Yogan had believed in fate, the old idea that the same souls were reincarnated into the same families in order to relive past mistakes, at least until one lucky fool broke the spell. When he was growing up, his mother had often said that she was living out the life of her own mother, so it was no coincidence that she’d encountered the same hardships—a lame foot, an abusive mother-in-law, a savage bout of cancer that would surely see her to the end. Because she had predicted her life so accurately, Yogan and his siblings were convinced that she was clairvoyant, and, in moments of privacy, they would fearfully ask her whether she could tell them anything about their futures. Her mood usually changed at this question, as if the idea of her sons outliving her, loving women and children of their own, meant that her life would be shortened. Bitterly, she would toss them futures so bleak and unappealing that, more than once, Yogan had to talk his youngest brother out of hanging himself.

“You’ll live your father’s life, what else?” his mother would start. “You’ll owe every neighbor a debt and spend every holy day at a brothel. What? Did you think you were going to become a king?” She laughed at the audacity suggested by her own question, then opened her arms to welcome her son, whom only she could comfort, for it was she who had opened the wound to begin with.

Yogan, too, had believed some of her predictions. How could his life turn out any different than his father’s? Those first few years with Roshni, he had kept himself at a comfortable and loveless distance, in order to protect both of them from whatever qualities he might or might not have inherited from his father. But Yogan had become living proof that his mother’s predictions were bullshit. Yogan, who now spent his daylight hours gliding across ice, teaching children and adults to spin like dancers—he had not grown up to resemble anyone he knew.

“Morning, gentlemen,” the instructor, Felix, had said at the start of each training session.

He spoke only in English, and Yogan had been surprised at how quickly he was able to catch on. “What do we say, chaps? Slow and steady is the way of the coward.” Felix had held his trainees’ hands as he guided them across the rink. He’d skate backward, observing every shudder and slip of Yogan’s inexperienced ankles. “Gliding, you’re just gliding,” Felix would coax, and Yogan, holding Felix’s hands, found the courage to move his hips forward, one and then the other. “Now back on your own,” Felix would say, trailing at a slight distance.

Arms raised in caution, Yogan had imagined that he was learning to skate just as his younger daughter would soon learn to walk. Every time he’d fall, every time another man’s bladed boot slid within an inch of Yogan’s fingertips or earlobe, he thought of his daughter’s waddling footsteps, the many tumbles she would take, and he believed that this vision of the child he had yet to hold in his arms somehow kept him lucky. He’d stand and dust the frost off his backside, and, with the muzzy picture of her in his mind, set off with more and more force, until he was able to make it from one end of the rink to the other without anybody’s support.

Now Yogan skated in an elegant, sinewy line around the rink, something his father never could have dreamed of, and he understood that he had been keeping his success to himself because there was no conceivable way to explain any of it.

“Morning, Yogs,” Felix said as Yogan swished past him.

“Good morning, sir,” Yogan said in English.

“You tell your wife yet?”

“No, sir,” Yogan grinned. “I am waiting.”

“You tell her soon, all right? Don’t let the lady get away.”

He had meant to tell his wife earlier that day: with his raise, he had managed to arrange a work visa for Roshni, who would be able to join him with their two daughters within the next few months. When they arrived, Yogan would move out of the accommodations and into an apartment on the other side of the city, in Karama. He would once again share a bed with his wife, their daughters in cots beside them.

“Yes, sir,” Yogan said. Out of respect, he had turned around so that he was facing Felix as they spoke. Now it was Yogan who skated backward, scanning the rink for anyone who needed his help.

Later that week, Yogan once again woke to the sound of a swat, but this time it was his own hand that was stinging. He sat up quickly and with little confusion; Samar wanted to know if Yogan would fan him.

Yogan found and unfolded the sodden newspaper they kept between their mattress and the bed frame. Leaning over Samar, Yogan saw that he was wide awake. He placed a palm on Samar’s forehead to indicate something he wasn’t sure how else to convey—his affection, or his willingness to listen.

“Will you tell me now what happened to you?” Yogan asked.

“Just let me sleep,” Samar said.

“Listen, I have something to tell you, too.”

“I need three lakhs,” Samar said. “Do you have that?”

Yogan laughed at the figure. It was about what Samar would make in a year. “What do you need that for?” He accommodated his own arm under the warmth of Samar’s neck in order to fan him more comfortably. Again, Samar went silent; he wore a calm expression that told Yogan he was not exaggerating. Then Yogan put down the newspaper and used his free hand to turn Samar’s face toward his own. “Are you sick? Do you need to pay for medicine?”

“It would be better if I was,” Samar said.

“You’re going mad without Chanda or what? Your moon’s been hidden.”

At the sound of her name, something between them seemed to crack. Samar shook his head and covered his eyes with his hands. His voice lowered in shame or remorse, he began to speak.

There had been an issue with the contract he’d signed, he said. He hadn’t read it. The contract was typed in English with an Arabic translation stapled to the back. Only when his most recent paycheck was withheld had Samar called the recruiting agency to complain and discovered what the conditions of his employment really were:

According to this contract, the EMPLOYEE (“SAMAR BOBAL”) accepts the terms of the EMPLOYER/SPONSOR (“AL KHATIB AND BROWN CONSTRUCTION LLC”) as put forth by the Recruiting Agency (“SILVER HAWK RECRUITING”) that the EMPLOYEE agrees to pay the Recruiting Agency a non-refundable fee of Three Lakh Rupees (Rs. 300,000) as facilitated through a standard loan by the Recruiting Agency in exchange for employment and visa services.

In the mail, they had sent him a version in Hindi that he had read so many times he had it memorized.

What the woman had made clear to Samar over the phone was that the recruiting agency had neglected to charge him for his loan over the past year. From now on, they would withhold his salary until he earned out the cost of his loan. They had no answer for how long this would take—the math was Samar’s to do.

“I’m a dead man,” Samar said.

The air of hope seeped out of Yogan. “Run away, then,” he said. “Take a flight back tomorrow. How will they find you?” He was trying to sound practical, unworried, but his voice broke.

“I don’t have my passport,” Samar said. He turned away, and Yogan could think of nothing to do but pick up his newspaper and wave it rapidly over Samar’s neck.

“Everything I made,” Samar said, “I’ve sent home. I have nothing on me. I’ve barely eaten today, man.”

Yogan started to give Samar what he could. A Lucknowi man he had befriended worked at the coffee shop near the ice rink and would give him sandwiches and airy bags of potato chips for free. At the end of the day, Yogan would carry these items home in his hard hat and stash them in their top bunk, along with whatever else he could spare: a spotted banana, a Tetra Pak of strawberry milk, a sleeve of Parle-G biscuits.

There were others like Samar in the city—trapped men, men who had signed the wrong papers, men who’d walked into cool roadside offices with the same idea as Yogan but emerged with a different fate. There were others in the accommodations, too, and everyone chipped in what they could to keep these men afloat.

With morning came the sound of men unrolling their carpets for prayer, the clang of steel tumblers of tea and coffee, and, through the blinds, the harsh orange glow of the day. Someone in the room always shared his cup of tea with Samar, who sat alone by the window, picking at his skin, trying and failing to phone Chanda, who had stopped answering his calls once she heard about his situation. Sometimes Samar would leave her soft, pleading monologues as voice mail: “How can your brothers say I’m a fool? I came here for you. Everything was for you.”

Later, as the men lined up for the buses that took them to their respective workplaces, Yogan squinted into the raw white light to follow the shape of Samar’s body as it approached the doors of his bus. What did he expect to see? A sign of endurance? Resolve? There was just the tall, skinny hook of his friend, thinner now than he’d ever been, his shoulders slumped, getting on the bus with a full water bottle in hand, the bright shine of his shaved scalp replaced by a thick mop of black hair.

Yogan remembered one of their first nights in the city, when the men in the room had jousted and jabbed at one another, laughing until their voices wavered with sleep, and then fell, one by one, to silence. Yogan and Samar were the last two awake, and talked late into the night about things Yogan could no longer recall, though he did remember the man on the lower bunk issuing a weak punch to their mattress at some point, urging them to go to sleep.

“Have you found some new boyfriends, then?” Yogan asked. “I’ve been thinking about you. You and your harem.”

“What dirty thoughts you think!” Roshni said. “Thank God your youngest daughter has another father.”

“He can also come. Tell him to pack his suitcase.”

“Why did you call me?”

“I’m just missing you!”

“Missing me? Why don’t you use your brain for something better!”

“What could be better than thinking of my beautiful wife?”

Yogan was full of happiness. Earlier that morning, he had selected the apartment they would move into, a one-room flat with enough space for all four of them and their small accumulation of objects. The bathroom had a pristine white tub that looked as if it had never been used before. Above the tub was a small window of pebbled glass that gave the ceramic sink a flickering shimmer. It was agonizing to hold all this in his mind, Yogan thought, to have to wait to share it with his wife.

He was skating along the side of the rink, his phone back in his pocket. He had called his wife to share this dart of anticipation, this pulsing in his jaw. Now he slowed his stride and watched a child with the same dark complexion as his older daughter gain confidence in her movements. The girl glided on jaggedly in a pair of purple skates, with Yogan following some distance behind. He gave her space until she began to skid, and then he happily skated over to ask if she needed help.

“Can you stay close?” the girl said in English. He continued to skate alongside her, in case she lost her footing again.

Most afternoons passed this way. Yogan skated the length of the rink, stopping whenever a child seemed to be attempting a particularly risky move, full of speed and reckless bravery. He’d wait, hoping, always hoping, that the child would pull it off and then try again.

He found it strange to see so many people who looked like him on the ice. People whose countries were rarely cold, people who had never seen a world caked in real winter. How brave they were to try to balance on two blades as thin as the tips of pencils, pushing off from the sides, hands outstretched for balance, their panicked eyes searching for a groove in the ice they could use, then flashing skyward to catch the glance of a proud mother or father watching from the stands. Look at my child, these parents would think. My child is doing the impossible. My child is dancing on ice in the middle of the desert.

He often imagined his daughters skating, their pleated skirts wrapping around them as they spun. For them, it would be as easy as walking on land, he thought. It was their inheritance after all, their father’s fate. But skating would not be a career for them. He would not allow that. It would be only a supplementary detail on applications, something that would win them admission into exclusive, wintry places. For once, he wished that all he’d believed about fate was true, for it would mean that his daughters would inherit his luck, that it would take them to far-off lands and give them impossible chances.

After his shift, Yogan changed into a T-shirt and new jeans that were faded and fashionably ripped at the knees, and took the metro to the Mall of the Emirates. A sensor pinged as Yogan stepped onto the shiny marble floor of the store. The man from Kabul sat behind a brightly lit display of gold and diamond jewelry, dressed in a crisp white shirt and sand-colored pants. The men in the accommodations had started referring to him as King Kabul, KK for short. This was because KK had recently chronicled the full story of his ascent on his YouTube channel.

He had first moved to Dubai to work construction, as they all had. Soon after, he was hired as a personal driver for one of his employers. When his employer began trusting him to pick up orders and mail confidential paperwork, he was given a laptop, a magical thing. A year later, having proved himself, King Kabul was instated as the general manager of the employer’s family jewelry store. These days, he spent each Eid with his employer’s family, eating meat and drinking sugary sherbet from the family’s expensive and fragile china. But the best part of all that had happened, KK had told the camera, was that he had been able to bring his family to the city. KK’s wife now worked as a cook for his employer’s family, who paid full tuition for his son to attend a rigorous international school.

“Look at you, brother,” Yogan said to KK now, his nervous hand flat on the cold display table. “I don’t want to invite the evil eye, but I need to tell someone. My Roshni is coming here, too.”

KK pointed at an amulet of a blue-and-white eyeball above the door of the shop. “There’s no evil eye here. Your good fortune is my good fortune. How old are your daughters? Maybe they can meet my son, Abas.”

“One is three. The other will be one soon.” Yogan inched his phone out of his pocket to show KK one of the photographs Roshni had sent. A selfie, with his youngest daughter sleeping in the crook of her elbow, swaddled in a pink blanket. “I hope we can put them in good schools,” Yogan said. “Like Abas.”

“There’s no end to what we hope,” KK said. He added that he and his wife had recently started thinking about sending Abas abroad for college. The boy was only twelve—he still had time to decide—but KK would need to begin saving, in case his employer became unable to sponsor Abas’s education. KK had heard of other children at his son’s school getting scholarships for colleges in London and America. “Imagine,” KK said.

“Inshallah,” Yogan said.

Behind the man from Kabul, a display case of gold and silver chains gave off small flashes of starlight.

“Hey, how much?” Yogan asked, pointing at one.

KK keyed open the glass case and held a delicate gold chain between his thumb and middle finger. From under the counter, he brought out a dark velvet tray, upon which he laid the chain gently, as if it were worth millions. Yogan touched the smooth gold clasp with the tip of his index finger; the metal was still warm from the powerful display light.

“When you’re ready,” KK said, “I’ll give you a discount. But not now. For now, you save all your change. There are lots of expenses coming for you.”

Yogan returned home to the accommodations that night a little dazed. He wanted to call Roshni again and tell her about KK’s hopes. He imagined that she would laugh, then fling an insult or two in his direction. “Abroad this, abroad that, it’s a mania these days,” she’d say. “If my girls are that smart, let them be smart near their mother. Why should I send them away?”

But she wouldn’t stay angry for long. After a moment, she would admit her own secret hopes. “Do you think if the girls go, we’ll ever get to visit?”

These days, no matter what Roshni was saying, the sound of her voice made Yogan part his lips in anticipation. How different this felt from his first few months in the city, when he had avoided her calls. Back then, the men had lined up with their phones and chargers at the two available outlets, some crying discreetly, others saying quick, important things like bank-account access codes and routing numbers, before cutting to the bye-bye.

Without fail, Samar had called Chanda each night before she went to sleep.

“Did you braid your hair?” he would ask her, and, if she said yes, it meant that she would be sleeping soon, and, if she said no, it meant that she could talk for another ten minutes.

The men had grown used to hearing Samar’s romantic conversations before bed. Sweetie, pinkie, and darling—all those sugary monikers that followed on the heels of “hello.” When the outpouring of such terms stopped, the men had noticed that, too.

“Where’s our Romeo these days?” they teased.

Four months had passed since Samar had learned about his debt. The men no longer mocked him; they were anxious to know if Chanda had responded to any of the hundreds of messages Samar had left her.

That night, as Yogan scrolled through his phone, another man approached Samar, who was sitting on the floor, gently peeling a banana. “Heard anything, or no? About Chanda?” the man asked.

Samar looked up and smiled a little crazily. “Don’t talk to me about that whore,” he said.

The following night, Samar returned from work and climbed straight up to his bunk without food or a shower.

Yogan came in from his own shower shortly after. “At least change into something clean,” he said. “I also have to sleep in that bed.”

Samar gave no response, only a kind of whimper that must have escaped accidentally.

“You want something to eat?”

Samar didn’t answer, but the other man in the room, hearing the question, looked at Yogan as if he were an idiot, as if he’d asked a fish if it wanted to swim.

Yogan went downstairs to the common kitchen with some cash in his pocket. He found one of the men he knew heating a bowl of lumpy yellow daal and a frozen paratha in the microwave. The man watched as Yogan counted out his asking price and placed the bills on the countertop. Only once the cash was secured in the man’s pocket did he hand over his warm plate of food.

In the room, the other men moved in silence as Yogan sat beside Samar on their bed, the plate in his hands. “Eat something,” he said. With his free hand, he traced the rope of Samar’s spine protruding from under his damp T-shirt.

“Did something happen?” Yogan asked. A question for anyone in the room.

“Nothing,” another man answered. “He’s just being dramatic.”

Then Samar sat up. His eyes were webbed with strawberry capillaries.

“How are you always home so early?” he asked Yogan. “Did you get fired, or what?”

“You should eat,” Yogan said.

Samar looked down at Yogan’s feet, on which he wore a pair of bright-red chappals. “Where did you buy those? Are they real Nikes?”

Yogan’s instinct was to jump off their bed and kick his slippers into the darkness under the bottom bunk. Just then, the plate of food, which he had rested on the bed beside Samar, went flying to the floor, the daal splattering across the linoleum.

“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Samar said. He held his own wrist, as if to discipline it. Then he eased himself onto the floor and began scooping the hot food into his cupped hands. His eyes had gone small and dark with tears, and he brought the inside of his elbow to dab at his wet nose.

A wave of misery and unease passed over the men, who regarded one another. Yogan crossed over to where Samar was crouched and placed a hand on his back. “Leave it,” he said, offering him a bath rag.

The other men began to collect the broken shards of the plate.

When Samar’s voice finally came, it was thick with phlegm. “Her brothers found someone to void our marriage. She’s marrying someone else,” he said.

“Shit.” It was all Yogan could say. He opened his arms for Samar to collapse into.

The metro ran mainly aboveground, but it was different from the trains in India because it did not rattle or jostle or violently assert itself. Rather, it slid to its stop. The doors opened with a gush of cool, sweetly scented air, and most of the seats inside shone in want of a patron. The train re-started with the rush of an airplane taking off, and within seconds it was speeding above the roads on cement beams tall enough to allow a panoramic view of the city. The number of skyscrapers had doubled since Yogan and Samar had first arrived in Dubai, almost two years earlier. Yogan had heard the other men saying that the towers were getting taller and more complex, and as he considered these rising obelisks of the future he thought of them not as a builder, evaluating materials and weight distribution, but as a father, anticipating the wonder of his daughters. Far beyond the skyscrapers, Yogan could see the still unfinished sporting stadium that Samar and others were working on. It was shaped like a disk, a silver mound.

It was National Day, a rare day off for all the men. Yogan was sitting beside Samar on the metro. It had been ages since he had seen Samar in his everyday clothes, and he noticed how the T-shirt his friend wore hung off his shoulders and neck.

When they’d first arrived in the station, Samar had seemed overcome with awe. He had never been inside a metro station in Dubai and couldn’t grasp how to read the digital maps that flashed on large screens above them. It was then that Yogan had admitted that he’d used the train before.

The day out was Yogan’s treat—an attempt to inject some life back into his friend, who hadn’t spoken to him since the news of Chanda’s engagement, other than to convey blank thanks for his rare acceptance of a nighttime meal.

Yogan also had to deliver his own news: he was moving out the following week.

At the mall, Yogan led Samar toward the sandwich shop. “Let’s have something? I’m hungry” was how he put it. Samar nodded his head thinly, as if he were doing Yogan a favor by agreeing to eat.

They ordered swarthy, buttered paninis full of ripe tomatoes and melted mozzarella. To Yogan’s surprise, Samar had an appetite. He appeared windswept by the ebullience of the mall, whipping his head left and right to examine the surrounding shop windows with their pedestals and handbags and slender, faceless mannequins.

“You’ve come here before?” Samar asked.

“This is what I wanted to tell you,” Yogan began.

He led the way to the ice rink, where the jaunty receptionist recognized him and allowed him access to the back room to get his skates. She handed Samar a pair of skates while Yogan paid for their day passes.

If Samar was confused, he did not show it. He had taken on, instead, the buoyant air of a dazzled child. “You want me to wear these?” he said, laughing. “I’m going to break my legs!”

“I’ll help you,” Yogan said. He already had his own skates knotted tight.

Yogan went down on his knees to fit Samar’s feet inside the skates, pulling at the laces to insure that his ankles were well secured. As he tied the knots, he explained that he’d been offered a job as a skater. He told Samar about the apartment in Karama.

Samar gave Yogan’s shoulder a brotherly punch, and said, laughing, “You bastard! This is your job?”

The laughter filled Yogan with relief. Holding his friend’s hand, Yogan ushered Samar onto the ice. Yogan suggested that he hold on to the side barriers, but Samar remained tethered to him, their damp fingers intertwined. The movements did not seem to come easily to Samar; he lifted his feet one at a time, as if he were marching. When they gained some speed, a wild, coy look appeared on his face.

“Try to lead with your hips,” Yogan said. “Let me show you.” He guided Samar to the barrier and pushed off alone, pointing down at his feet so Samar could understand what he meant.

“Do it again. Let me watch you,” Samar said when he returned. He was grinning. “Do you know any tricks?”

Again Yogan pushed off, swerving past the children and the teen-agers on the ice as Samar whistled at him from the side of the rink. “Look at this hero!” Samar called.

As Yogan skated, the chorus of an old Bollywood song began to ring in his pocket. Knowing that it was Roshni calling for their afternoon chat, he sent the call quickly to voice mail. Each time he heard that ringtone during this time of his life, he remembered how he and his siblings used to sit in front of the television with unbreakable focus, watching the finale of the movie in which the song featured. It was a declaration-of-love song, the hero and the heroine in their best clothes, dancing at the helm of a choreographed cast with clinking bangles and shimmying bellies. Finally, they were no longer bashful and had confessed their affection, which was too vast to convey in dialogue; it had to be set to music. Yogan remembered the great smile that Saif Ali Khan had worn as he danced. He had understood something about that smile even as a child. Where Yogan came from—a village outside Lucknow where sons were still preferred to daughters, most marriages were arranged, and a man out of work for a single week could render a family utterly damned—a dance number like that, in which the hero follows a girl in a shimmering blue lehenga, telling her that she looks like a piece of the moon, proved that somewhere in the world there was romance. It made life seem bearable.

Later, when Yogan looked back on this day with Samar, it was this song that he remembered, this song which became, over the years, a kind of engine for him. It unstuck him from himself when he needed it to, buoying him forward when he hesitated. That day at the rink he was moving inside a fantasy. In five days, his wife and his daughters would land in Dubai. In five days, he would hold his wife’s waist between his palms. He would cup the soft head of his new daughter, make a show of searching her face for traces of himself. It was Roshni that Yogan was thinking of that day with Samar, Roshni he imagined when their fingers were intertwined.

“Let me try,” Samar said when Yogan returned to him.

He made a few unsteady strides, his hands in front of him for protection, then gained confidence, his movements nascent but full of speed. Then Samar leaned back to avoid crashing into someone, and Yogan knew before it happened that he would correct himself by tilting too far forward too quickly, which would cause him to lose his footing. He watched his friend fall onto his knees; with his palms, he kept his body from hitting the ice.

Yogan skated over. Samar appeared more subdued than he had earlier, perhaps a little embarrassed. Yogan offered his hands to pull Samar up, and Samar took them awkwardly. He sent a crystalline wad of spit to the side.

“Why did you bring me here?” Samar asked. “To show off?”

“Come on, bhai,” Yogan said, urging him to the side of the rink.

“You want to watch me hurt myself so you can feel good?”

Yogan felt Samar’s hands grab his collar, and then he knew to anticipate the approach of knuckles, which flashed by his cheek like a pink ribbon, narrowly avoiding impact. Yogan glided backward to catch himself, one of his hands on his cheek, which had grown warm with shame. Then he heard a whistle that he recognized as the sound of his boss approaching. Yogan put up both his hands, as if in surrender. “There is no problem here, Felix,” he said in English. “This is my good friend. We are enjoying on our holiday.”

“I’m going to have to ask your good friend to get off the ice,” Felix said.

On the way home, Samar rested his head on Yogan’s shoulder. On the open plain of Samar’s neck, the skin appeared to have been shaved carelessly; there was a thin scabbed line across his Adam’s apple. Yogan lightly tapped his fingers against the healing skin, if only to show that he’d noticed it.

“You’re going to have to take care of yourself,” Yogan said. “When I’m gone, you’ll need to become close to someone else who can bring you food.”

“I’ll handle it,” Samar said.

“I’ll visit you. Every Sunday. Don’t forget.”

“Can you give me some money before you go? To tide me over until I find someone else?”

Yogan had prepared for this question, and also for its answer. Still, his throat swelled painfully, and he waited for the taut feeling to pass. Quietly, he managed to give his response: “I need the money for my girls. My oldest needs a school uniform. She needs textbooks.”

“I’ll manage,” Samar said.

He pointed at Yogan’s lap to ask whether he could use it to rest, and Yogan, with an open palm ready to catch his friend’s head, said, “Come.”

Some months after Yogan moved out, Samar disappeared from the accommodations one day, like a frame cut out of a movie. He didn’t get on the bus to the construction site. He wasn’t in his bunk when the other men came back.

The local news rarely picked up such a story; you had to dream of the dead, then wake up with a premonition. A text message received late at night, read over and over in the morning, would confirm what had happened. A young man had fallen—or jumped—in front of an oncoming train.

He had been only twenty-seven. His hands and feet were always colder than the rest of him, Yogan remembered, despite the incessant heat of those days. In bed, Yogan used to warm Samar’s rawboned fingers with his own, teasing him for his poor circulation.

There were no last rites; a ceremony would have been too expensive. No one went to claim the body. Samar’s clothes, his razor, his smartphone, and his charger were distributed among the men in the room. And, as for them, what could they do but line up for the morning bus, letting their thoughts wander, until someone issued an order, or asked sweetly, through the phone, what was new and had they eaten? ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/6945786c7e37d02ed9be36dc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Title_helmet.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 13:57:10.639929

The Court’s order and three-page opinion establishes important limits on presidential authority to federalize state National Guard units under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, with implications extending far beyond the Chicago case.

The decision blocks the Trump administration from ordering the state-based military force to the Chicago area, where an immigration crackdown led to thousands of arrests and confrontations between residents and federal agents. State governors who have obtained similar injunctions in California, Oregon, and Illinois now have significant Supreme Court precedent supporting their objections to federal Guard activations.

Background: Presidential Call-Up of State Guard Units

On October 4, 2025, President Trump called 300 members of the Illinois National Guard into active federal service to protect federal personnel and property in and near Chicago. The following day, he called up the Texas National Guard for similar purposes. Both activations were executed under 10 U.S.C. Section 12406(3), which empowers the President to federalize members of the Guard if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The key legal question: What does “regular forces” mean? The administration argued it referred to civilian federal agencies like ICE or the Federal Protective Service. Illinois and other states argued it meant U.S. military forces, triggering additional constitutional constraints under the Posse Comitatus Act.

The Posse Comitatus Act: Military Execution of Civilian Laws

The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, as amended, provides: “Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”

This law was passed after Reconstruction to prevent federal military intervention in civilian law enforcement. As the Brennan Center for Justice explains, when National Guard are called into federal service, “they become part of the federal armed forces, which means they are bound by the Posse Comitatus Act until they are returned to state control.”

Congress in November 2018 issued a report: “The Posse Comitatus Act and Related Matters: The Use of the Military to Execute Civilian Law.”

“Case law indicates that ‘execution of the law’ in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act occurs (a) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to an organ of civil government, or (b) when the Armed Forces perform tasks assigned to them solely for purposes of civilian government. Questions concerning the act’s application arise most often in the context of assistance to civilian police. At least in this context, the courts have held that, absent a recognized exception, the Posse Comitatus Act is violated when (1) civilian law enforcement officials make ‘direct active use’ of military investigators; or (2) the use of the military ‘pervades the activities’ of the civilian officials; or (3) the military is used so as to subject ‘citizens to the exercise of military power which was regulatory, prescriptive, or compulsory in nature.’ The act is not violated when the Armed Forces conduct activities for a military purpose.”

Supreme Court Majority Opinion

The Court’s 6-3 decision in Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al. v. Illinois, et al. was issued on the emergency docket. The majority concluded:

“We conclude that the term ‘regular forces’ in Section 12406(3) likely refers to the regular forces of the United States military. This interpretation means that to call the Guard into active federal service under Section 12406(3), the President must be ‘unable’ with the regular military ‘to execute the laws of the United States.’ Because the statute requires an assessment of the military’s ability to execute the laws, it likely applies only where the military could legally execute the laws. Such circumstances are exceptional: Under the Posse Comitatus Act, the military is prohibited from ‘executing the laws’ ‘except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress.’ So before the President can federalize the Guard under Section 12406(3), he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be ‘unable’ with those forces to perform that function.”

Practical Impact of the Ruling

The Court’s interpretation creates a two-step test for federalizing the National Guard under Section 12406(3):

First, the President must have statutory or constitutional authority to use regular military forces to execute the laws in question

Second, even with such authority, the President must be “unable” with regular military forces to perform that function

Since the Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits military execution of civilian laws except where expressly authorized, circumstances permitting Guard federalization under this provision are “exceptional.”

Dissenting Opinion: Presidential Inherent Authority

Three dissenting Justices (Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas) urged caution. They noted that because this case was decided on the emergency docket seeking a stay of an injunction, there had not been full briefing by the parties or oral argument before the Justices. Instead, the Court on October 29 had requested only letter briefs on what Congress meant by the term “regular forces.”

Justice Alito wrote: “On top of all this, the Court fails to explain why the President’s inherent constitutional authority to protect federal officers and property is not sufficient to justify the use of National Guard members in the relevant area for precisely that purpose.”

Justice Gorsuch emphasized procedural concerns: “Under these circumstances, caution seems to me key, and I would decide this application narrowly, based only on those few arguments the parties preserved and the evidentiary record as it stands.”

National Guard Activations: Understanding the Three Types

National Guard members serve under a dual-enlistment structure with three different active operational statuses:

State Active Duty: Guard members serve under state authority, typically for state emergencies like natural disasters or civil disturbances. The governor maintains command and control.

Title 32 Federal Active Duty: Guard members remain under state command but are federally funded. This status has been used for disaster relief, border security operations, airport security after September 11, and COVID-19 response efforts. Guard members in Title 32 status are not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act restrictions.

Title 10 Federal Active Duty: Guard members are federalized and come under direct federal command. In this status, they are subject to the Posse Comitatus Act and generally prohibited from domestic law enforcement activities.

The Supreme Court’s December 23 decision addresses Title 10 activations and establishes significant constraints on presidential authority to federalize state Guard units for domestic operations.

Other Guard Deployments and Legal Challenges

D.C. Circuit Ruling on Title 32 Deployment

The National Guard in the District of Columbia, along with State Guards from South Carolina, West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, Ohio, Georgia, Alabama, and South Dakota, have operated since August 2025 under Title 32 status. On December 17, 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the U.S. Government’s stay of an injunction that had blocked these deployments.

The different treatment of Title 32 versus Title 10 deployments reflects the distinct legal frameworks: Title 32 deployments keep Guard units under state command and avoid Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, while Title 10 deployments federalize the Guard and trigger constitutional constraints on military involvement in civilian law enforcement.

Prior State-Level Injunctions

Before the Supreme Court’s December 23 decision, governors in California, Oregon, and Illinois had already obtained federal court injunctions prohibiting Title 10 deployment of their state guards:

December 10, 2025 – Los Angeles: A federal judge ordered Trump’s National Guard deployment in Los Angeles to end.

November 8, 2025 – Portland, Oregon: A federal judge permanently blocked Trump from deploying National Guard to Portland.

October 16, 2025 – Chicago: An appeals court upheld a federal judge’s temporary order blocking National Guard deployment in the Chicago area. This is the injunction that the Supreme Court declined to stay on December 23.

These state-level victories now have the backing of Supreme Court precedent, significantly strengthening governors’ ability to resist unwanted federalization of their Guard units.

Implications for Emergency Management and Homeland Security

Impact on State-Federal Relations

The Supreme Court’s decision reinforces principles of federalism and state sovereignty over National Guard forces. State governors retain significant authority to resist federal takeover of their Guard units absent clear statutory authority and demonstrated inability of regular military forces to accomplish the mission.

For emergency management professionals, this decision clarifies the legal framework governing National Guard availability for state emergencies and disasters. While the Guard remains available for state active duty and Title 32 missions, federal authorities face substantial legal barriers to Title 10 federalization for domestic operations.

Future Legal Developments

The Court’s December 23 order is preliminary, decided on the emergency docket without full briefing or oral argument. Three dissenting Justices emphasized the need for more careful consideration. Several paths forward exist:

The Supreme Court may accept an appeal in another case for full briefing and oral argument (requires votes of four Justices to grant certiorari)

Congress could enact clarifying legislation defining “regular forces” and conditions for Guard federalization

The administration could pursue Guard deployments under different statutory authorities, including the Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C. Sections 331-335)

Until further clarification occurs, lower federal courts must follow this opinion. As Georgetown University Professor Marty Lederman, who filed an influential amicus brief in the case, explained in a November 13 podcast, the administration’s legal defeat represents a critical oversight in reasoning about presidential authority to deploy military forces domestically.

Conclusion: Separation of Powers and Guard Federalism

The Supreme Court’s December 23 decision represents a significant check on executive authority to federalize state National Guard units. By interpreting “regular forces” to mean regular military forces rather than civilian federal agencies, the Court established that Guard federalization under Section 12406(3) requires both statutory authority to use military forces for domestic law enforcement and demonstrated inability of regular military forces to accomplish the mission.

This decision reflects longstanding constitutional principles limiting military involvement in civilian affairs, rooted in the Posse Comitatus Act’s prohibition on using military forces to execute domestic laws. While the opinion is preliminary and three Justices dissented, it provides important protection for state sovereignty and the traditional federal-state partnership in National Guard operations.

As litigation continues and potentially returns to the Supreme Court for fuller consideration, state and federal officials must navigate a complex legal landscape. The decision underscores that National Guard forces remain primarily instruments of state authority, available for federal missions through cooperative arrangements that respect constitutional constraints on military power.

Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.
Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.
“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly.
The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.","After Missouri lawmakers passed a gerrymandered congressional map this fall, opponents submitted more than 300,000 signatures seeking to force a statewide vote on whether to overturn the map. But Republican state officials say they will use the map in the meantime.

Missouri courts now appear likely to weigh in.

“If we need to continue to litigate to enforce our constitutional rights, we will,” said Richard von Glahn, a progressive activist who leads People Not Politicians, which is leading the campaign opposing the gerrymandered map.

As some states engage in an extraordinary redraw of congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, state courts may decide the fate of the new maps. President Donald Trump has pushed Republican state lawmakers to gerrymander their states’ congressional maps, prompting Democratic state lawmakers to respond in kind.

Nationwide, state judges are poised to play a pivotal role in adjudicating legal challenges to the maps, which have been drafted to maximize partisan advantage for either Republicans or Democrats, depending on the state. Maps are typically only redrawn once a decade following the census.

While some state courts have long heard map-related lawsuits, the U.S. Supreme Court has all but taken federal courts out of the business of reviewing redrawn maps this year. On Dec. 4, a majority of the court allowed Texas’ new map, which seeks to secure five more U.S. House seats for Republicans, to proceed. A federal lawsuit against California’s new gerrymandered map, drawn to favor Democrats, hasn’t reached the high court.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s brief, unsigned majority decision voiced concern about inserting federal courts into an “active primary campaign,” though Texas’s primary election will occur in March. Critics of the court’s decision have said it effectively forecloses federal challenges to this year’s gerrymanders. The justices could also issue a decision next year that makes it more difficult to challenge maps as racially discriminatory.

State courts are taking center stage after gerrymandering opponents have spent decades encouraging them to play a more active role in policing maps that had been drawn for partisan advantage. Those efforts accelerated after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 limited the power of federal courts to block such maps.

“Basically, every one of the 50 states has something in its constitution that could be used to constrain partisan gerrymandering,” said Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.

State constitutions, which are interpreted by state supreme courts, typically have language that echoes the right to freedom of speech and association found in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, Wang said. They also include a right to equal protection under the law, similar to the 14th Amendment.

Some state constitutions guarantee free and fair elections, language that doesn’t appear in the U.S. Constitution. Thirty states have some form of a constitutional requirement for free elections, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

At least 10 state supreme courts have found that state courts can decide cases involving allegations of partisan gerrymandering, according to a 2024 review by the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School.

So far this year, California, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas and Utah have adopted new congressional maps. New maps also appear possible in Florida, Maryland and Virginia. A handful of other states — Alabama, Louisiana, New York and North Dakota — may have to change their maps depending on the outcome of court cases.

Some of those new or potential maps could face legal obstacles. Florida, New York and Ohio all have state supreme courts that have previously found problems with partisan gerrymanders. Maryland Democrats have so far not moved forward with a gerrymander, in part because of fears of an adverse decision from the state Supreme Court.

Four state supreme courts — including in Missouri — have determined that they cannot review partisan gerrymandering claims, though state courts may still consider challenges on other grounds, such as whether the districts are compact or contiguous.

In Missouri’s case, courts could also clear the way for a referendum vote over the new map, which is intended to force out U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Democrat who has represented Kansas City in Congress for the past two decades. Republicans currently hold six of the state’s eight congressional districts.

The map already faces a bevy of lawsuits, most notably over whether state officials must count some 103,000 referendum signatures gathered before the governor signed the map into law; at least 106,000 signatures are needed to send the map to voters.

Opponents of the new map have also filed lawsuits asserting the Missouri Constitution prevents redistricting without new census data and that an area of Kansas City was simultaneously placed into two separate congressional districts.

Missouri Republican Secretary of State Denny Hoskins’ decision this month (relying on an opinion from Missouri Republican Attorney General Catherine Hanaway) to implement the new congressional map, despite a submitted referendum petition, is expected to become the latest legal flashpoint. Opponents of the map argue it is now paused under state law.

Hoskins spokesperson Rachael Dunn said in a statement to Stateline that local election officials have until late July to verify referendum signatures — months after candidate filing ends March 31 and days before the Aug. 4 primary election. At that point, blocking the new map would be all but impossible, even if map opponents have gathered enough signatures to force a vote.

“Once signatures are all verified, the Secretary will certify the referendum based on constitutionality and verification,” Dunn wrote.

Hanaway’s office didn’t respond to questions.

Breaking out of lockstep

As federal courts limit their review of gerrymandering because of U.S. Supreme Court decisions, some state supreme courts are reluctant to wade into the issue because of a practice called “lockstepping.”

State supreme courts often interpret their state constitutions in line with — or in lockstep with — how the U.S. Supreme Court views similar language in the U.S. Constitution. Because the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to limit partisan gerrymandering, some state supreme courts have also declined to impose limits.

Gerrymandering opponents have used a variety of arguments over the years to try to prod state supreme courts out of lockstep. They have emphasized differences in wording between state constitutions and the federal one, and provisions in state constitutions — such as the free elections requirement — not found in the U.S. Constitution.

Sometimes these arguments work — and sometimes they don’t. The North Carolina Supreme Court in 2022 ruled against partisan gerrymandering. But after two Republicans were elected as justices that fall, the court reversed itself months later.

“Across the country, we have seen advocates turn to state supreme courts, and state courts in general, for state constitutional arguments against gerrymandering or voter suppression more broadly. And it’s been met with mixed success,” said Sharon Brett, a University of Kansas associate professor of law. In 2022 as litigation director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, she unsuccessfully argued a case before the state’s high court challenging Kansas’ congressional map.

In states where legislatures draw congressional maps, some lawmakers argue that state constitutions shouldn’t be interpreted to curb legislative authority over mapmaking. Court-imposed limits amount to violations of the traditional separation of powers, they say, with the judiciary overstepping its authority to interfere in politics.

“We expect them to be nonpartisan. We expect them to be unbiased. We expect them to be fair. We expect them to read the constitution and to protect or at least respect the separation of powers,” said Utah Republican state Rep. Casey Snider, speaking of Utah courts during a floor speech earlier this month.

In Utah, state courts waded through a yearslong legal battle over whether state lawmakers must adopt a non-gerrymandered map. After the Republican-controlled legislature repealed and replaced an independent redistricting process, the Utah Supreme Court last year ruled lawmakers had violated the state constitution.

A Utah district court judge in November then adopted a congressional map that will likely lead next year to the election of a Democrat. The state’s four congressional seats are currently all held by Republicans.

“What we would like is them to redistrict based on population — fairly,” Katharine Biele, president of the League of Women Voters of Utah, said of state lawmakers.

Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the Utah legislature into special session earlier in December to respond to the judge’s decision. Lawmakers pushed back candidate filing deadlines in hopes that an appeal to the Utah Supreme Court will result in a decision overturning the judge’s adopted map.

They also passed a resolution condemning the judiciary.

Constitutional concerns

As the Indiana legislature weighed a gerrymandered map to boost Republicans this month, some lawmakers were reluctant to constrain state courts. Democrats currently hold two of the state’s nine congressional districts.

The GOP-controlled Indiana Senate voted down the map in a major setback to Trump’s national redistricting push. The vote came after a floor debate where opponents raised concerns about limiting court involvement; the legislation included a provision sending any legal challenge directly to the Indiana Supreme Court, bypassing a jury trial.

Indiana Republican state Sen. Greg Walker said the measure violated the state constitution, which guarantees an “inviolate” right to a jury trial in all civil cases. “In legal terms, ‘inviolate’ has the implication of being sacred, as opposed to being just a piece of the law,” Walker said on the floor.

State Sen. Mike Gaskill, a Republican who sponsored the map, said during a speech that Indiana residents would benefit from a quick process to resolve legal challenges. “Both sides, in any case, want them to be settled quickly so that they don’t cause chaos and interruptions in the elections process,” he said.

If the map had passed, opponents would have likely attacked the measure using a provision of the Indiana Constitution that requires “free and equal” elections.",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=61685337&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C60%2C0%2C60,N,,2025-12-28 11:12:14.030189

Saydullo, a native of Uzbekistan, was later moved to the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Centre County, where he remains.
Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006.
My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business.
“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said.","On Dec. 10, Sayyid Akbarov was studying for his final exams when he heard something that made his stomach drop:

His father, Saydullo, was detained by federal immigration officials during a visit to Philadelphia.

Saydullo Akbarov, 42, who lives near Schuylkill Haven with his wife and four children, was at a Department of Homeland Security facility for an biannual checkup that morning, his son said.

What should have been a routine visit completed over a few hours led to him being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, according to Sayyid, 19.

Saydullo, a native of Uzbekistan, was later moved to the Moshannon Valley ICE Processing Center in Phillipsburg, Centre County, where he remains.

Saydullo owns and operates a local trucking business, Wild Stallion LLC, which has stalled in his absence, Sayyid said.

Saydullo Akbarov and his wife emigrated from Uzbekistan in 2006. They have raised all four of their children in the county — Sayyid, a former wrestling star at Blue Mountain High School, and his three younger sisters.

It has been a tough two weeks for the Akbarovs as they navigate life without their patriarch, whom they describe as a devoted citizen and community member.

“It’s a surprise when a complying person like that — he’s not on the run, he’s not a fugitive, he’s a business owner, complies with all the rules, has no criminal history, no record — is detained like that,” Sayyid said. “It’s surprising to see something like that happen.”

Sayyid said he and his family are discouraged because there is no legal recourse they can seek at this point. The Akbarovs were advised by a lawyer that they must wait around six months before they can take action and try to have Saydullo released, he said.

“From what the lawyer is saying, we have to wait a minimum of six months before we can reopen the case and get him out,” Sayyid said. “We don’t want to wait that long. … That’s the question we’re all asking right now — what can we do to get him out?

“We don’t want him to sit in there for six months. We’re doing everything we can. We’ve reached out to congressmen, we reached out to people to see if they can get him out, see if they can take some action on their end. We’ve talked to many lawyers, we’ve talked to people, family friends to see if they can have any pull. But unfortunately, we’ve come up short.”

Sayyid said that his father, over the past 19 years, has built a life as “a perfectly good resident who pays his taxes, clean record, no criminal history, has a business, has four kids, productive citizen and community leader.”

“In reality, he is the picture perfect American person,” Sayyid said. “ … He was not given the American dream — he earned it, worked for it — and with God’s grace, he was able to get it and fulfill the American dream. Isn’t that what this is all about? Isn’t that why people immigrate to the U.S., so they can have a better life?

“They want to take it all away. Twenty years being in the country, for nothing. They want him to start from scratch all over again, in a different country. Not only that, they want to drag a family apart. They want to drag him away from the community. His shoes are too big to fill.”

Sayyid, a sophomore track-and-field athlete at Lehigh University, said he felt overwhelmed when his mother called him on Dec. 10 to tell him about his father’s detainment. Stressed out after a rigorous semester at school — and simultaneously fighting through an illness — Sayyid was studying for his finals in a cafe in Philadelphia when he heard the news.

“When he was detained, I was thrown into the fire,” he said. “It was during finals week — I had my first final the day after he was detained. So I couldn’t concentrate on the finals, I didn’t do as well as I hoped to — and at the same time, the business needs, when he was (detained), I had to run the entire operation. At the same time while studying, visiting lawyers, prepping the paperwork, processing all this information. Just a lot to do during a small period of time.”

After he was taken into custody at the DHS facility, Saydullo was processed at a Philadelphia detention center. Officials then moved him to long-term custody at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center, Sayyid said.

Saydullo is active on the board of directors at the Islamic Society of Schuylkill County. Sayyid said his father has spearheaded the construction of many important amenities there, such as a parking lot and an accessible ramp that leads directly to the prayer hall.

He said his father orchestrates many other aspects of the mosque’s operations.

“He’s not just a business owner, not just a family member, but he’s also a community leader,” Sayyid said. “We rely on him here every day. … What he built and what he contributed to this mosque is really important.”

Sayyid said he and his uncle have helped out with Wild Stallion LLC, trying to “keep it somewhat open, somewhat alive,” but he said the business is unable to operate normally and stay solvent without Saydullo.

“We’re working with lawyers to see if we can get some sort of petition going for him,” Sayyid said. “There’s little to nothing we can do legally other than wait. … I can’t run the business, I’m a student athlete. My sister can’t run the business, my mom can’t run the business. People are going to lose their jobs.”

Beyond their personal relationship, Sayyid believes his father’s livelihood and his efforts for the community are too valuable to be removed all at once, after nearly two decades of positive contributions.

“Nothing positive is being gained,” Sayyid said. “Yeah, you removed a perfectly good resident, and there’s one less immigrant in the country. But is that really a positive to society? Is that what the country really wants for people? … It just doesn’t make any sense.”

Community leader

Those who know Saydullo Akbarov describe him as a hard-working, dedicated person who can be counted on to help out his community.

“People rely on him to get things done, for help, for everything,” Sayyid said. “That’s his place in the community.”

Dr. Mohammad Masood Akbar, a local ENT, said he was “really shocked” when he heard the news about Saydullo, whom he has known for several years.

“It’s going to be a big loss for our community,” said Akbar, who serves as vice president of the Islamic Society.

Among Saydullo’s many attributes, Akbar singled out his skill as a handyman, noting he can address any sort of community or mosque-related construction project.

“He is the ideal person you could have as a friend, a family member,” he said.

Alaedin Alamari, a longtime friend of Saydullo’s, said he is missed by everyone in the community.

“He’s a really good man,” Alamari said. “He’d give a hand for everybody. You miss him here. Everybody needs him here with us.”

Zachariah Hnesh, of Pottsville, said that Saydullo’s impact extends far beyond the mosque.

“He’s been instrumental in every community he’s been in,” Hsesh said. “He’s helped coach youth wrestling. He’s done all these different services for the community.

After a chilly night, the daytime hours of Sunday will be rather cloudy, but dry & uneventful. Things change quickly Sunday night after 5 PM. Very warm air will be present aloft, but sub-freezing temperatures at the surface will create an environment ripe for ice, especially in northern areas into Monday morning. We then change years with a stretch of below average temperatures.

It will be frigid overnight thanks to partly clear skies, lack of wind, and a fresh snow pack in wake of Friday evening’s snow. Lows will be in the single digits, with some subzero readings expected in the hills and mountains.

Temperatures will gradually warm Sunday. But after such a cold start, temperatures regionwide will be below freezing at the onset of precipitation Sunday evening.

What makes this winter storm unique from previous ones this season will be the abundance of warm air aloft, melting snow into rain. However, with subfreezing temperatures locked in at the surface, this rain will freeze on contact with roads, walkways, powerlines, sidewalks – you name it.

Our storm is still getting its act together over the center of the country, but it will carry with it a strong cold front that, one is passes through Monday afternoon, will increase our winds and bring in much colder air for the remainder of the forecast.

Winter Weather Advisories are up across the board for the anticipated ice, but not all advisories are created equally! Mohawk Valley-southbound, the Advisory is in effect through 4 AM, when temperatures should be above freezing. However, in the North Country, the colder air at the surface will be a bit more stubborn, so the Advisory is in effect through 10 AM. It’s areas north of Albany that have the best chance for over a quarter inch of ice accretion Sunday night into Monday.

As mentioned, area-wide, this is almost entirely ice at the onset. There won’t be any sleet or any snow with this system. Temperatures will gradually warm thanks to an increasing south wind, allowing a changeover to plain rain generally form south to north.

By 6 AM Monday, the Capital Region and points south should be above freezing, with some even close to 40 degrees by then. However, sub-freezing temperatures may persist to the north. Beyond 10 AM, temperatures will be above freezing, and the rest of the daytime hours will feature scattered rain showers. Behind the cold front as temperatures at the surface and aloft plummet Monday evening and a gusty westerly wind kicks in, lake effect snow showers and flurries are expected.

Ice amounts will be lower south of Albany generally, where temperatures should rise above freezing prior to midnight. Locally, I think we see a tenth of an inch or more of ice accretion. Remember, with ice, it only takes a glaze to create hazardous driving conditions! But up north, where as much as a half an inch of ice is possible, that is where there is a growing concern for power outages into Monday morning. Highest confidence in these higher ice amounts exists over much of the Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, and Saratoga Region, with some similar amounts possible within sheltered valleys of the Green Mountains in Vermont.

Temperatures should actually spike into the lower 40s Monday afternoon (mid to upper 30s in the areas with a higher ice accretion forecast), but will quickly drop Monday evening as another shot of arctic air filters in. On top of temperatures struggling to rise far above 20 degrees Tuesday afternoon, winds may gust as high as 50 MPH. That could also create for some power outages, but also keeps wind chill values in the single digits (below zero in the high spots). And, since these winds are off of the Great Lakes (specifically Lake Ontario), accumulating snow is expected, with plowable snowfall totals through Wednesday expected in parts of the Mohawk Valley and Adirondacks.

The breeze eases up Wednesday, but it will remain out of the west-northwest, thus continuing lake effect snow showers and flurries. Another wave of low pressure will slide near the region late Thursday, possibly producing a quick shot of light snow. Into next weekend, it will be colder than average, but dry conditions are favored both Friday and Saturday at this time.

Cannot say the same for next Sunday as some guidance suggests another winter storm is possible – one that would have all precip types associated with it. Where exactly those zones of snow/sleet/freezing rain/rain set up, of course, are unknown at this time, but it’s a signal our team will be watching through this upcoming week. Clouds hang around next Monday. More sun is possible by Tuesday, but that may be accompanied by colder temperatures.",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2022/09/STORM-TRACKER_WEATHER-alert-snow-parking-dig-plow-3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:58.795498

Scenes this summer of a synchronized fleet of Ukrainian drones descending on a field of Russian warplanes punctuate just how far we’ve pivoted from classic artillery and infantry-based operations. It’s not only the methods that are changing, but increasingly the targets. What will come next will be clandestine, remote hacking attacks supercharged by AI and targeted (or errant) munitions that sever broadband lines and incinerate internet infrastructure. And with data center development and the internet’s reach continuing to quickly accelerate worldwide, this shift should worry us all — because the primary victims of new age digital warfare will be vast civilian populations, and the toll will be catastrophic.

One need only look at Gaza to understand just how damaging these disruptions can be. According to a report from Access Now, Gaza experienced at least 27 complete or partial internet and telecommunications outages since Israel’s assault on the territory began in October 2023. The most recent shutdown, this past September, preceded an Israeli ground invasion with tanks and infantry.

Whether due to intentional sabotage or negligence, these actions have greatly hindered emergency responses and the coordination and delivery of services and resources, including food and water for besieged Gazans.

Concerns about attacks via or against the internet aren’t isolated to active conflict zones. Seventy-five percent of Americans are concerned about the safety of the country’s internet infrastructure, and it’s not hard to understand why. In the roughly two decades that the internet has been more or less ubiquitous in the U.S., the technology has evolved from being a novelty to being critical in how we perform our work, socialize, manage our finances and stay informed.

For most of us, the idea of an internet outage is mildly panic-inducing, plunging us into an experience that feels akin to temporarily losing one of our senses. But compare that with people in countries confronted by this new era of cyber- and internet infrastructure attacks, where internet disruptions are a recurrent reality. Civilian life, if not the target, is frequently among the collateral damage.

Somewhere around 5.5 billion people, roughly 68% of the world’s population, now use the internet. That’s more than double the number from just a decade ago, with the internet essential to how contemporary society and its institutions function. It’s used by hospitals and nonprofits to deliver healthcare and social services. It’s used by the government to make commercial travel and traffic safer. It helps coordinate the byzantine supply chains that fuel our economies. It even helps monitor and upkeep our communities’ water and energy infrastructure.

Because of how central the internet is to even these most basic functions, efforts to deliberately disrupt or terminate internet access reflect clear violations of human rights. And in a growing number of cases around the world, the violations are a clear matter of life and death. Yet there has been little international response to the increasing use of attacks on internet infrastructure in regions that are embroiled in explicit and covert war.

At multiple points over the last decade, undersea cables have been deliberately severed or otherwise sabotaged by antagonist actors. Last year, two undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, one linking Germany and Finland, were ruptured, presumably by Russian saboteurs. And this past March, the Peace Submarine Cable, connecting Africa, Asia and Europe, was cut, causing widespread internet outages in East Africa. No cause has been officially determined.

Last year, many Americans got a direct taste of just how much an internet blackout could affect our daily lives. A global internet outage in July 2024 caused by lapses from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, affected 26% of U.S. adults. The unintentional outage crippled financial services, delayed flights and led to disruptions of operations at hospitals and businesses across the world. So what happens when bad actors, including our own governments, intentionally, with even more precision and resources at their disposal, target our internet and threaten our ability to stay connected?

In October 2024, the Taliban instituted a broad internet shutdown in Afghanistan under the dubious pretext of addressing internet “misuse,” restoring it shortly after widespread condemnation. But this is far from the first instance of the internet being weaponized by internal forces. Following the example of Iran, Sudan, Bahrain, Egypt and Syria have cut off or suppressed internet access to stymie protesters, with varying degrees of success.

In a particularly troubling development that may signal broader trends, Russia has recently been testing a way to cut its territories off from the global internet as a way of building its own “sovereign” network — one that could allow the Kremlin to more directly surveil civilians and quash political dissent.

In 2016, the Human Rights Council of the United Nations formally declared access to the internet a human right. But like most of its pronouncements, enforceability and accountability aren’t guaranteed or widely expected. A handful of countries, each with deeply autocratic leanings — Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and India — have opposed UN amendments aimed at codifying the internet as a human right.

To earnestly make internet access a human right, it’s important that we define precisely what constitutes access, having a clear focus on an internet that is reliable and sufficiently fast. For example, although 5G was widely available in Israel in 2020, the Israeli government has long denied Palestinians access to 4G service, relenting to upgrades in 2021 that still have not fully come to fruition as they should have.

We also must recognize that human rights are often linked, with one essential to others. For example, internet access is increasingly connected to the quality of one’s education, a more globally recognized and embraced human right. According to one international survey, roughly 39% of internet users use it for education or study-related purposes. Internet access is also intimately connected to the ability to engage in free speech and to work, two other vital human rights.

While these kinds of infringements may seem unlikely to come to American shores, various forms of internet throttling and indirect censorship already broadly occur in the country. Owing to ongoing Republican politicking, the U.S. is behind on ensuring net neutrality, a principle that says all internet traffic should be treated equally and not subjected to the biases and financial spoils of tiered access. According to a CNET poll, last year, 42% of U.S. adults said they experienced unreliable internet speeds or connectivity, and 63% saw their home internet prices increase.

With digital connectivity increasingly determining access to basic needs, the case for earnestly treating internet access as a human right has never been clearer. Like warfare, our understanding of human rights has to evolve with the times. This means understanding that in future warfare, victory won’t be measured just in terms of adversaries eliminated, but also by the depth of destruction of the internet infrastructure that sustains our societies.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40b6a37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3500x1838+0+97/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F05%2Fb4b2709e442986dee23ea256f460%2Ftaiwan-undersea-cable-80958.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 10:57:42.695117

What America Might Look Like With Zero Immigration

The Trump administration’s efforts to reduce the foreign-born population are being felt in hospitals and soccer leagues and on Main Streets across the country, with hints of what’s to come.

Dec. 28, 2025, 5:01 a.m. ET

Across the United States, someone is missing.

One year into President Trump’s immigration crackdown, construction firms in Louisiana are scrambling to find carpenters. Hospitals in West Virginia have lost out on doctors and nurses who were planning to come from overseas. A neighborhood soccer league in Memphis cannot field enough teams because immigrant children have stopped showing up.

America is closing its doors to the world, sealing the border, squeezing the legal avenues to entry and sending new arrivals and longtime residents to the exits.

Visa fees have been jacked up, refugee admissions are almost zero and international student admissions have dropped. The rollback of temporary legal statuses granted under the Biden administration has rendered hundreds of thousands more people newly vulnerable to removal at any time. The administration says it has already expelled more than 600,000 people.

Shrinking the foreign-born population won’t happen overnight. Oxford Economics estimates that net immigration is running at about 450,000 people a year under current policies. That is well below the two million to three million a year who came in under the Biden administration. The share of the country’s population that is foreign born hit 14.8 percent in 2024, a high not seen since 1890.

But White House officials have made clear they are aiming for something closer to the immigration shutdown of the 1920s, when Congress, at the crest of a decades-long surge in nativism, barred entry of people from half of the world and brought net immigration down to zero. The share of the foreign-born population bottomed out at 4.7 percent in 1970. Stephen Miller, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, has extolled those decades of low immigration as the last time the United States was “an undisputed global superpower.”

Whether or not restrictions will restore some of what Mr. Miller views as a midcentury idyll, there’s little doubt that major changes are in store. Immigration has woven itself so tightly through the country’s fabric — in classrooms and hospital wards, city parks and concert halls, corporate boardrooms and factory floors — that walling off the country now will profoundly alter daily life for millions of Americans.

Grocery stores and churches are quieter in immigrant neighborhoods. Fewer students show up in Los Angeles and New York City. In South Florida, Billo’s Caracas Boys, a Venezuelan orchestra, puts on an annual holiday concert where generations of families come to dance salsas and paso dobles. This year, the orchestra announced at the last minute that it was canceling the show because so many people are nervous about leaving home.

The changes will also be felt hundreds of miles from any ocean or national border, even in the snow-washed streets of Marshalltown, Iowa, a city of 28,000 about an hour’s drive northeast of Des Moines.

First Mexicans, some undocumented, came to Marshalltown in the 1990s to work at the pork processing plant. After a high-profile immigration raid there in 2006, refugees with more solid legal status arrived from Myanmar, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Now, Mexican, Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants dot the blocks around the grand, 19th-century courthouse. The population is 19 percent foreign born, and some 50 dialects are spoken in the public schools. The pews at the Spanish-language Mass at the local Catholic church overflow on Sundays, and, in 2021, a Burmese religious society built a towering statue of Buddha on the outskirts of town.

“You have more energy in the community,” said Michael Ladehoff, Marshalltown’s mayor-elect. “If you stay stagnant, and you don’t have new people coming to your community, you start aging out.”

But with President Trump’s crackdown on immigration gaining strength, local festivals are more thinly attended. Parents pull their children out of school when they hear about people being detained. The supervisor overseeing the construction of a high school sports stadium received a deportation letter, creating a conspicuous absence as the work finished up. The pork plant has let workers go as their work permits have expired.

The insecurity of each immigrant ripples into the wider community. Sergii Fedko and his wife, Tetiana, came to Marshalltown in 2023 along with five other Ukrainian families under an immigration parole program for their war-torn country.

Mr. Fedko, a power plant engineer in Ukraine, was quickly hired at a local architecture firm as a designer and draftsman. Ms. Fedko works at a day care center, where she is beloved by her charges. Their three sons are enrolled in school; the eldest excel at soccer and swimming. They bought two cars and a fixer-upper house.

New immigration policies have loosened their toehold in America. They applied for an extension well before their two-year parole ended, but the White House paused processing and changed the rules. As the weeks ticked by and they didn’t hear back, they got nervous, and decided to apply for asylum as well. In mid-December, Mr. Fedko got notice that his application for the extension had been approved, but it would require a new $1,000 fee. His wife’s application is still in limbo.

If she loses her work permit, it will add to the acute shortage of child care workers that is making it harder for American parents to go to work. Mr. Fedko’s manager, Heidi Hogan, has been doing everything she can to help. Her reasons aren’t entirely selfless; there aren’t many skilled draftsmen in the area.

“If he can’t stay with us,” Ms. Hogan said, “I’m going to have a hard time finding someone else.”

An Echo of the Past

It’s not clear yet what these changes will mean for America. But a past era of immigration crackdowns contains some lessons.

Over the country’s first century, immigration was essentially unrestricted at the federal level. This began to change in the late 1800s, with the “great wave” of immigrants fleeing political oppression or seeking work. Starting in the 1870s and over the decades that followed, Congress barred criminals, anarchists, the indigent and all Chinese laborers.

By the turn of the 20th century, anti-immigrant sentiment was rampant. The lawyer and eugenicist Madison Grant wrote in his 1916 book, “The Passing of the Great Race,” that foreign countries were taking advantage of America’s openness by unloading “the sweepings of their jails and asylums” and that the “whole tone of American life, social, moral and political has been lowered and vulgarized by them.”

Grant was consulted as an expert when Congress began crafting the Immigration Act of 1924, which, along with companion legislation, barred nearly all immigration from Asia, created the U.S. Border Patrol and established quotas from eastern and southern European countries. Net immigration — which accounts for people leaving as well as those coming in — plummeted.

Today’s language echoes that time. President Trump characterizes people from Somalia, Haiti and Afghanistan as coming from “hellholes” and accuses other countries of “emptying out their prisons and their mental institutions into the United States of America.”

The broader debate in the 1920s would be familiar to contemporary ears, too: fears about crime; anxiety about the falling fertility rates of the native born; suspicion about the politics of newcomers; hopes that restrictions would mean higher wages for U.S.-born workers; disputes about assimilation.

Today, some proponents of halting immigration — including Vice President JD Vance — argue that it would help the country absorb those who were already here, decrease competition for scarce goods like housing and strengthen job opportunities for young men who had dropped out of the work force. Reihan Salam, president of the conservative Manhattan Institute, wrote in his 2018 book, “Melting Pot or Civil War?,” that a large and constantly growing population of low-skilled immigrants, many living in working-class ethnic enclaves, risks creating a “permanent underclass.”

Evidence is mixed on the effect of the 1920s restrictions on assimilation. Some researchers have found that, without newcomers arriving from their home countries, immigrants were more likely to marry American-born citizens and less likely to live in ethnically homogenous neighborhoods. Other studies suggest that policies aimed at forcing assimilation backfired, strengthening the determination to maintain ethnic identities.

Regardless, the effects of that period continue to reverberate. Melissa Marinaro, who directs the Italian American Program at the Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh, said that when people who fled Italy in the years around World War II could not join family members in the United States, they went to Australia or Canada instead.

“One hundred years later, we still have Italian American families who are split from their extended families,” she said.

The restrictions passed in the 1920s governed U.S. immigration until international competition in the Cold War, the civil rights movement and a shift in organized labor’s stance led to the end of national origins quotas in 1965.

Immigrants Make Up as Much of America as Ever

Before President Trump took office, the share of the population that was born outside the U.S. matched a historic high from 1890.

% foreign born

Although the effects of the 1924 immigration restrictions are difficult to untangle from other developments — wars, technological advancements, the baby boom — wages rose for U.S.-born workers in places affected by the immigrant restrictions. But only briefly. Employers avoided paying more by hiring workers from Mexico and Canada, countries not subject to immigration caps; American-born workers from small towns migrated to urban areas and alleviated shortages. Farms turned to automation to replace the missing labor. The coal mining industry, which was powered by immigrants now barred from entry, shrank.

And today? Construction wages have been rising, even as home building has been sluggish — a potential indication that deportations in the immigrant-heavy industry are bidding up salaries. The union representing workers in the pork processing industry sees an upside, too, even though it opposes deportations and won wage increases after President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s immigration surge.

“I will certainly bring it up at the bargaining table that the way to solve a labor shortage is to pay more money,” said Mark Lauritsen, head of the meatpacking division at the United Food and Commercial Workers Union International.

The same is true in landscaping. Immigrant crews, working outside, were an easy deportation target over the summer. Come spring, said Kim Hartmann, an executive at a Chicago-area landscaping firm, the labor force could be 10 to 20 percent smaller.

“It’s going to be much more competitive to find that individual who’s been a foreman or a supervisor and has years of experience,” Ms. Hartmann said. “We know that drives costs up.”

But there are limits to how much customers will pay for decorative shrubs, and they may opt to go without. One 2022 study examined the expulsion of tens of thousands of Mexicans from the United States in the early 1930s. Contrary to the policy’s intent, unemployment rose and wages were depressed for native-born workers, possibly because sectors that depended on immigrant labor — agriculture, construction and manufacturing — suffered so much that they contracted.

The lesson of the last period of intense restriction is that employers have an array of ways to adjust, said Leah Boustan, an economics professor at Yale who studies the history of immigration.

“The menu is other sources of labor, and machinery,” she said. “It’s not obvious that you’re going to pick the guy down the street relative to these alternatives.”

Where Hands Still Matter

Today, that menu has expanded. Companies can outsource jobs to other countries. Artificial intelligence is replacing some types of work, and other countries, like Japan, have shown the possibilities of robotics. But many services still require humans, in person.

“If you’re an obstetrician, delivering a baby right in the moment, you need hands to lay on the patient,” said David Goldberg, a vice president of Vandalia Health, a network of hospitals and medical offices in West Virginia. “It’s not the same as a banker, or someone creating code.”

Nearly a fifth of nursing positions are currently vacant in West Virginia — a state that is older, sicker and poorer than most — and the state faces a serious shortage of physicians in the coming years. The answer has been to look abroad. A third of West Virginia’s physicians graduated from medical schools overseas. Now that option is narrowing.

“We lost two cardiologists because of their concern that they wouldn’t get their visa and, if they did, that they would not be able to stay here permanently,” Mr. Goldberg said. “They went elsewhere.”

Similarly, nobody has figured out how to harvest delicate crops with machines. During the low-immigration 1970s, some crops, like green onions, disappeared from shelves or were imported instead.

“It’s not going to hop from the ground into a package without somebody’s hands being involved somewhere along the way,” said Luke Brubaker, who runs a dairy farm with his sons and a grandson in Pennsylvania. To milk cows, feed them and deliver calves, he relies on more than a dozen foreign-born workers, most of them Mexican. He is not optimistic that he will be able to replace them.

“You can put an ad in the paper,” he said. “Maybe you would have one American-born applying for that job if you need 10 people. And that’s a maybe.”

For now, Mr. Brubaker can still find staff. The surge of immigrants who entered the United States under President Biden — more than eight million people — means that many foreign-born workers are still available.

That surge helped create an anti-immigrant backlash, inflaming fears about crime and jobs. It also stung immigrants who felt they had faced higher barriers than newer ones from places like Venezuela.

“The Mexican population felt that it was not fair,” said Alfonso Medina, who owns La Carreta, a Tex-Mex restaurant in Marshalltown started by his father, a Mexican immigrant, in 2000. “Imagine you’re here for 20, 30 years contributing. And all of a sudden here comes this administration and starts letting people in right away with a permit. They felt betrayed.”

In 2024, they shifted toward Mr. Trump.

Land of Opportunity?

Dan Simpson, the chief executive of Taziki’s, a fast casual Mediterranean restaurant chain based in the Southeast, has been losing employees since the beginning of the year. These were not only dishwashers and cooks but also managers and assistant managers, who had come to the United States with advanced degrees.

While he worries about the effect on his own business, he believes that the damage could be much greater.

“If you zoom back, the bigger problem is that we’re tarnishing the brand of America,” Mr. Simpson said. Even if the United States opens up again, he said, “we’re going to need a campaign to fix the idea that America is not the land of opportunity.”

International students pay full-freight tuition that helps fund new programs and basic costs at many U.S. colleges. As international enrollment has dropped, many schools are facing budget holes.

Nearly half of the immigrants who legally came to the United States from 2018 to 2022 were college educated, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Immigrants are far more likely than U.S. citizens to start businesses; nearly half of this year’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants.

Several studies have found a decline in the number of patents issued for U.S. inventions after the immigration laws of the 1920s.

“You have an economy that is smaller, less dynamic and less diversified,” said Exequiel Hernandez, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

In early 2025, Rayan Sadri was raising money for his artificial-intelligence start-up. In June, the Trump administration barred everyone from a list of Muslim countries, including Iran, where Mr. Sadri is from. Based in Montreal and unable to travel in the United States, Mr. Sadri could no longer easily meet potential investors and customers. Moving the company to San Francisco, as he would have liked, was not going to happen. Among other factors, the ban slowed the young company’s momentum.

“Everything for start-ups is momentum,” said Mr. Sadri, who is now going to work for another tech company in Canada.

It’s not just Silicon Valley. Small enterprises across the country have been built by and for immigrants — and been embraced by a wider community. In Marshalltown, Luisa Ortega has been putting on Mexican-style rodeos and popular music acts since 2012. In recent years, white residents have started coming, too. “They like the all-day show, they want to be able to go and dance,” she said.

‘What Is the Future?’

Over the longer term, low immigration will collide with one inexorable trend: an aging population in need of care just as fewer workers are available to provide it.

Half of the people who work at Sinai Residences, a senior living facility in Boca Raton, Fla., are immigrants. Rachel Blumberg, the chief executive, has already had to notify 38 workers from Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela that they will have to go because the Trump administration ended their country’s temporary legal status. That is 9 percent of her work force.

“It was like this funeral that would never end,” she said, of those conversations. “They’re my best employees.”

Rural areas and postindustrial cities have long struggled with an exodus of the young and the growing needs of the older residents who are left behind. Many of these places have pinned their futures on immigrants.

Lancaster County, Pa., most famous for a community that has refused to assimilate — the Amish — has over the years also become home to a global marketplace. People from Myanmar now fill the pews of a Mennonite church founded in the 1700s. Scores of Congolese refugees work at local distribution centers. The county seat, Lancaster, has two Nepalese restaurants. Resettling refugees, long a mission of local Mennonites, has become central to Lancaster’s growth strategy.

Unlike most Pennsylvania counties, “Lancaster’s numbers are growing,” said Heather Valudes, the president of the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. “But that is simply because of immigrants.”

Ahmed Ahmed, 31, arrived in Lancaster when he was 3. His parents, refugees from Chad, worked as certified nursing assistants, taking care of Lancaster’s elderly; Mr. Ahmed became the manager of a local hotel and a city councilman.

He now supervises some of the immigrants who came after him, including several Cuban refugees who worked at the hotel. This summer, they learned that their temporary work permits had expired. The Haitian workers at the poultry plant learned this, too. As did the Ukrainian employees at the Walmart.

They are now stuck in limbo. The economy is closed to them, but they are unable to return home — the United States does not even allow commercial flights into Haiti. Shut out of the formal work force, some will probably move to larger cities and look for under-the-table jobs, delivering food or cleaning homes.

Mr. Ahmed was not sure what became of the Cubans he worked with. He is concerned about them, and also worried about what may lie in store for his adopted hometown.

“This is only Year 1,” he said. “What is the future?”

President Donald Trump had talked about reaching 3,000 deportations a day, but local enforcement actions here have been smaller. They have also been shrouded in secrecy, and the opacity has been one of the defining features of 2025.

Additionally, a clearer picture of the activities of Tren de Aragua emerged. This month, federal officials announced the indictment of two suspected TdA leaders in Denver on racketeering charges tied to robbery, extortion, kidnapping, money laundering and drug offenses over 14 months.

At the political front, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston appeared, alongside the mayors of Boston, Chicago and New York Mayor, in Congress to answer questions about his city’s “sanctuary” policies and response to the illegal immigration crisis, which spilled over from the southern U.S. border into America’s interior cities. The bill for Johnston’s legal defense for that March 5 hearing before the U.S. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee crossed the $1 million mark this month.

Within weeks of Trump assuming office, Immigration Customs and Enforcement had partnered with the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to knock down doors and round up immigrants unlawfully residing in the U.S.

These agencies widely touted their operations on social media.

Residents at one of these raids at Cedar Run Apartments in southeast Denver near Cherry Creek, disputed that federal agents had warrants targeting “wanted drug traffickers.”

The Denver Gazette sought copies of the warrants through the Freedom of Information Act. In response, ICE provided administrative warrants that in some cases were post-dated April 3 — nearly two months after the raid. An administrative warrant is an internal document that does not carry the same force of law as one signed by a judge. It authorizes agents to make an arrest, but not forced entry.

The DEA and FBI issued what’s called “Glomar” denials, rather than release the warrants tied to local operations, a position under appeal in cases involving the DEA and FBI.

Groups like the ACLU of Colorado have challenged some of the tactics in court, arguing agents have conducted warrantless apprehensions that violate constitutional protections. A federal judge has sided with the ACLU, granting a preliminary injunction.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said ICE officials are not making “indiscriminate” stops.

“This activist ruling is a brazen effort to hamstring the Trump administration from fulfilling the President’s mandate to deport the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” McLaughlin has said.

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement engages in ‘racial profiling’ are disgusting, reckless, and categorically false,” McLaughlin has said, adding the ruling will “hamstring” the Trump administration.

Meanwhile, Colorado’s largest school district mounted an unsuccessful legal challenge after the administration attempted to roll back long-standing protections that limited immigration enforcement in “sensitive” locations, such as campuses.

As part of the lawsuit, Denver Public Schools Superintendent Alex Marrero claimed the ICE raids in February negatively affected attendance. Attendance data across district-run schools reviewed by The Denver Gazette suggested a more nuanced picture.

The administration’s immigration operations sparked a wave of “No Kings” demonstrations and mass immigration protests at the state Capitol that drew thousands of residents.

Meanwhile, the TdA gang remained at the forefront of news, with authorities indicting two men they alleged to have sanctioned the armed robberies of two jewelry stores in Denver. In the Joyeria El Ruby robbery, authorities said, gang members stole nearly $4 million in jewelry and gold and brutally beat several employees with a firearm.

The pair also directed the kidnapping of a young man at gunpoint in October last year in an attempt to extract $30,000 ransom that the family did not pay, according to authorities. TdA gang members cut off one of his fingers, the authorities said. One of the leaders is one of the FBI’s top 10 most wanted, with a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture or conviction.",https://www.denvergazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25036611528177-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 18:56:55.012616

But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to.
The evidentiary hearing is slated for Jan. 28, 2026.","The federal judge overseeing the human smuggling case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia has canceled an upcoming January trial.

In lieu of that proceeding, the court will hold a one-day evidentiary hearing dedicated to ferreting out whether or not the Maryland man was vindictively and selectively prosecuted by the government.

This week, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw, a Barack Obama appointee, slammed the brakes on the controversial prosecution in a relatively terse four-page order – a decided victory for the father of three and an equally stinging loss for the Trump administration.

In the ruling, the judge said the evidence provided by the defense had turned the case in Abrego Garcia's favor long ago – at least on the due process issue of whether the prosecution is vindictive.

""The burden-shifting framework controls the Court's analysis,"" Crenshaw writes. ""Specifically, once a defendant establishes a prima facie showing of vindictiveness, 'a presumption arises in defendant's favor.' The Court has already found that Abrego has made such a showing, entitling him to discovery and an evidentiary hearing on why the government is prosecuting him.""

In August, Abrego Garcia filed a motion to dismiss his federal indictment on the basis of a selective and vindictive prosecution.

In October, the court found there was a ""realistic likelihood of vindictiveness"" behind the federal charges against Abrego Garcia.

The immigration lodestar's high-profile litigation is a well-known subplot of the story of the second Trump administration. Abrego Garcia was part of a summary deportation flight to a prison notorious for torture in El Salvador, but his deportation violated multiple court orders — both specific to him and general to the flight in question.

A DOJ lawyer was sacked after admitting the Trump administration's mistakes and, through a seesawing battle that has gone up the legal ladder all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and back down to various different district courts, Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States, promptly charged with unrelated crimes, and eventually released on bail before being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) yet again in late September.

Now, the outcome of the case is contingent on whether the government can rebut the presumption in the defense's favor by producing ""objective, on-the-record explanations"" for the human smuggling charges, according to the court.

The judge notes the upshot, at length:

Whether the government can produce such evidence is critical, for ""[i]f the government fails to present evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption, the presumption stands and the court must find that the prosecutor acted vindictively,"" leading to ""dismissal of the charges or other appropriate remedies."" However, ""[i]f the government produces evidence to rebut the presumption, the defendant must prove that the offered justification is pretextual and that actual vindictiveness has occurred.""

Crenshaw says the next step will be the evidentiary hearing – which will ""only"" turn on whether or not the government is able to rebut the presumption currently working in Abrego Garcia's favor.

""If the government can rebut that showing, the Court will revisit the government's Motion to Quash, as the burden will again shift back to Abrego to establish that the government's rationale for prosecuting him is pretextual and that his prosecution is actually vindictive,"" the order reads.

Notably, the upcoming hearing is particularly high stakes for the Trump administration – and could upend their entire case.

""If the government fails to carry its burden at the evidentiary hearing, however, the Court need not resolve the government's Motion [to quash] on the merits, as the [defense motion to dismiss] would be granted without need for any further discovery,"" the order goes on.

Still, the court explains, the current procedural ""landscape"" of the case is something of a double-edged sword for the defense.

Again, the ruling, at length:

Because Abrego has already affirmatively satisfied the threshold question of whether he is entitled to a presumption that his prosecution is vindictive, his subpoenas of [DOJ officials] serve to support the third step of the vindictive prosecution inquiry, i.e., whether he can establish pretext and actual vindictiveness. But, as Abrego emphasizes, to get there requires the government to successfully rebut the vindictiveness presumption Abrego is entitled to. According to Abrego, the Government has already shown that it cannot do so, given what Abrego asserts to be troves of evidence in the record indicating that his prosecution is actually vindictive. Based on this record, Abrego argues that the Court could rule on his Motion [to dismiss] without an evidentiary hearing or the testimony of [DOJ officials].

In other words, the current state of motions practice has diminished the need for discovery requested by the defense. But if the government can solicit testimony that works in its favor, the court strongly hints such discovery might very well come into play.

The evidentiary hearing is slated for Jan. 28, 2026.",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Trump-and-Kilmar-Abrego-Garcia-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 09:56:28.062581

In the video, which was posted to TikTok on Friday, Abrego Garcia can be seen lip-syncing to “Himno de Victoria” by Danny Berrios. In a second video posted to the platform, Abrego Garcia records the sky and trees before turning the camera toward himself and singing along to Jesús Adrián Romero’s “Sumérgeme.”

Employees of the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are under a gag order preventing them from making comments that could prejudice the public or interfere with Abrego Garcia’s right to a fair trial.

Earlier this month, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers accused Border Patrol officer Greg Bovino of repeated violations of the gag order, citing comments made on national television in which he referred to Abrego Garcia as an “alien smuggler” and “wife beater,” then asked the court to impose sanctions.

Under the auspices of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security, including Noem herself, have worked overtime to smear Abrego Garcia, repeatedly describing him as a “monster,” human trafficker, domestic abuser, child predator, and MS-13 gang member.

Abrego Garcia, who has lived in Maryland for years with his American wife and child, has not been convicted of any crimes, and denies any involvement in MS-13.

After a judge ordered that the 30-year-old be returned to the U.S., the Trump administration immediately began working to deport him again, considering locations like Uganda and Liberia, countries to which he has no ties, and indicting him on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

Debate, enforcement activity and protesting over the issue intensified in the course of the year. Reps from both sides suggest more of the same may be in store in 2026.

Immigration agents traversed Utah to round up immigrants they say are in the country illegally, while several Utah law enforcement agencies entered into formal accords with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to assist. Earlier this year, Utah lawmakers approved a number of bills meant, most notably, to toughen the penalties immigrants face when they break the law. The Utah National Guard agreed to help out in a supporting role, though not in arresting immigrants.

The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Salt Lake City is the potential site of a federal processing facility for immigrant detainees, echoing a CNN report last October.

The efforts are about ""enforcing the law and doing it in a way that protects citizens here in the state, trying to get the worst offenders off the streets,"" Gov. Spencer Cox said last July. He had signaled strong support for Trump's efforts ahead of Trump's inauguration to his second presidential term last January.

Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs sounded a similar message last August in announcing plans for the city's police force to increase cooperative efforts with immigration authorities in tracking and detaining immigrants in the country illegally. ""By putting federal resources to work here in Riverton, we can better protect our residents, uphold the rule of law and keep our neighborhoods safe from criminal activity,"" he said in a statement with Riverton Police Chief Shane Taylor.

At the same time, though, the uptick in action has sparked backlash from immigrant advocates, particularly in light of enforcement action targeting immigrants without serious criminal records and others going through the process to normalize their migratory status. Foes of the crackdown spoke for four hours last July against a Utah County Sheriff's Office proposal to enter into a cooperative agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a plan that was ultimately approved. They marched through the streets of Salt Lake City last June to protest the crackdown, and demonstrated earlier this month outside the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in the Utah capital against the threat of increased enforcement action inside the facility.

Immigration attorneys — sometimes quietly, sometimes loudly — have stood up in defense of immigrants with a potentially legal basis to remain in the country and advocated for their right to due process in immigration courts. They've also expressed concern with negative characterizations of immigrants put forward by Trump and his backers.

""What concerns me most about the current government approach isn't just policy, it's the false narrative of who immigrants are,"" said Ysabel Lonazco, a West Valley City immigration attorney. ""When we portray immigrants as threats rather than recognizing them as neighbors, co-workers and contributors to our communities, we lose sight of our own story. America has always been a nation of immigrants, and that diversity has been our greatest strength, not our weakness.""

She lamented the ""dehumanization"" of immigrants under Trump, while Nicholle Pitt White, an attorney in Murray, said the president's efforts haven't been focused strictly on immigrants in the country illegally, as advertised.

""He has been aggressive to legal immigration as well, working to denaturalize — take citizenship away — from people who have followed the rules and worked hard to become Americans,"" Pitt said. ""He has paused citizenship applications and oath ceremonies for hundreds, possibly thousands, of others just to be cruel.""

Indeed, Carlos Trujillo, a South Jordan immigration attorney, said all immigrants, legal or otherwise, are feeling uneasy. Originally from Venezuela, he's a naturalized U.S. citizen who was advised last April by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to leave the country or face ""potential criminal prosecution.""

""The problem is that we all feel attacked, even the ones that are doing the right thing, even the ones that are following the law,"" Trujillo said.

As a result, many immigrants are skittish about going out in public, terrified they may be targeted by immigration agents, Pitt said. At the same time, immigrant advocates are increasingly organizing, Lonazco said, using whistles to sound warnings when immigration agents are present and recruiting supportive business operators to place ""No ICE allowed"" signs in their front windows.

""Yes, they are nervous. Yes, they are terrified, yet they still show up for work, they still show up for their court hearings, and they are learning about their rights,"" Lonazco said.

'Making America safe again'

Looking ahead to 2026, the situation may not change much.

In a statement last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lauded what she said have been the advancements under Trump, suggesting more of the same is in store for the coming year.

""Under President Trump's leadership, we are making America safe again and putting the American people first. In record time, we have secured the border, taken the fight to cartels and arrested thousands upon thousands of criminal illegal aliens. Though 2025 was historic, we won't rest until the job is done,"" Noem said.

Similarly, Trujillo is bracing for more from the Trump administration, particularly additional measures that could erode immigrants' rights in federal immigration court.

""I don't see anything that really gives me any hope at the moment that things are going to change for the better,"" he said.
