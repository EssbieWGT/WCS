WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security today announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has lodged an arrest detainer for Oscar Gerardo Solorzano-Garcia, a criminal illegal alien from Honduras, who is charged with first degree murder after he stabbed a male victim with a large knife on a light rail train in Charlotte, NC.

Solorzano-Garcia’s criminal history includes prior arrests for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, destroying evidence, resisting arrest, using a false ID, and convictions for robbery and illegally re-entry.

Under the directive, which has not taken effect due to legal challenges, people born in the United States would not be automatically entitled to US citizenship if their parents are in the country temporarily or without legal authorization.
Several district court judges have issued universal preliminary injunctions to block Trump’s order.
In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have blocked Trump’s order.
That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair,” Edkins continued, referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.","The United States Supreme Court on Friday agreed to decide whether US President Donald Trump’s executive order ending birthright citizenship — as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment for more than 150 years — is constitutional.

Next spring, the justices will hear oral arguments in Trump’s appeal of a lower court ruling that struck down parts of an executive order — titled Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship — signed on the first day of the president’s second term. Under the directive, which has not taken effect due to legal challenges, people born in the United States would not be automatically entitled to US citizenship if their parents are in the country temporarily or without legal authorization.

Enacted in 1868, the 14th Amendment affirms that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.”

While the Trump administration argues that the 14th Amendment was adopted to grant US citizenship to freed slaves, not travelers or undocumented immigrants, two key Supreme Court cases have affirmed birthright citizenship under the Constitution — United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898) and Afroyim v. Rusk(1967).

Several district court judges have issued universal preliminary injunctions to block Trump’s order. However, the Supreme Court’s right-wing supermajority found in June that “universal injunctions likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has given to federal courts.”

In July, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit unanimously ruled that executive order is an unconstitutional violation of the plain language of the 14th Amendment. In total, four federal courts and two appellate courts have blocked Trump’s order.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, national legal director at the ACLU — which is leading the nationwide class action challenge to Trump’s order — said in a statement Friday. “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

Brett Edkins, managing director of policy and political affairs at the advocacy group Stand Up America, was among those who suggested that the high court justices should have refused to hear the case given the long-settled precedent regarding the 14th Amendment.

“This case is a right-wing fantasy, full stop. That the Supreme Court is actually entertaining Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship is the clearest example yet that the Roberts Court is broken beyond repair,” Edkins continued, referring to Chief Justice John Roberts.

“Even if the court ultimately rules against Trump, in a laughable display of its supposed independence, the fact that fringe attacks on our most basic rights as citizens are being seriously considered is outrageous and alarming,” he added.

Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, said that “it’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” adding that “every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional.”

Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund, asserted, “The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution.”

“We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century,” Mays added. “Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2221594152-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 18:57:31.068724

Potential ICE flight spotted at MSP

What we know:

The plane spotter named Nick Benson witnessed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) trucks at the airport, with potentially 14 people being loaded onto a Global Crossing flight. Benson has observed similar activities multiple times since April.

The Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) clarified that they do not receive advance notification of government-related flights, including those by ICE.

What they're saying:

""This plane is going to fly to Omaha, Nebraska next. I assume it's going to pick up another group of deportees there,"" said Benson. He noted that Alexandria, Louisiana, is a major hub for ICE air operations.

Benson mentioned that Global Crossing planes have been coming to Minneapolis regularly, even during the previous administration, but it was more transparent back then.

A representative with DHS provided the following statement to FOX 9: ""ICE does not confirm or deny specific flights for operational security. However, under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE removal flights are occurring every day.""

An ICE spokesperson shared a similar statement: ""To protect the security of flight operations, passengers and crew, ICE does not confirm future removal operations until they have landed in respective countries.""

We must raise our voices together and demand an immigration system that treats every person with safety, dignity and fairness.","Michelle Lamm is executive director of Greater Portland Family Promise.

During this time of year when we should be reflecting compassion and gratitude, far too many families in our community are instead living in fear. In my 25-plus years of working as a social worker with children and families, I have never witnessed the level of anxiety and trauma we are seeing today.

Friends and neighbors who have followed every legal step available to them are being arrested and detained without warning. Some are taken from their workplaces, while others are detained in front of their children’s schools. These actions are not only cruel but deeply destabilizing to families who have already endured unimaginable hardship.

Recently, a former colleague and close friend of mine was detained by ICE while simply doing his job. He is a devoted husband, father and friend and one of the most hardworking, compassionate, community-minded people I know.

Without notice, he was transported to a detention center out of state and held for weeks before finally being granted a bond hearing. His family spent every one of those days consumed with fear and uncertainty. After a few long weeks, he was released, but the trauma remains.

This is no way to treat human beings. Right here in Maine parents are being separated from their children, shackled during transfer and held in cold facilities without access to coats or warm clothing. These are not isolated incidents. This is happening across the country and violates people’s basic principles of dignity and due process.

The current administration is actively dismantling legal pathways and constitutional protections for people seeking safety. Many of those being detained are law-abiding individuals who fled instability, persecution and violence and have followed every legal requirement to pursue asylum or obtain green cards.

They have lived here for years. They work. They pay taxes. They contribute immeasurably to our workforce and our communities. And yet, because of a massive immigration backlog, some waiting a decade or more for their cases to be heard, families are left vulnerable to being arrested and detained.

We are punishing people not for breaking the rules, but for being stuck in a system that cannot process cases efficiently.

Detaining working, law-abiding community members without due process undermines both our legal system and our shared humanity. Maine families deserve better. We need solutions, not fear.

Here is where we must start:

1. Invest in immigration courts and case processing. The backlog of more than 3 million immigration cases nationwide is unacceptable. We need more judges (not fewer) and increased funding for the immigration courts and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Families should not wait a decade for clarity or safety.

2. End arbitrary arrests and ensure humane treatment. ICE officers should be required to identify themselves, follow transparent procedures and treat people with dignity. Fear-based enforcement erodes trust and re-traumatizes families who have already survived profound instability.

3. Guarantee due process and access to legal representation. Every person deserves a fair hearing and access to legal counsel. This is a constitutional right, not an optional courtesy, and the government cannot dismiss or adjudicate cases without providing due process.

Maine has always been a place where we take care of one another. In this moment, our values matter more than ever. We must raise our voices together and demand an immigration system that treats every person with safety, dignity and fairness.

We cannot remain silent while families live in fear, parents are torn from their children and hardworking members of our community are punished for bureaucratic failures. It is time to advocate for policies that prioritize human rights, strengthen our courts and provide real pathways to security and stability.

Maine can, and must, lead by example, showing that compassion, justice and accountability are not just ideals, but actionable commitments in how we treat every member of our community.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/12/Trump_Immigration_Boston_65764.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-12-06 19:57:22.243343

These include entry bans and the suspension of all immigration applications and naturalizations.
The granting of permanent residence and work permits, known as green cards, has also been suspended for people of the nationalities in question.
But a US government file revealed that the alleged gunman was actually granted asylum this year under Trump, Reuters reported.
Since all asylum applications are currently on hold, war refugees and people facing political persecution from around the world will no longer find a safe haven in the US.","United States President Donald Trump announced drastic measures against immigration in late November. All asylum procedures were suspended indefinitely ""until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,"" Joseph Edlow, director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), posted on X.

Further restrictions have since been imposed on nationals from 19 countries. These include entry bans and the suspension of all immigration applications and naturalizations. The granting of permanent residence and work permits, known as green cards, has also been suspended for people of the nationalities in question. USCIS chief Edlow said the president had also directed him to conduct ""a full scale, rigorous re-examination of every green card for every alien from every country of concern,"" including holders of residence permits that have already been granted.

What sparked the immigration crackdown?

The background to these new policies is an attack on two National Guard soldiers in Washington on November 26. The two men were seriously injured by gunshots in the center of the US capital, and one of the victims later died. The suspected attacker, a 29-year-old Afghan, was arrested and charged with murder. According to media reports, he entered the US in 2021, the year of the chaotic US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, having previously worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other US government agencies in his home country.

But the Trump administration's recent response is in line with asylum and migrationpolicies that have become increasingly rigid in recent months. The US president used this incident to once again sharply criticize immigration under Joe Biden, claiming that, like many others, the alleged assassin had entered the country ""unchecked"" during his predecessor's term in office.

But a US government file revealed that the alleged gunman was actually granted asylum this year under Trump, Reuters reported.

Which countries are affected?

The immigration ban applies to citizens of countries on three continents. In Asia, this includes Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, Turkmenistan, Myanmar, and Laos. In Latin America, the ban applies to Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela. But most of the sanctioned countries are in Africa: Libya, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Congo and Burundi.

These are all the same 19 countries for which the US government imposed entry bans in June 2025. And these restrictions have now been tightened once again. They are considered ""high-risk"" because US authorities say that they don't receive enough reliable information about their nationals to conduct security checks. Many of these countries are also accused of failing to cooperate in taking back people who have been required to leave the US.

How are immigrants impacted?

The new restrictions have far-reaching consequences for the individuals concerned: all green card applications, naturalizations, and asylum procedures have been put on hold for the time being. Those affected cannot pursue their applications, even if they were already being processed. Even green card holders could lose their permanent residency status after a new security check. In the worst case, they would then face deportation to their home countries.

Late this week, it was announced that the US government would also shorten the maximum validity period of work permits for refugees, asylum seekers, and other migrants — from five years to 18 months.

Since all asylum applications are currently on hold, war refugees and people facing political persecution from around the world will no longer find a safe haven in the US. The additional issue of reuniting affected families has now also been made extremely difficult or even impossible because family members will no longer be admitted to the country.

But the US economy is also facing negative consequences as a result of these policies. The freeze affects sectors that are heavily dependent on foreign workers, particularly in health, science, and technology. The refusal to issue visas, green cards, or work permits makes it difficult to import talent and skilled workers in these areas.

Who has criticized these policies?

While the US government considers the measures necessary steps to protect national security, Democratic lawmakers and human rights organizations have been critical. ""Nothing meaningfully links the 19 countries except the administration's opportunistic stigmatization and exclusion of people based on where they were born,"" Tanya Greene, US program director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. ""This sweeping change is not about safety. It is about scapegoating entire nationalities to justify discriminatory policies.""

To win, Democrats should unite behind popular policies that will repair the immense damage Trump has caused and build a better future for Americans.
In November elections, voters fed up with Trump elected Democrats with a broad range of views.
Trump imposed these tariffs on most nations without congressional approval, and they are making life in the U.S. less affordable.
With the right message and messengers, Democrats can show it is vitally important that they win majorities in the House and Senate next year to act as a check and balance on Trump’s destructive presidency.","Growing numbers of Americans are realizing President Trump is a raging bull in a china shop, recklessly destroying the effectiveness of federal agencies, making America less affordable, increasing unemployment, endangering our health and corrupting our justice system.

A November Associated Press poll found only 33 percent of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s management of government, down from 43 percent in March. While other polls show Trump with an approval ratings in the 40s, none show he gets the approval of most Americans.

Public support for Trump will likely fall lower as the affordability crisis worsens due to his tariffs and other harmful policies, and as more is revealed about his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This could enable Democrats to win control of the House and Senate in 2026 elections.

To win, Democrats should unite behind popular policies that will repair the immense damage Trump has caused and build a better future for Americans.

Trump was reelected because he promised to reduce unauthorized immigration, slow inflation, make health care more affordable and do much more to improve our lives. Other than arresting and deporting immigrants — often without due process of law — he has failed to deliver.

Instead, Trump has dedicated himself to investigating and prosecuting his enemies and to enriching his family. He has monetized the presidency to nearly double the net worth of his family to an estimated $10 billion since he was reelected, according to Forbes magazine.

In November elections, voters fed up with Trump elected Democrats with a broad range of views. New York City will get a democratic socialist mayor, but far more Democratic moderates were elected — including as governors and state legislators in New Jersey and Virginia, and as local officials in many places.

Although Democrats don’t agree on everything, we share many beliefs. Congressional candidates next year should embrace the following positions on domestic issues to take advantage of voter opposition to Trump’s failures and offer a better way forward.

For the sake of affordability, they should reach reciprocal tariff reductions with other nations to lower prices on imports and expand markets for U.S. exports, creating jobs. Trump imposed these tariffs on most nations without congressional approval, and they are making life in the U.S. less affordable.

Democrats should promise to reform the immigration system to allow more people to enter the U.S. legally and create a pathway to citizenship. Halt roundups of immigrants whose only crime is being in the U.S. without authorization. Mass deportations are creating worker shortages that are worsening the affordability crisis by raising prices for food, housing and other essentials.

They should restore more than $24 billion in funds Trump cut from clean energy projects, along with a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles and a 30 percent tax credit for homeowners who buy solar energy panels. This would make energy more affordable and create jobs, in addition to fighting climate change.

To address America’s shortage of an estimated 4 million to 7 million affordable apartments and houses, they should launch a partnership between federal, state and local governments and the housing construction industry to increase the supply of affordable housing.

To fulfill our responsibility to educate our children, they should reverse Trump’s dismantling of the Education Department and restore the billions of dollars and thousands of jobs he has eliminated from the department.

They should reform the tax system so that wealthy individuals and corporations pay their fair share. They should also rescind Internal Revenue Service budget cuts to enable the agency to crack down on wealthy tax cheats.

Democrats must end Trump’s war on diversity, equity and inclusion, which is spreading bigotry and blocking the advancement of people who are not straight white men. America benefits when all people can reach their full potential and when the achievements of all Americans are celebrated.

On health Care, Democrats should promise to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies set to expire at the end of this year, to prevent 22 million Americans from seeing their health insurance premiums more than double. They should also restore medical research funding that Trump has cut.

They should also promise to end Trump’s weaponization of the Justice Department and other federal agencies against the president’s enemies. They should restore about $500 million in budget cuts Trump has proposed for the FBI and restore the bureau’s role in preventing terrorism and fighting major crimes, rather than patrolling cities to roundup unauthorized immigrants.

Democrats should also halt Trump’s deployment of the military and National Guard troops in U.S. cities and increase funding for local police departments and community initiatives to prevent crime.

The above positions would benefit the Democratic Party’s candidates by attracting voters and more importantly would benefit America.

Taiwan’s significance boils down to semiconductors and shipping lanes. Washington’s “hectoring” of the wealthy Gulf monarchies needs to stop.

The world as seen from the White House is a place where America can use its vast powers to make money.

President Trump has shown all year that his second term would make it a priority to squeeze less powerful countries to benefit American companies. But late Thursday, his administration made that profit-driven approach a core element of its official foreign policy, publishing its long-anticipated update to U.S. national security aims around the world.

The document, known as the National Security Strategy, describes a world in which American interests are far narrower than how prior administrations — even in Mr. Trump’s first term — had portrayed them. Gone is the long-familiar picture of the United States as a global force for freedom, replaced by a country that is focused on reducing migration while avoiding passing judgment on authoritarians, instead seeing them as sources of cash.

“We seek good relations and peaceful commercial relations with the nations of the world,” it says, “without imposing on them democratic or other social change that differs widely from their traditions and histories.”

The National Security Strategy of Mr. Trump’s first term, by contrast, cast the world as a contest “between those who favor repressive systems and those who favor free societies.”

The National Security Strategy has no binding force, and some analysts cautioned against reading too much into it as a guide to future actions given Mr. Trump’s mercurial nature.

But the release of the strategy, which recent presidents have generally updated just once in every term, did carry significance as a snapshot in time. Amid the debates swirling among Republicans over American policy toward the Middle East, Russia, China and elsewhere, the document showed how the administration has appeared to coalesce around a commitment to avoid military entanglements and promote commerce.

In an interview, Dan Caldwell, a former senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who argues in favor of American military restraint, hailed the new strategy as a “true break from the failed bipartisan post-Cold War foreign policy consensus.”

“For too long, delusion undergirded our foreign policy — delusion about America’s role in the world, delusion about our interests and delusion about what we can achieve through military force,” Mr. Caldwell said. “This is a reality-based document in that regard.”

The document codifies Mr. Trump’s well-established aversion to Europe’s liberal governments and his readiness to overlook human rights abuses, as with his “things happen” remark last month about the murder and dismemberment of a Saudi Washington Post columnist in 2018. Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said it “discards decades of values-based U.S. leadership in favor of a craven, unprincipled worldview.”

The strategy depicts Europe as facing “civilizational erasure” at the hands of immigrants and its mainstream leaders. It says the United States will cultivate “resistance” to Europe’s mainstream leaders, and asserts that many of their governments “trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition.”

That stance provoked an outcry from European politicians, echoing the shock when Vice President JD Vance castigated German officials in February for trying to blunt the rise of the country’s far-right party. Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, posted on social media that the National Security Strategy “places itself to the right of the extreme right in Europe.”

Outside Europe, departing from decades of precedent in U.S. foreign policy, the 33-page document does not characterize democracy as a value to be defended. Israel and Taiwan — two democracies whose security the United States has long sought to support — are described in the context of their regions’ economic significance, not their connection to American values.

The Middle East, it says, is “a source and destination of international investment.” The document calls for “dropping America’s misguided experiment with hectoring these nations — especially the Gulf monarchies — into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government.”

In Latin America, the document says, the United States will “reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere.” Along the way, American diplomats are to hunt for “major business opportunities in their country, especially major government contracts.”

“The terms of our agreements, especially with those countries that depend on us most and therefore over which we have the most leverage, must be sole-source contracts for our companies,” the document says.

The strategy offers little insight into the Trump administration’s deliberations about a possible attack on Venezuela. While it says the United States should have a “predisposition to non-interventionism,” it also says that American military force is to be redeployed to Latin America from elsewhere “to address urgent threats in our hemisphere.”

Mr. Caldwell, the former adviser to Mr. Hegseth, said that many in Mr. Trump’s “America First” movement “have concerns about a regime change war in Venezuela.”

“But that said, what happens in Venezuela and our own hemisphere deserves more focus than who controls the Donbas,” he added, referring to the region of eastern Ukraine that Russia is demanding in peace talks.

The National Security Strategy takes a far more restrained view of geopolitical competition than prior administrations did. Gone is any reference to the worldview laid out in Mr. Trump’s 2017 National Security Strategy: “China and Russia want to shape a world antithetical to U.S. values and interests.”

Without describing Russia as an adversary, the new document says that “an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” is a “core interest of the United States.” The goal of such a peace deal, it says, would be both to “re-establish strategic stability with Russia” and to enable Ukraine’s “survival as a viable state.”

China is cast as a competitor, but mainly in the familiar commercial terms often repeated by Mr. Trump. The document says a war over Taiwan needs to be deterred because of what would be its “major implications for the U.S. economy.” It calls for “a genuinely mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing,” echoing the conciliation of the trade truce that Mr. Trump and Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, announced in October.

Jonathan Czin, a director for China on the National Security Council under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the new strategy carried “a happier message for Beijing” than the versions published under Mr. Biden or in Mr. Trump’s first term. Among other things, he said, the document’s focus on Latin America should be welcome news for China.

“I think it would be viewed with some relief,” said Mr. Czin, now a fellow at the Brookings Institution.

This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed.
The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country.
The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy.
City after city has risen up to defend its own.","As Donald Trump deteriorates and his grasp on power fades, he has been lashing out furiously at female journalists and ethnic groups, most recently Somali Americans. His insults land because of their animosity and his power, not their accuracy. Likewise, his administration’s attacks on immigrants are sloppy and driven by lies. It’s strikingly clear that the target is not individuals with criminal records. It’s anyone and everyone guilty of being brown. Native Americans with tribal identification cards, US citizens, people doing crucial work from construction to nursing, military veterans, college students, people sleeping in their own beds, small children: all kinds of residents of this country are under attack.

“ICE raids are cruel, inhumane, and do nothing to serve public safety,” declares Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect. Masked thugs smashing car windows and dragging parents away from their babies, terrorizing whole swathes of the population, and interfering with the ability of schools and businesses to function does the opposite. The rounds of targeted hatred by Trump and his minions – for people from Haiti during the 2024 campaign, for people from Venezuela this spring and summer, and most recently for people from Somalia – rely on defamatory lies and insults, because the facts about these groups don’t support the hate.

This terrorizing and demonizing pretends to be in service of recreating a white America that never existed. The US when white supremacists like Trump were young was whiter, but this was never a white country. In 1776, the 13 colonies that became the United States included a significant percentage of Black and Indigenous people (some southern states were a third or more Black). When the US annexed Texas in 1844 and then in 1848 took Mexico’s whole northern half, a Spanish-speaking population was already settled across parts of what’s now the south-west and California. The first African Muslim in what is now the United States came in a Spanish expedition almost a century before the Mayflower brought its fanatical Puritans to the shores of Massachusetts in 1620.

The persecution of huge numbers of brown people and even the mass deportations will not create the white country of far-right fantasy. Los Angeles, for example is an almost 50% Latino city, and despite the ICE and border patrol outrages, arrests, imprisonments and deportations, it remains so. The city’s very name is Spanish, a reminder of who was here first. All the hatred, all the persecution, seems like the panic of racists pretending they can stop the future of this country no longer being majority white through sheer cruelty.

It’s coupled with an attack on reproductive rights that is sometimes openly intended to make white women have more babies (the US has a below-replacement rate birthrate, which is less impactful than in many other countries facing the same decline, because a young, hard-working immigrant workforce keeps things going). Of course, rather than offering the support that might make parenthood less grueling, they are attempting to realize their goals by punitive means. And it’s not working. Margaret Talbot of the New Yorker writes that JD Vance’s reproductive politics – and insults to childless women – amount to pronatalism, which “typically combines concerns about falling birth rates with anti-immigration and anti-feminist ideas”.

Likewise, CNN reports: “Reproductive rights groups and other advocacy organizations say these efforts to buttress the birth rate don’t make up for broader administration priorities aimed at cutting federal programs such as Medicaid, its related Children’s Health Insurance Program, and other initiatives that support women and children. The pro-family focus, they say, isn’t just about boosting procreation. Instead, they say, it’s being weaponized to push a conservative agenda that threatens women’s health, reproductive rights, and labor force participation.”

The anti-immigration and pronatalist policies add up to fantasies of redirecting the demographic future of this country. Both amount to, in the end, dim-witted bullying by haters inadvertently demonstrating that their claims to superiority have to be based on race and gender, because otherwise they’re incoherent idiots.

A lot of the Trump administration’s justifications don’t line up with realities and results. The attacks in the southern Caribbean target small boats not confirmed to be carrying drugs and not capable of reaching the US. Venezuela is not involved in any meaningful way in trafficking fentanyl and much less involved in cocaine trafficking than other South American countries.

“We reject the disastrous ‘climate change’ and ‘Net Zero’ ideologies,” says a new White House document. Trump and company are sentimentally committed to fossil fuel, especially coal, and are forcing various US locales to waste money on this outdated and toxic fuel while sabotaging cheaper, cleaner renewable energy. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, is sabotaging public health while promoting anti-scientific schemes to control Americans’ diet.

The premise of the attacks on immigrants is that people of color who were not born in the US are intruders and threats, but from Los Angeles to Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago to Portland to New York, it’s the Trump administration’s violent foot soldiers with ICE and the border patrol that locals perceive as unwelcome threats and violent invaders. There is no more dramatic sign of the rejection of Trumpism than the thousands upon thousands organizing, showing up, risking bodily safety, arrest and felony charges to defend their neighbors. City after city has risen up to defend its own. All of Trump’s insults cannot change that.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6d8a325b3f1277257e32fe202baec9cae5a4b60/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9f538748b1202e4c24f59ebc9be83a80",N,,2025-12-06 16:31:38.359900

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Earlier today, a three-judge panel appointed by former President Bill Clinton heard oral arguments in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals as they consider whether to uphold a lower court decision from Hawaii placing a nationwide freeze on the Muslim ban. For the second time in the past week, President Trump’s inflammatory campaign statements targeting Muslims faced intense judicial scrutiny as the acting Solicitor General struggled to make the unreasonable sound reasonable.

The Fight Over Trump’s Muslim Ban Is A Fight Over America’s Identity

To be clear, this fight in court over Donald Trump’s Muslim ban is not an ordinary disagreement over immigration policy ― racism and discrimination are on trial, and concerned Americans are fighting back against efforts to make these the official policies of the United States. The intent behind the Muslim ban is becoming a central issue in ongoing lawsuits, precisely because a racist intent taints the law itself as racist ― and unconstitutional.

Iranian-Americans Continue Fight Against Second Muslim Ban

The judge in the Iranian-American lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s Muslim Ban indicated Friday that she was not yet ready to issue a new nationwide freeze on the ban. Instead, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan in the Washington, D.C. Circuit requested additional briefs from the Iranian-American plaintiffs and from the government side, in order for her to make a decision some time after May 5th.

Court Hears Live Testimony Ahead of Friday Hearing on Muslim Ban

Washington, DC – DC District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan heard live testimonials on Tuesday from members of the Iranian-American community in the joint lawsuit, Pars Equality Center, et al., v. Donald J. Trump, et al., brought on behalf of four Iranian-American organizations challenging the Administration’s Muslim Ban.

Q & A: Would Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0 Keep Us Safer?

Trump’s revised Muslim ban is set to go into effect this Thursday, March 16th. Since it’s announcement last week, we at NIAC have received an avalanche of questions from across the United States. In an effort to keep you informed, we posed the five most common questions that we’ve received to NIAC’s Reza Marashi and Adam Weinstein. Their answers are as follows.

NIAC Panel on Capitol Hill Examines Trump’s Muslim Ban 2.0

“Some refer to it as the Muslim ban, some argue that it does not affect all Muslims so it is not a Muslim ban, that is up for debate. What is not up for debate is that it affects all Iranians. Iranians, of the six countries, make up 58% of the visas that are granted annually” said NIAC policy director, Jamal Abdi, in his opening remarks.

Muslim Ban 2.0 Undermines American Interests

On March 6, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States” barring entry into the U.S. for foreign nationals from six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Still a Muslim Ban, Still Permanent

The Trump Administration is fulfilling its campaign promise to impose a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States…” Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani indicated that the President asked him how to implement a Muslim ban legally prior to the first Executive Order, and advisor Stephen Miller indicated that the new order will feature only minor technical changes and will result in the same fundamental policy.

Why Trump’s Travel Ban is Still a Muslim Ban

President Donald Trump’s new travel ban may reduce the chaos at airports caused by his previous executive order, but it will not enhance American security or make the intention behind the original order any less bigoted.

Indeed, in our opinion, the new travel ban is still very much a Muslim ban, even if it falls short of the Trump administration’s true ambitions.

A close look at what the administration has been doing since the now-infamous executive order was issued on January 27 — banning travelers and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations — reveals a clear intent from Trump’s inner circle to depopulate the United States of Muslims.

FAQ: Trump’s New Travel Ban

What is the Executive Order?

1. On March 6, 2017, President Donald J. Trump signed into law an Executive Order, “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States.” Section 3(c) of the Order blocks entry into the U.S. of foreign nationals from six affected countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — who:

1. are outside the United States on the effective date of the Executive Order;

2. do not currently have a valid visa; and

3. did not have a valid visa on January 27, 2017.

This travel ban is alleged to last 90 days from the date of implementation. However, Section 3(e) suggests that — for countries unwilling or unable to provide satisfactory information regarding its nationals seeking entry into the United States — the travel ban will be indefinite. Because the United States and Iran lack diplomatic relations, it is highly unlikely that Iran would provide the information necessary to satisfy the standards of the Executive Order. As a result, it is expected that the Order’s travel ban will prove indefinite for Iranian persons.

Sessions May Have Committed Perjury on Muslim Ban As Well

Washington, DC – NIAC Action Executive Director Jamal Abdi issued the following statement:

“NIAC Action is concerned that Attorney General Jeff Sessions may have misled the Senate Judiciary Committee in his confirmation hearing with regard to his role in planning and drafting President Trump’s executive order banning individuals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S. With new questions being raised regarding whether the Attorney General perjured himself in testimony before the U.S. Congress over contacts with the Russian ambassador, it is appropriate to revisit the record regarding his testimoney that he played no role in drafting or planning the so-called “Muslim ban”, in addition to other immigration-related Executive Orders.

Update: What’s Next in the Effort to Overturn Trump’s Muslim Ban – and What Will the New Executive Order Likely do?

Efforts to overturn the Trump administration’s Muslim ban are expected to take a new turn this week with the issuance of a new Executive Order this coming Wednesday.

Dozens more have retired or resigned. The diminishing headcount and mounting backlog of cases is fueling further disorder at immigration courts already roiled by masked federal agents detaining migrants and reduced pathways to legal status.

The courtroom culling process has become formulaic, ousted judges and their advocates told POLITICO: The judges receive an email stating Attorney General Pam Bondi has removed them from their posts, pursuant to Article II of the Constitution; their names are immediately struck from the Department of Justice’s website; and the news of the latest wave ricochets around chat groups formed among ousted colleagues.

Immigration judges are treated as at-will employees because the administrative courts they preside over fall under the purview of the Department of Justice and are not part of the judiciary branch. Rulings by judges in those immigration courts can ultimately be overturned by the attorney general. The oustings have renewed calls for the immigration courts to be independent of the executive branch — a push unlikely to gain traction in a Republican-controlled Congress.

A Department of Justice spokesperson blamed the current state of affairs on former President Joe Biden’s administration.

“After four years of the Biden Administration forcing Immigration Courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety,” the spokesperson said.

The Trump administration has sought to replace terminated immigration judges with military lawyers as a stopgap and recruit “deportation judges to ensure that only aliens with legally meritorious claims are allowed to remain.”

“We all felt like you can’t do more damage than you already have to the immigration courts and to justice and to due process. Yet it’s like, ‘Hold my beer, watch this,’” said Judge Jennifer Peyton, who told POLITICO she was fired in July in Chicago, where 14 judges remain. “New York is decimated. Chelmsford (Massachusetts) is decimated. The San Francisco court is decimated. Chicago is down half. There’s literally millions — millions with an ‘m’ — millions of cases that are pending.”

At New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza, an epicenter of clashes between immigrants, federal agents and protesters, seven judges were pushed out in one day this week. The wave of dismissals leaves 25 immigration judges in a courthouse that in January had 37, according to a comparison of Department of Justice staff lists now and then.

The most senior among the New Yorkers is former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Amiena Khan, who is on the American Accountability Foundation’s “bureaucrat watch list.” Peyton of Chicago is also on the conservative opposition research group’s list. Of the nine judges targeted by it, only one remains on the bench: Claudia Cubas of Maryland.

Many of the judges are challenging their dismissals.

Cassin of New York has begun the process. Former Judge Tania Nemer of Ohio, who said she was fired in February, filed a lawsuit this week alleging the Department of Justice discriminated against her on the basis of sex, national origin and political affiliation. Nemer is a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon and had sought local office as a Democrat.

Bondi referenced Nemer’s lawsuit at a Cabinet meeting, quipping, “Last I checked, I was a woman as well.”

The seven judges terminated in New York on Dec. 1 are all women: Khan, Lisa Ehrens, Maria Lurye, Alice Segal, Evalyn Douchy, Theodora Kouris and Lori Adams, five judges and court observers told POLITICO.

The expulsions have intensified the need for independent immigration courts, judges and Democratic lawmakers said.

“These unlawful and politicized firings are definitely just another reason why there’s a strong need for an independent judiciary under Article I or Article III of the Constitution,” said Anam Petit, a former Virginia immigration judge who said she was fired in September. “Judges should not be afraid for their jobs. They shouldn’t be nervous that they need to rule a certain way.”

Reps. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) plan to reintroduce legislation to move immigration courts out of the executive branch. The bill would establish an independent immigration court system.

“By firing immigration judges whose rulings he does not like, President Trump is installing himself as the judge and jury of his own decisions,” said Goldman, who has frequently sought to inspect areas in 26 Federal Plaza where migrants are being held. Goldman is part of a slate of House members suing the Trump administration for barring them from providing congressional oversight.

Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has launched a campaign seeking those willing to serve as “deportation” judges to fill the vacuum and is offering additional enticements. According to a job posting, the DOJ will provide a “25% of base pay recruitment incentive for first-time federal employees” placed in New York; Chelmsford, Massachusetts; San Francisco and other cities where a significant number of experienced immigration judges have been let go.

Jeremiah Johnson, an immigration judge who said he was fired in San Francisco late last month, called the recruitment effort a “false advertisement” that makes light of, and offers a bonus for, a position he and others consider a serious responsibility.

“During Trump One, when I was appointed, there was a policy that got some pushback called ‘No Dark Courtrooms.’ We were to hear cases every day, use all the space,” Johnson said in an interview. “Now, there’s vacant courtrooms that are not being utilized. And any attempts by the administration saying they’re replacing judges — the math just doesn’t work if you look at the numbers.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd4%2F48%2F97ccc0f14d25b11723eb2167c27a%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2226350381,N,,2025-12-06 12:57:31.336507

Signed early in his second term, the order states that children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or in the country temporarily are not citizens.

Lower courts have said the order is unconstitutional, including the 9th United States Circuit Court of Appeals, which said in July that it “contradicts the plain language of the 14th Amendment’s granting of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

They continued to rule this way, even after the Supreme Court said in June that three federal district judges overreached their authority when they issued nationwide injunctions against the order.

The case being heard by the Supreme Court comes out of New Hampshire, and will be argued in the spring, according to The Associated Press, with a definitive ruling expected by early summer.

“Our Constitution and the more than a century of court decisions on this topic are overwhelmingly clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship,” SangYeob Kim, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire, said in a statement Friday. “We will continue fighting this cruel executive order to ensure that every child born in the United States has their right to citizenship protected instead of being relegated to a permanent, multigenerational subclass of people born in the U.S. but who are denied full rights.”

The ACLU of New Hampshire and other legal advocates are representing plaintiffs in a nationwide class action lawsuit against the order.

While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.
Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.
They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.
“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States.","An administration official said to “expect a full overhaul of all adjudications,” adding: “We are at a critical moment of vetting foreign nationals, not just those from typical countries of concern.”

The official, like others, was granted anonymity to speak freely about the evolving plans within the U.S. government to respond to the shooting of two members of the West Virginia National Guard that killed one soldier and left another in critical condition.

“We need to screen and screen and screen some more because really and truly this is a tragedy beyond belief,” said West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice. “If I were President Trump, I would say, ‘If you think there’s a better way, then fix it.’”

Since the shooting, the Trump administration has moved to freeze visa and asylum applications from Afghan nationals, and said it will audit green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries. Trump has also said the U.S. must “reexamine” all Afghans who came to the U.S. under Biden, and vowed to “permanently pause” immigration from all “third world countries.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears eager to go further. She posted on X on Monday that she has recommended the president expand travel bans “on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

“There were some plans already afoot to find ways to revisit some of these cases. It was kind of tinkering around the edges,” said one person close to the administration. “But now, it’s going to be much more systematic, and I suspect they’re going to have to devote more resources to it.”

“I would call it an inflection point,” the person added.

Some of the proposals add procedural barriers. Immigration hawks on Capitol Hill are arguing for U.S. officials to restore standards a government commission convened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to root out potential security threats.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has pushed for legislation restoring those strict screening requirements, argued that chief among those steps would be the resumption in-person interviews for asylum applicants and more rigorous reviews to determine if an applicant has any ties to terrorist organizations.

“Does that take time? Of course it does, which is the point. I mean, the point is to zero in and make a judgment about each person you’re letting in because who knows how long they’ll be here,” Hawley said in an interview.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 on humanitarian parole. His application for asylum was approved in 2025 under the Trump administration. While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.

It’s unclear what inspired Lakanwal, who worked with a CIA-backed paramilitary force in Afghanistan, to carry out the shooting but reports have documented mental health concerns. Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.

Some of the plans under consideration would be unprecedented in scope. Two senior intelligence officials said that people who work in the National Counterterrorism Center are actively pushing the White House on a hardline plan to deport some 2 million people from mostly Muslim countries who entered the U.S. under Biden — and force them to reapply from abroad if they want to return.

The first intelligence official declined to explain how the NCTC arrived at the figure of 2 million.

Joe Kent, the head of the NCTC, has already floated the idea in public, advocating for retroactively vetting recent arrivals to the U.S. and deporting those “illegally admitted” under Biden on his social media account.

Olivia Coleman, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said NCTC “fully supports the mission to undo the damage caused by the previous administration’s lax vetting standards and get these monsters out of our country.”

Coleman also pledged that NCTC will “continue our efforts to identify individuals with terrorist ties, rigorously vet them, and equip DHS with the intelligence needed to remove these criminals from our country.”

The calls for more action are being amplified by long-time advocates for restricting legal pathways for migrants to enter the United States. They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.

“Many of them were, at best, very, very superficially vetted. Many probably weren’t vetted at all, and we’ve been paying the price for it. Not just with this attack on the National Guard, but in terms of criminal gangs moving in,” said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform think tank in Washington, which favors restrictions on legal pathways to emigrate to the United States.

Under multiple administrations, including under Biden, migrants and asylum seekers have been generally screened for ties to terrorist groups and potential threats they may pose to U.S. national security based on information available in federal databases. Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan — and therefore qualified to apply for a special visa — were typically initially vetted by military personnel at bases overseas. And not all Afghan refugees were offered humanitarian parole. Many still wait at U.S. military bases and refugee camps around the world for a small number of Special Immigrant Visas that would allow them to enter the United States.

Still, the Biden administration’s process was criticized in a 2022 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report, which found that federal officials “did not always have critical data” to properly vet Afghan refugees.

In a letter Friday, all eight Republicans on the Senate Intelligence panel urged acting national security adviser Marco Rubio to fully implement the recommendations of the OIG report and to remove Afghan “evacuees” deemed a security risk.

Not all of the White House’s allies are pushing for immediate and dramatic action. Some Republicans are voicing caution, wanting to learn more about the shooter before pushing for major changes.

“Secretary Noem says that he was radicalized after he came to the United States, and that may be, but we just don’t have the facts yet,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who in the past has supported visa programs for Afghans who helped the U.S. in its two-decade war. “We don’t have the facts about the extent to which, if any, President Biden’s administration vetted the folks. We were told they would all be vetted, but we don’t know if that was the case or not.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is “working to implement the most rigorous screening and vetting protocols in agency history” as a way to correct damage from the Biden administration’s “reckless approach” to refugee settlement. McLaughlin added that the Trump administration is “reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from countries of concern.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump is “fulfilling his promise every day and any policy changes needed to more effectively achieve” his goal to “put America first and carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history.”

Much of what the administration has carried out in recent days has built on its gradual steps to increase scrutiny of applications and reduce pathways to legally enter the United States, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration lawyer who works as an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

“It’s an escalation, but it’s building on these already extraordinary measures that they had been taking or trying to take,” Bush-Joseph said.

Among the changes, Bush-Joseph said, could be the reintroduction of rules around asylum introduced during the first Trump presidency. Many of those rules were blocked in the courts during Trump’s first term, but the administration has already shown a willingness to revamp other immigration policies that were hampered by litigation back then, such as changes to the diversity visa lottery.

Ken Cuccinelli, who served as acting deputy DHS secretary during the first Trump administration and wrote the chapter of a 2024 Heritage Foundation report that previewed many of the immigration policy changes Trump has since made, said that the administration should pursue a three-pronged policy of blocking new applicants from countries where vetting is impossible, re-vetting all applicants in the U.S. from those nations and deporting anyone who cannot be properly screened.

How far the efforts will go to re-screen foreign nationals is unclear. The first senior intelligence official said that senior White House officials have been briefed on the plan to deport the 2 million migrants from counterterrorism officials.

The second senior intelligence official cautioned that “a lot of things are floating around right now” in response to the shooting, but confirmed this idea was one of them.

In the interim, the political pressure is bubbling to the surface, as even lawmakers who have historically backed programs that grant Afghans and others who supported the U.S. military entry to the United States are acknowledging a need for more vetting.

“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States. I am very firm on that,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “But they must be properly vetted and we know that this was not done.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F9f%2F08%2F24cf4bf949da88c89544b344c2e8%2Fwhite-house-29555.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 12:57:34.807407

The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to take up the constitutionality of President Donald Trump’s order on birthright citizenship declaring that children born to parents who are in the United States illegally or temporarily are not American citizens. The justices will hear Trump’s appeal of a lower-court ruling that struck down the citizenship restrictions. They have not taken effect anywhere in the country. The case will be argued in the spring. A definitive ruling is expected by early summer. The birthright citizenship order, which Trump signed Jan. 20, the first day of his second term, is part of his Republican administration’s broad immigration crackdown. Other actions include immigration enforcement surges in several cities and the first peacetime invocation of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. The administration is facing multiple court challenges, and the high court has sent mixed signals in emergency orders it has issued. The justices effectively stopped the use of the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members without court hearings. But the Supreme Court allowed the resumption of sweeping immigration stops in the Los Angeles area after a lower court blocked the practice of stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location. The justices also are weighing the administration’s emergency appeal to be allowed to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area for immigration enforcement actions. A lower court has indefinitely prevented the deployment. Birthright citizenship is the first Trump immigration-related policy to reach the court for a final ruling. His order would upend more than 125 years of understanding that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment confers citizenship on everyone born on American soil, with narrow exceptions for the children of foreign diplomats and those born to a foreign occupying force. In a series of decisions, lower courts have struck down the executive order as unconstitutional, or likely so, even after a Supreme Court ruling in late June that limited judges’ use of nationwide injunctions. The Supreme Court, however, did not rule out other court orders that could have nationwide effects, including in class action lawsuits and those brought by states. The justices did not decide at that time whether the underlying citizenship order was constitutional. Every lower court that has looked at the issue has concluded that Trump’s order violates or likely violates the 14th Amendment, which was intended to ensure that Black people, including former slaves, had citizenship. Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers who are in the country illegally, under longstanding rules. The case under review comes from New Hampshire. A federal judge in July blocked the citizenship order in a class action lawsuit including all children who would be affected. The American Civil Liberties Union is leading the legal team representing the children and their parents who challenged Trump’s order. “No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” Cecillia Wang, the ACLU’s national legal director, said in a statement, adding, “We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.” The administration had also asked the justices to review a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. That court, also in July, ruled that a group of Democratic-led states that sued over Trump’s order needed a nationwide injunction to prevent the problems that would be caused by birthright citizenship being in effect in some states and not others. The justices took no action in the 9th Circuit case. The administration has asserted that children of noncitizens are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States and therefore not entitled to citizenship. “The Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children — not … to the children of aliens illegally or temporarily in the United States,” top administration top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, wrote in urging the high court’s review. Twenty-four Republican-led states and 27 Republican lawmakers, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, are backing the administration.

—

When attorney Andy Armstrong went to the Salt Lake City office of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Dec. 2, he expected a typical appointment.

His client was there with his wife, a U.S. citizen, for an interview to check his background and verify the authenticity of their marriage. That’s the last step for someone to get their green card, or legal permanent residency.

The client was nicely dressed and feeling good, said Armstrong, who works with the Murray-based firm Stowell Crayk.

“There was nothing about his background that gave me any pause at all to think we would have any problem,” Armstrong said.

But instead of being told his green card was on the way, the youth soccer coach was called into a room.

“There were two officers from ICE who said they were taking him into custody to initiate removal action, or deportation action, against him,” Armstrong said. “And they handcuffed him, and they took him away without being able to say goodbye to his wife.”

The client is now in ICE custody. Armstrong expects him to be transferred to a detention center outside Las Vegas.

In a statement, ICE told KUER the man was required to leave the United States in 2008.

“He was arrested for overstaying his visa and will remain in ICE custody pending the remaining removal proceedings,” a spokesperson wrote.

But that’s a relatively common situation for people at their Citizenship and Immigration Services interviews who are also in the process of obtaining legal status, Armstrong said. Plus, overstaying a tourist visa is not a disqualifying factor for a green card through marriage.

Ultimately, Armstrong expects his client will be released on bond in about two weeks and eventually end up back in the interview room after his time in detention.

“He's not a danger to society, and he's not a flight risk, and he's got an American citizen wife and an American citizen child,” he said.

A search of Utah court records found two debt collection cases under the client’s name, along with a petition for a child’s name change. A search of federal court records yielded no results.

It’s common for ICE to arrest immigrants who lack legal status but have no criminal record. What surprised Armstrong was that his client, who was clearly on the path to permanent residency, was arrested.

The client is scheduled to appear in immigration court in early January. He’ll make his case to the judge, and Armstrong expects him to be referred back to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to continue his case there.

“He ends up exactly back where he started — I mean, status-wise, but he, his wife, his family, his child, having suffered needlessly,” he said.

He sees the detention as a waste of ICE’s time and money.

This is the first arrest at the Salt Lake City office that Armstrong is aware of, but similar arrests have occurred recently in San Diego.

“This speaks to, and this is my own personal opinion, that part of the Trump administration's push to do immigration enforcement is to sow the seeds of fear in the immigrant community so that they either self-deport or that they don't try to become legalized,” he said.

That’s even affecting clients with straightforward immigration cases.

“You've got a lot of people here who are very afraid, including people who should not be afraid because they've done everything the right way,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/16461e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4900x2573+0+309/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1c%2Fd2%2Fc6137b90482296167a131b72765e%2F20251205-ml-img-1523.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 16:32:11.568857

The agency issued a news release saying that the arrestees had criminal records and blaming Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for local sanctuary policies. But some local immigration attorneys say law-abiding immigrants are being swept up in the arrests.

Immigrant advocacy groups told Sahan Journal that while they don’t have exact numbers, they believe, based on family and eyewitness accounts, that there have been more people arrested in Minnesota this week than the 12 reported by DHS.

“Every time ICE [the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] begins an operation and focuses their attention on a certain city, they plan to make as many arrests as possible,” said Erika Zurawski, a member of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee.

Immigration agents have been seen making arrests on the streets primarily in south Minneapolis and Richfield, Zurawski said. Agents typically arrive in two to three vehicles and are usually seen wearing face masks and vests that read “POLICE.”

Local law enforcement don’t wear face masks and their vehicles are marked with clear signage with their city or county’s name, she said.

‘They’ve done nothing wrong’

Local immigration attorneys tell Sahan Journal they’ve received a handful of new clients this week as a direct result of the ICE operation targeting Somali residents.

The clients fall into two categories:

They immigrated to the United States within the last few years and are not U.S. citizens, but filed official paperwork with the government to receive asylum, and are awaiting a final decision.

They’ve been in the country for a long time and are not U.S. citizens, but are here legally under other immigration status, such as green cards. However, they have a prior deportation order from several years ago for a number of reasons, including a criminal conviction.

David Wilson, a Minneapolis-based attorney, said he took on two new clients this week who already have to check in with ICE on periodic bases as part of their ongoing asylum cases. Both were detained during their check-ins this week, Wilson said.

“They were compliant,” Wilson said. “They were doing the check-ins. They don’t have any criminal history. They’ve both been going to court. They’ve both been submitting their documents. They were in the queue waiting for a trial date.”

On Thursday, the federal Department of Homeland Security wrote in a statement that the 12 people arrested in the Twin Cities this week represented “the worst of the worst,” including “child sex offenders, domestic abusers, and violent gang members.” Wilson, however, opined that the brunt of people experiencing fallout from the Twin Cities operation are pawns in a political dispute between Trump and Minnesota Democrats.

“These are real people living real lives,” Wilson said of many other ICE detainees. “They’ve done nothing wrong but being from the wrong country at a time when the president gets mad.”

Abdi Jabane, another Minneapolis immigration attorney, said he’s obtained one new client who was swept up in ICE activity this week. The client, who is a Somali man from Ethiopia, came to the United States within the last two years and has a pending asylum application. Jabane said he was still researching information about how and why this client was arrested, but added that the client was also attending regular check-ins with ICE.

Wilson and Jabane said they have other Somali clients who were questioned by ICE this week but weren’t arrested.

One of Jabane’s clients was afraid to attend his regular check-in with ICE this week.

“He was terrified,” Jabane said. “He went and was not detained.”

Jabane implored all asylum seekers to continue attending their check-ins with ICE.

“I know ICE now is everywhere,” he said. “Stay calm, go to work and go to school. If you are detained, you will still have the right to a hearing and to a lawyer to represent your case.”

He also told people to carry any of their necessary immigration papers on them at all times in case they are questioned by ICE without notice.

“Gather your documents and be ready,” he said. “Do not listen to fear, do not listen to rumors. Stay calm and stay strong.”

One of Wilson’s clients is a female Somali truck driver from the Twin Cities who was questioned by ICE over the weekend. She was arrested, detained and then released several weeks ago as she drove through a U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in Arizona.

Years ago, she was jailed and an immigration judge ordered her deportation. But her attorneys then successfully argued to prevent deportation to her home country because “she would be killed almost instantly if she returned to Somalia,” Wilson said.

Last month after she was arrested by ICE in Arizona, Wilson and his colleague successfully filed a habeas corpus motion, which argues that a person can’t be detained for long periods of time while the likelihood of deporting them remains uncertain. This led to her release from immigration detention.

Then, over the weekend, ICE agents visited the woman’s Twin Cities home and attempted to deport her, Wilson said. She called Wilson’s law office, and an attorney talked the ICE agents out of arresting her, Wilson said.

“It’s only because we had filed and already won [her habeas case] that they were willing to listen to the phone call from the attorney saying, ‘You really don’t want to do this again; we just did this 45 days ago,’” Wilson said. “No one had really actually screened whether she should have been taken into custody, because if they looked they would have seen that they had just lost this issue in federal court.”

Wilson said it’s likely that the ICE agents reportedly seen idling around Somali malls, homes and businesses this week are targeting immigrants with deportation and withholding orders from several years ago.

“If people have final orders [of removal], they might not have any check-ins anytime soon,” Wilson said. “So [ICE] goes out looking for them.”

Local immigration attorneys said such immigrants can be hard to deport because the federal government has already unsuccessfully tried to deport them, and the immigrants’ attorneys likely already successfully argued that their clients would immediately face danger if they were sent to their home countries.

“That doesn’t mean the government can’t send you somewhere else,” Wilson said, noting that east African countries like Uganda and Rwanda have agreed with the Trump administration to take detainees from other African countries.

Community, faith leaders show support

Community members and leaders, politicians and faith leaders have been mobilizing throughout the week to support the Somali community and call out the immigration enforcement.

More than a hundred people rallied Thursday outside the Target store on E. Lake Street in Minneapolis to demand that Target prohibit U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials from using their parking lots to mobilize.

Photos and videos recorded by immigrant advocacy watch patrols showed ICE agents using the Minneapolis Target parking lot and one in Richfield to congregate, said Luis Argueta, communications director at Unidos MN, a statewide immigrant advocacy group.

“We know history will teach Target and other companies that darkness does not prevail,” said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR-MN.

Target issued a written statement to Sahan Journal denying any cooperation with ICE.

“These claims are entirely baseless,” said the statement. “We have no cooperative agreements in place with ICE.”

Suleiman Adan, CAIR-MN’s deputy director, said his group recently organized a state-wide task force that handles reports of ICE enforcement against Somali residents. The number of task force members has reached more than 500, he said.

Task force members operate in cities with large Somali populations, including St. Cloud and Moorhead, and in neighborhoods like Cedar-Riverside in Minneapolis.

About 50 people, mostly Minneapolis residents, attended a training session Thursday evening at Brian Coyle Neighborhood Center to prepare for ICE activity in Cedar-Riverside.

“They’re just targeting a new group of people and we have to stand up against it as a community, because they have no right to say who doesn’t belong on stolen land,” said Nick Estes, one of the attendees.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the country, with 80,000 residents, according to Minnesota Compass. About 4,200 people in the community are not U.S. citizens, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, but many are green-card holders. Some are undocumented or have temporary protected status (TPS); President Donald Trump announced in late November that he plans to cancel TPS for Somali residents in the country.

A city-wide prayer was also hosted Thursday morning at the Brian Coyle Neighborhood Center in Cedar-Riverside to show support for the Somali community. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said at the prayer that his department has seen a heightened sense of fear in the Somali community in the past few days, but reaffirmed his commitment to support them.

At a news conference hosted in the Umatul Islam Center mosque Thursday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Trump’s derogatory remarks on the Somali community are harmful. Faith leaders across different religions and Somali community leaders who were also in attendance denounced the federal ICE operation.

“The focus needs to be on who we are as a people and what we value as Americans,” Frey said.

He issued an executive order Wednesday to create signage for businesses and property owners that show support for immigrants, and that mark their properties as off-limits for federal immigration actions. He also prohibited federal, state and local agencies from using city-owned parking lots, garages, ramps and vacant lots for federal immigration actions.

“Every one of us needs to be standing up against this hateful rhetoric because, indeed, when you come for one of us, you come for all of us,” Frey said.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICECommunityResponse2_12-4-3193.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:57:39.371844

In a statement posted on the social media website X, the agency said U.S. Border Patrol had been ""conducting a targeted immigration enforcement operation against a criminal illegal alien previously charged with felony theft and convicted of illegal possession of stolen property.""

The woman who Border Patrol agents were seen chasing, a 23-year-old mother who lives in Marrero, matched the description of the wanted subject, the agency said. They added that the agents had identified themselves.

""Agents immediately stopped upon reaching the property, determined the individual in question was not the target, and all agents departed the area,"" DHS said. ""No arrests were made.""

The agency’s social media post was in response to WWL-TV, after the local television station shared the footage, which drew more than half a million views in less than a day on the social media site.

But the mother of the Marrero woman who was chased by Border Patrol agents told The Times-Picayune on Friday that the statement from DHS did not make up for what happened.

“We've seen this and they're just trying to cover their asses because they did not identify themselves or ask her,” said Ramona Anglin, the woman’s mother.

In an interview Thursday with The Times-Picayune, the woman who was chased by Border Patrol asked only to be identified by her first name of Jacelynn, out of fear of retaliation. She said the masked agents ran after her after she walked out of a corner store and was heading back home.

The agents then stood outside the family’s home for five to 10 minutes, according to her father, Juan Carlos Anglin, who was watching his granddaughter inside at the time. He said he heard his daughter scream and thought she was being kidnapped. Juan Carlos Anglin confronted the agents, who told him they were looking for a woman and held up a photograph of her.

Juan Carlos Anglin said the woman in the photo appeared to be a decade older than his daughter.

U.S. Border Patrol launched “Catahoula Crunch” on Wednesday in New Orleans, bringing President Donald Trump’s federal immigration crackdown to the state. DHS has repeatedly declined to share specific numbers of how many people have been detained in their immigration sweeps so far in the area, but has said dozens have been arrested.

In recent Border Patrol sweeps in Chicago and North Carolina, a vast majority of detainees had no criminal backgrounds. And in New Orleans, allegations that federal agents have detained people with work permits and American citizenship have quickly mounted.

A similar encounter unfolded on Wednesday, when a Border Patrol agent detained a man at a Lowe’s store in New Orleans who insisted he was an American citizen, according to footage of the encounter obtained by the immigrants rights group Union Migrante. The group said he was one of three citizens questioned and then released after agents confirmed their citizenship.

Fox News Digital reached out to Jayapal, Smith and the Department of Homeland Security for additional comment on the pushback.","After more than 120 House Democrats signed onto a bill from a top progressive lawmaker to seek what they define as ""dignity"" for federal immigration detainees, critics sounded the alarm that the legislation could forever transform how illegal immigrants are treated in the U.S.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., is spearheading the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, along with fellow Evergreen State lawmaker Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. They say it would curb the ""shocking surge"" of allegedly wrongful detentions and inappropriate conditions, particularly at jails run by private companies under government contract.

Critics vociferously objected to that suggestion in exclusive comments to Fox News Digital Friday.

""This legislation isn’t aimed at improving conditions for migrants navigating the U.S. immigration system. It would instead end the federal government’s ability to enforce immigration law entirely,"" members of the Day 1 Alliance, the main trade association representing longtime federal and state contractors in the criminal justice and immigration spaces, warned.

Day 1 Alliance members said that, for more than three decades, both Republican and Democratic congresses and administrations have respected the ""limited yet valued"" role their members play in working toward a better immigration enforcement system.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would lead to the repeal of mandatory detention for those captured by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to a summary posted by Jayapal, and create a presumption of release, imposing a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and ""vulnerable populations.""

It also would phase out the use of private detention centers, like those Day 1 Alliance members may work in or with, by about 2029.

DEM CONGRESSWOMAN DENIES RHETORIC INCITED ANTI-ICE VIOLENCE, DOUBLES DOWN ON CONDEMNING AGENCY

In apparent response to Democrats being iced out of ICE centers earlier in 2025, including a case in Newark, New Jersey, where Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was accused of accosting officers, it also would mandate that the Department of Homeland Security admit members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

Another case in Baltimore involved that city’s congressman, Democratic Rep. Kweisi Mfume, joining others downtown to protest to the press about not being allowed full access to the Charm City’s Department of Homeland Security installation.

""Contractors operate under strict federal oversight and standards set by the U.S. Congress,"" Day 1 Alliance members told Fox News Digital of the implications about the proposed changes.

""They do not make arrests, do not decide the length of detention and play no role in determining the legal status of individuals in their care.""

The members said contractors work to provide humane housing, proper meals and quality medical care for all in their ward.

Jayapal said Thursday the Trump administration has caused a ""shocking surge in the detention of people who have committed no crimes.""

""As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse,"" Jayapal said. ""We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.""

Smith added that the U.S. is witnessing ""appalling conditions"" and a ""clear disregard for basic human rights"" of detainees.

""No one should be subjected to overcrowded cells, denied medical care or held in facilities that profit off of human suffering,"" he said, echoing his Seattle neighbor in saying the bill would provide proper oversight.

DHS SAYS FOUR HOUSE DEMOCRATS 'CHOSE TO STAND WITH CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIENS' AFTER VISITING ICE DETAINEE

Homeland Security officials torched the new bill later Friday.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital Jayapal's claims of overcrowding, mistreatment and wrongful detention are ""false.""

""ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,"" she said.

""It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,"" she continued. ""This includes medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by"" dietitians.

McLaughlin added that ICE deaths in custody are at a rate of less than 1%, lower than any previous administration's record.

She praised House Speaker Mike Johnson's ""big, beautiful bill"" as the facilitator of ICE improving detention conditions since President Donald Trump took office.

""Ensuring the safety, security and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,"" she said

A release from Jayapal’s office cited a figure of 66,000 people detained since Trump took office and claimed nearly three-quarters did not have any criminal convictions, an assertion immigration officials have rejected.

There were 123 listed Democratic co-sponsors, including several lawmakers representing areas ICE and USBP have pinpointed for mass enforcement activities.

And it’s sad that we have to go through this because at the end of the day, we’re hardworking people.","A video shows Staten Island residents clashing with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after at least one immigrant was taken into custody.

“This is home for them, and that’s the sad part,” said Jessica Vigueras, who took cellphone video of the altercation that happened Thursday afternoon inside a bodega in Port Richmond.

She says she heard some commotion outside and ran up the block. That’s where she saw eight or nine ICE agents questioning immigrants.

“They didn’t come with warrants. They didn’t come with papers. They just came and said, ‘What’s your name? What’s your legal status?’ I find it completely not right. I understand if they want to get criminals out, but that’s not the way,” said Vigueras, who is the daughter of Mexican immigrants who own a bakery next to the bodega where the ICE arrests took place.

Vigueras, who was one of several bystanders who attempted to stop the arrest, says the entire community is scared to leave their homes now.

“Why should they have to run? Why? They’re not criminals. They’re just getting food to go home and cook for their families,” she said.

An agent can be seen taking out his taser, but Vigueras says that didn’t stop the crowd from going after the agents.

“We chased them until they got in their cars and we made them leave,” she said.

Vigueras’ mother, who has lived in the city for 33 years, says this recent uptick in ICE raids keeps her up at night.

“It makes me [cry] all the time, they make me scared, sometimes I can’t even sleep all night. I wake up at 2 o’clock in the morning,” Laura Gutiérrez said. “I can’t explain to you. I can’t. It’s very sad. Very, very sad.”

Vigueras says she is deeply concerned for her family and community, and she believes immigrants should not be targeted.

“At the end of the day, whether people like it or not, immigrants make this country. Immigrants are the ones who are making people’s food. Immigrants are the ones who are [at] the back. And it’s sad that we have to go through this because at the end of the day, we’re hardworking people. It’s not like we’re stealing anything or taking anything from anybody,” she said.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship.","The Supreme Court on Dec. 5, 2025, agreed to review the long-simmering controversy over birthright citizenship. It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.

When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?

As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.

Arguments for automatic citizenship

Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.

The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.

One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.

Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.

If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.

However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.

The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”

One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.

The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.

Opposition to birthright citizenship

The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.

This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.

The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.

Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.

Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.

The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.

In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.

For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.

Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.

What might happen

The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.

The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.

Federal agents have yet to have a city-designated operation in San Francisco.","Mayors and local officials aren't just criticizing ICE raids in their cities: They're making life harder for federal law enforcement, while being careful not to go over the line.

Why it matters: The law forbids local leaders from impeding or interfering with federal officers. But cities are finding ways to push back on unwanted immigration enforcement by the Trump administration.

The big picture: Homeland Security officials started broadcasting a plan to target sanctuary jurisdictions from the start of President Trump's second term.

This has put local leaders — because of the law, past litigation and public sentiment — directly at odds with Trump's mass deportation campaign.

Driving the news: Homeland Security officials are getting a cold shoulder from local leaders as they decamp to New Orleans for ""Operation Catahoula Crunch.""

""To be in the country undocumented is civil issue. We will not enforce civil law,"" said New Orleans Police Department superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick at a recent press conference.

The local sheriff's office won't allow ICE into its jails to make arrests or use the space for detention, because of a consent decree from a case that started in 2011 and is still being litigated.

The city council, led by Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, launched a new portal for residents to document instances of potential abuse by federal agents. In an interview with NOLA.com, Moreno accused Border Patrol of ""targeting Brown people.""

Zoom in: In Minneapolis, bracing for an ICE operation targeting Somali immigrants over visa fraud, Mayor Jacob Frey signed an executive order this week that bans law enforcement agencies ""from using any City-owned parking lots, ramps, garages, or vacant lots to stage civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Frey's staff is also sharing a notice template that small businesses or homes can display to deter civil enforcement in private spaces.

The big picture: This is happening city by city.

In Chicago, where Border Patrol and other federal agents swarmed the city for months this fall, Mayor Brandon Johnson issued a similar ban on using city-owned space for any immigration enforcement operations, called ""ICE Free Zones.""

Earlier this year, Mayor Ras Baraka of Newark, New Jersey, worked to block the re-opening of an immigration detention facility, alleging that the building wasn't up to code. He and other demonstrators made a human barricade in front of the building in May.

Los Angeles County officials approved an emergency declaration that will cover living expenses for people who miss work because they fear immigration raids. It started accepting requests for aid in December.

Between the lines: Cities and states covered by sanctuary laws have learned to prepare for when — not if — ICE targets them. While community organizers are preparing to protest, city officials are also making plans.

Federal agents have yet to have a city-designated operation in San Francisco. But the local district attorney hatched a plan to charge ICE agents for violating state laws as they carried out arrests, such as violating the statewide ban on agents wearing masks and possible excessive force.

The other side: The Trump administration has swelled the number of deals between ICE and local law enforcement to more than 1,000 agreements across the country.

That's helped fuel immigration arrests and feed the pipeline for deportations. The Trump team is aiming for a million deportations a year.

The bottom line: New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani said he told Trump in their recent meeting that the raids are ""cruel and inhumane.""

But Trump and administration officials aren't relenting.

The Department of Homeland Security posted on social media, days after starting the new operations in Minneapolis and New Orleans: ""To the violent rioters and sanctuary politicians: You will not stop us. This administration will not be intimidated.""",https://images.axios.com/ArmmfEqjygwNqjcMQrThJGarhzE=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2025/12/05/1764954874561.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 11:58:18.329367

Amnesty International is the latest group to condemn the treatment of immigrants with disputed documentation at two South Florida lockups, the Krome North Service Processing Center (Krome) and the Everglades Detention Facility (Alligator Alcatraz).

The latter has been a priority of state government since President Donald Trump was inaugurated.

The organization claims treatment of the detained falls “far below international human rights standards.”

Amnesty released a report Friday covering what it calls a “a research trip to southern Florida in September 2025, to document the human rights impacts of federal and state migration and asylum policies on mass detention and deportation, access to due process, and detention conditions since President Trump took office on 20 January 2025.”

“The routine and prolonged use of shackles on individuals detained for immigration purposes, both at detention facilities and during transfer between facilities, constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and may amount to torture or other ill-treatment,” the report concludes.

Gov. DeSantis’ administration spent much of 2025 prioritizing Alligator Alcatraz.

While the state did not comment on the report, Amnesty alleges the state’s “decision to cut resources from essential social and emergency management programs while continuing to allocate resources for immigration detention represents a grave misallocation of state resources. This practice undermines the fulfillment of economic and social rights for Florida residents and reinforces a system of detention that facilitates human rights violations.”

Amnesty urges a series of policy changes that won’t happen, including the repeal of immigration legislation in Senate Bill 4-C, which proscribes penalties for illegal entry and illegal re-entry, mandates imprisonment for being in Florida without being a legal immigrant, and capital punishment for any such undocumented immigrant who commits capital crimes.

Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose “primary allegiance” is to the United States, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued.

The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year.
The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.","The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide the legality of President Donald Trump’s directive to restrict birthright citizenship in the United States, a contentious part of his efforts to curb immigration and a step that would alter how a 19th century constitutional provision has long been understood.

The justices took up a Justice Department appeal of a lower court’s ruling that blocked Trump’s executive order telling U.S. agencies not to recognize citizenship of children born in the U.S. if neither parent is an American citizen or legal permanent resident, also called a “green card” holder.

The lower court ruled that Trump’s policy violated the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment and a federal law codifying birthright citizenship rights in a class-action lawsuit by parents and children whose citizenship is threatened by the directive.

The Republican president signed the order his first day back in office on January 20 as part of a suite of initiatives he has pursued during his second term as president to crack down on legal and illegal immigration.

The 14th Amendment has long been interpreted as guaranteeing citizenship for babies born in the United States.

The amendment’s Citizenship Clause states that all “persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War of 1861-1865 that ended slavery in the United States.

The Trump administration has argued that the provision does not grant citizenship to the babies of immigrants who are in the country illegally or whose presence is lawful but temporary, such as university students or those on work visas.

It has asserted that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” means that being born in the United States is not enough for citizenship. Citizenship is granted only to the children of those whose “primary allegiance” is to the United States, including citizens and permanent residents, it has argued. Such allegiance is established only through “lawful domicile,” which government attorneys define as “lawful, permanent residence within a nation, with intent to remain.”

‘Birth Tourism’

The administration has said that granting citizenship to virtually anyone born on U.S. soil has created incentives for illegal immigration and led to “birth tourism,” by which foreigners travel to the United States to give birth and secure citizenship for their children.

The legal challenges appealed by the Justice Department concerned one lawsuit filed by the states of Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, and another filed in federal court in New Hampshire by plaintiffs who sued on behalf of a nationwide class of people affected by Trump’s order.

In July, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the states. Also in July, Concord, New Hampshire-based U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante let the plaintiffs in that case proceed as a class, allowing Trump’s order to be blocked nationally.

The challengers said the Supreme Court already settled the question of birthright citizenship in an 1898 case called United States v. Wong Kim Ark, which long has been interpreted as guaranteeing that children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents are entitled to American citizenship under the 14th Amendment.

The challengers also point out that Trump’s order violates a law Congress passed in 1940 that was subsequently included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. That measure codified the Citizenship Clause’s language and also adopted what was by then the well-settled understanding that the 14th Amendment promised automatic birthright citizenship.

The birthright citizenship fight had landed at the Supreme Court already once this year. After lower courts halted Trump’s order, the administration took the matter to the Supreme Court to challenge the power of federal judges to issue so-called “universal” injunctions preventing presidential policies from applying against anyone, anywhere.

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling powered by its conservative majority, issued a ruling in June blunting the power of federal judges but did not resolve the legality of Trump’s directive. The ruling left open the possibility for courts to grant broad relief to states or to individual plaintiffs through class action lawsuits.

The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality. Among these policies were Trump’s revocation of temporary legal protections on humanitarian grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deportations of migrants to countries other than their own and domestic immigration enforcement raids.

Then: “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”

He doubled down later: “We could go one way or the other — and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.”

These aren’t misremembered paraphrases. These are disregarded human beings, stripped of dignity, reduced to “garbage” in front of the world.

Trump’s tirade is not a reasoned critique of immigration policy. It is a naked display of bigotry, racism, and dehumanization. By singling out an entire ethnic and religious group — immigrants from Somalia, including a U.S. citizen elected to Congress, Ilhan Omar — he broadcasts a dangerous message: that people of certain backgrounds are disposable, undeserving of the rights and dignity that define America.

It aligns with his broader ideological agenda — white-nativism, exclusion, and an effort to mobilize his political base through fear, hatred, and division. This isn’t about integration or assimilation; it’s about erecting walls — physical, social, and moral — around whiteness and Christian-majority America, while casting people of color, Muslims, and immigrants as threats to the nation’s identity.

It’s no coincidence that such contempt comes amid aggressive crackdowns: reports suggest his administration is preparing Immigration and Customs Enforcement “strike teams” for mass deportations targeting Somali communities in Minnesota.

By dehumanizing Somalis, Trump lays ideological and rhetorical groundwork for systematic repression, erasing the line between “immigration law enforcement” and ethnic cleansing of whole communities.

A cruel irony: Trump’s own family’s immigrant roots

It’s an ugly hypocrisy that the man leading this crusade against immigrants descends himself — through marriage, naturalization, and private business — from immigrants. His wives, too, were not part of some ancient American founding class. Yet here he stands, calling other immigrants “garbage.”

That bitter irony exposes the argument for what it really is: not about law or national security, but about ideology — white nativist ideology, which sees immigrants of color as inferior, unwelcome, un-American.

Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions

The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine. According to the most recent census data, there are roughly 3,000 Somali-born residents in Maine, many of them living in Portland or Lewiston.

In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities. They established community centers, helped one another navigate social services, found jobs, paid taxes — and despite hateful myths and scapegoating, they have contributed concretely to the state’s social and economic life.

Take Safiya Khalid, who came to America as a seven-year-old refugee from Somalia, grew up in Lewiston, and in 2019 became the first Somali American elected to the Lewiston City Council — and the youngest ever.

Or consider Deqa Dhalac, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, she immigrated in the early 1990s, moved to Maine, worked as an interpreter and community organizer, and eventually became the first Somali-American mayor in U.S. history when she was elected mayor of South Portland in 2021. Today she serves in the Maine House of Representatives.

These are not political tokens. They are mothers, workers, organizers, people whose lives reflect the best of what America can be: a home for refugees, an opportunity for immigrants, a chance to rebuild, contribute, and belong.

Yet Trump’s words treat them like trash.

Why this scorched public rebuke matters

Because when a leader of a nation mocks entire communities as “garbage,” it emboldens racists, bigots, and xenophobes to act. His words are not benign, they are poisonous.

Because the president’s rhetoric attempts to strip Somali Americans, and all immigrants of color, of their identity, agency, and humanity, reducing them to stereotypes for political gain.

Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.

Because America was built on immigration. On hope. On the idea that people seeking refuge, safety, dignity should be welcomed, not vilified.

If Trump does not immediately retract his words, if the administration proceeds with raids, deportations, or policies targeting entire communities, it will be complicit in a moral atrocity.

We cannot stay silent. We cannot treat this as “just politics.” This is a moral crisis. And we — citizens, neighbors, voters — must speak out, demand accountability, and insist: immigrants are not garbage.

Federal agents sprayed some of the protesters from inside the field office parking lot.","Federal law enforcement officers pepper sprayed Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva, her staff and other community members protesting an immigration raid at a taco restaurant on Tucson’s west side in a historic Latino neighborhood.

Arizona Luminaria photographed the officers at Taco Giro dispersing a cloud-like substance at the crowd and captured video of Grijalva identifying herself and pushing back against agents dressed in combat gear and black masks partially covering their faces.

“I’m a sitting member of congress and I want to know where you’re taking him,” Grijalva asks as she wades through a crowd of protesters and masked officials. People cough around her.

“Don’t push me, don’t push me, don’t push me,” she says.

“I want to know where you’re taking him,” she says as she reaches a masked agent wearing a helmet and a uniform with “POLICE” on the front.

An agent is heard saying “assault on a federal officer” but the rest of the audio is unclear.

“What’s your fucking name, where’s your fucking badge?” a member of the public shouts.

Grijalva continues questioning where agents were taking people they’d arrested during the raid.

“Downtown to the federal jail is where you’re taking him?” Grijalva asks.

“Yes ma’am.”

“That’s all I needed to know.”

“She needs to stop being so aggressive,” Grijalva says about one of the masked agents. “Stop being so aggressive. Don’t push on me,” she says to the agent.

Grijalva is the first Latina to represent Arizona in the U.S. House and has already been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump. On her first day in Congress, after a Republican-led delay to swearing her into office, she was the deciding vote to release the Epstein files.

Grijalva describes Taco Giro as a “small mom-and-pop restaurant that has served our community for years.” The shop sits on Grande Avenue between St. Mary’s Road and Speedway Boulevard in the Barrio Hollywood neighborhood — lined with locally-owned restaurants, churches and a preschool and daycare.

Grijalva posted videos of the altercation at Taco Giro on her social media.

“You guys need to calm down and get out,” she tells federal officers using pepper spray as people scream, cough and car horns honk around her. A projectile nearly hits her in the leg as she moves through the crowd.

She then posted a statement condemning federal immigration agents’ actions.

“We just came up on a community that was protecting their people. We had, I would say, maybe 40 ICE agents, most of them masked, in several vehicles,” she says directly to the camera. “The community had stopped right here right in the middle of the street because they were afraid that they were taking people without due process. Without any notice.”

“I was here, this is the restaurant I come to literally once a week. And was sprayed in the face. By a very aggressive agent. Pushed around by others when I was literally not being aggressive — I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of congress,” she adds.

All but one agent, she says, was “rude and disrespectful” to her as she asked about the whereabouts of people arrested.

“I can only imagine, if they’re gonna treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else,” she says.

“We saw people directly sprayed. Members of our press. Everybody that was with me, my staff member, myself. Two staff members. We have remnants of whatever they sprayed on us,” she says coughing.

Grijalva called Trump out directly in her message.

“One of the biggest problems we have in this community is that we have Trump, that has no regard for any kind of due process, the rule of law, the constitution,” she says. “They’re literally disappearing people from the streets. They arrested two people. We have no idea where they’re going.”

She thanked Tucson Police Department officers “for coming and taking care of the space. Making sure that everyone was safe once ICE left. ot the aggressors here, they arrived on the scene after ICE was already here and after there was a block in the street. I just want to make sure that that’s really clear.”

Grijalva says she went to the raid to protect the community she represents and ensure the public’s safety.

“I think it’s important for me to have eyes on what’s happening here and not just have it be stories through other people,” she says.

Photos and videos taken by Arizona Luminaria show some officers in combat gear with the words “ICE” or “Police HSI,” which stands for Homeland Security Investigations. The organization is a federal law enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security, as is ICE.

Shortly after the operation, Mayor Regina Romero and Vice Mayor Lane Santa Cruz released a statement condemning federal law enforcement actions and clarifying that Tucson Police Department officers were not involved.

“Today, federal officers conducted a raid in Tucson that rapidly escalated into violence against the public. We share the fears in our community created by President Trump’s immoral and inhumane immigration policies,” they wrote.

They added that it is common under the “Trump Administration, unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like “police” to purposefully confuse the public.”

“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,” Romero and Santa Cruz wrote.

Tucson Police Department officers were dispatched to the scene to close the street and “to keep our residents safe. They were not involved in the use of force against community members,” they wrote.

Romero and Santa Cruz encouraged people with photos or videos of federal officers’ actions to keep the documentation should there be an “investigation and follow-up” into the incident.

“We are committed to having a safe city where everyone’s rights are respected and legally enforced at all times,” they wrote.

Some community members gathered at the federal ICE field office on the south side of Tucson to continue protesting.

Tucson Police Captain Dominic Flores said about a dozen officers responded to the ICE office on Friday afternoon in response to the protest. By the time the officers arrived they encountered about 25 protesters, he added. But the group quickly dispersed after their arrival.

Moments before Tucson police arrived, protesters had been banging on the fence to the field office, located inside a strip mall complex.

Federal agents sprayed some of the protesters from inside the field office parking lot. But there were no major injuries.

In recent months, community members and journalists have documented officers from federal law enforcement agencies commonly using aggressive policing tactics during immigration sweeps and raids in cities across the nation.

The Trump administration has repeatedly defended its immigration operations and officers’ tactics. Following a DHS operation in New Orleans this week, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement that cities with sanctuary policies were being targeted.

“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” McLaughlin said.

Local voters in 2019 rejected an effort to make Tucson a sanctuary city. However, amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts, the advocacy organization Stand Up, Fight Back Tucson launched a petition earlier this year calling on Romero and city council members “to pass a resolution for Tucson to become a sanctuary city, acting to protect the rights of our citizens even in the face of federal retaliation.”

DHS has not said whether Operation Metro Surge is still ongoing in the Twin Cities, and the agency also has not said whether ICE detained any additional people beyond the dozen shown in the press release.","MINNEAPOLIS — On Monday, Rhoda Christenson said she received a call from a neighbor that her husband, Abdulkadir Sharif Abdi, had been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""I'm driving on the road, and she goes, 'Hey Rhoda, ICE is in your apartment.' I was silent for a minute,"" Christenson said in a phone interview. ""I was really, really upset, because I hadn't said goodbye. We didn't have a plan.""

Abdi, 47, was one of at least 12 people detained this week during ICE's ""Operation Metro Surge,"" including five from Somalia, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Abdi's wife said he was initially processed at the Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling but has since been transferred to a detention facility in Nebraska. The two have spoken on the phone every day this week and are actively searching for attorneys to represent him in immigration court, Christenson said.

In a press release, ICE described Abdi as a ""criminal illegal alien"" as well as a ""former member of the Gangster Disciples"" and a ""known current member of Vice Lord Nation,"" listing previous convictions of ""fraud, receiving stolen property, receiving a stolen vehicle, vehicle theft, and multiple probation violations."" However, Christenson pushed back against that characterization, saying that Abdi was not a current gang member and that he had turned his life around after getting sober 13 years ago.

Most recently, she said, he had been working for a small homeless shelter helping the Indigenous population in the Twin Cities. A former acquaintance also confirmed that Abdi worked at Park Avenue Center in Minneapolis for several years and played a key role in helping others find sobriety.

""He's devastated. He's just a simple guy that loves his home, and he works, and he really does help the community,"" Christenson said. ""We've been married 11 years. Has he ever been in trouble? No. Has he always checked in with ICE? Yes.""

Abdi's story has been documented extensively over the years in local media.

A Somali refugee who fled civil war in the 1990s, Abdi became involved in a gang after moving to Minnesota and committed several felonies. According to a Minnesota Star Tribune article written in 2019, those early convictions included car theft, receiving stolen property and drunk driving, leading to a deportation order in 2002. In 2018, during President Trump's first term, Abdi was again targeted for deportation, but a judge spared him that fate after the community rallied to save him.

Christenson said her husband was detained again this past Monday, the day before news broke of ICE's operations and the day before President Trump called Somali immigrants ""garbage"" in a cabinet meeting.

""My preference is that he stays here, one million percent, and that's his goal as well,"" Christenson said. ""Sometimes, when you're being detained, or detained several times, maybe you've given up or lost hope. But Abdi's goal is to stay here.""

Of the 12 people listed on the Homeland Security press release, five were from Somalia while the others were from Mexico and El Salvador. The agency indicated that all of them were in the country illegally, and listed offenses ranging from child sex abuse to domestic violence.

""We're going to enforce the laws of this country without apology,"" White House Border Czar Tom Homan said in an interview with Fox News, ""including in the Twin Cities.""

DHS has not said whether Operation Metro Surge is still ongoing in the Twin Cities, and the agency also has not said whether ICE detained any additional people beyond the dozen shown in the press release.

Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Minnesota, said the Somali American community remained on edge Friday.

""More people are looking out the windows. They're checking to see unmarked cars,"" Hussein said. ""It's obvious, the fear.""

Hussein said that many Somali youth have turned to humor during these tense days, given that the vast majority of the younger Somali-American population was born in the U.S. Hussein has also estimated that more than 90 percent of the 80,000 Somalis in Minnesota are either citizens or have a pathway to citizenship, putting the number of undocumented residents in the hundreds.

The big picture: Validating the president's executive order barring U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants from U.S. citizenship would overrule a right guaranteed by the 14th Amendment and upheld by SCOTUS over a century ago.

The belief that U.S.-born children of undocumented immigrants have no rights to citizenship was once a fringe idea, but Trump has brought the issue into the mainstream.

Catch up quick: Trump's executive order, which he signed on his first day in office, was quickly met with legal challenges, resulting in temporary blocks on the order nationwide.

A federal court in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction indefinitely blocking the order in July, with U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante ruling that it ""likely 'contradicts the text of the Fourteenth Amendment and the century-old untouched precedent that interprets it.'""

The Trump administration is asking that the Supreme Court overrule that injunction.

The other side: ""No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship,"" Cecillia Wang, the national legal director of the ACLU, said in a news release.

""For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress.""

""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""

Here's what to know about birthright citizenship and Trump's bid to end it:

What birthright citizenship is

Context: In the U.S., birthright citizenship is automatically granted to people born on U.S. soil, according to the 14th Amendment.

That's regardless of their parents' citizenship status.

The Amendment overturned the Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, which had found that Black people — free or enslaved — could never become U. S. citizens, and ""had no rights which the white man was bound to respect,"" according to Chief Justice Roger Taney.

The Amendment, which was ratified in 1868, nullified the decision by granting citizenship to all those born in the U.S., regardless of race.

There are two types in the U.S: jus sanguinis, ancestry-based citizenship, and jus soli, birthplace-based citizenship.

With jus sanguinis, children born outside of the U.S. to at least one parent who is an American citizen may be entitled to U.S. citizenship if they meet certain requirements.

Jus soli guarantees citizenship to almost everyone born in the U.S. However, there are some narrow exceptions, such as children born to diplomats or foreign heads of state.

The 1898 Supreme Court case that validated birthright citizenship

Zoom in: The Supreme Court's 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark ruled that the 14th Amendment guaranteed U.S. citizenship to any person born on U.S. soil.

It was a watershed moment for immigrants and descendants of immigrants in the U.S., namely Asian Americans.

The case concerned Wong Kim Ark, a man born in California to Chinese immigrants, who returned to the U.S. after visiting family in China and was refused re-entry.

John Wise, the collector of customs in San Francisco who controlled immigration, wanted a test case that would deny U.S. citizenship to ethnic Chinese residents and challenged that individuals born to immigrants were not citizens.

Zoom out: The court's decision led to a dramatic demographic transformation of the U.S.

It also gave protection to millions of Asian Americans and Latinos. Native Americans weren't granted citizenship through birth until 1924.

What the Trump administration is arguing

Birthright citizenship was added to the Constitution via the 14th Amendment following the Civil War, guaranteeing citizenship for newly freed enslaved people.

What they're saying: The Trump administration is arguing that birthright citizenship only applies to those people.

""The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to grant citizenship to newly freed slaves and their children—not to the children of temporary visitors or illegal aliens,"" the government argued in its petition for Writ of Certiorari before the court.

The White House, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Agriculture, Department of State and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

How many people would be affected by Trump's order?

In 2018, there were 4.4 million U.S.-born children with at least one parent who is an ""unauthorized immigrant,"" according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis.

In 2022, Congress defined unauthorized immigrants as ""noncitizens who generally have entered the United States without inspection, overstayed a period of lawful admission, or violated the terms of their admission.""

The number of children born to immigrants

In 2021, 21% of U.S. births were attributed to immigrant parents, the same share as in 2000, according to child advocacy group Annie E. Casey Foundation.

The per­cent­age has fluctuated slightly over the years, rising to 25% in 2006, but has since dropped back down to its pre­vi­ous level.

The likelihood of eliminating birthright citizenship

Michael LeRoy, an immigration law expert and professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told Axios' Avery Lotz that a Supreme Court ruling in Trump's favor would have far-reaching legal repercussions.

LeRoy said he couldn't predict how the Supreme Court would rule, but striking down a ""clear provision in an amendment based on an executive order"" could have implications for other parts of the Constitution.

""The day might come when a president of a different political party issues an executive order to limit or repeal the Second Amendment,"" he said.",https://images.axios.com/6hY13Paiw62XIhKbsym1CehVQFQ=/0x800:7680x5120/1366x768/2025/12/05/1764966116043.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 06:56:21.747181

The expansion would build on a travel ban already announced in June by the Republican administration, which barred travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries and restricted access to the U.S. for people from seven others. In a social media post earlier this week, Noem had suggested more countries would be included.

Noem, who spoke late Thursday in an interview with Fox News Channel host Laura Ingraham, would not provide further details, saying President Donald Trump was considering which countries would be included.

In the wake of the National Guard shooting, the administration already ratcheted up restrictions on the 19 countries included in the initial travel ban, which include Afghanistan, Somalia, Iran and Haiti, among others.

Ingraham asked Noem whether the travel ban was expanding to 32 countries and asked which countries would be added to the 19 announced earlier this year.

""If they don't have a stable government there, if they don't have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?"" Noem said.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment about when an updated travel ban might go into effect and which countries would be included in it.

Additions to the June travel ban are the latest in what has been a rapidly unfolding series of immigration actions since the shooting Thanksgiving week of two National Guard troops in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who emigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal, has been charged with first-degree murder after one of the two victims, West Virginia National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, died of wounds sustained in the Nov. 26 shooting. The second victim, Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, was critically wounded. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

The Trump administration has argued that more vetting is needed to make sure people entering or already in the U.S. aren't a threat. Critics say the administration is traumatizing people who've already gone through extensive vetting to get to the U.S. and say the new measures amount to collective punishment.

Over the course of a little more than a week, the administration has halted asylum decisions, paused processing of immigration-related benefits for people in the U.S. from the 19 travel ban countries and halted visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

On Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it was reducing the time period that work permits are valid for certain applicants such as refugees and people with asylum so they have to reapply more often and go through vetting more frequently.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108158628-17497511572025-06-12t175848z_296456179_rc251faa617t_rtrmadp_0_usa-trump-migration-los-angeles-noem.jpeg?v=1749751213&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-06 07:56:18.193442

Then: “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”

That bitter irony exposes the argument for what it really is: not about law or national security, but about ideology — white nativist ideology, which sees immigrants of color as inferior, unwelcome, un-American.

Maine’s Somali community: real people, real contributions

The state I call home, Maine, is itself home to a growing Somali community, centered in cities like Portland and Lewiston, Maine. According to the most recent census data, there are roughly 3,000 Somali-born residents in Maine, many of them living in Portland or Lewiston.

In these cities, Somali immigrants and their families have worked tirelessly to build lives, businesses, and communities. They established community centers, helped one another navigate social services, found jobs, paid taxes — and despite hateful myths and scapegoating, they have contributed concretely to the state’s social and economic life.

Take Safiya Khalid, who came to America as a seven-year-old refugee from Somalia, grew up in Lewiston, and in 2019 became the first Somali American elected to the Lewiston City Council — and the youngest ever.

Or consider Deqa Dhalac, born in Mogadishu, Somalia, she immigrated in the early 1990s, moved to Maine, worked as an interpreter and community organizer, and eventually became the first Somali-American mayor in U.S. history when she was elected mayor of South Portland in 2021. Today she serves in the Maine House of Representatives.

These are not political tokens. They are mothers, workers, organizers, people whose lives reflect the best of what America can be: a home for refugees, an opportunity for immigrants, a chance to rebuild, contribute, and belong.

Yet Trump’s words treat them like trash.

Why this scorched public rebuke matters

Because when a leader of a nation mocks entire communities as “garbage,” it emboldens racists, bigots, and xenophobes to act. His words are not benign, they are poisonous.

Because the president’s rhetoric attempts to strip Somali Americans, and all immigrants of color, of their identity, agency, and humanity, reducing them to stereotypes for political gain.

Because Maine’s Somali community — and communities like them across the country — deserve to be honored for their resilience, their contributions, and their humanity.

Because America was built on immigration. On hope. On the idea that people seeking refuge, safety, dignity should be welcomed, not vilified.

If Trump does not immediately retract his words, if the administration proceeds with raids, deportations, or policies targeting entire communities, it will be complicit in a moral atrocity.

We cannot stay silent. We cannot treat this as “just politics.” This is a moral crisis. And we — citizens, neighbors, voters — must speak out, demand accountability, and insist: immigrants are not garbage.

US Supreme Court (File photo)

The US Supreme Court has agreed to take up the White House’s appeal on President Trump’s January 20 executive order restricting birthright citizenship. The directive seeks to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the US if their mother is in a temporary lawful status (say H-4) or has no legal status, and if the father is not a US citizen or permanent resident. For now, the US government remains barred from enforcing the order under four separate lower-court injunctions. By approaching the Supreme Court, the Trump administration is aiming for a ruling that upholds its reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause and clears the way for the executive order to take effect. Oral arguments are expected in 2026 and according to immigration experts, a final ruling is likely in mid-2026.

‘What Sleepless Nights?’: Ramaphosa Slaps Back After Trump Shuts South Africa Out Of G20 | Watch

Immigrant-rights groups reacted sharply to this development, arguing that the Constitution is unambiguous on the question of citizenship. FWD.us president Todd Schulte, president at FWD.us, a bipartisan political organization, said ""The Trump administration’s continued, unlawful, and unconstitutional efforts to implement its executive order ending the 14th Amendment’s clear guarantee of birthright citizenship have continually been blocked by the courts. As the SC has decided to take up this case on the merits, the court should and must be as clear as the constitution: those born in the United States are citizens, and no president can overturn the constitution by executive order.” The litigation stems from the Trump administration’s sweeping reinterpretation of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment, overturning more than a century of settled law. Earlier TOI reporting had detailed how the order would bar automatic citizenship for babies born after February 19, 2025, if neither biological parent holds US citizenship or a green card. Immigration attorneys note that this would particularly impact families stuck in the decades-long employment-based green card backlog, many of whom are from India. If the order were to take effect, a child born to an H-1B worker and an H-4 dependent would inherit only the mother’s temporary status, not US citizenship. In more extreme cases, if the mother lacked legal status, the newborn would immediately be deemed unlawfully present, making the child vulnerable to removal under immigration law. Although the Supreme Court’s June 27 ruling narrowed the authority of lower courts to issue universal injunctions, those that are already granted continue to shield affected families until a final order is issued.

(Yes, I created this withAI and am amused that the strings are connected to the man despite what I thought was a clear instruction to connect them to the ladder.)

While we look ahead to 2026 – the 250th Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence – I’m also looking back at themes that emerged from conferences and gatherings this fall of 2025, including NCoC, the ListenFirst Coalition’s Bridging Summit, and ComNet (the Communications Network’s annual gathering), to name a few. There’s also overlap with Lumina’s day-long convening on the power of narrative, and I’ll share more on that valuable research separately.

That 26 themes emerged over a few months of gatherings leading into 2026 tells me these are lessons we need to be heeding right now. Where possible and appropriate, I cite sources and seek to give credit where it’s due. If I’ve misattributed anything, please tell me and I’ll fix it.

These themes apply to everyone who wants to help heal what ails us these days. I also include actionable tips for those in communications, storytelling for impact, and philanthropy.

1. KNOW YOUR OWN POWER: WE ARE THE ONES WE’VE BEEN WAITING FOR

In moments of uncertainty, it can be tempting to look outward for a savior – a brilliant leader, a rock-solid institution, or your favored political party. When it comes to the future of the United States, that’s a mistake.

Whether you call it a constitutional republic or a democracy, our real strength has never come from the top. It comes from ordinary people when we decide that our values, our voices, and our actions matter. However small those may seem, we have power.

After all, our form of government is not self-executing; it relies on millions of us choosing to stay informed, speak up, and act, even when it feels inconvenient or unpopular. (See #4.)

Many people don’t realize this but just over 100 years ago, the United States faced challenges like what we’re facing today. After the industrial revolution, millions were uprooted from farms and forced into factory towns and crowded cities, economic inequality widened, politics was openly corrupt, trust was deeply fractured, and racial terror intensified as Jim Crow laws codified segregation.

In short, the country was a mess. And you know what people did?

They rallied. They rebuilt. The early 1900s were when settlement houses began, offering job training, arts programs and political education. Service clubs like Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions began popping up all over the country, along with Elks, Moose, and Knights of Columbus, the NAACP and National Urban League, and League of Women Voters.*

We need to find that inside ourselves again today.

When we remember our own agency, our perspective shifts: we stop feeling like unbuckled passengers in a runaway political moment and start acting like the authors of our shared future that we are.

(*Give yourself the gift of reading David Eisner’s account of this era.)

2. IDENTITY SHIFT: WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A “CITIZEN”

The shift we need is more than just perspective; it’s our very identity. Alongside the myriad identities we hold – brother, niece, grandparent, trucker, nurse, artist, Coloradan, Minnesotan, Hispanic, Brazilian, Singaporean, Christian, Muslim, etc. – citizen should make our lists.

As Harry Boyte has warned, many have been lulled into seeing citizenship as a form of consumerism: citizens as passive recipients of services and benefits in the transactional marketplace of politics. Such impressions miss a world of opportunity, responsibility, and privilege.

If you hear “citizenship” as a legal status we hold, you’re not alone. It took me several months to broaden what I hear to include being a member of a nationwide community.

Today, I understand citizenship is a relationship - a reciprocal one - between each of us and the country we share.

Today, I hear “citizenship” as something we do.

Today, I hear “citizen” as an identity that can be a source of belonging, pride, and connection.

As former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter once said of the United States, “The highest office is the office of citizen.” Many of us have forgotten that we hold this office - or were never taught in the first place. While some would prefer that we all forget, we citizens do still have power – or “civic muscle,” as we say in Braver Angels.

The more we practice civic engagement and the more we “flex our civic muscle,” the more our identity will shift and we’ll experience ourselves as contributors to a shared stewardship - not spectators.

3. BEING AN ENGAGED CITIZEN IS MORE THAN VOTING

As Valerie Lemmie from the Kettering Foundation reminded us at NCoC, many mistakenly think being a citizen is only two things: voting and obeying laws. Thinking of completing your ballot as the only expression of civic power is like exercising once a year and assuming you’re fit. Similarly, not breaking laws is a low bar - the civic health equivalent of not having ice cream every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Given this shrunken view of citizenship, it’s no surprise much of our civic muscle has atrophied (especially when realities like dark money and gerrymandering hamstring our voting power).

But here’s good news: no matter our age or circumstances, we can build that muscle back. Citizenship is exercised daily, not annually. It is lived through community relationships, shared stewardship, and the ongoing work of strengthening our neighborhoods, communities, and country. We’ll detail how in our November webinar the day after Thanksgiving – and you don’t even need to get off the couch to join.

In using that muscle, you’ll feel your own power. As Wilk Wilkerson of Braver Angels explains, our sense of agency expands with action.

It's the IKEA effect on a bigger scale: we value what we help build.

4. BEING AN ENGAGED CITIZEN TAKES COURAGE

Just like working other muscles, using your civic muscle isn’t always comfortable. In fact, being involved in your community or in public life can be incredibly uncomfortable. It’s easier not to find out what people in your community care about, not ask questions at a town meeting, not to learn more about local issues, not to correct a piece of misinformation in a group chat, and not to talk to people who disagree with you. And it’s certainly easier not to put together a citizens gathering when you know someone who has threatened violence is going to show up:

All those examples of civic engagement take courage. And when we use that word, let’s be clear about two things:

Courage isn’t about being fearless, never feeling nervous, and always being certain. It’s about feeling the fear, nerves, and uncertainty and showing up anyway.

Courage isn’t just for superheroes. Yes, these are challenging times, but there is space – and need – for everyday people across the country to find the way to contribute their talent, time, and treasure to our shared future. (See #15.)

5. BEING AN ENGAGED CITIZEN ALSO INVOLVES INVISIBLE LABOR

If there’s a common thread through examples of engaged citizenship I’ve seen across the country, it’s how much happens behind the scenes. For every step forward, there are countless meetings. For every public meeting, there are months of coordination. For every 5-minute video, there’s a thousand-fold in planning and editing. For every one-hour webinar, there’s twenty-fold in preparation and follow-up.

At NCoC, Jillian Youngblood from Civic Genuis shared the example of the considerable volunteer time that goes into keeping one Girl Scout troop together. Personally, I know how many hours I volunteer with Braver Angels, and deeply appreciate the time volunteers across the country freely give to support the organization.

In addition to time for coordination, there’s a vital need for emotional intelligence and social awareness. The Needham Resilience Network is a great example of this EQ in action. As Dr. Nichole Argo shared at the Bridging Summit, prior to any gatherings, the Network has 1:1 conversations to ensure people feel prepared, safe, and welcome to join.

This is particularly important when some voices have never been heard, where people with important things to share aren’t yet seen as “leaders,” or where some may not feel like they belong.* Beyond that, there are the logistics of ensuring transportation, compensating time away from work, securing childcare and other considerations.

This isn’t the work that shows up in headlines or news clips, but it is the work that brings and holds communities together.

(*For more on these concepts, check out Nina Simon's book The Art of Relevance.)

6. WE CAN’T SOLVE PROBLEMS WITHOUT CARING AND CONNECTION

What fuels all of this work – visibile and invisible? Vinay Orekondy of Better Together America clearly answered that question at NCoC: We can’t solve problems if we aren’t talking to each other – and if we don’t care about each other.

Knowing our own power isn’t enough; we need to be connected to other people and care what happens to them. That may seem simple as you read this post, but consider how divisions across the country look – and sound – in practice. Odds are you’ve seen or heard examples of the 4Ds in comments, social posts, conversations, or elsewhere: dissociate; devalue; dehumanize; destroy.

This 4D slope begins with “they are different than us,” moves to “their difference makes them less valuable than us,” which leads to a profound lack of empathy, and ends with the ability to destroy others because, after all, they aren’t really human anyway.

I heard another form of this disconnect at the Principles First conference earlier this year, when a speaker wisely noted that rather than recognize the real problems people are facing, some treat those people as if they are the problem to be solved. That, too, is demoralizing and dehumanizing.

Surrounded by messages of “us v. them,” it can be tempting to sever connection to “them,” but that’s the civic equivalent of cutting off one of your own hands. Can you count the number of tasks in your day that would drastically change if you lost your left or right hand? When it comes to the civic body* as a whole, severing connection to “them” is severing the possibility of real, lasting solutions.

(*If you aren’t familiar with that phrase, or even if you think you are, you’ll want to hear Dr. Allison Ralph’s talk on the topic.)

7. POLITICAL ACTIVITY ≠ CIVIC HEALTH

So, let’s say your community is politically active. You’re off the civic couch, knocking on doors, pushing yard signs into the ground, and cheering for “your team” to head to the polls. You might assume you’re civically healthy. Unfortunately, that’s not necessarily true.

Recall the state of Georgia’s recent elections, both the special session Senate election and gubernatorial races. Well, as we discussed at NCoC, despite the enormous energy around those races, the state still ranks 48th in child well-being. This mismatch underscores a crucial truth: more political activity does not automatically translate to stronger communities.

As being a citizen is about more than voting (#3), civic health is about more than political campaigns and elections. Civic health addresses what’s important in people’s daily lives, e.g., education, safety, belonging, and economic opportunity.

8. FEDERAL DYSFUNCTION MEANS WE MUST LOOK LOCAL

To address those priorities, many look to “Uncle Sam” by default. But federal officials just set a record for the number of days the U.S. government shut down. Too many of those officials operate as if “community” means “my party.” Looking to Washington, D.C. to save us is like expecting five minutes a day with a broken shake weight to build all the muscle you’ll ever need.

Yes, there are glimmers of hope from D.C., but if we wait for Congress or the White House to model healthier behavior, we’ll be skeletons gathering dust on the civic couch.

Daniel Stid of the American Enterprise Institute offered a less grim perspective at NCoC, explaining that while our national attention fixates on Washington, our actual lives are decentralized: we’re governed and resourced at the state and local levels.

In other words, civic opportunity lives close to home, not far away.

9. BUT DON’T JUST LOOK LOCAL, TAKE ACTION!

Looking local doesn’t mean transferring unrealistic expectations of federal officials to local officials instead. We need to collectively DIY – or DIO? DO IT OURSELVES.

We know citizen-led action is do-able because it’s already being done. People across the country know local problems are easier to see, local people are easier to reach, and local solutions… well, they aren’t always easy, but they are possible. And, like a capstan pulling in the anchor that’s been slowing us down, each turn gets easier as more people lean in and momentum grows. (Ditto for the Civic Action-Engine!)

At the same time, that local focus doesn’t mean we ignore the rest of the country. This is the American experiment, remember? And like the 20 or so centers around the world that each had dozens of teams involved in the Human Genome Project, we need to stay connected across communities and states, share ideas, and build on each other’s successes.

We’re not choosing local over national; we’re starting where we have the most influence while seeing the bigger picture.

10. POLITICAL POLARIZATION – AND THE INDUSTRIAL OUTRAGE COMPLEX – IS HARMING ALL OF US

Among the many reasons I appreciate Braver Angels’ approach is the reminder that political disagreement on its own isn’t a problem; as “Reds” in particular know, healthy democracies depend on healthy debate. What’s hurting us now is how:

We’ve become so outraged at “the other side” that we won’t even speak to “them;”

People have productized that outrage; and

So many of us regularly consume that toxic product.

In our ComNet panel about Politics, Proximity, & Purpose: The Impact of Your Organization's Communication in a Polarized Landscape, Sandra Brownrigg, co-chair of the Southern Front Range Alliance of Braver Angels, cautioned attendees not to fall prey to the Industrial Outrage Complex, i.e., media outlets, influencers, and algorithms that benefit from keeping angry and fearful so we keep clicking, sharing, and staying tuned in. These conflict entrepreneurs generate a constant stream of content designed to make us feel threatened by people who think differently.

This content chips away at trust, makes compromise look weak, and convinces us “others” aren’t human – i.e., it wants us to forget #6. As conflict entrepreneurs rake in the money, we pay the price in strained relationships with family, friends, and neighbors. Being constantly primed for battle takes a toll on us mentally and physically and leaves us less safe and less effective.

Recognizing how the outrage machine works is an important flexing of civic muscle. That recognition doesn’t magically fix polarization, but we know we’re being played, we can make more intentional choices about where we get our information and how we engage with each other.

11. COMMUNICATORS, FOCUS ON SHARED INTERESTS AND VALUES

A basic rule of communication is “know your audience.” Communications professionals may be tempted to interpret that as segmenting audiences based on age, geography, income, gender, or any other number of demographics. Further, many default to sharing messages that matter to their organization’s leadership or funders.

Instead, as Sofi Andorsky of Third Plateau clearly reminded attendees at our ComNet panel, to be effective communicators and bridge-builders, we must speak to people based on how they relate to the world, not based on our internal priorities or what funders expect. To reach people, we need to focus on what matters to them and find their shared interests and values. (Braver Angels does this in Braver Arts and Braver Faith, for example.)

As the “Let’s Talk” exhibit at the National Liberty Museum in Philadelphia explains, we often share more values than we realize, we just rank them in a different order. For example, a message that leads with the value of care sounds different than leading with security, which sounds different than leading with freedom, even if all three values are widely shared. This fact was a relief to one panel attendee who lives in a “deep red” state and appreciated the “reminder that working together doesn’t have to mean abandoning what I believe.”

Knowing how people relate to the world isn’t as easy as sorting by zip code, which is why I’m already looking forward to our May 2026 webinar with Democracy 2076. Referencing research the organization has done with Harmony Labs, Dr. Melody Mohebi shared what sounds like the best online quiz ever: name your four favorite TV shows and we can tell you what you value. Intrigued? Join us in May.

12. AUTHENTIC COMMUNICATION > METRICS

Another common mistake in this era of fragmented information consumption is assuming big numbers indicate meaningful impact. A survey Sofi’s organization undertook found that communications teams across the country spend a lot of time communicating only to members of Congress and elected officials. The survey also revealed that many teams spend more time promoting programs than building a broader audience.

Translation: many in the depolarization/pro-democracy field are failing to reach the general public.

Even harsher translation: we’re talking to ourselves.

While metrics like earned media and shares on social have their place, we need to prioritize connection. Connection is what actually makes a difference, and authenticity begets connection. That can look like letting go of some control and letting people carry your message in their own words.

For example, when PopPop called for more civic engagement while floating down the James River with Team Democracy, he used his own words to speak to his own growing audience.

13. BUILD A BIG TENT/DON’T GO IT ALONE

Big problems can require big coalitions, which is why I’ve written before about a “big tent.”

Two things are crucial in constructing that tent: 1) define it by what we’re for, not what (or whom) we’re against; and 2) don’t ask people to leave our differences at the door – er, flap – of the tent.

The goal of the big tent must be a positive vision for our shared future. When the tent is built around a shared vision rather than a shared enemy, more people can see themselves in it. And when more people can see themselves in it, we’re far better equipped to tackle the challenges ahead. The most inspiring thinking I’ve seen recently is this honest, inclusive, and forward-looking paper by the U.S. Baha'i Office of Public Affairs:

NoA Concept note 2025.04.25.pdfDownload PDF • 83KB

When it comes to resisting the urge to work in isolated circles of people who already think exactly like we do, I’m grateful to Heidi and Guy Burgess, longtime scholars of conflict transformation and Co-Directors of the Conflict Information Consortium. (You'll want to subscribe to their Substack, Beyond Intractability.)

They remind us that large-scale social challenges can only be addressed through “massively parallel” efforts, i.e., many groups, with different perspectives and different strengths, all working toward a shared horizon. (Or third horizon, as some theories posit.)

In their view, the point isn’t to iron out every disagreement or erase ideological diversity; it’s to create enough connection, trust, and coordination that people can move in the same general direction without needing perfect alignment. And I’m grateful to Walt Roberts for hosting IMIP, the InterMovement Impact Project, his co-creator Caleb Christen, and all who participate with the goal of building that connection, trust, and coordination.

Media Miss by the right: Immigration judge fired by Trump admin files discrimination lawsuit

Former immigration judge Tania Nemer is suing the Trump administration, arguing she was wrongfully terminated because she is a dual citizen of Lebanon, the child of immigrants and had previously run for local office as a Democrat.

Nemer’s lawsuit claims her firing violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

She also filed a complaint with the Justice Department’s Equal Opportunity Office, but it was dismissed.

Right now there are 61 living Medal of Honor recipients, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society.

""Because now it doesn't matter you have papers, you speak English or you are a citizen, it's not enough.""","New Orleans' mayor-elect said Friday that a federal immigration crackdown launched this week is already causing harm as encounters between masked agents and residents, including some caught on video, has prompted public backlash.

Frustrated city officials pointed to the case of Jacelynn Guzman, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen who was walking back to her Louisiana home from a trip to the grocery store on Wednesday when a truck pulled up beside her and two masked federal agents approached her, according to security footage obtained by The Associated Press.

Guzman began running away as a second vehicle arrived and the agents pursued her down the sidewalk until she reached her family's home in Marrero, a neighbourhood across the Mississippi River from downtown New Orleans. Guzman's mother has lived there her entire life.

""We're legal, we are from here, born and raised,"" Guzman shouted back at the agents. ""Don't chase me, that is disgusting.""

Several hundred agents under Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino have converged on southeast Louisiana this week as part of an immigration enforcement operation seeking to arrest 5,000 people. The Department of Homeland Security has touted dozens of arrests with only limited details released. Many Hispanic residents have said they feel their community is at risk of being abused or detained by agents regardless of their legal status.

Alongside city council members, Democratic Rep. Troy Carter, Hispanic leaders and civil rights advocates, mayor-elect Helena Moreno expressed ""deep concern over recent actions"" by federal agents. She said the operation is causing harm — forcing businesses to shutter and workers to stay home out of fear of mass arrests.

While federal officials have repeatedly said the goal of the operation is to target dangerous criminals who entered the country illegally, Moreno argued ""that does not appear to be the case.""

Moreno said she is asking for regular public briefings from federal agencies, which she asks includes data on the stops, detentions, charges, warrants, outcomes and if any of the people detained have violent criminal histories.

""Without this full visibility into these enforcement actions, it is impossible to determine whether this particular operation is actually targeting the most dangerous offenders,"" Moreno said.

Guzman's stepfather, Juan Anglin, said he understood federal agents had a job to do but believed they were going about it in the wrong way.

Anglin heard his stepdaughter screaming outside and went out to confront the agents. He said she ran from the agents because she was a young woman surrounded by aggressive masked men.

""I thought she was going to be kidnapped, honestly,"" Anglin said. ""I thought somebody was going to hurt her.""

In response, the Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol had been searching for a ""criminal illegal alien previously charged with felony theft and convicted of illegal possession of stolen property.""

DHS said the agents ""encountered a female matching the description of the target"" and that agents identified themselves and left when they realized Guzman was not who they were seeking.

Anglin disputes the government's narrative and says she was stopped solely because of her appearance.

""Just because you look brown, you look Hispanic, you're going to get stopped,"" he said. ""Because now it doesn't matter you have papers, you speak English or you are a citizen, it's not enough.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/5cc05804-2a33-4c76-9b5a-fdb23ea042e8,1764984081567/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C209%2C3936%2C2214%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-12-06 02:56:42.556078

Derek Boe said he was leaving Don Taco at 2610 E. Fourth Plain Blvd., and as he started to drive away, he saw what he assumed was police. He parked on the side street, where he watched the incident unfold.

“You can just hear the guy screaming, and it sounded like he was either distraught or in extreme pain.

ICE changes

What we know:

Right now, ICE leases a building in downtown Milwaukee at Broadway and Knapp. It is on the MSOE campus.

The federal government has leased the building since 1999. In 2023, MSOE bought it. School officials said before then, the federal government said it was going to leave within months, but ended up staying.

MSOE officials say federal law requires they allow the federal government to stay. But that upset some students.

Plenty of opinions

What they're saying:

""It's very important for MSOE to recognize: they inherited this lease, they chose to accept this building, where they knew ICE was conducting enforcement removal operations out of it,"" said Conor Mika, MSOE student.

""ICE is not welcome in Wisconsin,"" said Steve Szymanski, a protester.

ICE responded to Friday's protest with the following statement:

""ICE respects the rights of individuals involved in peaceful protest. We remind the public that every day, the brave men and women of ICE work in communities across the country to uphold public safety and national security by apprehending gang members, foreign fugitives, and other dangerous criminal aliens illegally present in the United States. In recent months, ICE officers’ jobs have become even more dangerous as assaults on officers continue to increase. ICE personnel have been targeted with protest activity at their homes, along with doxxing, which has resulted in their personal information being made public. These actions have led to a more than 1,150% increase in assaults and an 8,000% increase in death threats against ICE law enforcement.""

MSOE said no one was available for an interview, but issued the following statement:

""When MSOE acquired the building at 310 E. Knapp St. on March 1, 2023, the property included an existing federal lease administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) that had been in place since September 16, 1999. Prior to the acquisition, discussions with the GSA indicated that the agency intended to vacate the space within several months. Based on that understanding, MSOE’s long-term plan was to renovate the facility for academic use following the termination of GSA’s tenancy.

""However, after the acquisition, the GSA elected to continue its occupancy beyond the original lease term while federal agencies determine their next steps. Under the terms of the inherited lease and federal authority allowing the government to require continued occupancy, MSOE is obligated to accommodate the tenant during this period.

""We understand that some members of our community hoped the space would already be available for university use. That remains our long-term goal. In the meantime, MSOE is fulfilling its legal responsibilities as landlord to the federal government.""

What's next for ICE?

Dig deeper:

ICE is planning a move to Milwaukee's northwest side. FOX6 News obtained city records revealed the city approved an occupancy certificate for ICE. For months, construction crews have transformed what was empty office space.

In the application for occupancy for Suite 100, the contractor listed the proposed days and hours as ""Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m."" The application said it will not be serving or preparing food.

Other records FOX6 News obtained show the proposed security fence with black privacy slats. The fence application said it will be 8 feet fall and have an anti-climb mesh.

Other city documents FOX6 News first obtained in January show a plan have been in the works since at least spring 2023. Those documents said the federal government will use the space for ""processing of immigrants."" It said that is for non-detained people checking in, as well as for processing detainees heading to detention facilities. The plans showed building security entrances typically used for transporting people in custody.

Federal immigration officials have arrested a visiting Harvard Law School professor from Brazil, who recently resolved allegations that he illegally fired a pellet gun outside a Brookline synagogue.

Carlos Portugal Gouvêa, 47, had his visa revoked Oct. 16 following his initial arrest, the Department of Homeland Security said in a news release. On Wednesday, nearly two months later, agents from the Boston U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office arrested Gouvêa again, and he agreed to leave the country voluntarily rather than be deported, according to DHS.

Per his Oct. 1 arrest report, Gouvêa told Brookline police he was using the pellet rifle to hunt rats near Temple Beth Zion, where worshippers were marking the start of Yom Kippur.

He was charged with illegally discharging a BB gun or air rifle, disorderly conduct, vandalism, and disturbing the peace, though prosecutors dropped the latter three charges last month as part of a plea agreement. For the remaining count, Gouvêa agreed to serve six months of pretrial probation and pay $386.59 in restitution after one of his pellets broke a window on a nearby parked car.

Gouvêa pleaded not guilty, and a spokesperson for the Norfolk County District Attorney’s Office previously told Boston.com no change of plea is taken in a case that is disposed through pretrial probation.

However, the DHS press release makes reference to a “guilty plea” and describes the incident as an “anti-Semitic shooting,” contrary to statements from local authorities and Temple Beth Zion leadership. In fact, synagogue leaders specifically wrote in an open letter that they had “no reason to believe this was an antisemitic event.”

“From what we were initially told by police, the individual was unaware that he lived next to, and was shooting his BB gun next to, a synagogue or that it was a religious holiday,” the letter states. “It was potentially dangerous to use a BB gun in such a populated spot, but it does not appear to have been fuelled [sic] by antisemitism.”

An attorney who previously represented Gouvêa also said earlier that the incident was “a total misunderstanding” and that the professor “categorically denies” his actions were motivated by antisemitism. Further, a Harvard Chabad rabbi told attendees at an October event that Gouvêa’s wife and children are Jewish, The Harvard Crimson reported.

Still, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on the antisemitism claims.

“There is no room in the United States for brazen, violent acts of anti-Semitism like this,” she said in a statement. “They are an affront to our core principals as a country and an unacceptable threat against law-abiding American citizens. We are under zero obligation to admit foreigners who commit these inexplicably reprehensible acts or to let them stay here.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and commit anti-American and anti-Semitic violence and terrorism should think again,” McLaughlin added. “You are not welcome here.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/https___arcmigration-prdweb.bostonglobe.com_r_Boston_2011-2020_2020_01_09_BostonGlobe.com_Metro_Images_Colleges_Slavery_Reparations_71541-6761825811db6-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 09:57:03.522726

Lake Street Church of Evanston is displaying the scene outside on its grounds.

Baby Jesus is wrapped in a thin blanket resembling aluminum foil, which the church said is a reference to the emergency blankets used in detention facilities.

Masked centurions, officers in the ancient Roman army, are depicted in sunglasses and green vests labeled “ICE.”

It also shows Mother Mary wearing a respirator mask “to protect herself from tear gas,” according to the church. Joseph is also masked.

In a Facebook post last week, the church said the installation reimagines the Nativity as a scene of forced family separation, drawing parallels between the Holy Family’s refugee flight and modern immigration detention practices.

“This installation reimagines the nativity as a scene of forced family separation, drawing direct parallels between the Holy Family’s refugee experience and contemporary immigration detention practices,” the post reads.

“‘The Holy Family were refugees. This is not political interpretation, this is the reality described in the stories our tradition has told and retold for millenia,’” it continues. “‘By witnessing this familiar story through the reality faced by migrants today, we hope to restore its radical edge, and to ask what it means to celebrate the birth of a refugee child while turning away those who follow in that child’s footsteps.’”

The church, which also hangs Black Lives Matter banners and social justice banners, said the zip ties on the baby’s wrists directly reference children who were zip-tied by agents during a raid on a Chicago apartment building earlier this year.

The church claims most residents were US citizens in that incident. It called the display a stark reminder that “enforcement terror does not discriminate by documentation status.”

In recent days, it appears Mary’s gas mask has been removed, while the zip ties have been cut from the baby Jesus’ hands.

The Facebook post and display drew both criticism and praise from commenters.

“Joseph and Mary went to Bethlehem because they had to return to Joseph’s ancestral home to be counted in the census,” one person wrote. “So Trump is just following that example and sending people HOME per a legal requirement. If they want to immigrate LEGALLY, they can fill out the paperwork before they leave and self–deport.”

“Blasphemy!!! Father forgive them, they know not what they do,” another wrote.

A different commenter argued the church had misinterpreted the Bible: “The Holy Family were refugees… do you guys read the Bible? Mary and Joseph travelled as required by Caesar’s census requirement, NOT refugees.”

Others supported the display, with one user calling it “very powerful art.”

“Out of all the tragedy affecting my community, I’m glad powerful art is being used to address the issues that trolls make fun of,” one person wrote. “Hoping more displays like this come out to trigger the masses in a positive way.”

CJ Doyle, head of the Catholic Action League, said he was furious about this year’s scene after receiving complaints from local residents.","Leaders at St. Susanna’s Parish said they will keep the “ICE was here” sign in a half-empty manger outside of the church despite condemnation from some catholic leaders and community members.

Statues of Jesus, Mary and Joseph are missing from the Dedham church’s annual nativity scene this year. In their place was the sign about ICE, implying that immigration agents had taken the religious icons.

Below it was a smaller sign that read “The Holy Family is safe in our Church ... If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.”

Father Stephen Josoma said he chose to focus the nativity on immigration after speaking with several of the refugee families the church has worked with in the past few years. Several of his congregants, who come from countries like Honduras, Guatemala and Afghanistan, expressed fear about what the stepped-up deportations could mean if they were sent back to the violence they fled.

“These are folks who carry a lot of scars with them. Some of them are physical scars, but most are emotional. They’ve seen their folks killed in front of them,” Josoma said.

He said the display is meant to show “the context Christmas is happening in this year,” adding that current immigration policies feel “brutal” and threaten the status of people who have already settled in the U.S.

The Archdiocese of Boston on Friday called the sign and missing figures a “politically divisive display” and said the parish should restore the créche to its “proper sacred purpose.”

“The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,” the statement read.

The Archdiocese also said St. Susanna did not request or receive permission for the display and said church norms “prohibit the use of sacred objects” for purposes other than worship.

A spokesperson for the Archdiocese, Terrence Donilon, pointed WBUR to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ long-standing statements on immigration, which call for more humane treatment of migrants — especially in detention — while also recognizing a country’s right to regulate its borders. The bishops oppose mass deportation and condemn dehumanizing rhetoric toward both immigrants and law enforcement.

This isn’t the first time St. Susanna’s has clashed with critics over its nativity messaging. For more than a decade, the parish has turned the display into a form of political art, tackling issues like gun control, climate change and other immigration policies.

In 2018, under Josoma’s leadership, the nativity featured a baby Jesus figure in a cage, protesting the Trump administration’s policy that separated immigrant families at the border.

CJ Doyle, head of the Catholic Action League, said he was furious about this year’s scene after receiving complaints from local residents. He accused the parish and Josoma of creating “sacrilegious” political theater.

“This is a case of a dissident priest who has a long history of these crackpot, publicity stunts,” Doyle said. “He’s politicizing Christmas, he’s exploiting the Holy Family, he’s trivializing it and he’s using his position as a pastor to promote his left-wing political ideology.”

Josoma rejected those criticisms, and said this is exactly the kind of moral witness churches should take up.

“I think the role of all churches is to speak out on issues, that’s what the Gospel is about,” he said. “How we treat the least among us is how we ultimately treat Christ.”

He said religious art is meant to provoke reflection, even discomfort, and that critics’ anger toward the display says more about people’s priorities than the installation itself.

On the morning of Thanksgiving, ICE agents detained a Vancouver father, Luis Ixchop, while he was out delivering food with his partner.","VANCOUVER, Wash. — A Vancouver family worries their loved one was run over by federal agents as they arrested him in the middle of a busy street on Thursday.

Cell phone video captured by a driver stuck in traffic behind the immigration officers partially captured the incident. It happened on East 4th Plain Boulevard and Z Street.

Carmen Paniagua and her husband, Ulysses, told KGW that the man seen being detained in the video is Ulysses' brother, 27-year-old Jose Paniagua Calderon. They were told Thursday that Jose's car had been found somewhere in town by a family friend.

""My husband came over here to double check that it was his car, and that's how we confirmed that it was him because he had a little work hat and everything,"" Carmen Paniagua said. ""So, he confirmed that it was, and then, I don't know where, we started seeing the videos that were circulating on the Internet.""

Paniagua said that Calderon had just gotten off of work when he was surrounded in traffic by federal agents. They broke his car window, dragged him to the ground, and one of the agents then got into the driver's seat of his car.

In a video circulating on social media and provided to KGW, multiple SUVs are stopped in the middle of a busy street. Several masked federal law enforcement officers can be seen standing around.

At first, Calderon can't be clearly seen, as he is seated on the pavement in between two vehicles. One of the officers can be seen to get in one of the vehicles and begin to drive it forward. Then, Calderon starts screaming.

Editor's note: The video embedded below is graphic and may be difficult for some viewers.

""You could see how the car goes like up and down on his leg, and then you just hear him screaming and in so much pain,"" said Paniagua. ""Like, when we heard his scream, that broke all of us — and I'm pretty sure that even the people that are not his family felt bad.""

Seconds later, officers pick Calderon up and put him in the back of the other vehicle. It's at this point that his face and body become visible.

""They didn't even give him the medical attention that he needed right there and then, because in the video you could clearly see how his leg is twisted,"" Paniagua said. ""So we honestly think it might have broke or something.""

Paniagua said Calderon was quickly taken to the ICE detention facility up in Tacoma, and they worry that he still has not received proper medical care.

""They're abusing their power, they're just being racist — they're treating us like animals,"" Paniagua said. ""We want this to be known because we want justice for him. We want them to be accountable for what they did to him, because no human should be treated worse than an animal.""

The Vancouver Police Department initially indicated that they'd heard about the incident, but no one had filed a report. Late Friday afternoon, VPD put out a statement saying they'd be taking a closer look.

""The Vancouver Police Department learned of this incident via a video that appeared to be taken with a cell phone of the ICE arrest that was subsequently circulated by community members. The video appears to show that the arrested person’s foot may have been struck by an ICE agent’s vehicle during the arrest.

""Based on the information regarding a vehicle that is alleged to have struck a person within the city limits of Vancouver, per our policy, the Vancouver Police Department will be conducting a traffic investigation to determine the facts.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not yet responded to a request for information.

On the morning of Thanksgiving, ICE agents detained a Vancouver father, Luis Ixchop, while he was out delivering food with his partner. Ixchop has high blood pressure, and his partner said that he'd been hospitalized after the arrest.

In a statement they released later regarding Ixchop's arrest, ICE said in part:

""It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody and provides each detainee with medical, dental, and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.""

The Paniaguas said that they didn't want to talk about the details of Calderon's legal status, but they said he'd been in Vancouver for about five years and worked to provide for his elderly parents in Mexico.

""He doesn't have a crime; he doesn't have bad habits. He's a guy who his hobby is going to church and playing guitar. He wasn't doing anything bad,"" said Paniagua.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/a90c9637-a214-4027-85f8-a6848efd15c9/20251206T011519/a90c9637-a214-4027-85f8-a6848efd15c9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 01:57:49.150915

Adelita Grijalva of Arizona said she was pepper-sprayed and ""pushed around"" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during a raid at a Tucson restaurant on Friday.

In a video statement posted on X, Grijalva said it happened as local Tucsonans gathered to stop a group of roughly 40 ICE agents, many of them masked and in several vehicles, stationed in the middle of a street near a restaurant she frequents.

Grijalva said she was ""sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others."" She added, ""I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress.""

Department for Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied Grijalva's account, saying instead that the congresswoman was ""in the vicinity"" of another person who was pepper-sprayed as they obstructed and assaulted law enforcement.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel. But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper-sprayed,"" McLaughlin said.

“Presenting one’s self as a 'member of Congress' doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement,"" she added.

McLaughlin also said that two law enforcement officers ""were seriously injured"" during the incident.

A spokesperson for Tucson Police Department, Ofc. Frank Magos, said that ICE had served a federal search warrant at Taco Giro, a local restaurant on Friday morning, and ""federal tactical resources responded to extract federal investigative special agents from the area where community had gathered.""

Federal agents deployed ""chemical munitions"" and called for emergency support from Tucson police to make their way out of the area, Magos said.

Tucson Mayor Regina Romero and Vice Mayor Lane Santa Cruz said in a joint statement Friday that federal special agents had conducted a raid in the city that ""rapidly escalated into violence against the public.""

""Under the Trump administration, unidentified federal agents often intentionally wear clothing with vague words like ‘police’ to purposefully confuse the public,"" the pair of city officials said.

""Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,"" they added.

Grijalva said that she identified herself as a member of Congress, and saw ""people directly sprayed,"" including press and members of her staff.

""The biggest problem that we have in this community is that we have Trump that has no regard for any due process, the rule of law, the Constitution,"" Grijalva said. ""They're literally disappearing people from the streets.""

NBC News has reached out to Grijalva’s office for further comment.

Grijalva was sworn in last month, more than seven weeks after winning a special election for the seat of her late father, Rep.

Those standards were last revised in 2024 during the Biden administration, after Census Bureau research and public discussion.
Calabria's comments mark the first public confirmation that Trump officials are considering the possibility of not using the latest racial and ethnic category changes and other revisions.
The first Trump administration stalled the process for revising the racial and ethnic data standards in time for the 2020 census.
Advocates of the changes, however, see the new categories and other revisions as long-needed updates to better reflect people's identities.","A Trump administration official on Friday signaled a potential rollback of the racial and ethnic categories approved for the 2030 census and other future federal government forms.

Supporters of those categories fear that any last-minute modifications to the U.S. government's standards for data about race and ethnicity could hurt the accuracy of census data and other future statistics used for redrawing voting districts, enforcing civil rights protections and guiding policymaking.

Those standards were last revised in 2024 during the Biden administration, after Census Bureau research and public discussion.

A White House agency at the time approved, among other changes, new checkboxes for ""Middle Eastern or North African"" and ""Hispanic or Latino"" under a reformatted question that asks survey participants: ""What is your race and/or ethnicity?"" The revisions also require the federal government to stop automatically categorizing people who identify with Middle Eastern or North African groups as white.

But at a Friday meeting of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics in Washington, D.C., the chief statistician within the White House's Office of Management and Budget revealed that the Trump administration has started a new review of those standards and how the 2024 revisions were approved.

""We're still at the very beginning of a review. And this, again, is not prejudging any particular outcome. I think we just wanted to be able to take a look at the process and decide where we wanted to end up on a number of these questions,"" said Mark Calabria. ""I've certainly heard a wide range of views within the administration. So it's just premature to say where we'll end up.""

OMB's press office did not immediately respond to NPR's request for comment.

Calabria's comments mark the first public confirmation that Trump officials are considering the possibility of not using the latest racial and ethnic category changes and other revisions. They come amid the administration's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, a push to stop producing data that could protect the rights of transgender people and threats to the reliability of federal statistics.

In September, OMB said those Biden-era revisions ""continue to be in effect"" when it announced a six-month extension to the 2029 deadline for federal agencies to follow the new standards when collecting data on race and ethnicity.

Calabria said the delay gave agencies more time to implement the changes ""while we review.""

The first Trump administration stalled the process for revising the racial and ethnic data standards in time for the 2020 census.

The ""Project 2025"" policy agenda released by The Heritage Foundation, the conservative, D.C.-based think tank, called for a Republican administration to ""thoroughly review any changes"" to census race and ethnicity questions because of ""concerns among conservatives that the data under Biden Administration proposals could be skewed to bolster progressive political agendas.""

Advocates of the changes, however, see the new categories and other revisions as long-needed updates to better reflect people's identities.

""At stake is a more accurate and deeper understanding of the communities that comprise our country,"" says Meeta Anand, senior director of census and data equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. ""I am not concerned if it's reviewed in an honest attempt to understand what the process was. I am concerned if it's for a predetermined outcome that would be to ignore the entire process that was done in a very transparent manner.""

Grijalva, Arizona’s first Latina congresswoman, has been a fierce critic of immigration enforcement activity in her district.","Arizona’s U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva was involved in a clash with federal agents during a protest of immigration raids in west Tucson Friday, during which she claims she was hit with pepper spray.

According to a spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency partnered with the Internal Revenue Service to carry out as many as 16 warrants in southern Arizona in a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations.” In videos posted to social media by community advocates, several masked federal agents in tactical gear can be seen near the westside location of popular Mexican seafood and grill restaurant Taco Giro.

The raids prompted a protest and federal agents deployed tear gas and pepper spray against the crowd. The Arizona Daily Star reported that multiple employees who live near the west Tucson restaurant were detained. At least one protester was among those taken into custody by federal agents. AZ Family reported that Taco Giro locations in north Tucson, Casa Grande and Vail were also targeted. ICE spokesman Fernando Burgos-Ortiz confirmed to the Arizona Mirror that multiple people were arrested, but didn’t clarify how many or confirm claims that agents had pepper-sprayed a sitting U.S. Congresswoman.

Tricia McLaughlin, the spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, dismissed Grijalva’s account. McLaughlin accused Grijalva of hindering the work of federal agents and appeared to question Grijalva’s claim that she was pepper-sprayed by highlighting her lack of visible physical reaction in the video.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” McLaughlin wrote. “But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement. In fact, 2 law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that (Grijalva) joined. Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Tucson Sentinel reporter Paul Ingram, who was on-the-ground covering the ICE raid and protest, reported that federal agents shot pepper spray into his face and eye, even though he was clearly identified as a member of the press.

A video from Univision reporter Óscar Gómez shows federal agents shooting pepper spray directly into the faces of protesters, with Grijalva in close proximity. An agent is then seen coming after Gómez directly, covering his camera with pepper spray, even as Gómez appeared to be backing away.

The large-scale raid of several Taco Giros in Southern Arizona is the second time this year a restaurant chain was the subject of an investigation by Homeland Security Investigations, a division within ICE, that ensnared multiple employees who lack legal immigration status.

In July, federal agents raided Colt Grill BBQ and Spirits locations in Northern Arizona. The operation was the culmination of a multi-year investigation into a money laundering and labor exploitation scheme. Along with the husband-and-wife owners of the Northern Arizona restaurants, and two undocumented immigrants who were involved in recruiting and exploiting other immigrant workers, several more undocumented employees were also arrested.

In a video posted to her X account, Grijalva described as many as 40 agents gathered at the westside location she visited with her staff for lunch, and said that she was treated with hostility even after identifying herself as a member of Congress.

“I was here, this is like the restaurant I come to literally once a week, and was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent, pushed around by others when I literally was not being aggressive,” she said. “I was asking for clarification which is my right as a member of Congress.”

A video of the incident posted to Grijalva’s social media accounts shows a federal agent spraying several bursts of pepper spray directly at demonstrators in the street, close to where Grijalva is standing. Grijalva’s staffer jumps in front of her. Coughing can be heard offscreen. Later in the video, a pepper ball appears to explode inches from Grijalva’s feet as she walks away.

Grijalva, Arizona’s first Latina congresswoman, has been a fierce critic of immigration enforcement activity in her district. Earlier this week, she publicly condemned a Border Patrol raid of a humanitarian group’s migrant aid station in the desert on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, criticizing it as an example of President Donald Trump’s “cruel (and) unconstitutional” mass deportation agenda.

In a statement issued shortly after she said she was pepper-sprayed, Grijalva said her office was working to get more information on Friday’s immigration arrests.

“Our residents deserve to know whether these raids are targeting genuine public safety threats – or law-abiding neighbors who have called our communities home for decades,” she wrote. “ICE has become a lawless agency under this Administration – operating with no transparency, no accountability, and open disregard for basic due process.”

While Trump administration officials have time and again emphasized their intent to detain the “worst of the worst”, many of the immigrants that ICE has arrested during Trump’s second term have no criminal record. A June survey of people in immigration detainment facilities at the time found that nearly half, 47%, lacked any criminal history and fewer than 30% of them had been convicted of crimes.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, the state’s top legal officer, denounced the incident on social media. In a post on X, the Democrat, who has long criticized Trump’s immigration enforcement tactics, called the incident “unacceptable and outrageous.”

“Enforcing the rule of law does not mean pepper spraying a member of Congress for simply asking questions,” Mayes wrote. “Effective law enforcement requires restraint and accountability, not unchecked aggression.”

Grijalva voiced concern for how federal officials interact with people who don’t have her authority, in light of how she was mistreated on Friday.

“While I am fine, if that is the way they treat me, how are they treating other community members who do not have the same privileges and protections that I do?” she questioned, in her written statement.

Lexi Celis, a U.S. citizen, said her husband’s arrest has devastated their family.

“For all the people who think that they’re just getting criminals, I am an example of them tearing our family apart,” Lexi Celis said.

She never imagined anything like this would happen to her family.

“I just feel betrayed. I feel no U.S. citizen should have to go through this,” she said.

Jair Celis was at the final step of his immigration process when ICE detained him at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Salt Lake City on Tuesday.

“We’ve tried to do everything the right way, we have, and he’s not here,” Celis said.

Armstrong, representing the family, argued that Celis’ case contradicts the federal government’s stated focus on arresting only dangerous individuals.

“Jair’s case shows that the rhetoric that we’re going after the worst of the worst, that’s not true,” he said. “Lexi and JR have been married, lawfully married, and have filled out the proper paperwork to apply for residency for Jair. He entered when he was a young child on a visa, and so he had a legal entry into the country, which allows him to adjust status here in the United States.”

2 News reached out to both USCIS and ICE for comment and asked why Celis was detained. But the agencies did not respond in time for this report.

Armstrong said ICE has the authority to arrest anyone without lawful status, even inside a USCIS office.

2 News asked, under what circumstances can an applicant be detained at an interview?

Armstrong said, “Any applicant who's out of status, this is any person, whether they're applying at USCIS, or they're just out on the street. If they are not in a legal status to be here.”

Armstrong believes in the Jair Celis case, “It’s such a colossal waste of U.S. government taxpayer money, and the ICE agents’ time and effort to take into custody somebody who otherwise would have received a green card or been approved for a green card that exact day.”

Immigration attorneys said they believe arrest numbers may rise.

“We believe the presidential administration is putting heavy pressure on ICE in Utah,” said Armstrong.

“I believe it is to sow fear among the immigrant community,” he added.

However, there are some protections for certain immigrants depending on their status.

“If you have DACA or you have TPS, which is Temporary Protected Status, or you are awaiting a hearing on an asylum, and you have a work permit, you do have protections,” he explained.

As for Lexi Celis, she said she just wants her husband home.

“I want him to be home before Christmas.”

On Dec. 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to President Trump’s executive order limiting birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment

Birthright Citizenship Case

On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to President Trump’s Executive Order 14,160, which seeks to limit birthright citizenship. The order provides that children born in the U.S. to parents who are either unlawfully present or temporarily in the country would not be recognized as U.S. citizens.

The consolidated cases — including Trump v. Washington and Trump v. CASA, Inc. — ask the Court to determine whether this policy complies with the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment and 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a). Lower courts previously blocked the order, finding it inconsistent with longstanding interpretations of the Constitution.

Looking Ahead

Until the Court issues a ruling, current law remains unchanged: children born in the U.S. are citizens regardless of parental status.

Background Information

President Trump issued Executive Order 14,160 on January 20, 2025, seeking to restrict birthright citizenship by excluding children born in the U.S. to parents who are undocumented or temporarily present. Federal courts quickly blocked the order, extending injunctions throughout 2025 while litigation proceeded. In September 2025, the Supreme Court issued a separate ruling clarifying the limits of nationwide injunctions, which shaped how lower courts can block federal policies in immigration cases.

Instead, the judge rejected a government request to dismiss a class-action challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.
Judge Sooknanan found that the law did not give the administration the power to hold detainees designated for deportation at offshore military bases.

But Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., stopped short of ordering Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, to shut down the detention operation there.

Instead, the judge rejected a government request to dismiss a class-action challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union. A lawyer for the A.C.L.U. said the legal group would soon seek a closure order.

Judge Sooknanan found that the law did not give the administration the power to hold detainees designated for deportation at offshore military bases.

While successive administrations have for decades housed migrants at Guantánamo who have been intercepted at sea trying to reach the United States, Judge Sooknanan found that never before had the U.S. government used the base to hold people being deported from the United States.

The White House began using Guantánamo as a way station for deportees in February after an order from President Trump to prepare the base to hold up to 30,000 migrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have held about 710 detainees there, all men, with support from hundreds of U.S. soldiers and Marines.

No migrants have been there since mid-October, when the department sent 18 men with final deportation orders from the base to El Salvador and Guatemala, then ceased operations before Hurricane Melissa.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a question on whether the administration would still be sending immigration detainees who are designated for deportation to the base. The Justice Department also did not respond to a request for a comment.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U., said his group would now try to stop that for good.

“The court squarely rejected the Trump administration’s legal claim that Congress gave it the extraordinary power to detain immigrants in military bases overseas,” Mr. Gelernt said. “We will now move promptly to end the policy based on this legal ruling.”

The A.C.L.U. challenged the policy using the names of two men who were deported through the base, and framing it as a class-action lawsuit. They argued that detainees are held there in a form of limbo between deportation and detention on U.S. soil, where they have greater rights.

At a hearing in October, Judge Sooknanan pointedly asked a government lawyer whether it was the Trump administration’s position that it could house detainees designated for deportation at any overseas base.

“I don’t see why not,” replied August E. Flentje, a senior Justice Department lawyer.

Judge Sooknanan’s ruling found that “before the Guantánamo-detention policy at issue here, the United States had never run a detention facility outside of the United States for individuals subject to removal orders.” She added, “The unprecedented nature of this claim of authority is another clue that the reading of the statutory scheme is wrong.”

She ordered government and A.C.L.U. lawyers to discuss next steps at a status conference on Thursday.

Judge Sooknanan also faulted the structure at Guantánamo, which for a time held migrants profiled as “low threat” in a prison that formerly held suspected Qaeda members.

For the most part, the low-threat detainees were held in a more communal barracks facility. But some were consolidated into the prison earlier this year during a water outage in the area of the barracks.

The judge opened her decision by calling the military installation with more than 4,000 residents, including Navy families, “the site of one of our country’s most notorious detention facilities.”

“Over two decades ago, it was opened to hold suspected terrorists in the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001,” she wrote. “Since then, Guantánamo has been synonymous with pervasive mistreatment and indefinite detention.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/02/07/multimedia/05dc-gitmo-migrants/dc-gitmo8-tvlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 21:56:26.178972

Adelita Grijalva said Friday she was pepper-sprayed and pushed around during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Tucson, Arizona, a claim that the Department of Homeland Security swiftly disputed.
“I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said.
But they’re not true.
She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.
“In fact, 2 law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that @Rep_Grijalva joined.","Rep. Adelita Grijalva said Friday she was pepper-sprayed and pushed around during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Tucson, Arizona, a claim that the Department of Homeland Security swiftly disputed.

The Arizona Democrat said in a video on X the incident occurred near a restaurant she frequents and that she came upon a scene of “maybe 40 ICE agents, most of them masked, in several vehicles” who had been “stopped” in the street by people who she said “were afraid they were taking people without due process.”

Grijalva said she “was sprayed in the face by a very aggressive agent” and “pushed around by others,” even though she said she had not been aggressive. “I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokeswoman, said on X in a response to the congresswoman’s video that the claims are “not true.”

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel. But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who *was* pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin said.

“In fact, 2 law enforcement officers were seriously injured by this mob that @Rep_Grijalva joined. Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement.”

Speaking to CNN’s Laura Coates later Friday evening, Grijalva dismissed McLaughlin’s account, saying, “It’s convenient to them to make it seem as if I was doing anything other than inquiring about what was happening.”

Earlier Friday, Grijalva posted a second video to X that shows uniformed officials spraying into a crowd of people, including what appear to be protesters, Grijalva and her staff. Grijalva can be seen saying, “You guys need to calm down and get out.”

The congresswoman said in the first video she posted that once she introduced herself as a member of Congress, she assumed it would have been calmer, “but there was literally only one person that was trying to speak to me in any kind of civil tone, and everyone else was being rude and disrespectful.”

“I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else,” she said.

Grijalva denounced the Trump administration’s handling of immigration enforcement.

“I think that this is one of the problems – the biggest problem that we have in this community is that we have Trump that has no regard for any due process, the rule of law, the Constitution,” Grijalva said in the video. “They’re literally disappearing people from the streets. They arrested two people. We have no idea where they’re going.”

By the time she arrived, she said, the protesters had “stopped” a squadron of dozens of mostly masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
The protesters, Grijalva said, were “afraid that they were taking people without due process”.
“When I presented myself as a Member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she wrote.
In a statement, DHS said immigration agents’ actions were not aimed at the representative.","Adelita Grijalva, an Arizona congressperson, said she was “sprayed in the face” during a protest against a federal immigration raid at a Mexican restaurant in Tucson on Friday.

In a video filmed after the incident, Grijalva said she joined a group of protesters assembled outside Taco Giro, a “small mom-and-pop” restaurant in Tucson Grijalva said she visits weekly. By the time she arrived, she said, the protesters had “stopped” a squadron of dozens of mostly masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The protesters, Grijalva said, were “afraid that they were taking people without due process”.

A second video shared by Grijalva’s official account on social media shows a chaotic standoff between federal agents in tactical gear and protesters carrying anti-ICE signs. In the footage, Grijalva, a progressive Democratic representative, who has been sharply critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy, can be seen approaching the officers, as an agent sprays an orange chemical in the direction of the protesters alongside her. She then urges the officers to “calm down” and “get out” as she coughs. The agent holding a spray can orders the group to “get out of the way” as protestors yell.

In a video clip taken from another angle, a projectile lands behind Grijalva, producing a cloud at the her feet as she steps toward an officer.

“When I presented myself as a Member of Congress asking for more information, I was pushed aside and pepper sprayed,” she wrote.

In a statement, DHS said immigration agents’ actions were not aimed at the representative.

“If her claims were true, this would be a medical marvel,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said. “But they’re not true. She wasn’t pepper sprayed. She was in the vicinity of someone who was pepper sprayed as they were obstructing and assaulting law enforcement.”

McLaughlin said two law enforcement officers were “seriously injured” during the clash.

“Presenting one’s self as a ‘Member of Congress’ doesn’t give you the right to obstruct law enforcement,” she added, promising “more information forthcoming”.

In a statement, Fernando Burgos, an ICE spokesperson, said special agents as well as officers from the agency’s homeland security investigations were “executing 16 search warrants” across southern Arizona as part of a “years-long investigation into immigration and tax violations”. Multiple individuals were taken into custody during the operation, he said.

In a video filmed shortly after the incident, Grijalva, still coughing, says she arrived on the scene because she believed it was “important for me to have eyes on what’s happening here”.

“I literally was not being aggressive, I was asking for clarification, which is my right as a member of Congress,” she said, adding: “I just can only imagine if they’re going to treat me like that, how they’re treating everybody else.”

Grijalva and other local officials praised the Tucson police department for helping to calm the situation.

In a joint statement, Regina Romero, the Tucson mayor and Lane Santa Cruz, the vice-mayor, both Democrats, said the enforcement operation in Tucson had “rapidly escalated into violence against the public”.

“Their disproportionate use of force, smoke grenades and pepper balls against the public, including our own Representative Adelita Grijalva, is not justified and cannot be tolerated,” they wrote, encouraging bystanders to share video and photographs of the incident for “potential investigation and follow-up”.

Arizona Democrats rallied around Grijalva. The representative Greg Stanton denounced the incident as “outrageous” while the representative Yassamin Ansari called it “absolutely unacceptable”. Senator Ruben Gallego wrote: “Pepper-spraying a sitting member of Congress is disgraceful, unacceptable, and absolutely not what we voted for. Period.”

At a town hall in Tucson later that day, senator Mark Kelly called it “horrific”.

Grijalva was elected to Congress in September, winning a special election to fill the seat left vacant by the death of her father, the late representative Raúl Grijalva. However, she was not sworn in as a member of Congress until last month, after the House returned from a weeks-long recess during the federal government shutdown.

“If federal agents are brazen enough to fire pellets directly at a Member of Congress,” Grijalva wrote on Friday, “imagine how they behave when encountering defenseless members of our community.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf7dd602269aed7c32c9ba1830daac6a49f601b6/667_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0607474e9d23902e6e526e11a7d12558",N,,2025-12-05 20:57:31.663962

Asked for a response, Bovino, who on Friday afternoon was walking with masked federal agents down Martinique Avenue in Kenner, didn't commit to any changes in his approach.
Earlier this week, Moreno and City Council members unveiled a portal for residents to report human rights violations by federal agents engaged in the operation.
Meanwhile, local Republican officials in Jefferson Parish and Kenner – where most of the first sweeps have occurred – have been silent or supportive of the operation.
“It is more than likely, on this particular issue in the Greater New Orleans area, that New Orleans will stand alone,” said City Council President JP Morrell.","New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno on Friday demanded that federal agents be more transparent about New Orleans-area immigration sweeps, amid reports that people across the region – including U.S. citizens and others with work permits – have been detained without cause and treated inhumanely.

Flanked by U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, National Urban League CEO and former Mayor Marc Morial and other local business and civic leaders, Moreno called on U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino to disclose basic information about the number of stops and arrests agents make, including the legal basis, criminal charges and warrants for each arrest.

She also demanded that agents remove masks and show clear identification when enforcing federal laws, show clear probable cause for their arrests, provide legal representation and medical care to detainees and allow detainees to notify their families.

“Our points are just very simple,” Moreno said at a Friday press conference. “They're centered around communication, transparency, accountability and upholding people's constitutional rights. I don't believe that we're asking for too much here.”

Moreno on Friday sent a letter to Bovino with her demands, which also included a request for safeguards against racial profiling.

Asked for a response, Bovino, who on Friday afternoon was walking with masked federal agents down Martinique Avenue in Kenner, didn't commit to any changes in his approach.

“I think this is about as transparent as it gets right here,” Bovino said.

The comments by Moreno and others represented the strongest local pushback to the sweeping federal immigration operation to date, though Moreno and other public officials conceded they have little authority to compel federal authorities to comply with their demands.

Earlier this week, Moreno and City Council members unveiled a portal for residents to report human rights violations by federal agents engaged in the operation. And the mayor-elect has criticized the effort publicly for days, saying New Orleans would be better served if the federal government sent resources so New Orleans can hire more federal prosecutors and social workers, create a police DNA lab, or help domestic violence victims.

Federal officials have said the intention is to target ""criminal illegal aliens"" who are public safety threats, but New Orleans officials on Friday said they don't buy it, since documents leaked to the Associated Press indicate the operation mission includes an arrest quota of 5,000 people.

“Citizens have already been profiled because of the color of their skin, chased, hunted and workers have even stared down the barrel of a rifle just trying to do their jobs,” said Sarah Whittington, advocacy director for ACLU Louisiana, who joined Moreno and others on Frday.

Moreno said her office fielded a call shortly before the briefing from the family of a detainee looking for help in locating their relative. Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, which provides free legal assistance to immigrants, has been contacted by the loved ones of 15 detainees, including some whose locations aren’t known, said Homero Lopez, the group’s director.

Lopez said a majority of those clients either have legal status or are in the process of obtaining legal status in cooperation with immigration authorities.

“What we are hearing from our clients is exactly what we have seen happen in other cities. Folks are being arrested indiscriminately, targeted for the color of their skin, the language they speak, the location where they are working,” Lopez said.

The mayor-elect also warned that New Orleans will suffer economically so long as day laborers and service industry workers – whether they reside in or outside city limits – are afraid to go to work.

“This operation is actually causing harm for the city of New Orleans, and it's causing harm for people beyond those who are being targeted. We have businesses that are closing. We have workers afraid to show up. And ultimately, there is an economic impact,” Moreno said.

Morial, meanwhile, said the images of masked federal agents “remind me of the tactics of the Ku Klux Klan.”

“I do not suggest that (immigration agents) are the Ku Klux Klan, but in this country, there is zero precedent for sworn law enforcement officers to mask themselves to carry out public enforcement actions,” Morial said.

He pointed out that lacking documentation is, by itself, a civil violation and not a crime. He said “the civil rights community” will take legal action over constitutional violations.

Carter, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he plans to call for a committee hearing to be held in New Orleans, which he said would force Trump administration officials to “directly address these pressing issues in the light of day and in the presence of the people most affected.”

Moreno said she believes “the politics of all this is starting to turn.”

“Even very conservative folks within our city, within our region, are believing that this is a step too far, that this has gone well beyond what it ever needed to be. That is why it is also so important that we are on the record with our demands,” Moreno said.

Moreno did not identify who she was referring to.

Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, have shown unwavering support for the immigration sweeps. Murrill on Friday issued a letter instructing New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick to “immediately” order NOPD cooperation with immigration agents, or else risk violating a 2024 state requiring local police to use “best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law.

Wisconsin law already prevents undocumented individuals from enrolling in BadgerCare, Wisconsin’s version of the federal Medicaid insurance program.
In his Friday veto message, Evers noted Republicans who passed the bill knew state law already prevents undocumented residents from enrolling in BadgerCare.
Other vetoes include bills to ban guaranteed income programs, allow for more election lawsuits In all, Evers vetoed nine bills passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature.
State Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, issued a statement claiming Evers’ veto means commission decisions “can never be questioned by anyone.”","Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a host of Republican bills Friday, including legislation barring undocumented immigrants from getting federal health care funding.

In his veto message, Evers accused GOP lawmakers of passing a bill to prevent “problems they admit do not exist, all for the sake of trying to push polarizing political rhetoric.”

The state Senate passed the bill in November. It would ban any public money from going toward health care coverage for people in the country illegally. Wisconsin law already prevents undocumented individuals from enrolling in BadgerCare, Wisconsin’s version of the federal Medicaid insurance program. But Republicans said they were concerned the state Department of Health Services may try to change that through what’s called an administrative rule change.

In his Friday veto message, Evers noted Republicans who passed the bill knew state law already prevents undocumented residents from enrolling in BadgerCare.

“These basic but important admissions by its own co-authors underscore that Republicans’ decision to pass this bill was more about being inflammatory, stoking fear, and sowing division than it was about accomplishing any significant policy outcome or being prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars,” said Evers.

In an interview with WPR, Rep. Alex Dallman, R-Markesan, the bill’s coauthor, said he was confused about why Evers’ veto message was “so strong” when the measure passed with votes from three Democrats in the state Senate. He claimed the “far left” is taking over the Democratic Party across the county, including Evers.

“It’s just unfortunate that Evers, who claims to be more middle-of-the-road as a governor, once again proves he’s looking out for the far left,” Dallman said. “And he’s going to veto a bill that could protect our hard-working taxpayer dollars.”

Dallman said Republicans are concerned about DHS trying to create rule allowing undocumented immigrants to enroll in BadgerCare due to a July Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that gave state agencies more power to enact rules without legislators blocking them.

Other vetoes include bills to ban guaranteed income programs, allow for more election lawsuits

In all, Evers vetoed nine bills passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature. They comprised a wide range of topics from building codes, higher education, election complaints and federal healthcare funding.

The governor vetoed legislation that would have made wide-ranging changes to unemployment benefits and prevented local governments from creating guaranteed income programs. Evers said he objected to lawmakers trying to restrict local control.

Evers also rejected a Republican bill aimed at making it easier for people to go to court if they have election complaints dismissed by the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The legislation came after the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s liberal majority said a complainant appealing a WEC decision didn’t have legal standing. State Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine, issued a statement claiming Evers’ veto means commission decisions “can never be questioned by anyone.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1344-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 19:56:36.575193

Texas can use a redrawn congressional map that adds as many as five Republican-friendly congressional districts, the supreme court ruled yesterday, handing Donald Trump a major win in his push to boost Republican seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

In an unsigned order, the 6-3 conservative-majority court granted a request by Texas to lift a lower court’s ruling that struck down the state’s new map in November. The supreme court’s three liberal justices dissented.

“The district court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections,” the supreme court said in an order explaining its decision.

What did the lower court rule? The lower district court previously found that Texas had likely sorted voters based on their race – an unlawful practice called racial gerrymandering – when it adopted the new maps, and ordered the state to use the maps it had adopted after the 2020 census for next year’s election.

Pentagon announces it has killed four men in another boat strike in Pacific

The Pentagon announced yesterday that the US military had conducted another deadly strike on a boat suspected of carrying illegal narcotics, killing four men in the eastern Pacific, as questions mount over the legality of the attacks.

The US southern command, based in Florida, posted video of the new strike on social media with a statement saying that at the direction of Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, “Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel in international waters operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization”.

The footage showed a large explosion suddenly overtaking a small boat as it moved through the water, followed by an image of a vessel in flames and dark smoke streaming overhead.

Why was the boat targeted? “Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was carrying illicit narcotics and transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the eastern Pacific. Four male narco-terrorists aboard the vessel were killed,” the statement said.

It comes as Washington seeks to increase pressure on India to cut back trade with Russia. It is the first time Putin has visited India since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and marks another step for him on the international stage since starting a war that has turned Russia into a global pariah.

Several lower courts have blocked as unconstitutional Trump’s attempt to put restrictions on the law that states that anyone born on US soil is automatically an American citizen.

Trump signed an executive order on January 20, his first day in office, decreeing that children born to parents in the US illegally or on temporary visas would not automatically become US citizens.

Lower courts have ruled the order to be a violation of the 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Trump’s executive order was premised on the idea that anyone in the US illegally, or on a visa, was not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the country, and therefore excluded from this category.

The Supreme Court rejected such a narrow definition in a landmark 1898 case.

The Trump administration has also argued that the 14th Amendment, passed in the wake of the Civil War, addresses the rights of former slaves and not the children of undocumented migrants or temporary US visitors.

In a brief with the court, Trump’s solicitor general, John Sauer, argued that “the erroneous extension of birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens has caused substantial harm to the United States”.

“Most obviously, it has impaired the United States’ territorial integrity by creating a strong incentive for illegal immigration,” Sauer said.

Trump’s executive order had been due to come into effect on February 19, but it was halted after federal judges ruled against the administration in multiple lawsuits.

District Judge John Coughenour, who heard the case in Washington state, described the president’s executive order as “blatantly unconstitutional”.

Conservatives hold a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court, and three of the justices were appointed by Trump.

Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which has spearheaded the legal challenges to the attempt to end birthright citizenship, said she is hopeful the top court will “strike down this harmful order once and for all”.

“Federal courts around the country have consistently rejected President Trump’s attempts to strip away this core constitutional protection,” Wang said.

“The president’s action goes against a core American right that has been a part of our Constitution for over 150 years.”

The Supreme Court has sided with Trump in a series of decisions this year, allowing various policies to take effect after they were impeded by lower courts that cast doubt on their legality.

Among these policies were Trump’s revocation of temporary legal protections on humanitarian grounds for hundreds of thousands of migrants, deportations of migrants to countries other than their own and domestic immigration enforcement raids.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AP25328704047319-1764974554.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-05 18:58:06.590083

I’m a US citizen.” “He did not care at all,” Guzman said to the station.
The Trump administration told WWL that it had deployed immigration agents across New Orleans-area communities including Marrero as part of an operation focused on violent offenders illegally residing in the US.
Guzman’s stepfather told WWL that he ordered the agents who had been pursuing her off their property.
Guzman said she couldn’t help but believe the agents who chased her might be “racially profiling all people of color”.","A US citizen who was seen on home security video being chased by masked federal agents outside New Orleans amid the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration crackdown says she surmises that she was pursued because “I’m brown”.

“I have no idea why they targeted me,” Jacelynn Guzman told the Guardian reporting partner WWL Louisiana on Thursday, a day after the video in question was taken and subsequently went viral online.

“That’s honestly all I can think of … It makes me scared for my family. It’s devastating.”

Asked for comment about Guzman’s remarks, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson issued a statement saying she matched the description of someone who was being sought by border patrol agents in connection with a deportation order.

The statement, provided on Friday, said agents ultimately determined Guzman “was not the target” and then departed the area without making arrests.

Guzman’s case nonetheless provided the public with a stark glimpse into the tactics being used by immigration agents who descended on Louisiana’s most populous city as well as the surrounding region with a goal of making 5,000 arrests in the coming weeks.

As the 22-year-old Guzman put it to WWL, she was walking back from a corner store near her home in Marrero, Louisiana, on Wednesday when an SUV pulled up next to her. More unmarked cars soon arrived, and men clad in masks and tactical gear poured out.

Guzman said she thought she was about to be kidnapped, and she sprinted toward her front door in plain view of a home security camera.

“Leave me alone!” she could be heard saying on the video, with at least one masked man running after her and two others trailing behind more slowly.

Guzman – whose family identifies as Hispanic – told WWL she had no idea why the men would approach her beside the fact that “I’m brown.” She said she had no criminal record and told one of the agents, “I was born and raised here. I’m a US citizen.”

“He did not care at all,” Guzman said to the station.

The Trump administration told WWL that it had deployed immigration agents across New Orleans-area communities including Marrero as part of an operation focused on violent offenders illegally residing in the US.

The DHS’s statement on Friday said the person for whom Guzman was mistaken had been previously charged with felony theft and convicted of illegal possession of stolen property. Neither are considered violent offenses under Louisiana law, though the statement – without naming the individual – referred to that person as a “public safety threat”.

The statement added that “agents identified themselves” during their encounter with Guzman. They ran toward Guzman’s home when she did, stopped “upon reaching the property”, and left when they realized she was not the person they were after, the DHS’s statement said.

Guzman’s stepfather told WWL that he ordered the agents who had been pursuing her off their property. The home security video at the center of Guzman’s case also captured him pointing at the agents and noting that at least one of them seemed Hispanic.

“Hispanic people against Hispanic people, bro!” he could be heard shouting.

Guzman said she couldn’t help but believe the agents who chased her might be “racially profiling all people of color”.

“It’s wrong,” she said to WWL.

By the time Guzman had spoken with the outlet, at least dozens of people had been arrested in the immigration sweep across the New Orleans area, plunging its immigrant communities into fear.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd0f28054645fd05ab4d56202420a6092b74ffe9/690_0_6895_5516/master/6895.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92e4570302cdae7d1d6d65fa34e63e7a",N,,2025-12-05 17:58:36.259601

The ICE officials instructed these Afghan residents to go to the downtown Sacramento field office for “same-day appointments,” but they were immediately detained.","Likely more than a dozen members of the Afghan community living in the Sacramento area have been detained by federal immigration agents as part of a nationwide crackdown on refugees from Afghanistan, according to community advocacy groups.

At least 12 immigrants from Afghanistan have been arrested since Monday during routine appointments at the downtown Sacramento field office for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly referred to as ICE. Many of the refugees live in the eastern suburbs of Sacramento, including Carmichael and Arden Arcade.

These arrests were reported by community groups, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Sacramento Valley/Central California said in a statement Wednesday. The community groups said they are worried the number of ICE arrests could be higher, because many families are afraid to tell others what happened to their loved ones.

“ICE is conducting a targeted, systematic campaign against our Afghan community using deceptive tactics,” Reshad Noorzay, executive director of CAIR-SV/CC, said in the news release “Community members are being called into ICE’s Sacramento office at 650 Capitol Mall for what they believe are routine appointments — and they’re being arrested the moment they walk through the door. This is entrapment. This is cruel. And this is happening right now in our community.”

Rep. Doris Matsui, D-Sacramento, organized a news conference Friday morning just outside the entrance of the John E. Moss federal building downtown, where immigration agents took Afghan residents into custody earlier this week. Matsui, joined by members of the CAIR and NorCal Resist community advocacy groups, called this week’s arrests “a serious escalation” by the Trump administration to target immigrant families.

“They have singled out entire communities with rhetoric that is reckless, dangerous and blatantly racist,” Matsui told reporters. “This is about people, human beings, our neighbors, families who came to this country seeking safety, many of whom were Afghan allies who stood with us at great personal risk and were promised safety in this country.”

The Sacramento Bee contacted ICE officials, who did not answer questions about the reported immigration arrests made in Sacramento this week or whether the federal agency is conducting other immigration enforcement of Afghan residents in the area.

Instead, ICE officials referred The Bee to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security news release issued Thursday that claimed the previous administration of President Joe Biden “created one of the worst and most complex national security crises in American history.”

“Under Secretary (Kristi) Noem, DHS has been going full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and criminal illegal aliens that came in through Biden’s fraudulent parole programs,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “When Joe Biden let 190,000 Afghan nationals in, they didn’t do criminal background checks or vet social media, someone just vouched for them and they took the words as truth.”

Former U.S. officials familiar with the Special Immigrant Visa process told The New York Times that the CIA had an intense vetting process for its partners during the war in Afghanistan, which included a requirement for Afghans to get current force members to vouch for them that put the reputation of their tribe or family on the line. The agency also kept extensive identifying biometric data, including retinal scans, on Afghans who served in its units.

Nationwide crackdown after shooting

CAIR said the ICE arrests in Sacramento were part of a nationwide immigration enforcement crackdown on immigrants from Afghanistan, a response from President Donald Trump after a shooting last week that killed one National Guard member and critically wounded another.

The New York Times obtained and reviewed internal documents that show the Trump administration is prioritizing the deportation of Afghan nationals, more than 1,800 of them throughout the country, previously ordered to leave the United States. The Times reported that the federal deportation efforts are part of a broader crackdown on refugees from Afghanistan after an Afghan national was accused of shooting the two National Guard troops in Washington.

“It has become vital to review the population of Afghanistan citizens,” an ICE official wrote to agency field offices in a Nov. 29 email.

Noorzay urged Afghan community members to consult attorneys before attending any ICE appointments. He advised residents not to attend ICE meetings without legal representation, and called on others in the Sacramento area to demand accountability from federal authorities.

“When ICE can detain 10 people in three days using deceptive tactics, and we don’t even know the real number — that creates a ripple effect of terror throughout our entire community,” Noorzay said in the news release. “Children are asking if their parents will come home. Families are afraid to answer the phone. People are too scared to go to their ICE check-ins, even when they’re required to do so by law.”

At Friday’s news conference, Noorzay said the issue at hand is not an abstract concept. He said the people targeted for removal are your neighbors, real families who work in the community who are now afraid to answer their phones

“They risked their lives working alongside U.S. forces, translators, interpreters, drivers, even journalists, and they fled under hardship, trusting that the United States would protect them,” Noorzay told reporters. “Today, that trust is being shattered.

He said what federal officials are doing to Afghan residents is profiling, targeting people based on national origin and faith. Noorzay said it echoes “some of the darkest chapters” in this country, such as the Japanese American internment camps during World War II and the painful history of targeting Latin American immigrants and refugees through raids and intimidation.

“This sends a wave of fear amongst this Afghan community and amongst every household,” Noorzay said.

Capital response and detentions

Members of the NorCal Resist community advocacy group have been taking calls to its hotline reporting federal immigration agents taking Afghan residents into custody. They’re urging residents to know their rights.

“The Afghan residents are a part of our community. We will be defending them,” Giselle Garcia of NorCal Resist told The Bee on Thursday.

Garcia told reporters on Friday that she escorted one Afghan family to the downtown federal building earlier this week after they received a call from ICE officials instructing them to appear for an impromptu appointment. She said the family who arrived in Sacramento earlier this year had fled Afghanistan to escape persecution from the Taliban, because the family had supported U.S. military.

“We knew what that meant,” Garcia said. “We had to prepare this family that he (the father and husband) would likely be detained, and that they would be separated.”

She said the father tried to be strong for his wife and children, while his wife held back tears as best as she could. Garcia said she can still hear the couple’s young daughter trying to console her mother, telling her mother it would be OK when her father comes back. As recent arrivals, the family and others is required to comply with immigration officials.

“I could not reconcile that our government was forcing this beautiful family to walk into a trap and that we were driving them to their demise,” Garcia told reporters.

On Thursday, Afghan residents in Arden Arcade reported immigration officials knocking on the doors of their homes, questioning them and promising to return. Garcia said these tactics are “terrorizing the community.”

The community groups have reported that ICE officials have been calling Afghan residents, many of whom are recent arrivals, some who are already under ICE supervision and others who are scheduled for expedited removal proceedings.

The ICE officials instructed these Afghan residents to go to the downtown Sacramento field office for “same-day appointments,” but they were immediately detained. CAIR officials said the majority of those arrested in Sacramento were being held at the California City Detention Facility, a former prison in Kern County converted to an ICE detention center.

The facility is facing a federal lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other civil rights groups, which alleges serious operational failures—including raw sewage leaks, insect infestations, insufficient medical care, and inadequate food and clothing for cold weather. One detainee reportedly went without heart medication for days, resulting in two hospitalizations.

The lawsuit claims ICE and its private contractor, CoreCivic, have failed to provide for the basic needs of those in custody, citing delayed surgeries and inhumane treatment.

ICE and CoreCivic have denied the allegations, and DHS officials have called the complaints “false.”

“ICE’s mass detention strategy is rooted in anti-Muslim bigotry and discriminatory profiling,” Layli Shirani, civil rights managing attorney for CAIR’s Sacramento chapter, said in the news release. “The federal government is criminalizing the very people who risked their lives to help America. Using fake appointments to lure people into detention is a deceptive, inhumane tactic that violates basic principles of due process.”

The Sacramento area is home to an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Afghan residents, the largest concentration in the United States. CAIR said many of them assisted U.S. military forces as translators, interpreters and CIA assets before fleeing Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021.

The congresswoman said Trump and Noem have exploited the heartbreaking shooting of two National Guard members to justify going after immigrant families in Sacramento and throughout the country.

“Sacramento knows how to respond when fear is weaponized,” Matsui said at Friday’s news conference. “We don’t scatter. We lock arms, and we stand together.”

HIAS and our partners will continue to work to put out good information for refugees, asylum seekers, and community members in the days and weeks to come.","In the last two weeks, the Trump Administration has announced sweeping and unprecedented restrictions on refugees and asylum seekers, some of them following the tragic shooting of members of the National Guard in Washington, D.C. on November 26.

Many of these announcements still lack detailed public guidance or clarity on how they will be implemented. Here is what you need to know now about the most recent changes impacting refugees, asylees, and immigrants to the United States:

Refugees Admitted Between January 2021 and January 2025

The Trump administration is planning to re-screen 200,000 refugees admitted into the United States during the Biden Administration, according to a leaked USCIS memo from November 21, 2025. The U.S. Refugee Admissions program (USRAP) already includes years of security screening by multiple federal agencies, making resettled refugees the single most vetted population admitted to the country.

Refugees admitted through the USRAP have already endured years or decades of trauma, instability, and loss. The prospect of being summoned back into an interview process—paired with the threat of losing access to permanent residency—disrupts the sense of safety and belonging that resettlement is intended to restore.

Despite the fact that the refugee resettlement program remains shuttered to almost all new arrivals (as of January 20, 2025), HIAS continues to provide ongoing integration and welcome services to thousands of clients who arrived during the past five years and is deeply concerned for their wellbeing in this moment.

People Seeking Asylum in the United States

The Trump Administration paused all asylum decisions on November 28, 2025, for asylum seekers from any country around the world. Asylum seekers have since reported widespread cancellations of interviews.

There is currently a backlog of 1.4 million asylum applications pending before USCIS, which means that people seeking protection after fleeing violence and persecution have even less stability, and risk being sent back to danger. Seeking asylum is a legal pathway, and a lifesaving option. President Trump has even stated he intends to pause the asylum system for “a long time”.

In addition to the halt on asylum processing, the Trump administration has also indicated that they will review all asylum decisions made during the Biden Administration, plunging people who spent years proving that they faced danger in their home countries, back into uncertainty.

HIAS works with asylum seekers through our direct legal representation in the New York and DC areas and provides legal support and resources through a large pro-bono network across the country.

People from the 19 Travel Ban Countries

Six months ago, the Trump Administration announced a new travel ban, blocking people from nineteen countries from entering the U.S. This is a fully discriminatory policy, echoing the Muslim ban from the first Trump administration, only even more sweeping.

Now the administration has blocked all immigration processing for people from those 19 countries, such as travel documents, obtaining green cards, adjustment of status, and naturalization. They also plan to re-review past approvals for individuals from those countries who entered the U.S. on or after January 20, 2021.

Additionally, the administration is reportedly considering expanding the travel ban list to thirty countries.

Afghans

The Trump Administration has announced that all visas for people from Afghanistan are halted. This includes Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) for people who assisted the U.S. mission during the recent wars. With the current shutdown of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, SIVs were some of the only individuals still being admitted in the United States. Afghans remain one of the largest groups of refugees around the world, fleeing violence and persecution from the Taliban regime.

HIAS works with Afghan refugees and SIVs across all our programs nationwide. We have resettled thousands of Afghan refugees, provided long-term integration support and resources, provided legal support, and engaged local communities in welcome and advocacy. We will continue to advocate for the rights and safety of the Afghan community.

Next Steps

HIAS is deeply saddened by the senseless act of violence targeting Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, and our thoughts are with their families. As a Jewish organization, we also know all too well what it means for an entire community to be targeted because of the actions of one person.

We will always stand in solidarity with people seeking the opportunity to rebuild their lives in safety, including those being targeted now by harmful policies and hateful rhetoric in the Afghan American and Somali American communities.

While this article summarizes some of the events of two tumultuous weeks, we recognize that this is an ongoing situation, with fast-moving developments. For most of the policy changes announced, there remains no clear guidance on how they will be implemented, leaving refugees and immigrants – and all of us who work with them – with questions, uncertainty, and fear. HIAS and our partners will continue to work to put out good information for refugees, asylum seekers, and community members in the days and weeks to come.",https://hias.org/wp-content/uploads/Getty_Minnesota_Immigration_Protest_Hero.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 21:56:34.196994

Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the US, according to an internal state department cable.

“I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” she said.

Donald Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats.

The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travelers.

Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list.

“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem said.

Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the US, according to an internal state department cable.

An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National guard members in Washington DC last week.

Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement program under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting.

Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from what he termed all “third world countries”, although he did not identify any by name or define that label.

Immigration groups and lawmakers sharply criticized the escalation and plan to halt immigration applications from 19 countries that were already under US travel restrictions, a decision that comes amid reports that naturalization ceremonies for people on the travel ban list are also being canceled.

Before that, officials from the DHS said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, and green cards issued to citizens of 19 countries.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf70d5ede73ae1d1b6c82ab178d5d230c5ef2007/537_0_5006_4005/master/5006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57b949d61991683864c64befa69f27e2",N,,2025-12-05 17:58:15.792943

The tension underscores how severely the relationship between Newsom and the White House has deteriorated since catastrophic blazes tore through Los Angeles in January. A year that began with Newsom extending an olive branch to his Oval Office nemesis drew toward a close with the likely 2028 presidential candidate championing a gerrymandering campaign framed as a rebuke to Trump, who has infuriated California Democrats with policies like sweeping immigration raids in LA.

Newsom’s visit comes at a critical time in the recovery process, nearing the one-year anniversary of the blazes that destroyed 13,000 homes across Los Angeles. Wildfire survivors have begun to return to their homes in recent weeks, but they’ve continued to struggle with a lack of high-level leadership and funding needed to manage the recovery.

Financing gaps are particularly pressing for low-income renters and longtime homeowners on fixed incomes, many of whom had no insurance or were underinsured. The governor’s revised request calls for $2 billion to build new affordable housing developments and $9.9 billion for long-term housing and infrastructure needs. Beyond housing, Newsom wants $11.8 billion in public assistance, including to repair damaged school facilities and for emergency staffing.

While a substantial amount of federal funding typically comes years after disasters, state and local governments rely on the money to reimburse them.

Newsom at first sought to coax more resources through a conciliatory approach, meeting with Trump even as the president and his allies threatened to attach preconditions to federal assistance. He worked to unite California’s delegation across party lines in a bid for more money that brought in Republicans including the state’s senior appropriator, Rep. Ken Calvert.

But that attempt at comity collapsed as Newsom vociferously opposed — and challenged in court — core Trump policies like tariffs and the president’s deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and as Newsom’s staff mocks the president online. Trump during a visit in late January vowed to help with the recovery but has since cast doubt on whether he would aid the “incompetent” Newsom.

The EO would deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States to a mother in temporary lawful status or without status, if the child’s father is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident.

The EO would deny U.S. citizenship to children born in the United States to a mother in temporary lawful status or without status, if the child’s father is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. lawful permanent resident.

The federal government is currently enjoined from implementing the birthright citizenship EO pursuant to four separate lower court orders. The White House is seeking a Supreme Court ruling that the EO is constitutional in its reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment Citizenship clause, thereby overruling the lower court injunctions.

A final ruling on the EO’s constitutionality may not be issued until the end of the Supreme Court’s current term in June or July 2026.

On January 20, President Trump issued a birthright citizenship EO stating that the following classes of children born in the United States after February 19, 2025 would no longer be U.S. citizens at birth:

Children whose mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth; and

Children whose mother’s presence in the United States at the time of the child’s birth was lawful but temporary, and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of the child’s birth.

The EO defines mother as the “immediate female biological progenitor” and father as the “immediate male biological progenitor.” (Therefore, parents with legal but not biological parentage of a child could not serve as the basis for their child’s U.S. birthright citizenship claim.)

The basis of the EO is a significant reinterpretation of the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” in the 14th Amendment Citizenship clause, which for more than 125 years has been interpreted to grant citizenship based on birth in the United States, subject to some very narrow exceptions.

Thus far, various nationwide injunctions have prevented implementation of the birthright citizenship EO, even after a June 27 Supreme Court decision seemed to limit the authority of federal courts to issue nationwide (or “universal,” in the court’s terminology) injunctions. Despite the various injunctions in effect, in late July 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued preliminary guidance on certain aspects of EO implementation, providing insight into how the agency would apply the new citizenship framework if all injunctions were to be lifted. If the Supreme Court were to deem the EO constitutional and the EO were to take effect, significant changes would be required in the policies and operations of both USCIS and the U.S. State Department.",https://www.fragomen.com/a/web/jw8CFvqZCBTzJTGK5te2fn/3gcYmk/alert-social-open-graph.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:58:47.352919

Homan’s visit underscored the ongoing divide in El Paso over immigration policy, reflecting broader national debates playing out across the country.","EL PASO, Texas — White House Border Czar Tom Homan’s visit to the University of Texas at El Paso on Thursday sparked both enthusiastic support and vocal opposition, turning the campus into a divided scene over immigration policy.

Homan spoke at an event hosted by Turning Point USA, where organizers say roughly 500 people filled the auditorium to hear his remarks. Inside, he delivered a sharp message on illegal immigration, calling for stricter enforcement and defending the administration’s approach along the southern border.

“At the University of Texas at El Paso, we are not sending the message to the whole world that it’s ok to enter illegally… when you cross the border illegally, you are a cheater and put yourself in front of the line of millions who are doing it the right way,” Homan said.

While Homan addressed the crowd indoors, dozens of protesters gathered outside the venue. Demonstrators, many of them students and local immigrants’ rights advocates, criticized his role in shaping federal immigration enforcement and the impact they believe his policies have had on families in the borderland.

“He is the one promoting this idea that it is okay to deport U.S. citizen children. We believe that message is not necessarily welcome in El Paso or in UTEP,” said Fernando García, Director of the Border Network for Human Rights.

Supporters inside the auditorium said they attended because they view Homan as a knowledgeable and credible voice on immigration law.

“He is very, very knowledgeable about all aspects of immigration law. I like to hear him talk because he comes from a very informed opinion,” said attendee Andy Bucker.

Some UTEP students voiced discomfort with the visit, noting that the university is majority Hispanic and in a community deeply connected to the immigrant experience.

“It is very troubling that Tom Homan has come here to speak because this is a majority-Hispanic university. Under Tom Homan’s leadership, most of our students here could be targeted by ICE regardless of their immigration status,” said UTEP student Naomi Reese.

The event concluded with both sides standing firm in their viewpoints. Supporters argued that open discussion is essential, while critics insisted that Homan’s presence sends a harmful message to immigrant communities on campus.

“In El Paso, I would rather see protesters come in and engage in a respectful manner so people can learn,” Bucker said.

In the letter, the New Dems lay out eight commonsense and immediate steps the Administration could take to address the ongoing housing affordability crisis. The letter comes as the Secretary of the Treasury has indicated the Administration is planning to declare a “national housing emergency” to address rising costs, while refusing to take quick and decisive actions to actually bring down the cost of housing.

The letter reads in part:

“We agree with the Secretary’s comments that this is an ‘all hands on deck’ challenge and believe there are concrete steps the Administration and Congress should take to meet this ongoing crisis. However, details on actual policies that would expand affordable housing options have not been provided. In fact, recently announced policies at the Department of Housing and Urban Development would do the opposite, and reverse progress made in fighting homelessness and go against Congressional instruction.”

The recommendations include restoring funding for Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) homelessness programs, lowering tariffs on construction materials to decrease costs, improving data collection and transparency, and prioritizing reforms to planning, permitting, and zoning.

You can read the full letter here, and below:

Dear President Trump:

Access to affordable housing is critical for our nation’s long-term success. For too long, rising home prices and rents have kept home ownership out of reach for teachers, nurses, firefighters, and millions of other Americans, forcing families to choose between saving for their children’s education, affording needed healthcare, and keeping a roof over their heads.

These heartbreaking financial decisions have meant too many families have given up on the American dream, an America where any child can grow up to have a better future than their parents. That is why the New Democrat Coalition has for years called for policies to make owning a home more accessible for more Americans by building more affordable housing, improving availability of capital for homebuyers, and lowering overall housing costs. We write to urge your administration to take immediate action to increase affordable housing production and lower housing costs for Americans.

Past comments from the Secretary of the Treasury indicate that the administration is planning to declare a “national housing emergency” to address the rising costs of housing. We need more than declarations and hollow promises. We agree with the Secretary’s comments that this is an ""all hands on deck"" challenge and believe there are concrete steps the Administration and Congress should take to meet this ongoing crisis. However, details on actual policies that would expand affordable housing options have not been provided. In fact, recently announced policies at the Department of Housing and Urban Development would do the opposite, and reverse progress made in fighting homelessness and go against Congressional instruction.

There are numerous existing policy actions within your authority that you and your administration can act on today, to help build more housing and lower the cost of buying, renting, or selling a home. We urge your administration to take concrete steps to tackle the housing crisis by focusing on proven and practical solutions, including:

Reverse the proposed cuts and changes to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Continuum of Care Program announced on November 13, 2025, which puts 170,000 people at immediate risk of homelessness.

Develop best practices for zoning and land-use policies, including model codes at the HUD in consultation with agencies such as the Department of Transportation and Department of Commerce, which will help a teacher afford to live in the same community where she works, rather than commuting two hours each day.

Prioritize federal funds for projects that include planning, permitting, and zoning reforms to promote more streamlined development, including updating grant criteria to reward jurisdictions with simplified codes, which will help cut through the red tape that adds tens of thousands of dollars in costs to every new home.

Update Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage disclosures to include Department of Veteran Affairs’ (VA) Home Loans alongside FHA and conventional loan options to maximize transparency, which will show veterans that VA loans often offer better terms than conventional options—ensuring our service members aren't missing out on benefits they've earned.

Improve data collection efforts at the Census Bureau and HUD to better understand how and where housing is being lost and not replaced so Congress and the Administration can respond urgently when a community loses 100 affordable units and only builds back 20.

Exempt housing construction materials from tariffs to lower construction costs by thousands of dollars per home, savings that developers can pass directly to homebuyers.

Enhance data transparency by requiring the Federal Housing Finance Agency, HUD, VA, and Department of Agriculture to release public loan-level appraisal data that identifies lenders and appraisers, but protects homeowner privacy, ensuring that a family's zip code or last name doesn't determine whether they can get a fair mortgage.

Provide significant funding anti-discrimination programs at HUD to ensure that all Americans can buy, rent, or sell homes at fair prices, which safeguard all Americans, regardless of race, religion, gender, disability, or marriage status.

The housing crisis demands specific action with real impact. We strongly encourage your administration to work collaboratively with Congress to implement these measures and other forward-looking policies to address the nation’s housing challenges. By pursuing these practical reforms, we can deliver real results for American families while respecting constitutional limits and building the bipartisan consensus necessary for lasting solutions.

Carla Cunningham, the Democrat who faced a jeering hometown crowd this summer after delivering a controversial speech on the state House floor criticizing immigrants, is seeking an eighth term.

She’ll likely be in a crowded primary field in House District 106 in Charlotte.

The Rev. Rodney Sadler filed campaign paperwork on Monday.

At least two others say they plan to run. Morris McAdoo, a lawyer, has a campaign website. Vermanno Bowman, whom Cunningham defeated in last year’s primary, announced on social media he also plans to run again.

Cunningham worked for decades as a nurse and has been a prominent voice in the legislature on health and mental health matters.

She is the widow of longtime House member Pete Cunningham, who resigned his seat in 2007 and died in 2010. Carla Cunningham won her first term in 2012.

Cunningham has emerged as one of the Democrats who votes most often with the Republican majority. This year, she voted with Republicans more than any other Democrat. And Republican House leaders have recognized that by awarding her coveted positions in chamber leadership: she co-chairs the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services, and is a vice-chair of the House Health Committee.

But, until now, she has not faced a concerted Democratic effort to oust her. She defeated Bowman in last year’s primary with more than 84% of the vote.

House District 106 is heavily Democratic, so the primary victor is likely to win the seat.

Cunningham delivered her controversial speech on immigration as she voted with the GOP to override Democratic Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of House Bill 318. The law puts more requirements on law enforcement to help U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement with deportations.

“All cultures are not equal,” Cunningham said in a speech explaining her vote to override Stein’s veto. Immigrants need to assimilate, she added.

At an August town hall filled with angry Democrats, Cunningham defended her vote and the speech, WFAE reported.

Last month, the U.S. Border Patrol began an operation in Charlotte that triggered a wave of fear that temporarily closed businesses and had parents afraid to send children to school.

Cunningham was initially dismissive of reports of the operation. She told NC Newsline, “I’m going to be keeping my eyes on my own safety for right now,” saying she had received threats over her July speech.

However, in an email Friday announcing her reelection bid, Cunningham said her vote was about serious criminal offenders.

It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.

In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.

When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?

As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.

Arguments for automatic citizenship

Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.

The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.

One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.

Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.

If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.

However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.

The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”

One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.

The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.

Opposition to birthright citizenship

The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.

This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.

The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.

Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.

Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.

The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.

In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.

For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.

Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.

What might happen

The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.

The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.

The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.

Similarly, xenophobia targeting migrants from other African countries has been a constant feature of life and politics in post-apartheid South Africa.
Xenophobia is not confined to any region or ideology; it is now woven into the political life of countries across the globe.","“I don’t want them in our country. I’ll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care. I don’t want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason …”

This is what United States President Donald Trump had to say about Somali migrants on the first day of an immigration crackdown targeting their community. He insisted that Somali migrants have turned the US state of Minnesota, where some 2 percent of the population is of Somali descent, into a “hellhole” and should be “out of here”. Then, directing his ire at his vocal critic, Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born Democratic representative from Minnesota, Trump said, “She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people who work. These aren’t people who say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great. ’”

Of course, none of this is new or surprising. Hatred of migrants and asylum seekers has always been the glue that holds Trump’s MAGAverse together. Who can forget that, before his cordial meeting with Trump at the White House, several MAGA Republicans made serious efforts to revoke the US citizenship of New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani. Since Trump’s rise to power, hostility to migrants has become not just a mainstream component of contemporary politics in the United States but a governing principle.

But the rise in anti-migrant sentiment, and its validation and promotion by those in positions of power, is not exclusive to Trump’s increasingly insular America. Similar rhetoric and tactics are gaining ground elsewhere, revealing a global trend that extends far beyond the United States. Denmark is one such example.

Beneath its long-cultivated image as a progressive, humane and orderly society built on universal healthcare, Lego, highly liveable cities and minimalist designer aesthetics, Denmark has in recent years become one of Europe’s most restrictive states on immigration and asylum. During the recently concluded local elections, Islamophobic rhetoric was on full display, and in the lead-up to the 2026 national elections, the ruling Social Democrats have placed their commitment to tackling the so-called problem of immigration at the centre of their campaign.

Across the pond, in the United Kingdom, the supposedly progressive Labour government seems eager to follow the Danish example. Under pressure from the far right and Reform UK’s enduring rise in the polls, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is eager to convince people that he can be trusted to take back control of our borders and close the book on a squalid chapter of Britain’s immigration policy. He has warned that the UK risks becoming an island of strangers unless immigration is sharply reduced, and has promised that his government’s reforms will ensure that migration will fall. That is a promise. Most strikingly, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood recently sent officials to Denmark to study its immigration and asylum regime, a gesture that underscores how dramatically Labour’s stance has hardened.

Xenophobia is also on the rise outside the Western world. It is a staple of policy and practice from Libya to South Africa, a reminder that anti-migrant politics is now a global tool of governance.

Europe-bound migrants in Libya face horrific levels of violence and abuse. According to Amnesty International, they are subjected to prolonged arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture, rape, unlawful killings, extortion and forced labour. These abuses occur within a system effectively underwritten by European governments, which have funnelled funding, training and equipment to Libyan coastguard units tasked with intercepting migrants before they reach international waters. Keen to stem the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean, European Union states have outsourced border control to Libya despite knowing the consequences, supporting the authorities’ ability to continue with measures the United Nations says could very likely amount to crimes against humanity.

Further west, in Tunisia, Black African migrants have faced sporadic violence for years. In early 2023, President Kais Saied claimed there was a criminal plan to change Tunisia’s demographic makeup through irregular migration, turning it into a purely African country that has no affiliation to the Arab and Islamic nations. His remarks triggered a surge in mob attacks on Black migrants, students and asylum seekers. There was also an increase in arrests, and the police appeared to be targeting Black African foreigners based on their appearance. Those detained included undocumented migrants, registered refugees and asylum seekers, as well as migrants with valid credentials, a stark demonstration of how state practices can shift once xenophobia is given political sanction.

Similarly, xenophobia targeting migrants from other African countries has been a constant feature of life and politics in post-apartheid South Africa. According to Xenowatch, a project hosted by the University of the Witwatersrand that tracks xenophobic discrimination and violence, there have been 1,295 recorded incidents since 1994, including displacement, looting of migrant-owned businesses and killings. Deaths peaked in 2008 with 72 fatalities and 150 incidents. In 2025, while 16 people were killed, the overall number of xenophobic incidents again reached 2008 levels, underscoring the persistence of the crisis.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government systematically overlooked migrant communities, excluding many from relief programmes and framing protection of South Africans as the priority. The state also constructed a 40-kilometre fence along the border with Zimbabwe to block infected or undocumented persons, despite Zimbabwe having only 11 confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time compared with South Africa’s 1,845. Politicians reinforced existing myths about foreign-owned businesses posing health risks. When announcing that spaza shops could remain open, the then-Minister of Small Business Development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, declared that only South African-owned, managed and run shops would remain open.

South Africa has also seen the rise of explicitly anti-immigrant mobilisation. The Put South Africans First movement, a coalition of civil society groups advocating the mass deportation of African migrants, organised a march to the Nigerian and Zimbabwean embassies on September 23, 2020, claiming that foreigners contribute to South Africa’s social ills such as drugs, human trafficking and child abductions.

The vigilante group Operation Dudula emerged from this movement in 2021, following the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma. Although it claims to address crime and drug use in Gauteng communities, its name, Dudula – meaning “force out” in isiZulu – captures its true focus. The group is better known for calling for mass deportations, blocking migrants from accessing hospitals and clinics, and raiding or shutting down foreign-owned businesses.

Of course, I could keep going, from increasing restrictions in countries like Colombia, Peru, Chile and Ecuador aimed at stemming the influx of Venezuelan migrants, to Indian authorities forcibly expelling ethnic Bengali Muslims to Bangladesh without due process, domestic guarantees and international human rights standards, claiming that they are undocumented. Xenophobia is not confined to any region or ideology; it is now woven into the political life of countries across the globe.

Why are we so keen to give in to xenophobic narratives and policies? In part because they are convenient. They allow governments and societies to externalise domestic failures, offering an easy explanation for problems that are far more complex and often rooted in political and economic mismanagement at home, in austerity, deepening inequality and precarious work rather than in the arrival of strangers.

In this logic, the migrant becomes a ready-made scapegoat, a figure onto whom we project all the ills we believe threaten who we are or what we stand for. It then becomes effortless to claim that migrants subscribe to dangerous ideologies, strain national resources, carry diseases or form part of some insidious plan to alter the country’s demographic or cultural fabric.

Perception becomes reality. Blaming those beyond our borders allows us to imagine the threat lies elsewhere, reassuring us that we are not the problem. The tragedy is that the dysfunctions and corruptions embedded in our own systems remain untouched. And scapegoating the supposed outsider does nothing to make our societies fairer, safer or more humane; it merely buys time for leaders unwilling to confront the crises they helped create.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ap_6932d1cfefa76-1764938192.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-05 18:58:02.469714

Federal judges across the country ruled that the policy is at odds with the Constitution and an 1898 Supreme Court ruling long seen as guaranteeing citizenship to virtually everyone born in the U.S.

Although the courts blocked Trump’s policy within days of its issuance, the Justice Department did not immediately ask the Supreme Court to revive it. Instead, in March, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to use the birthright-related litigation to tell judges to stop the issuance of nationwide injunctions against the federal government.

Sauer’s move, which put off the high court battle over birthright citizenship for about a year, led to a Supreme Court ruling in June that reined in judges’ authority to issue nationwide injunctions but didn’t slam the door on them altogether.

The Trump administration returned to the high court in September, asking the justices to take up the substance of the birthright fight and rule that Trump’s policy is constitutional.

“The Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to grant citizenship to freed slaves and their children, not to the children of illegal aliens, birth tourists, and temporary visitors,” Sauer wrote. “The plain text of the Clause requires more than birth on U.S. soil alone.”

Critics say Trump’s policy would upend more than a century of settled law and practice. They also question any president’s authority to declare who is and is not a citizen.

It’s also unclear how the order would be implemented. State and local governments issue birth certificates in the U.S. and they don’t always indicate the citizenship of parents.

“The Executive Order and Petitioners’ efforts to implement it threaten chaos and strike at our Nation’s most solemn promise — equality under the law and full citizenship for those born on American soil,” lawyers for Democrat-led states opposing Trump’s order told the court in October.

Those states did not oppose the high court taking up the case to resolve the issue, while immigrant rights advocates said the law is so clear that the justices should turn aside the administration’s bid for review.

Trump’s executive order did not directly seek to strip U.S. citizenship from people who already had it.

The case could have a seismic impact on the nature of citizenship in the United States, ending the automatic presumption children born within the country are U.S. citizens regardless of the immigration status of their parents, based on more than 125 years of legal precedent.

The executive order from Trump, signed on the first day of his second term as part of a tough-on-immigration approach, sought to deny citizenship to children born in the United States if their parents were not current citizens or permanent residents.

States and others challenging the executive order have said in court filings that it could strip citizenship from hundreds of thousands of children each year.

The Trump administration appealed a lower court decision that found the executive order violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case Friday in a one-page order and could decide the case by the conclusion of the term at the end of June.

The language in that amendment, which states “all persons born or naturalized” in the United States are citizens, has served as basis for that guarantee all people born in the country.

The court had decided one aspect of the birthright citizenship case last term, focusing on trial judges who had issued rulings on a nationwide basis prohibiting Trump from enforcing the order.

The high court ultimately decided nationwide injunctions as a general matter are unlawful. But that decision was about the authority of trial judges and didn’t address the underlying merits of limiting birthright citizenship.

Defenders of Trump’s move have pointed to conditional language in the amendment stating individuals born in the United States must be “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” to be eligible for citizenship.

That interpretation cuts against more than century of legal precedent that established that carve out applies to very limited categories of people, such as the children of foreign diplomats.

The Justice Department filed the petition seeking review before the court last month in two challenges, one in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against Trump and another pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, which has yet to render a decision.

The Trump administration petition states “the mistaken view that birth on U.S. territory confers citizenship on anyone subject to the regulatory reach of U.S. law became pervasive, with destructive consequences,” and that Trump issued the order to “restore the Clause’s original meaning.”

Early review is necessary before the 1st Circuit has rendered its decision, the Justice Department contended, because Trump’s directive “forms an integral part of the Administration’s broader effort to prevent illegal immigration.”

“Though these cases arise in a preliminary-injunction posture, further proceedings in the lower courts would have limited utility, given that the cases involve pure questions of law,” the petition states.

Civil rights groups that had brought litigation against Trump’s directive argued in a brief before the Supreme Court that review was unwarranted because the key question was already resolved, citing the decision in the 1898 Wong Kim Ark case.

“Wong Kim Ark is one of the most important decisions in our nation’s history, and it stands as a cornerstone of our modern society,” the brief says. “Reopening questions of birthright citizenship would cause potentially catastrophic effects, rippling out far past the particular Order at issue here.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/birthright_BC_150_051525-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:58:36.791680

The industries listed do not include the many year-round (or nearly year-round) jobs that can be found on crop farms, including equipment operators and supervisors.
A fall in the H-2A wage will increase demand for H-2A workers, since employers can save significantly on labor costs if they hire them.
As a result, it will become relatively more expensive to hire non-H-2A U.S. farmworkers.
However, if the rider to make H-2A year-round goes into effect, farmworkers in year-round jobs will see the biggest pay cuts.","This is Part 1 of a two-part series analyzing the impact of an amendment to the House Homeland appropriations bill on the H-2A and H-2B visa programs.

For well over a decade now—time and time and time and time again—Congress has been making policy changes to temporary work visa programs not through the normal process of debating and passing legislation, but through a backdoor process. This involves amendments to annual appropriations legislation (known as “riders”) that fund the U.S. government. Riders that make policy changes are much more likely to pass without much public notice, debate, or pushback relative to dedicated legislation, since they are smaller parts of larger, must-pass legislation to fund the whole U.S. government. The significant changes proposed or passed in riders over the past decade have all pushed temporary work visa programs in the same direction: expanding and deregulating the H-2A and H-2B visa programs, which benefits employers at the expense of U.S. workers and hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who will continue to see reduced wages and poorer working conditions. It’s already clear that low-wage work visa programs won’t be improved during the Trump administration; instead, they’ll be made much worse.

This fiscal year, there is a particular urgency around the riders to expand and deregulate the H-2A and H-2B visa programs, in light of the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort that is arresting and deporting workers at a breakneck pace, as well as canceling temporary immigration protections that provided work authorization to millions. The Trump administration got the ball rolling on this effort with a new proposed H-2A wage regulation issued by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) on October 2, 2025. This proposed regulation contains a stunning admission: The administration’s mass deportation effort is likely to raise food prices. DOL’s solution to this problem of the administration’s own creation is an irrational and anti-worker solution. Instead of pushing the administration from within to stop their campaign of mass deportation, DOL proposes to lower farmworker wages by $24 billion over the next 10 years.

Having seen this proposed rule, employers who are heavily reliant on migrant laborers—especially those in the hospitality, construction, and agricultural industries—can now be confident they have a friendly administration willing to dismantle labor standards and are lobbying furiously for more work visas that allow them to employ a vulnerable workforce. Employers are making the case that H-2 visas are “a workforce issue, not immigration,” as well as an essential service that must continue to function even during the recent government shutdown. A number of lawmakers and the Trump administration seem to agree.

The latest legislative vehicle that has a chance at furthering these goals is a rider that the Homeland Security subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee proposed and passed. It was originally known as Amendment #1 but was later dubbed the “Bipartisan Visa En Bloc” amendment. As Politico Pro reported, “House appropriators from both parties came together…to back big changes to visa policies that would boost the number of seasonal workers who can come to the United States.” The rider was cosponsored by three Republicans and one Democrat (but the Democrat was Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the recent recipient of a pardon from Trump for federal bribery charges). However, it’s worth noting that because rider passed by a voice vote, there is no on-the-record vote tally showing who voted for it.

The rider still has a long way to go before becoming law and will also depend on whether an omnibus government spending bill is ultimately passed for fiscal year 2026. As of the time of publication, the Senate has not yet released their version of a Homeland Security appropriations bill. To become law, the Senate would also have to adopt the same rider provision for it to become part of the broader omnibus appropriations legislation. Nevertheless, the rider is a statement of intent from legislators who are willing to go to bat for employers seeking new exploitable and underpaid migrant workers to replace their long-term immigrant workers who have been deported or lost status.

Below is a summary of the four major changes that the Bipartisan Visa En Bloc rider amendment would make to the H-2A and H-2B visa programs. Only the first major change is discussed in this explainer, but a follow-up to this blog post will discuss the other three changes. Under the rider:

Employers would be permitted to hire H-2A farmworkers to fill year-round jobs.

The H-2B visa program would be expanded by at least 100,000 workers relative to its size in 2024.

H-2B workers employed at carnivals, traveling fairs, and circuses would be moved to the P visa program, a program that has no wage rules or worker protections and over which DOL has no formal oversight role.

DHS would not be permitted to spend funds to implement the January 2024 regulation that incrementally improves rights and protections for H-2A and H-2B workers. This regulation allows them to be eligible for green cards through existing pathways and helps them more easily change employers, reducing the indentured nature of the visa programs, and requires additional scrutiny on employer applications if they’ve committed certain violations.

The H-2A program has expanded rapidly and is rife with abuse

Employers use the H-2A visa program to fill seasonal and temporary jobs in agriculture, after employers go through a (mostly pro forma) process to prove that they could not find an available U.S. worker to hire. There is no annual limit on the number of H-2A workers that can be hired, and H-2A has in recent years been the fastest-growing U.S. work visa program, tripling over the past decade. Figure A shows the three available data sets on H-2A job certifications, petitions, and visas, as well as an estimate of the total number of H-2A workers between 2015 and 2024, with 352,682 H-2A workers estimated to have been employed in the United States last year. The vast majority of H-2A workers are employed on crop farms, picking fruits and vegetables, and the average duration of an H-2A job is roughly six months.

There have been countless exposés from journalists and advocates that reveal how H-2A farmworkers are indentured to their employers, frequently robbed, exploited, victimized, and trafficked, and how the main source of wage and hour violations on farms comes from employers breaking H-2A rules.

The rider adopted in the House would allow H-2A workers to be employed in year-round jobs—which is currently prohibited—expanding the scope of the program and allowing H-2A workers to fill jobs on dairy, livestock, and poultry and egg farms, as well as in nurseries and greenhouses and other nonseasonal agricultural occupations. This would be a major change to H-2A, and it has long been a demand of agribusiness.

Making H-2A year-round raises three key questions:

How many permanent, year-round jobs might be impacted?

How will farmworker wages be impacted?

How much will the H-2A program expand?

There are 410,000 year-round jobs in agriculture

For an answer to the first question, see Table 1, which lists four of the major agricultural industries employing farmworkers year-round, the largest of which are greenhouse and dairy jobs. Together they total nearly 410,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The industries listed do not include the many year-round (or nearly year-round) jobs that can be found on crop farms, including equipment operators and supervisors. In total, it’s possible that up to one-third of the total 1.6 million full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture could be year-round.

DOL’s new Adverse Effect Wage Rate will result in a pay cut for H-2A workers and U.S. workers that will line the pockets of employers by billions

Next, let’s consider what would happen to the wages of farmworkers in year-round occupations if the H-2A visa program were expanded to include them.

The wages of nearly all H-2A farmworkers are set by the Adverse Effect Wage Rate (AEWR), unless the federal, state, or local hourly minimum wages are higher, or if there is an applicable local prevailing wage or collective bargaining agreement in place. The purpose of the AEWR is to ensure that H-2A workers are paid a wage that is consistent with U.S. wage standards and prevent adverse impacts of H-2A employment on the wages of farmworkers in the United States.

On October 2, 2025, DOL issued an interim final rule laying out a new AEWR methodology. A recent EPI post describes in detail how the new Trump AEWR will cut wage rates dramatically by using an inferior data set for agriculture and creating two artificial “skill levels,” which set H-2A wages at the 17th percentile of wages surveyed for farm occupations (skill level 1) and at the 50th percentile, which is the median of wages surveyed (skill level 2).

In the new AEWR, the Trump DOL also removes the previous H-2A program requirement that employers pay for 100% of housing costs for H-2A workers. In its stead, the new AEWR deducts a set amount out of every hour of an H-2A worker’s pay, to compensate the employer for H-2A housing costs. This shifts housing costs to H-2A workers who will have the added burden of paying for housing costs out of the already-low wages they earn. The housing deduction is subtracted from the AEWR—lowering a low wage even further—so low that in many states, the state minimum wage will be higher and become the de facto AEWR.

In total, DOL estimates that over $1.7 billion will be transferred from H-2A workers’ pockets back to farm employers under the new wage rule in 2026, amounting to $24 billion over the next 10 years as the program grows to over 500,000 jobs. EPI’s own estimates are that H-2A workers will see a wage cut of between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion in 2026, depending on how state minimum wage laws are enforced. Reducing the AEWR for H-2A workers will also lower wages for U.S. farmworkers—one-third of whom are U.S.-born citizens, according to the latest DOL survey. A fall in the H-2A wage will increase demand for H-2A workers, since employers can save significantly on labor costs if they hire them. As a result, it will become relatively more expensive to hire non-H-2A U.S. farmworkers. Employers will therefore reduce demand for U.S. farmworkers, putting downward pressure on their wages, with U.S. farmworkers seeing wage reduction of $2.7 to $3.3 billion in annual pay.

This would represent a shocking upward redistribution of income away from some of the country’s most underpaid and essential workers for the food system.

Under the new AEWR, H-2A farmworkers in year-round jobs would be paid tens of thousands of dollars less annually compared with what U.S. farmworkers earn now

The wage cuts from the AEWR described above currently apply only to H-2A farmworkers, who can only be employed in seasonal jobs. However, if the rider to make H-2A year-round goes into effect, farmworkers in year-round jobs will see the biggest pay cuts.

Table 2 lists a sample of some of the main year-round agricultural industries in major agricultural states, along with average annual employment, which together accounts for about 15% of the total year-round full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture. Table 2 shows how much farmworkers earned annually, on average in 2024 in those industries and states, and compares the annual earnings of farmworkers in 2024 with what H-2A workers would earn in 2026 if they had worked in the same jobs and had been paid the corresponding 2026 AEWR at skill level 1 for the entire year (40 hours per week for 52 weeks), minus the annualized amount that will be deducted from hourly wages for housing according to the 2026 AEWR.

The final column in Table 2 shows a few examples that illustrate the difference between what year-round U.S. farmworkers in the selected industries earned in 2024 and what H-2A workers at skill level 1 would earn if they were paid the annualized AEWR in 2026. Table 2 shows that the reduction in wages for H-2A farmworkers in year-round jobs could range from an annual pay cut of nearly $21,000 for farmworkers on hog and pig farms in North Carolina to a pay cut of almost $44,000 for farmworkers on poultry and egg farms in Texas.

Outcomes such as these—in which farmworkers paid the 2026 AEWR would earn tens of thousands of dollars less than what U.S. farmworkers earned in major year-round jobs in 2024—are egregious and in violation of the spirit and letter of the AEWR and the H-2A statute, but will be the norm and allowed if the year-round H-2A provision in the rider becomes law. This would hurt some of the most vulnerable and lowest-paid workers in the U.S. labor market and create an almost unstoppable incentive for employers to replace their current farmworkers who now fill year-round jobs with H-2A workers who can’t easily switch employers or effectively complain when their wages are stolen and when they’re forced to work in unsafe conditions.

The year-round H-2A rider with the new AEWR rule could triple the current size of the H-2A program and cause wages to drop sharply for farmworkers

The ultimate result of the new H-2A wage rule combined with making the H-2A program year-round would be a likely tripling of the size of the H-2A program to about 900,000 workers, which includes the complete decimation of job quality for the 410,000 jobs in agriculture that can provide stable year-round employment and sometimes a living wage for U.S. farmworkers.

How would this occur? The Trump DOL’s new wage rule estimates that the lower pay for farmworkers it institutes will encourage farms to rapidly increase hiring through the H-2A program, estimating that 515,000 H-2A workers will be employed in 2034. If those low wages remain in effect and the year-round H-2A rider becomes law and is renewed yearly (as the H-2B riders have been every year), employers are likely to ramp up hiring for year-round jobs until nearly all are filled by H-2A workers who can be paid extremely low wages and, because of their precarious immigration status, have little bargaining power or the ability to complain in the face of employer lawbreaking.

For context, the 410,000 H-2A workers in year-round jobs plus the estimated 257,500 year-round equivalent jobs done by H-2A workers in seasonal jobs (i.e., 515,000 H-2A workers employed in 2034 for six months out of the year), would equal 667,500 full-time equivalent jobs in agriculture, or roughly 42% of all annual average employment in agriculture.

Instead of ballooning the H-2A program, policymakers should create a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers to ensure their rights on the job

Policymakers and the public must reject the harmful and unjustified proposals coming from Trump and Congress to pay less to farmworkers who already live on the margins of society, and to keep more of them indentured through the H-2A program. This rider is another example that reveals the truth about the Trump administration’s immigration agenda: They have no real interest in protecting jobs or pay for American or “native-born” workers, only in giving employers what they demand.

Using H-2A, a problematic temporary work visa program—in which workers are virtually indentured to their employers and that accounts for most of the wage and hour violations that take place on farms—to fill permanent, year-round jobs should give pause to all members of Congress. It makes no sense, unless the goal is to keep the workers employed in those jobs from having equal rights and fair pay. If migrant workers are filling true labor shortages in permanent, year-round jobs, then those workers should always get lawful permanent residence (i.e., green cards) that puts them on a path to citizenship.

If members of Congress want a reliable, healthy, and stable farm labor force that can continue to produce food domestically for Americans, they should pass legislation that legalizes undocumented farmworkers and reforms the H-2A program so that all migrant farmworkers have equal rights, fair wages, and a quick path to permanent residence and citizenship. That’s the only way to ensure that the workers who sustain the food supply chain will be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve and that honors their contributions to the U.S. economy.

The amounts have not been adjusted for inflation. The 2026 AEWR provides two “skill levels” for farmworkers—which are set at specific percentiles along the distribution of OEWS wages surveyed. Skill level 1 is the 17th percentile while skill level 2 is the median of wages surveyed, which is also the 50th percentile. For this calculation, I am only calculating the wage differentials for H-2A workers in year-round jobs who are classified by employers at skill level 1, which DOL estimates will account for 92% of all H-2A workers.",https://files.epi.org/uploads/shutterstock_2599517487-950x535.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:57:46.900409

Issued at the start of his second term, the plan is the first from Mr. Trump's immigration agenda that the Supreme Court will evaluate on the legal merits. The justices have been asked to intervene in several challenges to Mr. Trump's immigration policies, but did so at early stages of the cases and through emergency requests for relief.

No lower court that has been confronted with legal challenges to the birthright citizenship order has embraced the Trump administration's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause. Still, the Justice Department has argued that those decisions are wrong, claiming that the Constitution does not grant citizenship to the children of ""temporary visitors or illegal aliens.""

Section 1 of the 14th Amendment states: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, said, ""No president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.""

""For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump's executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress,"" Wang said in a statement. ""We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.""

Mr. Trump issued his executive order on birthright citizenship on his first day back in the White House. Under the plan, children born in the U.S. to parents who are either in the country illegally or on a temporary basis are not recognized as U.S. citizens.

The president's directive sought to reverse more than a century of understanding that the 14th Amendment grants citizenship to babies born on U.S. soil, with exceptions for children born to diplomats and foreign military forces. The Supreme Court addressed the issue 127 years ago, ruling in 1898 that the Citizenship Clause ties U.S. citizenship to place of birth.

Mr. Trump's executive order is a pillar of his immigration agenda, but it has yet to take effect. The policy faced a slew of legal challenges soon after it was issued, and lower courts uniformly blocked its implementation. Then, the Supreme Court agreed to intervene during the early stages of three different cases, but did not consider the underlying legality of Mr. Trump's proposal.

Instead, the issue before the justices was the scope of relief granted by lower courts hearing the birthright citizenship cases, which had issued nationwide injunctions preventing the administration from enforcing the policy. The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, curtailed the ability of district court judges to issue those universal orders, but said plaintiffs could seek broad relief through class-action lawsuits. It also left open the possibility that states could secure nationwide relief.

On the heels of that ruling, two babies subject to Mr. Trump's order and their parents, as well as a pregnant woman, filed a lawsuit challenging the birthright citizenship order on behalf of a putative nationwide class. A federal district court in New Hampshire certified as a provisional class all babies who would be denied birthright citizenship by the president's plan and found that the order likely violates the Constitution.

The district court barred the Trump administration from enforcing the plan against all impacted by it.

The Supreme Court is taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit has weighed in.

It did not act on another appeal involving four states, Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon, that had been before the high court in a preliminary posture. In July, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order was invalid because it contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all born in the U.S.

The 9th Circuit split 2-1 to leave in place a nationwide injunction that had been issued by a district court in February, finding it was necessary to give the states complete relief.

The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to take up both cases and issue a final decision on whether Mr. Trump's executive order is constitutionally sound. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said it's a ""mistaken view"" that birth on U.S. soil confers citizenship, and said that understanding has had ""destructive consequences.""

On the first day of his second term, Trump signed an executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship for children born to undocumented parents or parents who have lawful, but temporary, residency status.

Several lower courts this year have determined that order violated the 14th Amendment, which automatically confers citizenship to those born in the U.S., as well as federal immigration law.

Responding to a request from the Trump administration, the Supreme Court Friday agreed to review a lower court ruling permanently barring the government from enforcing Trump’s order.

In asking the Supreme Court to review the case, the Trump administration claimed that birthright citizenship can only apply to children born to one parent who is a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident.

The lower court determined that argument contradicts the 14th Amendment’s Citizenship Clause, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

Trump’s attempt to end birthright citizenship stems from his vast xenophobic crackdown on every form of immigration to the U.S.

Trump ran for a second term on promises to conduct “mass deportations.” Since taking office, he has presided over widespread, aggressive immigration raids and imposed a travel ban on citizens of 19 countries that he determines to be “high-risk.”

Friday’s move marks the second time the Supreme Court has intervened in a case challenging Trump’s birthright citizenship order.

In June, the court’s conservative majority struck down multiple bans to Trump’s order, claiming that individual judges did not have the authority to bar its enforcement nationwide. However, that decision did not address the underlying constitutionality and merits of the order.

These and other strategies are part of very organized preparations hatched to counter President Donald Trump’s hardline policy toward the nation’s immigrants.

The Immigrant Defense Network (IDN) — an umbrella group of about 100 immigrant, labor, legal, faith and community organizations — has trained about 2,500 Minnesotans to respond to actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including last month’s road on the Bro-Tex facility in St. Paul.

IDN-trained “constitutional observers” were also dispatched Nov. 25 to a home in St. Paul where an ICE operation turned into a melee and federal agents used tear gas and pepper spray against protesters.

These volunteers deploy observers to scenes of ICE activity and organize public demonstrations and other events in support of the state’s immigrants.

The observers, many of whom are multilingual, are trained and provided secure, toll-free phone and texting options, according to the IDN’s strategic plan.

Edwin Torres, the IDN’s network manager, said a rapid-response team was able to get to the Bro-Tex facility within 12 minutes, and the St. Paul home in 10 minutes.

But the new ICE operations are different, he said, and the “constitutional observers” are now arriving at a site after federal agents have quickly whisked the immigrant they were seeking away.

“We are not seeing large-scale operations this week,” Torres said.

Instead, there have been 20 ICE detentions of individuals — mostly of Latino men and a few Somalis, Torres said — and IDN can do little more than only offer help to tearful families of the immigrants who have been detained. Sometimes, there’s only a car with a broken window left at the scene.

Related: Do administrative warrants allow ICE to enter and search your house?

Undaunted, IDN members are patrolling the streets, sifting through tips to find those that are “credible or verified” and sending alerts when needed by text, email and phone calls to its constitutional observers.

Torres said IDN has a system that uses the boundaries of state House districts to determine which people to call to respond to an incident at a certain address.

Julia Decker, policy director of the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said the state’s immigrant advocates have had time to organize and train volunteers because “it’s taken a little bit longer for this type of surge to reach Minnesota.”

“So, we’ve seen, we had a chance to see some of the tactics that have been used by the federal government and other cities, and so there’s been a little bit more time to prepare and see what we are likely to face,” Decker said.

Trump has ordered immigration crackdowns on Los Angeles, Memphis, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Charlotte, N.C., and, this week, New Orleans and the Twin Cities. The president says the reason for the operations is to fight violent crime he attributes to immigrants.

In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., last week, Trump said immigrant communities are “illegal and disruptive populations” that “hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for.”

Trump said his crackdown on the Twin Cities, which the Department of Homeland Security has dubbed “Operation Metro Surge,” was based on the involvement of Somalis in the Feeding our Future scandal, in which millions of dollars were siphoned off from a pandemic-era program aimed at feeding hungry children. Other scams included one involving reimbursements for assistance for nonexistent services for people at risk for homelessness.

But those involved in the fraud were a fraction of one percent of Minnesota’s 80,000-strong Somali community, most of whom are U.S. citizens or legal residents.

The day after he called Somalis “garbage” during a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump doubled down on those comments and said Somalia “is considered by many to be the worst country on earth.” He also accused Somali immigrants of having “destroyed the country.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said this week that his agency is investigating allegations that tax dollars from Minnesota were diverted to the militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.

‘Living in a time where we have to be careful’

Torres said the idea for IDN was developed after Trump won the 2024 election.

The organization has a seven-member steering committee composed of a variety of both large and small immigrant advocates and human rights groups. They include ACLU-Minnesota, Ayala Leads, COPAL (Communities Organizing Latine Power and Action), the Minnesota Interfaith Coalition on Immigration (ICOM) and the Land Stewardship Project, a group that promotes sustainable agriculture and defends immigrant rights in Greater Minnesota.

Minnesota 8 — an organization that was formed to fight the deportation of eight Cambodian nationals in 2016 and is now an advocate for undocumented Asians in the state — and The Advocates for Human Rights are also members of the steering committee.

Dozens of other groups are affiliated with IDN, including CAIR-Minnesota, an organization that aims to protect the rights of the state’s Muslims.

But information about most of those allied with IDN is not public. And the organization pulled information, including a detailed strategic plan that lays out the group’s operational plans and political goals, from its website after Trump attacked Minnesota’s Somali community this week and his administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Monday.

“Right now, we are living in a time where we have to be careful,” Torres said. “At this moment we have to be more protective of what we have online.”

He said the group’s immediate goal is “to counter the hateful narrative” about immigrants that is coming from the White House with stories about how newcomers to the nation enrich American life.

“We can’t be OK with the rhetoric,” Torres said.

UnidosMN, which organizes Minnesota’s Latino community, is not under the IDN umbrella but also sends volunteers to try to disrupt ICE operations in Minnesota and western Wisconsin under its “Monarca” program.

“It doesn’t matter how many rapid-response teams groups are called for,” UnidosMN spokesman Luis Argueta said. “(IDN) may respond to one side of town and we to another.”

Argueta, however, said the current immigration sweep in Minnesota has prompted some collaboration and conversations between IDN and his organization.

He also said UnidosMN is receiving tips on ICE operations from both the public and elected officials.

A history of immigrant advocacy

Torres said the IDN also plans to lobby the state Legislature, seeking an end to agreements between ICE and local governments and sheriffs in Greater Minnesota, passing “affirmative resolutions” to aid immigrants in the state’s suburbs and advocating for public health and public school policies that are beneficial to immigrant communities.

According to the group’s strategic plan, IDN representatives also plan to spend at least five hours every week meeting with elected officials and “sector influencers” to lobby for immigrant rights.

Trump has characterized protests against ICE actions as unlawful and has characterized some protesters as “thugs” or “domestic terrorists.”

He has also blamed outside agitators and leftist groups for organizing the unrest.

The president’s supporters also share Trump’s views — that immigrants, especially those from Third World countries, are a danger to American society and the American way of life — and support the surge in deportations.

Yet Trump’s plans to crack down on Minnesota’s immigrants are running up against the state’s history and culture.

“Minnesota has a long history of immigration and refugee settlement, and this history has created a comparatively strong infrastructure of immigrant advocacy and support organizations,” said Llana Barber, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota.

Barber also said that Minnesota, particularly the Twin Cities, also has a “comparatively progressive political culture.”

“Many Minnesotans view the current federal enforcement efforts as grounded in racism and xenophobia and oppose them on those grounds,” Barber said. “They see current efforts to threaten and terrorize immigrants as part of an authoritarian expansion of state power, not a legitimate effort to enforce US law.”

In the 32 years she’s owned and operated her North Broad Street business “Ricard’s Inc.,” it’s taken plenty of sweat and toil to keep the lights on.

“I’ve survived hurricanes, the pandemic, the buyout of a partner, all of these things, and I’ve never been in a situation like this,” Krivjanick said.

But Krivjanick said she has recently started having trouble finding electricians, housekeepers, delivery drivers all essential to her work managing short-term rentals and selling restaurant, catering and janitorial products. People are not showing up or just outright quitting, she said, and she attributes this to workers being afraid that federal immigration agents will target people who have brown skin — even creole women, like her.

She’s not alone.

Broad Street traverses several of the city’s neighborhoods from Broadmoor to the 7th Ward. Long an epicenter of Black-owned businesses, Broad Street is now also a commercial hub for the city’s Latino community. The street and adjacent ones are peppered with a wide variety of businesses — hair salons, grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, auto repair shops, veterinarians and fast food stores. On the strip of Broad between Canal and Tulane, businesses such as Morenita Plus, Ideal Market and Botanica San Simon are frequented by Latino customers. On a normal weekday, music pulses from popular store fronts and people line up at Taqueria El Poblano for lunch.

But now, as the Department of Homeland Security launches Operation Catahoula Crunch, many in the Broad Street business community who spoke with Verite News, say they feel increasingly placed in a quandary: wanting to keep their businesses operating as usual but worried that customers and workers could feel at-risk of being swept up in the operation, which has a reported goal of arresting 5,000 people. They’re saying that the fear that’s gripped residents of New Orleans is negatively impacting business. Some business owners are taking small steps to help where they can.

Others expressed fear of speaking out and drawing the unwanted gaze of immigration agents. Many say that federal law enforcement using aggressive tactics to round up people they see as part of their community is not normal, desired or helpful for business.

“This is not America. This is not who we are,” Krivjanick said. “We don’t have masked men running up to us, grabbing us, throwing us into unidentified cars, you know or to beat us up on the street.”

DHS says the masks worn by many immigration agents protect them from people learning details about them and their families.

Krivjanick said the tactic makes people afraid of the government.

On top of the worker shortage, short-term renters are calling, Krivjanick said, and asking if the U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement is still going to be roaming the streets around the New Year’s holiday or Mardi Gras. Those are times when Krivjanick typically expects her rentals to fill up. She doesn’t know what to say, because she doesn’t know herself.

In her experience, people come to New Orleans to enjoy themselves. Potential renters Krivjanick said, who’ve seen scenes from other Border Patrol operations across the country play out don’t think a confrontation with masked agents compliments the partying, drinking, dining and dancing people anticipate when planning a trip to New Orleans. Three potential tenants canceled on her earlier this week, citing ICE as a reason for cancelling, she said.

In response to Verite News questions about fears of people being targeted for their skin color, DHS denied that it engages in racial and ethnic profiling, calling allegations that it does so disgusting, reckless and false.

Allowing workers to stay home is one step some businesses said they’re taking to help alleviate the anxiety they’re hearing in light of stories of Border Patrol agents profiling and detaining people.

“I can’t ask anybody to come to work right now,” said Krivjanick, choking on some of her words, “I simply can’t, because I feel if I made pressure and said, ‘Hey, you know, if you come in, I’ll pay you a little extra,’ if I do that and something happens to the family, yeah, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.”

Tommy LeBlanc, co-owner of HEY Coffee Co., based off of North Broad Street, also said he didn’t want to encourage people to come out to an upcoming fundraiser if they didn’t feel safe. On Wednesday, he and his friend, José Chris Blanco, co-owner of Waska, a pop-up store that specializes in cooking arepas, were hosting an event at LeBlanc’s Broadmoor location.

A portion of the proceeds were set to go to a local nonprofit that serves some of the area’s Hispanic community, Puentes New Orleans. Blanco cooked food and said 70% of the profits from Waska would go to Puentes. LeBlanc said 20% of the day’s sales at his other coffee shop in Broadmoor would go to Puentes. LeBlanc’s shop also sells a coffee blend, café con sueños, that launched this summer and whose proceeds go to Puentes NOLA’s mission.

“We’re just trying to take the time to show our neighbors, our Latino neighbors, that they are cherished and welcome, as far as we’re concerned,” LeBlanc said.

Puentes New Orleans normally works to promote better outcomes in education, career development and cultural integration. But they’ve recently had to pivot into crisis mode, to address the fear and panic setting in among families as uncertainty around the immigration enforcement operation looms, according to the non-profit’s executive director, Angela Ramirez.

For Blanco, whose business is mobile and who has sometimes worked on Broad Street, spending a day cooking arepas so that 70% of the proceeds could go to Puentes New Orleans was a “no-brainer.”

“I love what they do, what they stand for,” Blanco said.

Blanco was born in Colombia, grew up in Miami, worked as a chef in Vermont, and started his pop-up around the end of 2022, he said. For the first time since coming to the country, Blanco is carrying around his green card with him, which he called “pretty wild.”

“I’ve never had to walk around with my residence card, and even that … doesn’t give me 100% protection against what ICE is doing,” he said.

As the Trump administration has deployed surges of immigration agents to cities around the country, they have been accused of detaining people based on the way they look, the language they speak or their place of work. American citizens have been detained in the operations, as well.

He also said he knows people who are not leaving their homes.

“Is this, like, Nazi Germany? Like, what’s going on?” Blanco asked. “People are hiding because they don’t want to go out because they’re afraid of being abducted.”

Blanco’s business partner, Marcella Garcia, said she sees the residents of New Orleans as a fearless people, and that she hopes that those who can will help protect the people who are the most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions by raising awareness of what agents are doing.

Several Broad Street business owners would only speak anonymously for fear of being targeted by federal immigration agents.

One said he’s losing money in sales daily because some of his customers are afraid to come out to shop, and some of his employees are afraid to come to work. He said they’re scared to be targeted even driving around. In places right outside of the city, a routine traffic stop could lead to immigration detention and deportation.

Malaysia Walker, who’s a longtime seamstress and works as a general manager at Broadway Bound Costume Supplies, was sewing the base for a Mardi Gras Indian suit when she spoke with Verite News.

Walker said that as far as she can tell, her business has not been impacted by the operation, but she was personally not fond of the idea of expanded law enforcement in the streets.

“I do feel it’s an extreme way to handle the situation, and I think it’s going to bring more harm than good to the city,” Walker said.

On Tuesday afternoon at Coffee Science on South Broad Street, plastic whistles sat in a container near the sales register, as business was winding down for the day.

Co-owner Leah Vautrot said that the whistles are there for community members to use as a tool to draw attention to immigration agents to alert others of their presence and help prevent people from being isolated or quietly detained. She said that, as a community hub committed to social justice, the business felt a responsibility to stand up for its neighbors.

“Disappearing our neighbors off the street should never be normalized. That’s why we’re doing what we can, however small, to create resources that help our customers recognize when ICE is present, alert others, and draw a crowd,” said Vautrot.

Vautrot said that what she’s witnessing feels like something out of 1933 Germany, when Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany, and his Nazi party completed its takeover of the country’s government.

She also highlighted the important role that immigrants, foreign farms and global exchange play in the main product they sell — coffee — and she said she’s opposed to the idea of disrupting the livelihood of the families that enable their business “from origin to cup.”

“If we don’t stand up for dignity and due process, we’re complicit in a system that erases people,” Vautrot said. “And people are not disposable.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-85/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/20251202_czb_broadstreet_23-2048x1382-1-1024x6911764963310.jpg?h=37702503&itok=lDiP-qEz,N,,2025-12-05 16:57:30.425084

Under the order, which has never gone into effect, people born in the United States would not be automatically entitled to citizenship if their parents are in this country either illegally or temporarily. The challengers argue that the order conflicts with both the text of the Constitution and the court’s longstanding case law.

The announcement came in a brief list of orders from the justices’ private conference on Friday morning. The court will release another list of orders, including the cases from Friday’s conference in which it has denied review, on Monday at 9:30 a.m. EST.

The United States is one of roughly 30 countries, including Canada and Mexico, that offer automatic citizenship to nearly everyone born there. Birthright citizenship was added to the Constitution in 1868 when the 14th Amendment was adopted following the Civil War. The section of that amendment known as the citizenship clause provides that “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The amendment was intended to overrule one of the Supreme Court’s most notorious decisions, its 1857 ruling in Dred Scott v. Sandford, holding that a Black person whose ancestors were brought to the United States and enslaved was not entitled to any protection from the federal courts because he was not a U.S. citizen.

In a related case in 1898, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Wong Kim Ark, who was born in California to parents of Chinese descent. By a vote of 6-2, the court rejected the government’s argument that Wong Kim Ark was not a U.S. citizen, with Justice Horace Gray explaining that the 14th Amendment – although enacted to establish the citizenship of Black people – “affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens.”

In his dissent, Chief Justice Melville Fuller argued that Wong Kim Ark was not a U.S. citizen because he could not be “completely subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States: as Chinese citizens, his parents had a duty to the emperor of China, and a federal law barred them from becoming U.S. citizens.

Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship spurred multiple lawsuits. In Seattle, one federal judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from enforcing the order, while a federal judge in Maryland separately blocked the Trump administration from enforcing the order while a challenge by immigrants’ rights groups and several individual pregnant women moved forward.

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court in the spring. But U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer did not ask the justices to weigh in on the legality of the president’s order. Instead, the issue before the court was the propriety of so-called “universal” or “nationwide” injunctions – orders by federal district courts that bar the government from enforcing a law or policy anywhere in the country. After the Supreme Court issued its ruling in late June, holding that district court judges generally cannot issue such orders, challenges to Trump’s order continued in the lower courts – and lower courts once again ruled for the challengers.

In Barbara v. Trump, a federal district judge in New Hampshire issued a preliminary injunction that barred the Trump administration from enforcing the executive order against a class of babies born on or after Feb. 20, 2025, who are or would be denied U.S. citizenship by Trump’s order. And in Trump v. Washington, a divided panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that the executive order “is invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment’s grant of citizenship to ‘all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.’”

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court at the end of September, asking justices to take up both cases. In its petition for review, it argued that the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause was “adopted to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens.” The challengers and the lower courts cannot rely on the court’s 1898 decision in Wong Kim Ark, it argues, because the parents in that case lived permanently in the United States even if they weren’t U.S. citizens.

Opposing review, the challengers countered that the Supreme Court has already decided, more than a century ago in Wong Kim Ark’s case, what the citizenship clause means. But in any event, they wrote, in 1940 (and again in 1952) Congress enacted a federal law that essentially codified the citizenship clause, and it did so with Wong Kim Ark in mind, so that Trump’s executive order also violates federal law.

On Friday afternoon, the court granted the Trump administration’s petition for review in the Barbara case. The justices apparently did not act on the administration’s petition for review in Trump v. Washington. If, as seems likely, the court does not take up that case, it will presumably remain on hold until the court issues its decision in the New Hampshire case.

The court also did not indicate that it intends to fast-track the Barbara case, which means that the justices will likely hear oral arguments in the spring, with a decision to follow by late June or early July.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1393695657.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 17:58:54.067863

And it says that the policy of the United States should be to help Europe “correct its current trajectory” over the course of the next several decades.

“The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the document says.
The United States’ latest criticism of Europe came on a day when trans-Atlantic tensions were already running hot.","The Trump administration said on Friday that Europe was facing the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” and pledged that the United States would support like-minded “patriotic” parties across the continent to prevent a future in which “certain NATO members will become majority non-European.”

The grim assessment of Europe’s future was released overnight as part of an annual update to the United States’ national security strategy around the world.

Without naming them directly, the document says the United States should be “cultivating resistance” across Europe by supporting political parties that fight against migration and promote nationalism. That describes several right-wing populist parties like Reform U.K. in Britain and the Alternative for Germany, known as the AfD, which has been classified as an extremist party by German intelligence services.

“In everything we do, we are putting America First,” Mr. Trump wrote in a foreword to the document, which he called a “road map to ensure that America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.”

In a section called “Promoting European Greatness,” the document offers a searing critique of America’s closest allies.

It warns that Europe is on a path to becoming “unrecognizable” because of migration policies that it claims are undermining the national identities of European countries. And it says that the policy of the United States should be to help Europe “correct its current trajectory” over the course of the next several decades.

“We want Europe to remain European, to regain its civilizational self-confidence and to abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” the 33-page document says.

Mr. Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the political leadership in Europe, and he has repeatedly pressured those leaders to bend to his will on funding for NATO, trade and tariffs. Vice President JD Vance issued a broad critique of Europe’s mainstream political parties in a speech in Munich in February and urged them to end the isolation of far-right parties across the continent.

The document accuses the European Union and other “transnational bodies” of undermining liberty and sovereignty, censoring free speech and trampling on basic principles of democracy to suppress political opposition.

“The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism,” the document says. “Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory.”

Within hours of its release, the document was already provoking sharp retorts from across Europe.

Johann Wadephul, the foreign minister for Germany, responded on Friday by saying that Germany did not “believe that we need to get advice here from any country or party.”

He told journalists in Berlin that the United States was Germany’s most important ally in NATO but that “questions like freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and how we organize our liberal society here in the Federal Republic of Germany are not part of that.”

“It’s a frontal attack on the European Union,” said Brando Benifei, an Italian member of the European Parliament who chairs the delegation for relations with the United States. He called the document “totally unacceptable,” full of “extreme, shocking phrases,” and said some of its statements amounted to direct calls for election interference.

The United States’ latest criticism of Europe came on a day when trans-Atlantic tensions were already running hot. The European Union announced on Friday that it would fine X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, $140 million for breaching the bloc’s transparency rules, including through what it called the “deceptive design” of its blue check mark for verified accounts.

As rumors about the fine circulated on Thursday, Mr. Vance criticized the European Union for the expected move, writing on X that the bloc should be “supporting free speech not attacking American companies over garbage.”

The administration’s approach to Europe, as described in the strategy document, was in stark contrast to the way it said it would treat some countries in other parts of the world.

A section of the document titled “The Middle East: Shift Burdens, Build Peace” argues that while the United States should “continue to encourage” the countries in the region to combat radicalism, it should not overly meddle in their internal concerns.

It calls for “dropping America’s misguided experiment with hectoring these nations — especially the Gulf monarchies — into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government,” adding, “We should encourage and applaud reform when and where it emerges organically, without trying to impose it from without.”

The document adds that what is crucial to a successful Middle East policy is “accepting the region, its leaders and its nations as they are” and makes no mention of human rights issues like the treatment of women or the killing of a Washington Post columnist, which the C.I.A. believes was approved by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.

And it appears to echo Mr. Putin’s language by insisting that the United States should be “ending the perception, and preventing the reality, of NATO as a perpetually expanding alliance.”

Ian Lesser, who heads the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund, a research group, said that the document would reinforce Europe’s existing concerns about the state of the trans-Atlantic relationship and the U.S. position toward Russia, and that it might further embolden the far right in Europe.

“The piece treats Europe as a sort of other, one that is a model of what not to do,” he said, adding that it underscored that the United States was not isolationist, but rather “unilateralist.”

“It really reinforces existing concerns and puts a sharper edge on them,” he said.

Carlo Calenda, a center-left, pro-European senator in Italy, said on Friday that the document showed that Mr. Trump was an “enemy of Europe,” and “an enemy of democracy.” He said that efforts by European politicians to try to flatter Mr. Trump had not worked to promote their own interests.

“He’s a bully, and you cannot face a bully by being warm and kind,” he added. “It’s not the way in which you can manage him.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/05trump-europe-ftvz/05trump-europe-ftvz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:58:07.416354

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an appeal in a case challenging President Trump’s birthright citizenship executive order that seeks to deny U.S. citizenship to many babies born in the United States.

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Trump v. Barbara. Courts have repeatedly blocked the administration from implementing the executive order, finding it violates the Constitution, over a century of Supreme Court precedent, and a longstanding federal statute.

The Barbara case is a nationwide class action, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of New Hampshire, ACLU of Maine, ACLU of Massachusetts, Legal Defense Fund, Asian Law Caucus, and Democracy Defenders Fund on behalf of babies who would be subject to the executive order.

This summer, the federal court in the Barbara case granted a preliminary injunction that protects birthright citizenship for all children born on U.S. soil.

Birthright citizenship is the legal principle, guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, that every baby born in the United States is a U.S. citizen. The Trump administration’s order seeks to deny citizenship to children unless one of their parents is a U.S. citizen or has permanent immigration status, excluding children born to parents on temporary work, student, or other visas, or without immigration status at the time of birth.

This assault on birthright citizenship flouts the Constitution’s dictates, longstanding Supreme Court precedent, a statute passed by Congress, and fundamental American values.

“No president can change the 14th Amendment’s fundamental promise of citizenship,” said Cecillia Wang, ACLU national legal director. “For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth. The federal courts have unanimously held that President Trump’s executive order is contrary to the Constitution, a Supreme Court decision from 1898, and a law enacted by Congress. We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term.”

“Our Constitution and the more than a century of court decisions on this topic are overwhelmingly clear: no politician can decide who among those born in this country is worthy of citizenship. We will continue fighting this cruel executive order to ensure that every child born in the United States has their right to citizenship protected instead of being relegated to a permanent, multigenerational subclass of people born in the U.S. but who are denied full rights,” said SangYeob Kim, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the ACLU of New Hampshire.

“The Trump administration’s attempts to unilaterally rewrite the 14th Amendment — an essential Reconstruction-era measure that granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S., including formerly enslaved people — will not stand,” said Morenike Fajana, senior counsel at the Legal Defense Fund. “We look forward to going before the Supreme Court to uphold the constitutional promise of citizenship for all babies born in America.”

“It’s deeply troubling that we must waste precious judicial resources relitigating what has been settled constitutional law for over a century,” said Aarti Kohli, executive director of Asian Law Caucus. “Every federal judge who has considered this executive order has found it unconstitutional. If implemented, this policy would force all parents — including U.S. citizens — to prove their immigration status just to get a birth certificate or Social Security number for their baby, inevitably leading to racial profiling based on names, appearance, or accent.”

“The attack on the fundamental right of birthright citizenship is an attack on the 14th Amendment and our Constitution,” said Tianna Mays, legal director for Democracy Defenders Fund. “We are confident the court will affirm this basic right, which has stood for over a century. Millions of families across the country deserve and require that clarity and stability.”

‘The 14th Amendment established birthright citizenship as a bedrock principle on which Congress and the Supreme Court, together with generations of Americans, have worked to build a modern, democratic, and pluralistic society. By creating an unlawful regime where some American babies are treated as second-class citizens based on their parentage, the Trump administration is taking a sledgehammer to the foundations of that society. The ACLU will not let that happen. The court should use this opportunity to reaffirm its century-old precedents and confirm, once and for all, that birthright citizenship is here to stay,” said Carol Rose, executive director at the ACLU of Massachusetts.

Additionally, these same legal groups brought another birthright citizenship lawsuit, which is on behalf of three organizations with members whose babies born on U.S. soil would be denied citizenship under the order: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, League of United Latin American Citizens, and Make the Road New York.",https://www.aclu-nh.org/app/themes/aclu-parent/img/press-release.png,N,,2025-12-05 15:57:50.615068

Wong Kim Ark.","WASHINGTON (CN) — After greenlighting its enforcement, the Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether President Donald Trump’s policy limiting birthright citizenship is constitutional.

The appeal sets up a constitutional showdown over the meaning of the 14th Amendment that could result in new limits on American citizenship for immigrants.

In a day-one executive order, Trump declared the children of individuals who do not have legal status or who possess temporary legal status would be excluded from the “priceless and profound gift” of United States citizenship. The White House said the new limits were justified because immigrants without legal status and foreigners participating in “birth tourism” had degraded the meaning and value of American citizenship.

Immigrants, Democratic states and mothers quickly sued to block the order from going into effect. Several lower courts issued nationwide injunctions prohibiting the policy from being enforced.

Trump appealed to the Supreme Court, but he only asked that the justices weigh in on whether universal injunctions — that allow a singular federal judge to issue nationwide orders — were lawful. In a sharply divided 6-3 ruling, the conservative majority nixed universal injunctions, allowing Trump to enforce limits on birthright citizenship without deciding whether his order was constitutional.

The lower courts swiftly responded, finding a variety of ways to keep Trump’s order paused without violating the Supreme Court’s June ruling. A Maryland court certified children who would be subjected to the policy into a class — a legal process that assesses the commonality between a group of people within a class action. Another court blocked the order within the states that have challenged the policy as unlawful.

An appeals court then ruled that Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally stripped the children of some individuals without legal status of their citizenship rights.

Despite agreement from the lower courts, Trump urged the Supreme Court to intervene again, framing his order as a major policy of his administration.

“The order forms an integral part of the administration’s broader effort to prevent illegal immigration,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote. “This court has previously granted review when lower courts have blocked similarly significant administration policies.”

Under the 14th Amendment, “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Trump claimed that people in the country illegally or temporarily are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S. and therefore are not necessarily citizens.

The justices acknowledged that the case would likely return to them on the merits, but the families and nonprofits challenging the order said there are good reasons to deny Trump’s appeal.

Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the Constitution, a federal statute and 127 years of Supreme Court precedent. The vast majority of scholars considered birthright citizenship settled in 1898 when the Supreme Court upheld the right for children of noncitizens in United States v. Wong Kim Ark.

The families and nonprofits said that Wong Kim Ark already rejected Trump’s arguments.

“Petitioners offer no substantial reason to doubt Wong Kim Ark’s holding or its application to the categories targeted by the order,” the families and nonprofits wrote. “Their case amounts to little more than a jumble of historical misstatements, inapposite citations, newly manufactured doctrines, and — more than anything else — policy preferences.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/02/woman-and-child-immigrant-us-birthright-citizenship.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-05 17:58:59.777292

An appeals court ordered the inquiry into whether the Merit Systems Protection Board and Office of Special Counsel are meeting their obligations amid Trump’s efforts to oust critics. Trump pushed the justices to pause the ruling, calling the inquiry a “fishing expedition” that risks intrusive and needless discovery and raises serious separation-of-powers concerns.

“If qualms about an agency’s ‘independence’ permit ignoring Congress’s decision to channel claims to that agency, it could be open season on agency-review processes in the Fourth Circuit,” U.S. Solicitor John Sauer wrote.

Chief Justice John Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, quickly granted an administrative stay on Friday afternoon, temporarily pausing proceedings until the high court rules on Trump’s application.

The dispute began as a policy challenge to a rule barring immigration judges — U.S. attorney general-appointed attorneys who preside over deportation cases — from publicly expressing personal views on immigration. The National Association of Immigration Judges filed suit in 2020, but it was dismissed in 2023 for jurisdictional issues.

On appeal, the association argued the lawsuit should be treated as an enforcement challenge to an unconstitutional policy, rather than an employment action that must go through the Merit Systems Protection Board.

The Fourth Circuit, however, raised serious concerns about whether the board and special counsel can independently review adverse actions against federal employees, noting that Trump fired the Office of Special Counsel chief and removed merit board members earlier this year.

These and other adjudicatory boards were created under the Civil Service Reform Act.

Trump argued that Supreme Court precedent required that federal employees exhaust administrative remedies before filing a case in federal court. The administration chastised the appeals court for trying to revise precedent based on recent factual developments.

“‘[U]nelected judges’ do not get ‘to update the intent of unchanged congressional statutes if the court believes recent political events…alter the operation of a statute from the way Congress intended,’” Sauer wrote. “Further, the court of appeals’ unheard-of approach to channeling risks ‘far-reaching implications’ for all manner of jurisdictional schemes, which may be textually unambiguous yet susceptible to concerns that those schemes too are purportedly not working as Congress intended.”

If the Supreme Court did not intervene now, the administration warned that the government wouldn’t lose its opportunity to challenge the Fourth Circuit’s decision. The Trump administration said it would ask the justices to formally review the issue on the court’s merit docket to prevent other lower courts from issuing similar rulings.

“The court of appeals’ novel jurisdictional rule apparently demands constant relitigation of the present-day ‘functionality’ of the CSRA, as well as every agency-review scheme that might be said to have been undermined by subsequent factual events,” Sauer said. “Indeed, other district courts are already tilting at that windmill, perversely preventing the CSRA from working as Congress actually intended and depriving the MSPB of matters that Congress reserved for its resolution in the first instance.”

Roberts asked the association to respond to Trump’s application by Dec. 10.

Trump’s emergency appeal comes days before the Supreme Court hears oral arguments over the legality of executive branch firings on administrative boards.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/05/donald-trump-signs-drug-prices-executive-order.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-05 15:58:52.634392

The rights group condemned the incident and asserted that it violated the rights of asylum seekers. It also viewed it as the consequence of the US’s recent immigration policies. Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at HRW, stated that immigration enforcement measures at sporting events could tear families apart and expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger.

Worden’s statement came after the police arrested a man in New Jersey while he was waiting to attend the Club World Cup tournament final with his family. The man and his family left their country of origin in 2022, fleeing death threats from armed groups. According to HRW, the man was initially arrested for unintentionally violating the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)’s directive prohibiting the use of drones in and around stadiums during sporting events, which usually only results in a fine. However, law enforcement officers asked the man about his immigration status and handed him over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The latter detained him and moved to deport him to his country of origin, where his life might be at risk.

The rights group explained that states and local law enforcement agencies that do not have arrangements with ICE, known as 287(g) agreements, should not ask people about their immigration status or arrest them to investigate their status. Additionally, agencies included in these agreements should take note of any inherent abuses and abandon them. HRW also pointed out that FIFA, as the World Cup organizer, should take action to address the impacts the US immigration policies might have on the running of the 2026 World Cup and ensure the safety of all eligible individuals during the event.

Rights organizations have criticized US President Donald Trump’s administration for its immigration enforcement measures, including raids and mass detentions, which have been cited as human rights violations. In September, an immigrant rights organization and Washington, DC, residents filed a complaint against the administration, alleging illegal arrests of immigrants. Authorities also raided a Hyundai-LG battery plant in the US, executing a search warrant with ICE and other law enforcement agencies, which resulted in the detention of over 300 Korean citizens.

Advertising Afghans are not the only immigrant group that has been specifically targeted under the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown.","From her home in Tacoma, S has watched the flurry of immigration policy changes issued by the Trump administration in recent days with horror.

The Afghan woman was granted asylum in 2022 and applied for a green card in 2023, but has not received an update on her application since last December, when she fulfilled a request for medical records. She fears that application, now paused, may ultimately be denied, and that her asylum status, under new scrutiny, may be terminated.

If her case is litigated, “I would say to the judge, or whoever decides, that I would want to die here,” said S, who asked to go by her first initial because she fears speaking out could negatively impact her immigration case or result in attacks from the public.

“I will definitely be killed (if deported), but if I had the choice of dying here —” she stopped, her voice catching in her throat.

In the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members last week, allegedly carried out by an Afghan national, the Trump administration has begun a sweeping crackdown on immigration that could drastically alter the lives of immigrants already living in Washington state and those abroad seeking to come to the U.S.

Local advocates and service providers say the effects are already rippling across the state, as immigrants and their loved ones frantically call attorneys, scrape together legal funds, assemble personal documents and anxiously wait for any news about their cases.

The changes, by far the most widespread disruption on legal immigration since Trump’s return to office, were detailed in a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services policy memo posted online Tuesday.

All asylum decisions will be halted for people currently in the U.S., and asylum approvals issued during the Biden administration will be reviewed. The issuance of special immigrant visas to Afghans who assisted U.S. forces is suspended. Immigration applications, like requests for green cards or naturalization, filed by nationals from 19 countries, mostly in the Middle East or Africa, will be paused. And officials say they will also reexamine the green cards and immigration benefits already issued to people from those countries.

The exact number of Washington residents — including lawful permanent residents, refugees, those with asylum status and people seeking asylum — who will be affected by the new policies is difficult to calculate but easily in the tens of thousands.

Within 90 days, USCIS “will prioritize a list for review, interview, re-interview, and referral to ICE and other law enforcement agencies as appropriate,” according to the Tuesday memo.

‘Not much we can do’

S moved to the U.S. in 2015 to attend university on a student visa, she said, inspired by her readings at a U.S.-backed Lincoln Learning Center, including “The Diary of a Young Girl” by Anne Frank and books on the women’s rights movement.

“Women in these books were so much different, and were able to do so much more than I was,” said S, who graduated in 2019.

Once, when she returned to Afghanistan during college for a visit in 2018, she was physically assaulted over her work supporting women’s education there, she said. S and her parents also regularly received threatening calls. Things worsened in 2020 as Taliban activities increased in Afghanistan, she said. The killing of a friend, human rights worker Fatima “Natasha” Khalil, solidified her decision to apply for asylum.

“I suffered at the hands of the Taliban, and now I’m being labeled as a terrorist,” S said.

In federal fiscal year 2024 alone, which ended in September 2024, more than 12,500 refugees and other humanitarian immigrants made Washington home, including over 3,200 from Afghanistan. More than 32,000 people in the state obtained lawful permanent resident status in fiscal year 2023, according to the most recent publicly available USCIS data, including nearly 3,500 from the 19 “countries of concern” targeted by the new mandates.

The 19 “countries of concern” identified by USCIS are those under previously announced travel restrictions: Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen.

At Asian Counseling and Referral Service in Seattle, at least one Afghan client had his citizenship interview canceled this week, said Alexandra Olins, director of employment and citizenship services. A client from Sierra Leone on the cusp of citizenship was told her oath ceremony, scheduled for Friday, was canceled.

“They got no explanation, no explanation about next steps, and their lives are just hanging in the balance,” Olins said. “It’s just so cruel, and there’s no benefit from it. … It’s just this collective blanket punishment.”

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project has in recent days been reaching out to Afghan clients “to let them know we will continue standing by them,” said Executive Director Malou Chávez.

Beyond that, she said, “there’s not much we can do. We have to wait to see what steps the administration will take.” The nonprofit runs a project, currently serving 200 clients, helping Afghans apply for legal protections such as asylum, special immigrant visas and green cards.

How the Trump administration will review so many immigration cases and reexamine green cards remains uncertain. For years, USCIS has struggled to process a massive backlog of applications and petitions.

“There’s lack of clarity,” Chávez said.

There are processes for taking away immigrants’ lawful permanent resident status if they commit certain crimes or their green cards are found to have been granted in error, say because they misrepresented something in their application.

The removal of green cards cannot be done wholesale, Chávez said. The administration has to “go through every case and try to find a reason.”

‘In a state of terror’

USCIS said the increased scrutiny and widespread halt on immigration applications for people from “high-risk countries of concern” is necessary in the wake of the Washington, D.C. shooting on Thanksgiving eve that left one National Guard soldier dead and another wounded.

The suspect in that shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is a 29-year-old Afghan man who entered the country in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program created to help Afghan allies flee after the Taliban takeover. Lakanwal, who served in a secretive, CIA-backed unit, was living in Bellingham with his wife and five children and was granted asylum in April.

“In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,” the agency stated in the Tuesday memo.

Immigration advocates note many of the groups targeted under these new rules have already gone through extensive, yearslong vetting by federal officials. Refugees, for example, must prove they face persecution in their home country before they’re approved to enter the U.S., and undergo multiple rounds of interviews, background checks, medical screenings and more.

Meetra Alokozay, executive director of Sahar, a Seattle-based nonprofit that supports secret girls education programs in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, said the prospect of another round of vetting is anxiety-producing even for those, like herself, who have nothing to hide.

Alokozay, who was born in Afghanistan and, with her family, moved to Pakistan so she and her sister could get an education, came to the U.S. in 2018 as a Fulbright scholar and now has a green card. Before it was approved, authorities got her fingerprints and did a background check, she said.

“I’m more worried about people who are still waiting for a decision for their asylum,” she said. Many are in limbo and fearful they might be sent back to a country where they’re at risk, she added.

‘Even citizens are scared’

In Bellingham and greater Whatcom County, Afghans are “living in a state of terror right now,” said Jeremy Dorrough, executive director of Racial Unity Now, a civic organization dedicated to combating systemic racism.

Being repatriated to Afghanistan would be a death sentence for many Afghans whom Dorrough has spoken with, because they were allies for the U.S. before the military withdrew in 2021.

Many of the Afghan immigrants who have resettled in Whatcom County only have temporary permission to be in the U.S. that could expire in a year or more, Dorrough said. Community members have reported seeing their friends and family members’ asylum claims halted in the past few days, he said.

Eiman, a U.S. citizen living in Seattle who emigrated from Afghanistan in 2019, said her parents and siblings have already secured their asylum status. But with their pending green card applications now paused, her mother is terrified to leave the house.

“People are totally scared and afraid to go out,” Eiman said, who asked to use only her first name for fear of negatively impacting her family’s immigration applications. “My mom wanted to go to Costco yesterday, and she asked, ‘Can you buy groceries for me, because I feel scared?’”

She knows of several Afghan nationals with green cards who have canceled their holiday plans to visit family members abroad, Eiman said, fearing they will be barred from returning to the U.S. The return of rampant Islamophobia and scapegoating, similar to what Muslims and those often misidentified as Muslim (like Sikh men who wear turbans) experienced after 9/11, is an ever-present fear, Eiman said.

Afghans are not the only immigrant group that has been specifically targeted under the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown. Trump, who made a series of xenophobic comments about Somali immigrants Tuesday, calling them “garbage” who “contribute nothing,” launched a major immigration operation in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region targeting undocumented Somali immigrants this week.

Farhiya Mohamed, executive director of the Somali Family Safety Task Force in Seattle, said the president’s bigoted rhetoric and slew of immigration policy changes have left many confused and alarmed. She said her organization has started to reach out to legal experts for advice and organize meetings for community members to share updates.

“Even citizens are scared, saying we don’t know what’s going on,” she said, noting many live in mixed-status families. “Thirty years we’ve been here, we haven’t done anything.”

For now, immigrants across Washington remain on high alert for additional updates and guidance from immigration officials.

S, the Tacoma woman from Afghanistan, said she used to have nightmares every night she would be deported before she was granted asylum. When she won her case, she felt immense relief: “OK, I’m safe right now,” she recalled.

But that feeling of security has begun slipping away, she said. The nightmares have returned.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12042025_tzr_tzr_180150.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-12-05 14:57:38.671231

Billed as “a roadmap to ensure America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history and the home of freedom on earth”, the US National Security Strategy makes explicit Washington’s support for Europe’s nationalist far-right parties.

The document, with a signed introduction by Trump, says Europe is in economic decline but its “real problems are even deeper”, including “activities of the EU that undermine political liberty and sovereignty, migration policies that are transforming the continent, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition … and loss of national identities”.

The 33-page exposition of Trump’s “America First” worldview appears to espouse the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory, saying several countries risk becoming “majority non-European” and Europe faces “the real and stark prospect of civilisational erasure”. It adds: “Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognisable in 20 years or less.”

US policies must therefore include “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations” as well as enabling Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” and “opening European markets to US goods and services”.

Responding to the strategy document on Friday, Germany’s foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said the US remained a vital ally on security but “questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies” did not fall into that category.

“We see ourselves as being able to discuss and debate these matters entirely on our own in the future, and do not need outside advice,” he said.

The policy document, released by the White House late on Thursday, underscores the Trump administration’s clear alignment with Europe’s far-right nationalist parties, whose policies centre on attacking supposed EU overreach and excessive non-EU migration.

In language that will appear extraordinary to close allies, it says the US should “stand up for genuine democracy, freedom of expression and unapologetic celebrations of European nations’ individual character and history”, adding that Washington “encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit”.

With far-right parties either in government, supporting rightwing coalitions or leading in the polls in several EU member states, the document says the “growing influence of patriotic European parties … gives cause for great optimism”.

The Trump administration has repeatedly sought to foster closer ties with Europe’s nationalist parties, including Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). In September a senior AfD party figure visited the White House for meetings with senior officials.

On immigration, the strategy document appears to endorse the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which claims ethnic white European populations are deliberately being replaced by non-white peoples. It says it is “more than plausible” that “within a few decades at the latest” some European Nato members “will become majority non-European”.

It claims Europe must “remain European, regain its civilisational self-confidence and abandon its failed focus on regulatory suffocation,” arguing that the continent’s lack of assurance is evident in its relationship with Russia.

As Trump seeks an end to the Ukraine war that would most likely favour Russia gaining territory, the document accuses Europeans of showing weakness. Despite a “significant hard power advantage”, it says, many on the continent “regard Russia as an existential threat”.

It argues it is a “core interest of the US to negotiate an expeditious cessation of hostilities in Ukraine” but that Washington “finds itself at odds with European officials who hold unrealistic expectations for the war perched in unstable minority governments, many of which trample on basic principles of democracy to suppress opposition”.

It claims that a “large European majority” wants peace in Ukraine but that this “is not translated into policy, in large measure because of those governments’ subversion of democratic processes”.

The document’s publication came hours after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, reportedly warned his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, that the US could “betray Ukraine on territory, without clarity on security guarantees”.

The thrust of the US text echoes JD Vance’s brutal ideological attack on Europe at this year’s Munich security conference, in which the US vice-president accused EU leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running from voters’ true beliefs.

The document concedes that Europe remains “strategically and culturally vital” to the US, with transatlantic trade one of the pillars of the global economy and US prosperity. It also says the US “needs a strong Europe to help us successfully compete and to work in concert with us to prevent any adversary from dominating Europe”.

It adds that Washington wants to “work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd54696065078c42340ef81a1f7c6f9a7abda60b/1159_667_2682_2146/master/2682.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4b38e7aa9ac1bd32985fa2a01bf43d4d",N,,2025-12-05 15:57:54.535813

🔍 What Happened: Title Funds Have a New Home

The Department of Labor is slated to become the new overseer of some of the largest and most impactful federal K-12 funding programs as the Trump administration continues its effort to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education.

According to six agreements developed by the federal education department, many of its key functions will be distributed to other federal agencies. That includes the administration of billions of dollars in Title I funds that support school systems with high rates of poverty, special education, and English language learner students.

Traditionally, the labor department’s focus has been on the workforce, with a stated goal to “foster, promote, and develop the welfare of wage earners, job seekers, and retirees.” It is the body that administers income support programs like unemployment benefits and litigates complaints of unsafe working conditions.

🎯What it Means:

After more than four decades of functioning with a federal education department, this change will be a significant administrative shift in Washington, D.C., Education Week reports.

How it will impact school and district budgets, however, remains to be seen. Districts’ reliance on these federal dollars varies based on their student population. For those who receive a significant portion of money through the Title program, any hiccups in the implementation of a new process or delays in cash flow could create major short-term problems.

Some administrators looking to get ahead of potential delays or hurdles in receiving the money may be prepared to cut programs or contracts that heavily rely on it.

If that’s the case, many education companies could find their contracts on the chopping block. A majority of providers say their district clients use federal dollars to pay for their product or services, EdWeek Market Brief previously reported. Title I funding is the second most common source that companies say their district clients use, behind district general funds.

🔍 What Happened: Pushback Muddies Federal Department Shake Up

A group of states is pushing back following the announcement that four other federal agencies would take over the day-to-day management of key U.S. Department of Education grant programs, Education Week reports.

Democratic attorneys general from 20 states and the District of Columbia argue in an amended complaint filed on Nov. 25 that federal laws require the U.S. Department of Education to carry out its own programs.

The 1979 federal law that created the Education Department allows the secretary of education some latitude to reorganize the agency, but not as much latitude as the Trump administration has taken, the expanded lawsuit argues.

🎯What it Means:

Even if the challenge doesn’t stop the move of major federal grant programs, it could slow the change while the legal challenge is argued in court.

Secretary of Education Linda McMahon has previously acknowledged that the Trump administration needs congressional approval to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, which was a Trump campaign pledge. Last month, she described the interdepartmental moves as a “pilot program” to prove to Congress that the changes could work long term.

This challenge comes from the same coalition of states that sued months ago to stop mass layoffs at the Department of Education.

🔍 What Happened: Immigration Enforcement Hurts Enrollment

Increased immigration enforcement activities supported by the Trump administration, including raids in schools, are impacting some large K-12 districts, K-12 Dive reports.

The Los Angeles Unified School District — one of the largest districts in the country — experienced a drop in enrollment that exceeded its expectations, with the student body declining by 4% year over year. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho categorized the loss as “deeply connected” to the realities immigrant families are facing.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools in Florida and Chicago Public Schools have also reported enrollment drops that they say are related, at least in part, to new immigration actions.

🎯What it Means:

Any change to a school district’s population impacts the budget. In many states, K-12 funding is distributed on a per-pupil basis, meaning a loss of students translates directly to an unanticipated loss of money.

If districts are also seeing a shift in a certain population of students, such as English language learners, that could also affect whether they qualify for Title I funds or how much money they receive per student. State funding formulas generally offer increased dollars for students with more academic needs, including those learning to speak English.

In many areas, the declines in LAUSD, Miami-Dade, and Chicago are driven partly by lower enrollment of newcomer students, K-12 Dive wrote.

Owner and chef Christina Nguyen said it was the first such incident since the restaurant opened more than a decade ago.

""Definitely our first ICE encounter,"" Nguyen said. She believes her restaurant, which serves Latin street food, was arbitrarily targeted after the Trump administration deployed more federal agents to the Twin Cities. On Tuesday, Ring camera footage captured what neighbors said were ICE agents in unmarked cars parked in the restaurant’s lot while it was closed.

The following evening, two federal agents walked into the dining room during dinner service.

General manager Naomi Rathke said she had been reviewing ICE protocols with employees at the time to ensure they knew their rights, including reviewing information from groups such as the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee. After the agents entered, she said she asked them to present a judicial warrant.

“They said, 'We don’t need one.' I said, 'Yes, you do,'” Rathke recalled. She then asked them to leave, noting that a signed warrant is required to conduct immigration operations inside a private business. Rathke and Nguyen believe the officers were using intimidation tactics to instill fear in the restaurant's employees, including telling them that agents ""have the place surrounded.""

""I think that they were just saying a lot of things to try to intimidate and scare us into letting them in the back, which we didn't,"" Nguyen said.

“They don’t have power over me, they don’t have power over us,” Rathke added. “I’m not scared of them, honestly.”

Nguyen praised Rathke for her response. ""Seriously brave to not crumble under that pressure,"" she said.

According to Nguyen, the agents said they were searching for a woman whose photo they showed on a phone, though Nguyen says the woman does not work at Hola Arepa. “It wasn’t anybody who works for us at all, but you know, possibly to them, everybody looks the same, I don’t know,” she said.

Employees recorded videos of the agents leaving and turning the wrong way onto a one-way street. ""Just endangering others, driving the wrong way,"" Nguyen said. ""They were lucky because usually that street is incredibly busy, especially during rush hour.""

Nguyen said some staff members remain shaken. “People who are here completely lawfully are just afraid,” she said. She hopes the incident encourages others to learn their rights. “We just all have to stay strong together and be in solidarity with each other.""",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/d3a5eba9-b0fb-4b57-8f54-00ba2ba6dc68/20251205T030727/d3a5eba9-b0fb-4b57-8f54-00ba2ba6dc68_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 15:58:15.041224

Rebecca Saldaña (D-Seattle) and Rep. Lillian Ortiz-Self (D-Mukilteo) to propose the Immigrant Worker Protection Act.

The proposed legislation would:

Require employers notify employees when the federal government has requested their employment eligibility information.

Remind employers that they are not required to give federal immigration officials access to their non-public places of business unless agents have a warrant.

Make sure employers follow the law and only share employees’ personal data when a subpoena or judicial warrant has been issued.

“What we’re seeing from this administration is a campaign of fear that’s left many people scared to go to work,” Brown said. “This law empowers workers so they get the same information as their bosses do and have the opportunity to get their affairs in order.”

“Immigrant workers keep our communities and economy strong. They deserve fairness, respect, and the peace of mind to work and provide for their families,” Saldaña said. “This legislation protects them from fear and uncertainty, ensuring they can continue contributing to the strength and prosperity of our state.”

“Immigrant workers keep Washington’s economy strong, and they deserve stability and respect in their workplaces – especially as unlawful federal enforcement continues to disrupt families and communities,” Ortiz-Self said. “This bill not only protects workers, but also gives employers the clarity, resources, and support they need to understand their rights and meet their responsibilities under state law. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act ensures timely notice of I-9 audits, strengthens protections on the job, and upholds our urgent commitment to keep Washington families safe and together.”

Immigrants help power Washington’s economy

Washington’s prosperity would not be possible without the contributions of immigrants. At just 15% of the state’s population, immigrants generate 21% of Washington’s economic output, according to research from the Immigration Research Initiative.

The state’s economic engine thrives when employees and employers have a safe, predictable environment in which to operate. However, federal immigration authorities’ tactics have had a destabilizing impact on Washington’s economy, sowing chaos and fear in communities throughout the state.

“As an employer, I know in the case of an I-9 audit there are steps I would need to follow,” said Ana Castro, owner of La Salvadorean Bakery and Restaurant in White Center. “This bill just adds one step to that process and ensures my workers have a chance to provide any updates to their documentation. This bill will help me stay in compliance with federal law because ultimately I rely on my employees to help me keep employment records up to date.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill for Washington state. It will help protect workers' privacy and level the playing field between employers and employees,” said April Sims, president of the Washington State Labor Council. “This bill can help immigrant workers, and all workers feel safer at work and help them to know what their employer is doing with their personal information.”

“The Immigrant Worker Protection Act is an important bill to protect workers and keep them in the know about when and how their information is being shared,” said Danielle Alvarado, executive director of Working Washington. “Workers who have had changes to their documentation and legal status should have the same opportunity to get their paperwork in order as employers do.”

“We fought to have provisions like these in many of our collective bargaining agreements. We know employers can comply with requirements like this – many already are,” said Stefan Moritz, secretary treasurer of UNITE HERE Local 8. “If an employer has advance knowledge that federal immigration will be doing an I-9 audit, workers should have that notice too so they can seek their own legal advice on how to respond to the situation.”

“The National Employment Law Project is leading the fight for a good-jobs economy, where all workers, regardless of immigration status, have the right to dignity, safety, and fair treatment on the job. When exploitative employers use worksite immigration enforcement to retaliate against immigrant workers, these rights and labor standards are eroded for all workers,” said Marisa Díaz, Director of the Immigrant Worker Justice Program at the National Employment Law Project. “The Immigrant Worker Protection Act supports good jobs because it will expand worker protections and increase access to information on employers’ and workers’ fundamental constitutional rights.”

As of 2023, one in four U.S. citizen children live with a foreign-born parent.","Published December 5, 2025

Millions of people in the U.S., including over 18 million children, are living in a state of fear and chaos perpetuated by the Trump administration, which has enacted a number of policies and practices explicitly designed to scare immigrants from accessing the limited benefits available to them. This includes restricting access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for humanitarian-based non-citizens in HR 1.

The chilling effect is further intensified by the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) efforts to obtain taxpayer information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and to access benefit data from the Social Security Administration and state SNAP and Medicaid agencies. These efforts violate federal privacy protections and break explicit commitments that the government has made to beneficiaries. These policies also place mixed-status families, many of which include U.S. citizen children and adults, in a climate of fear, causing even citizens to avoid critical supports out of concern for the safety and stability of their loved ones.

Together, these measures will deepen economic hardship, destabilize family well-being, and increase food insecurity for immigrant and U.S. citizen households alike.

Public Charge Proposed Rule

The administration just took another step to create fear in immigrant communities. On November 19, DHS issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that, if enacted, would rescind a rule put in place in 2022 that defines what could be considered in making a public charge determination for people seeking a U.S. green card or visa.

What Is Public Charge?

When someone applies for a green card or a visa, either to adjust their status within the U.S. or to enter the country, a government official reviews their application to determine whether they are likely to rely on the government for support. Under long-standing law and the current 2022 rule, only cash assistance for income maintenance and long-term institutionalized care at the government’s expense could be considered in determining if someone could be considered a public charge. This proposed rule would rescind those regulations without any new guidance in its place. This vacuum creates confusion over what programs or benefits could be considered in the determination, meaning that, if enacted, the officials reviewing the applications could consider any programs as cause to deny someone a green card or visa.

The goal of this proposed rule is to not only change this policy but to create more confusion, fear, and barriers for immigrant families to have essential supports.

Making up 27 percent of the population in the U.S., immigrant families are a large part of our communities, and half of their households include a U.S. citizen. As of 2023, one in four U.S. citizen children live with a foreign-born parent. Policies, actions, and proposed rules such as this one will only lead to more hunger and increased poverty.

Palmyra, Ozaukee and Kenosha counties rejected ICE’s offers of money to transform their sheriffs into agents of federal immigration enforcement.","In Wisconsin we have been watching in horror as President Donald Trump’s lawless immigration crackdown terrorizes communities in our neighboring states of Minnesota and Illinois.

Here at home, so far, things are mostly quiet. Farmers in western Wisconsin report no ICE raids on the dairies where 60% to 90% of workers are immigrants without legal status. There have been a few high-profile arrests and deportations in Milwaukee, Madison and Manitowoc, but nothing like the scenes of chaos in the streets of Chicago and Minneapolis, where masked federal agents are aiming guns at civilians, smashing out car windows and dragging parents from their children, hustling them off to detention centers to be fast-tracked out of the country without due process.

One of the most disturbing things about this campaign of terror is that it seems to be directed by the president’s whim. In a Thanksgiving post full of invective and schoolyard insults directed at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, Trump denounced the Somali community he claimed was “completely taking over the great State of Minnesota.” One week later, CBS News confirmed that ICE operations were underway targeting Somali immigrants in the Twin Cities.

Since we can’t count on the federal government to stay inside the bounds of reason or the law, it is critical that local and state leaders stand up to the racist, unconstitutional and unAmerican assault on immigrants.

It was good news when, on Wednesday, the Wisconsin Supreme Court accepted a case filed by the state chapter of the ACLU on behalf of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, contending that Wisconsin law enforcement agencies do not have the authority to make arrests or keep people in jail on detainers based solely on ICE’s administrative warrants.

Tim Muth, the ACLU of Wisconsin’s senior staff attorney, said hundreds of people throughout the state are being illegally held for days.

“It is extremely important for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to determine whether any law enforcement in Wisconsin has the legal authority to put or keep people in jail when they have not committed a crime and when no judge has issued an arrest warrant,” Wisconsin immigration attorney Grant Sovern wrote in an email to the Examiner. “Anyone in Wisconsin would want dangerous people to be kept from the public. But ICE is currently making no determinations about dangerousness or the likelihood to show up for a hearing if a summons is issued. A summons is a perfectly rational and legal way to address a civil legal question like someone’s immigration status. Jailing people before any independent adjudicator determines someone to be dangerous is against the Constitution and not the Wisconsin way.”

At a press conference Wednesday, Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces, told the story of a landscaper in Green Bay who was picked up for driving without a license (immigrants without legal status are barred by a 2007 state law from obtaining driver’s licenses). He was sent to county jail and then handed over to ICE. “He was a grandfather, very active in his church,” Neumann-Ortiz said, describing him as “someone who does not represent any kind of threat to society at all” and who, on the contrary, is a pillar of his community and beloved by his family.

Voces helped fight the deportation in a case that is still working its way through the courts. “At least he’s out and together with his family,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But that’s an example of how people can be impacted by this.”

As it scrambles to meet arbitrary deportation quotas, ICE sends detainers even for people who have never been convicted of a crime and have only minor charges pending in Wisconsin courts.

Voces has been fighting at the local level since the first Trump administration for local law enforcement to refuse to collaborate with ICE unless there is a judicial warrant for someone, meaning that person is being sought in connection with a serious crime. As a result of Voces’ efforts, that is now the standard in Milwaukee County. The state Supreme Court case is an effort to establish the same standard statewide.

Neumann-Ortiz said she’s grateful the Supreme Court justices recognized the urgency of the issue in agreeing to take the case on an expedited basis, “given the current level of abuse that we’re seeing happen, and which will only escalate.”

And, she added, “We certainly very much anticipate Milwaukee being one of the cities that will be targeted for militarized occupation with these aggressive sweeps.”

Whether or not Wisconsin communities can protect people from the kind of violence we’ve been seeing in other states depends on the courageous actions of state and local officials, advocates and informed community members. It begins with recognizing that the Trump administration’s actions are wrong and then standing up.

At the press conference, a reporter asked about ICE’s assertion that the agency doesn’t have room for everyone in its detention facilities and therefore needs space in county jails. Muth responded: “Detain fewer people.”

Neumann-Ortiz added some clarifying context. “They are profiling people, they are just grabbing people without any probable cause. So it’s a very racist program that is using violence against people and is trying to hijack, through bribery and through threats, local law enforcement to be part of this mass deportation machinery,” she said.

“We’re seeing, at the local level, community come together,” she added, “to reject these efforts to undermine local law enforcement — which is supposed to play a public safety role — into just this arm of deportation driven by xenophobia and racism. And which is making a lot of money for the for-profit prison industry.”

This year, communities across the state have pushed back on 287g partnership agreements between local law enforcement and ICE that turn sheriff’s departments into an arm of the federal immigration agency. Palmyra, Ozaukee and Kenosha counties rejected ICE’s offers of money to transform their sheriffs into agents of federal immigration enforcement.

The Kenosha sheriff’s office made its decision not to participate after the ACLU and Voces had already named it in the Supreme Court lawsuit, along with Walworth, Brown, Sauk and Marathon counties. Palmyra also reversed a decision to accept a large payment from ICE to participate, responding to public outrage.

“Resistance is happening, it’s successful, it’s building community,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “But we do need state protections to uphold our rights.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Neumann-Ortiz-2048x1148.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 13:57:46.978837

The couple had previously run a successful Mexican restaurant, La Placita, at the Public Market in a building owned by Wilton adjacent to Boulder Coffee.
During that time, both Bocanegra and Ramos Jimenez were detained by ICE.
The complaint filed against Wilton alleged fraud, unpaid wages, and violation of labor law.","The co-founder of a staple South Wedge Mexican restaurant has been detained by federal immigration agents.

Omar Ramos Jimenez, 50, is originally from Mexico and has lived in Rochester since 2004. He and his wife founded and ran La Casa on Alexander Street and, before that, operated La Placita at the Public Market.

Family and friends describe him as a father, beloved neighbor and community leader, and accuse Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of lying to Ramos Jimenez in order to get him to their office this week and arrest him.

ICE allegedly contacted Ramos Jimenez on Monday and told him he needed a new phone app installed for reporting to ICE, and it needed to be done in-person at the agency’s Buffalo field office.

He first was detained by ICE in 2013 and paid a $1,500 bond to be released. Since then, he had sought to receive both asylum status and a cancellation of removal. He was denied those protections in 2020 but quickly filed an appeal. The appeal of that ruling is ongoing. Ramos Jimenez has meanwhile been complying with all requests and check-ins from ICE for the past 5 years, according to a federal complaint filed Wednesday by his attorney, Grace Zaiman.

When he arrived at the ICE offices on Wednesday, the complaint states, he was immediately arrested.

“(Ramos Jimenez) was told by ICE officers that their decision to take him into custody was due to changes in presidential priorities and policies and to ensure his future attendance at court hearings,” the complaint reads. “When (Ramos Jimenez’s) counsel indicated he did not have any scheduled court hearings but was awaiting a decision on his appeal, the ICE officers responded that by taking him into custody his appeal decision would thus be expedited.”

Zaiman did not immediately return a request for comment. The complaint alleges the federal government denied Ramos Jimenez his right to due process by failing to hold a bond hearing or an individualized hearing prior to his detainment. It is seeking his immediate release or a hearing on the matter, as well as an order barring his removal from New York.

Ramos Jimenez founded La Casa in 2013 alongside his wife, Maria Bocanegra, under the ownership of landlord Lyjha Wilton. The couple had previously run a successful Mexican restaurant, La Placita, at the Public Market in a building owned by Wilton adjacent to Boulder Coffee. While the couple had set up and established the restaurant, they were never listed as owners due to their undocumented status. The original plan was for the restaurant to be transferred to their daughter, Leila, on her 21st birthday, according to a federal complaint later filed by the couple.

The relationship between the couple and Wilton soured shortly after the restaurant’s opening. During that time, both Bocanegra and Ramos Jimenez were detained by ICE. The complaint filed against Wilton alleged fraud, unpaid wages, and violation of labor law. They settled out of court in 2015.

Ramos Jimenez no longer has any affiliation with La Casa, a family spokesperson said, and the new complaint states that for the past eight years he has worked in lawn care and snow removal.

Rochester City Council President Miguel Meléndez said the way in which Ramos Jimenez was detained only stokes more fear of how immigration enforcement is unfolding under the second presidential administration of Donald Trump.

“This is exactly what we have anticipated, in terms of them targeting anyone and everyone,” he said. “It's happening.""

Ramos Jimenez is also the father of Cassandra Bocanegra, the senior manager of organizing and strategy for the Finger Lakes chapter of the New York Immigration Coalition (NYIC). Bocanegra declined to comment until later in the day Friday. NYIC and other immigration advocacy groups are planning a rally at 5 p.m. outside Spiritus Christi Church on North Fitzhugh Street.

The sheriffs argued there is no Wisconsin law prohibiting ""a sheriff from cooperating with federal immigration officials by complying with a federal immigration detainer request and administrative warrant.""
The state Supreme Court will accept arguments from interested parties before setting oral arguments in court.","The ACLU of Wisconsin is suing five sheriffs, arguing it is illegal for local jails to hold people on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The sheriffs contend that state law does not prohibit them from cooperating with federal immigration officials.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case, bypassing the lower courts.

Brown County Sheriff Todd Delain is one of five Wisconsin sheriffs named in a petition seeking for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to rule that it's illegal for local jails to hold immigrant detainees at federal authorities' request.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin filed a lawsuit Sept. 18 on behalf of immigrant advocacy group Voces de la Frontera against five Wisconsin sheriffs who have honored immigration detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The state's highest court agreed to hear the case Dec. 3.

An immigration detainer is a request from ICE for the jail to notify ICE before an individual is released and to hold the person for 48 hours after they should have been released under state law to give ICE time to pick up and take custody of the person.

The sheriffs named in the lawsuit are Delain, Dave Gerber of Walworth County, Chad Billeb of Marathon County, David Zoerner of Kenosha County and Chip Meister of Sauk County.

The Brown County Sheriff's Office is part of ICE’s 287(g) program under the warrant service officer model, which authorizes local law enforcement officers to serve administrative warrants on undocumented immigrants in jail and detain them until ICE takes over custody.

In April, the sheriff's office updated a long-standing contract with the U.S. Marshals Service allowing the jail to house federal inmates to include individuals in ICE custody.

With the contracts, there are two ways a person can end up in ICE custody but housed in the Brown County Jail: they are arrested by ICE or another federal agency specifically for immigration violations and housed in the jail through the Marshals Service contract, or they are arrested on local criminal charges and later transferred into ICE custody.

The ACLU argues in its lawsuit that keeping a person in custody for extra time under an immigration detainer constitutes a new arrest, and that it's illegal because Wisconsin law doesn't allow officers to make civil arrests except in certain circumstances — none of which are relevant to civil immigration enforcement.

The lawsuit also argues that moving people into federal immigration custody while their local criminal cases are ongoing ""disrupts the Wisconsin criminal justice process, potentially depriving victims of justice and defendants of the opportunity to defend against the charges.""

The ACLU is seeking for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to declare that civil immigration violations are outside the authority of a law enforcement officer in Wisconsin, and to prohibit the sheriffs from holding people on ICE detainers.

The sheriffs pushed back against the court taking up the lawsuit, arguing in a response that the matter does not warrant skipping a typical litigation process. They also argued the issues raised by the ACLU ""do not rise to the level of statewide concern,"" a legal precedent for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take up an issue before it goes through any lower courts.

The sheriffs argued there is no Wisconsin law prohibiting ""a sheriff from cooperating with federal immigration officials by complying with a federal immigration detainer request and administrative warrant.""

""The petition makes no attempt even to address the constitutional, statutory, and common law duties and powers of Wisconsin sheriffs despite challenging the authority of Wisconsin sheriffs to engage in a practice that has occurred for decades,"" the response said.

The state Supreme Court will accept arguments from interested parties before setting oral arguments in court.

In the past decade, the 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill and the 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill have further demonstrated the immense risks of offshore drilling expansion.
As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb.
The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history.
The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.","U.S. Representative Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) joined U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) and 27 members of the California Democratic congressional delegation in condemning the Trump Administration’s official draft 2027-2032 Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program that includes six lease proposals off the coast of Northern, Central, and Southern California. The plan proposes opening vast swaths of previously protected federal waters to new oil and gas drilling for the first time in over 40 years, disregarding bipartisan opposition.

The Trump Administration’s overwhelmingly unpopular proposal directly targets areas former President Joe Biden withdrew from future leasing in January 2025, when he protected 625 million acres. In their letter to President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the lawmakers stressed that this plan would undermine state laws that prohibit new offshore drilling along its 1,110-mile coastline and ban new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters.

“We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast,” wrote the lawmakers. “This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless.”

“As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb,” continued the lawmakers. “Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.”

The lawmakers emphasized the devastating impacts new oil and gas leasing would have on California’s environment, military readiness, and diverse coastal economy, threatening the state’s tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and defense infrastructure industries. California’s marine economy accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages, and pollution off its coast would significantly damage the state’s world-leading economy.

California began efforts to block offshore drilling in 1969 when an oil rig off the coast of Santa Barbara leaked 3 million gallons of crude oil into the ocean, blanketing beaches with a thick layer of oil and killing thousands of marine mammals and birds. It was the largest oil spill in U.S. history until the Exxon Valdez spill 20 years later. In the past decade, the 2015 Refugio State Beach oil spill and the 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill have further demonstrated the immense risks of offshore drilling expansion.

Last month, Carbajal hosted a press call with Central Coast public officials, environmental advocates, and business leaders to condemn the Trump Administration’s plan immediately after it was announced. In addition, Carbajal spoke at a national press conference hosted by Senator Padilla and House Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Jared Huffman (D-CA-02).

In April, Carbajal announced the reintroduction of the California Clean Coast Act. The California Clean Coast Act was the first bill Congressman Carbajal introduced as a Member of Congress, demonstrating his longstanding commitment to protecting California’s coast from offshore drilling and the devastating impact of oil spills.

Full text of the letter is available here and below:

Dear Mr. President and Secretary Burgum:

We write in strong opposition to the Draft Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition.

We stand united with the overwhelming majority of Californians who fundamentally oppose any proposal that would expand offshore drilling and risk our state’s invaluable, ecologically unique coast. This proposal, coupled with ongoing efforts to reduce federal staffing and funding for agencies that protect our environment, including for safety and oil spill response, is not only dangerous but outright reckless. As we have repeatedly seen in California and other parts of the country, offshore drilling is a ticking time bomb. Any expansion of offshore drilling in the waters off the coast of California and the spills that would inevitably accompany it would be devastating to the communities we represent.

In April 2025, California officially became the fourth-largest economy in the world, behind only the United States, China, and Germany in global rankings. Our economy is diverse and robust, including sectors such as tourism, recreation, fisheries, deepwater port commerce, and Department of Defense infrastructure. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), California’s marine economy alone accounted for $51.3 billion in GDP and $26.7 billion in wages in 2021. The economic well-being of these sectors is dependent upon a healthy and clean coastline. Further industrialization off our coast will inevitably pollute our beaches, spelling disaster for California’s economy and detrimentally impacting the rest of the country, which relies on California as an economic engine.

California is all too familiar with the devastating impacts of oil spills. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill remains the largest in our state’s history—and one of the landmark spills in U.S. history. Immediate damage to birds, intertidal organisms, beaches, and the economy was severe. That experience galvanized Californians and secured an unshakable commitment to protecting our coastline. The more recent 2015 Refugio oil spill and 2021 Huntington Beach oil spill reinforced our strong opposition to any offshore drilling expansion.

Our Congressional delegation, state leaders, and dozens of California municipalities and Tribes have expressed their opposition through resolutions or comment letters, along with state groups and citizens. The bipartisan consensus against expanded offshore drilling has been clear and consistent over five decades. This has resulted in current state laws that include a permanent ban on new offshore oil and gas drilling along California’s 1,110-mile coastline and a prohibition on new leases for oil and gas infrastructure in state waters that enable increased oil and gas production from federal waters. As stated in the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)’s Request for Information and reinforced by the comments BOEM received from our state, “As a result of Congressional moratoria, subsequent Presidential actions, and consistent opposition by the States of Washington, Oregon, and California to any activity off their coasts, the Pacific OCS has not been included in any National OCS Program since the 1987–1992 Program.”

In addition to the economic and environmental reasons for not expanding drilling off California’s coasts, our national defense would be better served by keeping additional oil rigs away from our shores. California’s waters and coastline are strategically vital, hosting a significant number of military installations, key logistics routes, and special-use airspace. Allowing oil and gas development, or the risk of spills, in areas where our servicemembers routinely operate would undermine military readiness and pose risks to national security.

For these reasons and more, we write in strong opposition to the Proposed Program (DPP) for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program. We specifically want to express our strongest opposition to the inclusion of the Northern California OCS Planning Area, the Central California OCS Planning Area, and the Southern California OCS Planning Area in the DPP for oil and gas leasing disposition.

Matthew R. Galeotti, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney John A. Sarcone III for the Northern District of New York made the announcement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Rouse’s Point and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Border Patrol Champlain Station are investigating the case. HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington D.C. and CBP’s International Interdiction Task Force provided significant assistance.

The investigation is a result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and other transnational criminal organizations and eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating within the Americas that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border, the Northern District of New York, the District of Vermont, and the Southern District of Florida. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs, among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 425 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 375 U.S. convictions; more than 325 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

USCIS and the Trump administration have ramped up immigration restrictions and enforcement after two soldiers were shot outside of a metro station in Washington, D.C., by alleged shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who first entered the country in 2021 under the Biden administration’s Operation Allies Welcome program. Lakanwal was granted asylum earlier this year under the Trump administration.

Since the shooting, USCIS has issued a pause on all benefit requests by foreign nationals from 19 countries deemed “high-risk” by the Trump administration.

The pause on benefit requests applies to individuals from the following 19 countries, regardless of entry date: Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Top-Boat-strikes_112825_AP_Alex-Brandon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:31.507337

,Human Rights,2025-12-05 15:41:56+00:00,News From The States,Federal law strips food support from thousands of refugees and human trafficking victims in Kansas,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-law-strips-food-support-thousands-refugees-and-human-trafficking-victims-kansas,"Many immigrants who had previously received SNAP support for food and Temporary Assistance to Need Families, or TANF, were kicked off the programs, including human trafficking victims and refugees, Silva-Renteria said.
“In state fiscal year 2025, the average number of legal non-citizen residents receiving Kansas SNAP benefits per month was 9,483,” she said.
SNAP requires recertification case reviews to be done within the next six to 12 months, La Row said.
“Any family that is no longer eligible to receive benefits will be notified once that review has taken place,” she said.
“We have minimized our expenses as much as we can to prioritize direct services and support to the families,” Silva-Renteria said.","TOPEKA — The Trump administration in January cut off 36 people who were bound for Kansas when it canceled travel plans for refugees who planned to relocate to the United States.

Months later, cuts in aid through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act continue to eliminate needed food services for immigrants living in Kansas.

One refugee was a mother waiting to join her family, which had immigrated without her because she was pregnant and unable to travel, said Yeni Silva-Renteria, executive director of International Rescue Committee in Wichita.

Today, that mother still awaits approval to reunite with her husband and children who live in Wichita, she said.

“Now she’s stuck,” Silva-Renteria said. “People come to the office all the time, asking when is my son coming, when is my wife coming, and we cannot answer that at this moment. People are going through a lot of stress right now, and it’s very difficult. This world right now, especially within resettlement and within the immigration system — I’ve never experienced this much stress.”

That stress ramped up when new regulations for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program went into effect in November.

Many immigrants who had previously received SNAP support for food and Temporary Assistance to Need Families, or TANF, were kicked off the programs, including human trafficking victims and refugees, Silva-Renteria said.

Silva-Renteria stressed that anyone in the country illegally was never able to receive those government dollars, as is often erroneously reported.

Refugees, who often have been living in refugee camps for years before they are approved for relocation, usually receive a work permit and a Social Security card and, typically, eligibility for programs like SNAP to help them as they adjust to their new lives, she said.

SNAP and TANF are especially important when refugees first arrive in the country, Silva-Renteria said.

“The expectation is that within 90 days they’ll obtain a job,” she said. “Within the systems, we know that they’re not going to be self-sufficient within 90 days. Especially in Kansas, day care is a challenge, transportation is a challenge, the language barrier.”

It doesn’t mean that they’re not working, she said, or that they’re taking advantage of the system.

“There is an investment that we provide to those families until they get on their feet,” Silva-Renteria said. “These are people who have been at refugee camps for several years and have endured a lot of trauma. Some of them are the only survivors in their family. That support is critical for them because there’s no other way they’re going to make it without relying on that assistance.”

Eliminating support

Federal law previously allowed certain categories of noncitizen residents, such as refugees and human trafficking victims, to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, said Erin La Row, spokeswoman for the Department for Children and Families.

“In state fiscal year 2025, the average number of legal non-citizen residents receiving Kansas SNAP benefits per month was 9,483,” she said.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act changed eligibility, limiting it to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants and Compact of Free Association citizens, which is an agreement between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau, La Row said.

Beginning Nov. 1, 4,039 individuals in the state were no longer eligible to receive benefits, although the loss of those benefits may not occur until DCF processes a review of their case, La Row said. SNAP requires recertification case reviews to be done within the next six to 12 months, La Row said.

La Row said DCF couldn’t be certain who would lose benefits until each case was reviewed, so after Nov. 1, all applications, reviews or other changes would be verified through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system, called SAVE.

“Any family that is no longer eligible to receive benefits will be notified once that review has taken place,” she said. “Additionally, we are working with the International Rescue Committee to determine how best to notify families, as that is the entity that engages with the majority of the population losing their eligibility for these benefits.”

The fallout

Silva-Renteria said her organization is doing its best to work with immigrant families as their assistance disappears.

“We’re doing a lot of outreach and communicating with the families. They have to understand this new change and see what that means for them,” she said.

IRC is connecting families with community resources and also using donations to its organization for food and other types of assistance.

Their work happens amid the organization’s own federal grant losses, including the shutdown of a grant funding its resettlement program that forced the layoff of 11 people in February.

“We have minimized our expenses as much as we can to prioritize direct services and support to the families,” Silva-Renteria said. “There’s only so much we can do.”

She and her staff have watched as immigrants have been vilified across the country, including online discussions and political comments after an Afghani immigrant shot two National Guard members.

Cautious about being misunderstood, Silva-Renteria said she doesn’t support violence in any way, but she knows that one person’s actions don’t speak for their entire immigrant communities.

“We do need a lot of support, obviously financially but also understanding and awareness that we’re dealing with people,” she said. “We’re dealing with families, children who deserve a safe space, a home, a place. Unfortunately right now, even within our community in Wichita, some of them may not feel as welcome or as safe just because of the climate.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-1024x6831764947325.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=jw7BfXHx,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:42.663391

• Asylum seekers to be housed in military sites instead of hotels This week, the Home Office opened Campsfield immigration removal centre in Kidlingon, Oxfordshire, where up to 400 migrants will be detained next to Oxford airfield.
As part of the asylum proposals, ministers will seek to bring in legislation to prevent human rights laws being used to frustrate deportations and make it easier to remove people.
The Conservatives said Labour had to be more transparent to allow public debate over its proposals to reform the way in which the ECHR is interpreted in British courts.
“Labour are refusing to publish key enforcement data and they avoid saying how many cases are affected by human rights laws.","Separate plans to reopen the Haslar detention centre in Gosport, Hampshire, have been hit by further delays and will not be ready until 2027, four years later than originally planned.

The immigration removal centre, which has been closed since 2017 because of major refurbishment works, was due to accommodate up to 600 beds. It has been cited as part of Labour’s plans to significantly increase the number of illegal migrants and foreign criminals deported from the UK.

• Asylum seekers to be housed in military sites instead of hotels

This week, the Home Office opened Campsfield immigration removal centre in Kidlingon, Oxfordshire, where up to 400 migrants will be detained next to Oxford airfield. It takes the total capacity to nearly 3,000 across eight immigration detention centres.

A report by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford has warned that gaps in official migration statistics are hampering public debate and policy decisions on immigration, including on cases relating to human rights laws.

The migration experts has flagged ten major areas where information was lacking, including enforcement and returns, and the unknown size of the illegal migration population in the UK.

The research also raised how it was difficult to understand how many immigration cases were affected by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which has been subject to political debate including calls to quit it by the Conservatives and Reform UK.

Experts found there was little data to know who and how many people applied for and were granted permission to stay in the UK through the convention, or successfully appealed against their removal.

Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory, said: “The UK’s membership of ECHR is a major issue in public debate, in large part due to its impacts on migration policy.

“But the current data can’t give us a clear picture of where and when it has most impact. This makes it harder for the public or policymakers to make an informed choice about an important decision with long-term repercussions for the UK.”

Shabana Mahmood, the home secretary, announced a series of reforms to both the asylum system and legal migration to cut the number of people coming to the country.

As part of the asylum proposals, ministers will seek to bring in legislation to prevent human rights laws being used to frustrate deportations and make it easier to remove people.

The Conservatives said Labour had to be more transparent to allow public debate over its proposals to reform the way in which the ECHR is interpreted in British courts.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “Labour have spent months hiding the very data the public need to understand what is happening to our borders. The Migration Observatory confirms what we have been warning about. Labour have chosen secrecy over honesty.

“Labour are refusing to publish key enforcement data and they avoid saying how many cases are affected by human rights laws. This Labour government is keeping the country in the dark because the truth would expose how weak and incompetent their approach really is.”

Georgina Sturge, the author of the Migration Observatory report, said the prominence of debate about the ECHR in British politics warranted much more thorough data on how many migrants were using human rights laws to remain in the UK.

She said: “We have some pretty major ongoing policy discussions that include big ideas about even removing ourselves from the ECHR and there are quite a lot of perceptions about how much of a role of human rights appeals play in the appeals system. But the data is very thin and we don’t have granular data to tell us how many people are getting leave to remain based on human rights, how many people are bringing human rights appeals and at what stage.”

The Home Office said: “We are furious at the level of illegal migrants and asylum hotels. Moving to large military sites is an important part of our reforms to tackle illegal migration and the pull factors that make the UK an attractive destination.

“We are continuing to accelerate plans to move people into Crowborough and Cameron Barracks, when the sites are fully operational and safe. We will not replicate the mistakes of the past where rushed plans have led to unsafe and chaotic situations that impacts the local community.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F25910b6d-7cef-4cba-b033-671786bee437.jpg?crop=7983%2C4490%2C0%2C192&resize=1200,N,,2025-12-05 11:57:47.038702

These agreements have resulted in the forcible transfer of thousands of people—including families recognized as refugees or people granted protection from return to their country of origin—to countries where they have no ties and could be subject to inhumane detention or deportation to the countries they fled.

“Banished by Bargain: Third Country Deportation Watch sheds light on the human suffering behind these unlawful and secretive transfers,” said Uzra Zeya, President and CEO of Human Rights First. “Beyond their cruelty, these agreements reflect a transactional foreign policy driven by xenophobia—punishing non-citizens for seeking protections enshrined in law, while undermining human rights and setting dangerous new norms for migration management globally. We are working to hold the U.S. government accountable for policies that flout international law and endanger lives.”

“Our new tracker exposes how the Trump administration is methodically shredding the longstanding American principle of protecting vulnerable people from harm. These third-country transfer agreements frequently underpin harmful practices and human rights violations in other countries” said Jeremy Konyndyk, President of Refugees International. “These deals will put lives at risk. This Kafka-esque system of agreements risks creating a modern gulag of abusive detention. We are committed to pulling back the curtain on these arrangements and holding both the U.S. and recipient governments accountable on the global stage.”

Since early 2025, the Trump administration has expanded the use of forced third country transfers—sending asylum seekers, people granted withholding of removal under the Refugee Convention or the Convention Against Torture, and those with family ties in the United States to countries where they are often stranded, separated, detained, or face onward deportation, in some cases to the country they fled persecution. The practice—which began with the transfer of Asian and African asylum seekers to Panama and Costa Rica and Venezuelans to El Salvador’s CECOT prison—now spans multiple continents through a web of secretive diplomatic agreements with different qualities and quid pro quos. As part of its coercive deportation agenda, the Trump administration is also refusing to consider the asylum applications of thousands of additional individuals and instead threatening them with future forced transfer to third countries.

The new website offers an invaluable comprehensive picture of the diplomatic deals behind the agreements and their various forms. It details where people are being sent and how they are treated when transferred. It also provides resources for journalists, policymakers, advocates, and attorneys working to understand and challenge what is happening.

But what if that person committed a burglary in their late teens, served years in state prison, turned their life around, and now mentors at-risk youth?

Do the details matter? Researchers found that they do.

A new poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research examines California voters’ attitudes toward due process for immigrants with criminal convictions during the Trump administration’s nationwide crackdown on unauthorized immigration. The survey also examined support for how tax dollars are spent and Californians’ views on the state’s sanctuary policies.

It found bipartisan support for ensuring that immigrants facing deportation receive due process, including ones with criminal records.

“This survey shows that there’s clear concern about the current administration’s approach to immigration enforcement,” said Sara Knight, a research director at Goodwin Simon Strategic Research. “I’m not surprised by the results, but I am heartened to see how strong the support for due process is and the growing frustration with treating people inhumanely in our immigration system.”

President Donald Trump campaigned on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals, among other things, and he has made good on that. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested more than 160,608 noncitizens nationwide with criminal convictions or pending charges, since his inauguration.

The Trump administration has sought to expand the use of “expedited removal,” which allows immigration officers to remove certain non-citizens, like those convicted of crimes, from the United States without a hearing before an immigration judge.

Researchers say this latest poll by Goodwin Simon Strategic Research, released to CalMatters this week, also reflects waning support, even among a small majority of Republicans for the harshest immigration enforcement practices. It showed 84% of Democrats, 61% of independents, and 54% of Republicans agreed that “even if someone does have a record, they deserve due process and the chance to have their case heard by a judge before being deported.”

The poll was commissioned by the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, both pro-immigrant organizations. Goodwin Simon Strategic Research describes itself on its website as an “independent opinion research firm.” Researchers wrote the survey questions and polled more than 1,200 self-identified voters. Knight said the partisan divide among those polled mirrored the party-affiliation split in the electorate. The margin of error was 3 points.

Some other recent polls echo similar conclusions released in recent weeks, including one released last week by UC Berkeley’s Possibility Lab that found one-third of Latino voters who supported Trump now regret their choice. Another public opinion poll by the nonpartisan research firm Public Policy Institute of California found 71% of Californians surveyed said they disapproved of the job ICE is doing. And, a CNN exit poll after the Proposition 50 redistricting election on Nov. 4 found that about three-quarters of California voters said they’re dissatisfied with or angry about the way things are going in the U.S., and 6 in 10 said the Trump administration’s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far.

Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, pointed to other recent national polls to argue the public supports Trump’s immigration policies.

“President Trump and Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem are delivering on the American people’s mandate to deport illegal aliens, and the latest polls show that support for the America First agenda has not wavered – including a New York Times poll that nearly 8 in 10 Americans support deporting illegal aliens with criminal records,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.

“The American people, the law, and common sense are on our side, and we will not stop until law and order is restored after Biden’s open border chaos flooded our country with the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens,” she continued.

From prison to ICE

In the more recent Goodwin Simon Strategic Research poll, 61% of voters surveyed said they want California’s prison system to stop directly handing immigrants over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for deportation.

The state’s sanctuary law does not apply to immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes. State prisons have transferred to ICE more than 9,500 people with criminal records since Gov. Gavin Newsom took office in 2019, according to data released to CalMatters. So far in 2025, ICE has picked up 1,217 inmates directly from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, the data shows.

The corrections department also provides ICE with information that helps the agency locate, arrest, and deport people who are not directly transferred. CalMatters obtained and reviewed more than 27,000 pages of emails between state prison employees and ICE. The emails show prison employees regularly communicate with ICE about individuals in state custody, including U.S. citizens. They often share personal details about their families, visitors, and phone calls. Often, these family members have no criminal records and are U.S. citizens

Newsom, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla, and Speaker Robert Rivas have all denounced ICE’s broader deportation efforts. But all three have also indicated some level of support for having federal immigration officials remove noncitizens with prior convictions for violent crimes from the community.

The governor has stated he would veto legislation that seeks to restrict the state prison system’s ability to coordinate with federal immigration authorities for the deportation of felons.

‘We may be deporting the wrong people’

Goodwin Simon researchers found that voters’ opinions change when they find out more details about the personal circumstances of a noncitizen with a past criminal conviction, even for violent crime. Pollsters gave two narratives to voters.

One was about a man who was brought to the United States from Mexico as a child. He got into a fight in his early 20s that left someone injured. The man was sentenced to seven years in state prison, where he turned his life around by taking college classes and helping other inmates get their high school diplomas. When he got out of prison, he was deported to Mexico before an immigration judge could decide on his case.

The other narrative was about a person closely connected to a man whose family fled genocide in Cambodia when he was a baby. In the U.S., the man was the lookout for a robbery when he was a teenager and served 30 years in state prison. Upon his release, prison officials turned him over to ICE.

“We may be deporting the wrong people. Although this last person did commit a crime, he has served his time and is now a valuable member of society, so it would be hard to say for sure if a person ever committed a crime deserves to be sent back. That is why the due process is important,” one Republican voter from Sacramento responded to the poll. She shifted her opinion from the view that people with past criminal convictions should be automatically deported to favoring a judge reviewing each individual case after hearing the narratives.

The change does not appear to prevent people from submitting new asylum applications if they are applying within the United States.
Migrants who qualify for work permits The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would reduce the amount of time work permits are valid for refugees, asylum seekers and people granted asylum, among other migrants.","The Trump administration has made sweeping changes to the immigration system in the wake of last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan who received asylum in April, has been charged in the attack, which killed Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and seriously wounded Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe. Mr. Lakanwal has pleaded not guilty.

President Trump has cited the shooting to deepen his crackdown on immigration. In the last week, officials have issued a number of policies upending the legal pathways for immigrants to enter or live in the United States, particularly for Afghans and other people from countries subject to Mr. Trump’s travel ban.

For now, the new rules halt the ability of Afghans to obtain visas to come to the United States. But they also indefinitely prevent a broader swath of migrants already in the country from moving ahead with efforts to obtain benefits like green cards and citizenship. And they have halted decisions on asylum applications for people regardless of their nationality.

It is unclear how long the administration will pause decisions on asylum and other benefit applications. On Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said the hold would be “lifted by the U.S.C.I.S. director through a subsequent memorandum.”

Here are the major changes and who is affected:

Asylum applicants

The federal government has frozen decisions on asylum applications that have been filed with U.S.C.I.S. by migrants currently inside the country. That benefit is granted to migrants seeking protection in the United States because they fear persecution in their home countries.

The hold could affect as many as 1.5 million people who had pending applications with U.S.C.I.S. as of June, according to the latest government data.

The change does not appear to prevent people from submitting new asylum applications if they are applying within the United States. But decisions on new filings would be paused, immigration lawyers said.

Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization, said the halt on asylum decisions could be extremely disruptive for people who have already been waiting months or years for a ruling.

The pause affects citizens from the 12 countries that Mr. Trump subjected to a travel ban in June: Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

It also applies to citizens from seven countries with partial travel restrictions: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Citizens of those countries cannot enter the United States permanently or receive certain visas.

In a memo, U.S.C.I.S. said the hold affects benefits such as green card renewals, which legal permanent residents typically need to obtain every 10 years.

The pause on benefits has also effectively halted the citizenship process for migrants from the 19 countries subject to the travel ban, according to immigration advocates and officials.

In recent days, lawyers for migrants who have applied for benefits have said that some of their clients have already had their green card interviews or naturalization ceremonies canceled with little explanation.

Migrants from those countries who entered the country since the start of the Biden administration and were approved for benefits such as green cards, asylum and citizenship will also be subject to a reassessment, “to fully assess all national security and public safety threats along with any other related grounds of inadmissibility or ineligibility,” according to U.S.C.I.S.

Those people could be required to complete additional interviews with officers to defend their applications if federal officials find any potential discrepancies, said Jeff Joseph, the president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. That could mean more people are subject to deportation, he added.

“They’re going to be looking for everything that they can do to screen up people and put them in removal proceedings,” Mr. Joseph said.

Applying for benefits like green cards or citizenship could also take longer for other applicants, regardless of their countries of origin, because immigration officers will be reassessing certain benefits that have already been approved, said Sarah Pierce, a former policy analyst at U.S.C.I.S. who now serves as the director of social policy at the center-left think tank Third Way.

“This is an agency that is already over-strapped with very, very long processing times,” Ms. Pierce said of U.S.C.I.S.

Last week, the agency also said it would consider “country-specific factors” included in the travel ban as “significant negative factors” when evaluating applications for green cards and other benefits. The policy change, which could make it harder for immigrants from those countries to receive approvals, had been under consideration before the shooting of the National Guard members.

Migrants who qualify for work permits

The Trump administration said on Thursday that it would reduce the amount of time work permits are valid for refugees, asylum seekers and people granted asylum, among other migrants. Federal officials will now require them to renew their work permits every 18 months instead of every five years.

The Biden administration previously extended the maximum period to five years, up from two years, in an effort to reduce burdens on the agency that processes applications for employment authorization.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/05dc-immig-explainer-fptm/05dc-immig-explainer-fptm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:07.088281

It happened at a simple green card hearing last Monday at 26 Federal Plaza. The building, home to ICE in New York, is intimidating these days, but Allen Dabrio Marrero and Matthew Marrero, married for two years now, felt confident.

""We were scared, but we also felt like we'd done everything right up to this point,"" Matthew Marrero said. ""My husband has been meticulous with his immigration paperwork. And we've paid all the fees, we pay our taxes, we do everything we're supposed to.""

It turned out, there was one thing Allen Dabrio Marrero had missed: a piece of mail when he was between addresses.

""We were told that in December of 2022, he had missed a hearing, and the judge ordered removal,"" Matthew Marrero said. ""That was the first we had ever heard of that.""

It was especially surprising since he'd had hearings, gotten work authorization and even a driver's license since then and applied to school to become a nurse.

The 34-year-old has been in the U.S. since 2013, applying for asylum from the Cayman Islands, where it wasn't safe for him to openly be LGBTQ+. Ten years later, he met Matthew.

""From there, it was just like, he's my person,"" Matthew Marrero said. ""He heard me and saw me the way I've always wanted to be heard and seen. Within a month of us talking, I had written in journal that this man is going to be my husband, I'm going to spend the rest of my life with this man. He's the love of my life and I am lost without him.""

Allen Dabrio Marrero has been in detention since ICE officers took him into custody at that hearing last week but has been granted a stay that's keeping him from being deported, for now.

The couple is waiting for the chance to tell a judge this was a simple oversight, and that he should be home for Christmas.

""The way the narrative has been spun to the general public is that they're going after the worst of the worst. And that is not true,"" Matthew Marrero said. ""My husband is a contributing member to society, is proud to want to be an American.""

He's has been visiting Allen Dabrio Marrero at Newark's Delaney Hall, which he calls eye-opening.

""The families, and the babies, and the people who are sitting out in the cold and the rain, just to get a glimpse of their loved one. This is wrong. This is wrong,"" Matthew Marrero said.

In the meantime, Middle Collegiate Church, of which the Marreros are members, is rallying around the couple.

A GoFundMe page has also been started to help the couple.

With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.

Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.

Earlier this month, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.

The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.

The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”

The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.

Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.

Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”

Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.

“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.

In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”

“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47644/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-08-06-texas-redistrict-hearing-reuters-scaled1764892812.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=sN_F_b8y,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:38.572222

In a written order, the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit lifted an injunction that said the troops needed to leave the nation’s capital by 11 December.

The DC circuit’s order, while not a final judgment, allows Trump to continue a deployment he began this summer and has ramped up in response to a 26 November shooting of two national guard members near the White House.

The order came in a lawsuit filed by the DC attorney general, Brian Schwalb, a Democrat and the capital city’s top legal officer.

More than 2,000 national guard soldiers have been in Washington since Trump’s initial deployment in August, part of the president’s contentious immigration and crime crackdown targeting Democratic-led cities.

The guard troops in the city include contingents from the District of Columbia, as well as Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama.

US district judge Jia Cobb ruled on 20 November that the troop presence was probably unlawful. She temporarily blocked the deployment, but paused her ruling for three weeks to allow time for the administration to remove the troops, as well as to appeal her decision.

Rather than begin a wind-down, Trump, a Republican, ordered 500 more troops to Washington after the shooting of two members of the West Virginia national guard, which officials described as a “targeted” attack. One of the troops has since died from her injuries.

A 29-year-old Afghan national is facing charges for the shooting, prompting Trump to escalate his anti-immigrant rhetoric and declare a halt to immigration from what he called “third-world countries”.

Schwalb sued on 4 September, accusing Trump of unlawfully usurping control of the city’s law enforcement and violating a law prohibiting troops from doing domestic police work.

The president has unique law-enforcement powers in Washington, which is not part of any state, but local officials say he overstepped by taking over the mayor’s policing role and flouting laws that forbid federal troops from doing civilian police work.

Trump administration lawyers called the lawsuit a political stunt in court filings and said the president iswas free to deploy troops to Washington without the approval of local leaders.

Trump has also moved to deploy troops in Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to combat what he describes as lawlessness and violent unrest over his immigration crackdown.

Democratic leaders of those cities and their states have sued to block the deployments, saying they amount to an attempt to punish political foes with militarized shows of force.

Trial courts around the country have ruled against the troop deployments. The US supreme court is expected to soon weigh in on the legality of Trump’s use of the national guard in Chicago, a decision with repercussions for other cities.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a81ff0974b16d5f219c7530321dae6917a12d82d/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26cf5146587ea2d2a01747d8aaf5e28d",N,,2025-12-05 10:59:10.071618

President Trump declared that Somalis are “garbage” on Tuesday, adding that they should “go back to where they came from,” and has threatened to denaturalize citizens.
To be born in a disfavored country was considered to be inherently unfit to immigrate to the United States.
If the Trump administration has its way, these assumptions will once again govern U.S. immigration policy.
Mr. Miller and others in the Trump administration do not appear to know that those 1924 immigration restrictions are no longer on the books.","Sixty years ago, the United States abolished immigration restrictions based on nationality alone. By 1965, such discrimination had become an embarrassment. In an emotional ceremony by the Statue of Liberty, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared that the legislation he was signing “corrects a cruel and enduring wrong” and makes Americans “truer to ourselves both as a country and as a people.”

Now the Trump administration is reviving nationality-based discrimination. After an Afghan refugee allegedly shot two National Guard members on Nov. 26, the Trump administration “indefinitely” stopped processing immigration-related applications for all Afghans — even those who have lived legally in the United States for years. The administration extended that same suspension to immigrants from 18 other countries, including those on the verge of receiving green cards or citizenship. President Trump declared that Somalis are “garbage” on Tuesday, adding that they should “go back to where they came from,” and has threatened to denaturalize citizens. Meanwhile, his administration claims it can classify undocumented 14-year-old Venezuelans as “alien enemies” and deport them without judicial review.

Starting in 1875 and for most of the century that followed, country-specific immigration bans were the norm, not the exception. To be born in a disfavored country was considered to be inherently unfit to immigrate to the United States.

Nativism escalated gradually. In 1875, a law barred prostitutes from “China, Japan, or any Oriental country” from entering the United States. Although people from all backgrounds practiced the world’s oldest profession, Congress perceived women from these countries as a particular threat. “Virtue is an exception” among Chinese women, one lawmaker had claimed years earlier. Another had warned that these women “spread disease and moral death among our white population.” The law succeeded in shutting down immigration for almost all Asian women, prostitutes or not.

Seven years later, the Chinese Exclusion Act went further, barring all laborers from China. Once again, Congress relied on sweeping generalizations about the Chinese. “Alien in manners, servile in labor, pagan in religion, they are fundamentally un-American,” said one congressman, referring to hundreds of millions of people.

Once the nation started thinking this way, it was hard to stop. When a Jewish factory manager was accused of murder in 1913, his conviction fueled antisemitic xenophobia. Likewise, the 1921 murder conviction of two Italian anarchists, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, helped incite the Red Scare and the restrictive immigration laws that followed. At the heart of these crackdowns were not only assumptions of collective national guilt, but beliefs in a collective national character.

Nativist fervor culminated in 1924 with the Immigration Act. Aimed at slowing immigration from undesirable countries, the law capped immigration to 2 percent of a nationality’s U.S. population as of 1890, over 30 years earlier. It proved impossible to unwind Americans’ tangled ancestry, but no matter. The law was used to justify giving the majority of visas to Northern and Western Europeans, while strictly limiting immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe — a change celebrated by the Ku Klux Klan for keeping out Catholics and Jews. The door remained almost entirely closed to people from Asia and Africa.

Why would lawmakers choose to reject a promising scientist from Asia while welcoming an illiterate farmer from Germany? Because they conflated race, nation and culture into a set of immutable traits attached to entire countries. The national character was in their “alien blood,” lawmakers said, rendering some nationalities inherently unfit for membership in the United States.

If the Trump administration has its way, these assumptions will once again govern U.S. immigration policy. Last week, Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump’s immigration policy, defended collectively punishing Afghans for the shooting that killed one National Guard member and injured another. “You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies,” he wrote. “Migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions, and terrors, of their broken homelands.” Mr. Miller would have felt right at home in the 1924 Congress.

Mr. Miller and others in the Trump administration do not appear to know that those 1924 immigration restrictions are no longer on the books. Abolishing national origin discrimination was a sea change in law that stands alongside the Voting Rights Act as one of our most important pieces of civil rights legislation. That 1965 law allocated visas based primarily on family reunification and an applicant’s ability to contribute to the labor market. Every immigrant is individually vetted, and immigration is capped worldwide, but no longer are any nationalities automatically restricted.

America is stronger for it. Nearly half of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children — and many came from countries that were heavily restricted before 1965. Immigrants generally commit fewer crimes than native-born Americans, and Afghans are no exception.

The recent shooting was horrific, and the perpetrator should be punished to the full extent of the law. But collective punishment is just the sort of bigotry that the nation rejected decades ago.

It’s also likely to be illegal. As the Supreme Court explained when upholding Mr. Trump’s first travel ban back in 2018, the president has statutory authority to suspend entry into the United States based on national origin, at least for some period of time. But that does not permit him to deny visas, cancel green cards or denaturalize immigrants based on nothing more than their country of origin.

Without question, today’s antiquated immigration system is in need of a major overhaul. But we should never go back to a system that made collective judgments about the worthiness of specific nationalities to immigrate to the United States — particularly not based on an incident involving a single person.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/05/multimedia/05frost-klpf/05frost-klpf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:15.098799

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) on CNN Sunday pushed back against the Trump administration's characterization of Somalis.","Driving the news: Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Tuesday that her agency will be targeting visa fraud in Minnesota, where around 87,000 people with Somali roots live.

What they're saying: Trump said last week that he wanted to end temporary protected status for Somalis, which would impact approximately 700 people covered by TPS.

""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State, and BILLIONS of Dollars are missing. Send them back to where they came from. It's OVER!"" he posted on Truth Social.

The other side: Minnesota State Attorney General Keith Ellison suggested in a post on X that he may seek legal recourse if Trump removes the TPS protections.

""Trump's announcement of termination of Somali TPS holders in Minnesota is legally problematic,"" he wrote. ""While a president does have a lot of authority to designate and revoke TPS, he cannot legally wield that power to discriminate against an ethnic group or to target a state, like MN.

""This ain't over.""

What we're watching: The deployment of 100 ICE agents to Minnesota also starts this week, the New York Times reported.

""When ICE agents interact with Somalis here, they will find what we've been saying for years: Almost all of us are U.S. citizens,"" state Sen. Zaynab Mohamed (DFL-Minneapolis), said in a statement.

""This act of political theater is a waste of taxpayer money and will result in the harassment of peaceful American citizens trying to go about their day.""

Here's what to know about the administration's targeting of Somalis in the U.S:

The Trump administration's visa fraud allegations

Zoom in: Noem levied allegations of visa fraud this week.

""You told me to look into Minnesota and their fraud on visa programs, 50% of them are fraudulent,"" Noem said, blaming Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during a Tuesday Cabinet meeting, without citing evidence for the figure.

Walz responded to Noem on X, saying, ""We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.""

Reality check: Ana Pottratz Acosta, professor at the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of Minnesota Law School, told CBS News the 50% figure ""doesn't sound plausible"" based on her two decades of experience.

""I think before giving any credence to those numbers, I really would want to see more specific data from the Department of Homeland Security to substantiate those allegations because they're very, very serious and really should not be made unless there is data or information to back up those claims,"" she said.

Acosta also added that the rate of immigration fraud is relatively low overall because the penalties for doing so are serious.

In a response to a request for evidence about the 50% figure, the DHS told Axios that Noem was referring to Operation Twin Shield, an investigation led by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ICE and the FBI.

""Investigations found approximately half of the cases investigated were fraudulent,"" spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. ""This operation targeted cases including naturalization, H-1B visas, marriage fraud, and the Ukrainian humanitarian parole program.""

""USCIS is working to implement the most rigorous screening and vetting protocols in agency history,"" McLaughlin said, accusing the Biden administration of ""prioritizing sheer numbers over rigorous vetting and strict adherence to legal requirements.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said his police department, which includes Somali officers, will not aid federal agencies with immigration enforcement.

""Our values and our commitment to the Somali community, to every community of immigrants and people in our city, is rock solid and will be unwavering,"" Frey said at a press conference on Tuesday.

Fraud charges with reported ties to the Somali community

Catch up quick: In March, a federal jury in Minneapolis convicted the leader of a now-defunct nonprofit Feeding Our Future and an associate on federal charges for their roles in a fraud scheme that involved $250 million in federal COVID aid.

Feeding Our Future bilked funds from a long-running federal program for feeding needy children by claiming reimbursements for thousands more children a day than they served, a 2022 federal indictment alleged.

Prosecutors at the time asserted that officials loosening the federal program's rules in 2020 as pandemic lockdowns took effect had left the door open for abuse.

As of late November, 78 defendants in total had been charged for their involvement in the scheme, and there have been 50 convictions so far.

Zoom out: While thealleged ringleader was white, many of the defendants were Somalis, and most of them were U.S. citizens, fueling the Trump administration's scrutiny into the community.

Following Feeding Our Future, several other fraud cases involving Medicaid and Minnesota's autism program came out implicating members of the state's Somali community.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on X this week that his agency will investigate allegations that money stolen from Minnesota programs ""may have been diverted"" to the Al-Shabaab militant group in Somalia.

In 2018, similar claims about a child care assistance program funding Al-Shabaab surfaced, but the nonpartisan legislative auditor's investigation wasn't able to substantiate the allegations.

Federal prosecutors have rejected claims that defendants charged in recent schemes are linked to terrorists, and none have faced terrorism financing charges so far.

Former U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Andy Luger, who oversaw the Feeding Our Future case, told the Minnesota Star Tribune last week that the defendants his office prosecuted ""were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.""

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D, Minn.) on CNN Sunday pushed back against the Trump administration's characterization of Somalis.

""Every state has a problem with crime, but what the President has done here is taken a horrific crime that occurred in Washington, D.C., where one beloved guard member is still struggling for his life, another was shot and killed. … He took that case, and then he went 2,400 miles away to Somalia and somehow indicted an entire group of people.""

""He tries to stoke division,"" Klobuchar said, ""and make people hate each other.""

The Trump administration threatens funding

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy threatened to withhold over $30 million in federal highway funding from Minnesota, citing concerns that the state improperly issued commercial drivers' licenses.

Duffy demanded Minnesota revoke licenses, blaming ""illegal foreign drivers"" for ""months of deadly crashes,"" accusing the state of doling out ""trucking licenses to unsafe, unqualified non-citizens.""

""My statement on this is, we are following the law exactly as it's written, exactly as we've implemented it for decades,"" Walz responded.

Flashback: Duffyrevoked $40 million in federal funding from California, claiming that the state wasn't enforcing English language requirements.

Between the lines: Between threatening SNAP funds to ""blue states"" and Duffy's threats over CDLs, the administration is targeting states where leaders have publicly brawled with Trump.

Every state Duffy has threatened has been a Democrat-led state, but he has said the department is auditing others, including Texas and South Dakota.

Walz, who has maintained that the state ""followed the law"" on issuing CDLs, suggested Tuesday that the administration's actions were retaliation for his online spat with Trump.

""Strange coincidence that the President goes on a rant and uses a slur against me, and I just asked him to do what every other president has done, release his medical records, and now they bring this in,"" he said.

The Somali population in the U.S.

By the numbers: An estimated 260,000 people of Somali descent were living in the U.S. in 2024, per the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey.

Many Somalis began immigrating to Minnesota in the 1990s amid a civil war, drawn to employment opportunities and social services in parts of the state, Ahmed Ismail Yusuf wrote in his 2012 book ""Somalis in Minnesota.""

Context: Somali citizens were first granted TPS status in 1991, under former President George H.W. Bush.

There ""exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in Somalia that prevent aliens who are nationals of Somalia from returning to Somalia in safety,"" the U.S. Attorney General found at the time.

TPS status for Somalis has been either extended or re-designated 27 times since then due to ongoing conflict in the nation, according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service earlier this year.

""It was never meant to be an asylum program,"" Noem said in a press briefing on Sunday, defending Trump's decision to end the TPS for nationals of Somalia, Venezuela and Nicaragua, among other nations. ""It was always meant to be put in place after an incident or an event on a temporary basis, and that's what the evaluation will be.""

,Policy,2025-12-05 14:30:42+00:00,ProPublica,"Sean Duffy Defies Congress' Power of the Purse, Which He Once Defended - ProPublica","Jake Pearson, shoshana.gordon@propublica.org",,,,,https://www.propublica.org/article/sean-duffy-trump-transportation-secretary-congress-funding,"Today, it stands in stark contrast to Duffy’s own actions as transportation secretary in the first year of Trump’s second stint in the White House.
Duffy has cited some of those directives as he has withheld congressionally approved transportation funds.
And administration officials have defended doing so, claiming that a post-Watergate law asserting Congress’ power over spending improperly restrains the president’s authority.
But a congressional watchdog and the courts have taken issue with that expansive interpretation of federal authority.
“The Constitution specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse,” the congressional watchdog wrote, arguing that the payments should resume.","Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been one of the most vociferous defenders of President Donald Trump’s expansive use of executive authority, withholding billions of dollars in federal funding to states and dismissing protests of the White House’s boundary-pushing behavior as the gripings of “disenfranchised Democrats.”

But court documents reviewed by ProPublica show that a decade ago, as a House member, Duffy took a drastically different position on presidential power, articulating a full-throated defense of Congress’ role as a check on the president — one that resembled the very arguments made by speakers at recent anti-Trump “No Kings” rallies around the country.

In an assertive, thoroughly researched 2015 legal brief, Duffy, then a Republican representative from Wisconsin, detailed the history of America’s creation in reaction to the absolute power of the English crown, invoking the Magna Carta and the Founding Fathers as he made the case for the separation of powers.

“Just as Congress may not bestow upon the President Congress’s own exclusive power to make, or to repeal, federal law,” Duffy argued, citing a 1998 court decision, “it may not bestow upon the Executive its own exclusive power of the purse.”

The brief went on to cite James Madison’s account of the Constitutional Convention, where there was “unanimous agreement that Congress, not the President, should control the purse.”

At the time, Duffy filed the friend-of-the-court brief in support of a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau gets funded. Duffy, who chaired the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, maintained that the agency’s unique funding system — its dollars come directly from the Federal Reserve System rather than by a congressional appropriation — improperly bypassed lawmakers’ authority.

The 39-page brief was filed under Duffy’s name along with a nonprofit group aligned with the Republican legal activist Leonard Leo and submitted by a preeminent conservative lawyer. Today, it stands in stark contrast to Duffy’s own actions as transportation secretary in the first year of Trump’s second stint in the White House. Indeed, his attempts to restrict congressionally appropriated transportation funding across all 50 states this year have been condemned by a congressional watchdog and federal judges, resulting in stinging public rebukes from the other branches of government that echo his own 2015 position.

Peter Levine, a civics expert at Tufts University, said that while it could be that Duffy’s views on presidential power have evolved over time, his apparent flip-flopping on something as fundamental as the meaning of the Constitution raises the prospect that Duffy may “just be playing a game for power.”

“The Constitution is a promise to continue to apply the same rules and norms over time to everybody,” he added. “When political actors completely ignore that, and just go after their own thing, I don’t think the Constitution can actually function.”

In response to questions, a Department of Transportation spokesperson asked for a copy of Duffy’s brief. But after ProPublica provided it, the spokesperson stopped responding. A message sent to a number listed for Duffy hasn’t been returned.

The expansion of executive power has been a hallmark of Trump’s second administration. The president issued a whopping 214 executive orders between Jan. 20 and Nov. 20, according to the The American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In both “number and ambition,” the orders and resulting actions are “exceeded on these dimensions in the last century only by Franklin D. Roosevelt,” one Harvard Law School professor recently noted.

Duffy has cited some of those directives as he has withheld congressionally approved transportation funds. And administration officials have defended doing so, claiming that a post-Watergate law asserting Congress’ power over spending improperly restrains the president’s authority.

But a congressional watchdog and the courts have taken issue with that expansive interpretation of federal authority.

For Duffy, the first instance came in May, when the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, concluded that the DOT had violated the law when it halted payments in February from a $5 billion fund for electric car charging stations that Congress approved under former President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure law.

“The Constitution specifically vests Congress with the power of the purse,” the congressional watchdog wrote, arguing that the payments should resume. “The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation.”

A White House spokesperson called the GAO’s opinion “incorrect” when it was issued and argued that the DOT was “appropriately using” its authority.

In June, a federal judge in Washington ordered transportation officials to lift the pause after a handful of states sued Duffy and the DOT, writing that when the executive branch “treads upon the will of the Legislative Branch,” it’s up to the court “to remediate the situation and restore the balance of power.”

The government has moved to dismiss the lawsuit, writing that it had revamped the grant application process for the charging station money and also that the states’ constitutional concerns were unfounded, since another part of the Constitution “vests the President with broad, discretionary authority to ‘take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.’” The suit is ongoing.

Separately, a federal judge last month sided with states that had challenged an attempt by Duffy to condition billions of dollars more in federal funds for highway maintenance and other core transportation functions in exchange for helping the administration detain immigrants.

“Should Congress have wished, it could have attempted to entice State cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement through lawful means, and it could have sought to empower federal agencies to assist it in doing so,” John McConnell Jr., the chief judge of the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, wrote in a Nov. 4 decision blocking Duffy’s actions.

But it didn’t, he said, and instead administration officials had “transgressed well-settled constitutional limitations on federal funding conditions.”

“The Constitution demands the Court set aside this lawless behavior,” he wrote.

The lawsuits are among hundreds of legal actions this year challenging the constitutionality of the White House’s various actions, including its attempts to halt the disbursement of hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending that Congress had previously approved.

As for the legal challenge Duffy supported in 2015, it was ultimately unsuccessful and the Supreme Court last year affirmed the constitutionality of the CFPB’s funding mechanism.

Yet the ruling has not insulated the bureau from the Trump administration, and officials have advanced novel legal theories to achieve what Duffy sought a decade ago. The administration now argues that since the Fed operates at a loss, it has no profits to transfer to the CFPB.

As a result, the bureau is being starved. According to a recent court filing by government lawyers, it will run out of operating funds by early next year.","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2231496543_maxHeight_3000_maxWidth_3000.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-12-05 10:59:19.057270

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

U.S. Southern Command said that it killed four men in a strike on a suspected drug vessel in the eastern Pacific yesterday. Ismail Shakil reports for Reuters.

In closed-door briefings yesterday, Adm. Frank M. Bradley and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine are said to have told lawmakers that they assumed the hull of the vessel might have stayed afloat following the initial strike on Sept. 2 because it still contained packs of cocaine. They believed the survivors could have managed to float back to Venezuela, allowing them to try again to deliver the cocaine. Bradley denied that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had told him to kill everyone, and insisted that the follow-up strike was lawful. Helene Cooper, Megan Mineiro, Julian E. Barnes, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times; Stephen Groves and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

The video footage of the strikes on Sept. 2 showed that around 30 minutes after the first strike, the front portion of the boat was overturned but still afloat, and the two individuals were visible, according to lawmakers and congressional staff who viewed the video and were briefed on it yesterday. The video does not show the survivors using any radios or satellite phones, according to sources, as U.S. officials had told the New York Times earlier this week. Helene Cooper, Megan Mineiro, Julian E. Barnes, and Charlie Savage report for the New York Times; Stephen Groves and Lisa Mascaro report for AP News.

The Defense Department is considering publicly releasing the video footage of the Sept. 2 strikes, Axios has learned. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton (R-AR) said he supports releasing the full video, adding that yesterday’s briefing “demonstrated exactly what I thought it would demonstrate – that these were righteous strikes completely within the law of armed conflict.” Cotton called the reports that Hegseth had given orders to leave no one alive a “total lie.” Other lawmakers emerged from the briefings feeling increasingly concerned about U.S. military action in the Caribbean. Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) said what he saw was “one of the most troubling things” he has ever seen in public service, adding “any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors — bad guys, bad guys — but attacking shipwrecked sailors.” Stef W. Kight reports; Josephine Walker reports for Axios.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The Kremlin said today that Russia and the United States were making progress in peace talks, adding that Moscow is ready to carry on working with the current U.S. team. Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday however restated Russia’s demand for full control over Ukraine’s Donbas region, saying Moscow would take it by force unless Ukrainian troops withdrew. “We need real peace, not appeasement,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also said yesterday. Francois Murphy reports for Reuters.

French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed concern on a confidential call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week that U.S.-led peace negotiations could pressure Kyiv into yielding territory, according to the transcript reported by Der Spiegel. Macron said, “There is a chance that the U.S. will betray Ukraine on territory without clarity on security guarantees.” Merz warned Zelenskyy that U.S. negotiators are “playing games” and that he should be “very careful” over the next few days. Andreas Rinke and Gabriel Stargardter report for Reuters.

Macron yesterday pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to help end the war in Ukraine during three-day visit to China. Marcon told reporters that the two leaders had discussed the war “at length,” adding that he hoped Xi would join efforts to achieve “at the very least” a halt in attacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine. Xi did not commit to anything, telling reporters, “China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the crisis, while resolutely opposing any irresponsible actions of shifting the blame or smearing.” Vivan Wang reports for the New York Times.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military said yesterday that its forces have killed around 40 Hamas fighters who had been trapped in tunnels below Rafah, in an area currently under Israeli control. Hamas has not officially confirmed the number of those trapped or how many remain in the tunnels. Maayan Lubell and Nidal al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

Yasser Abu Shabab, the leader of the anti-Hamas militia ‘Popular Force’ in Gaza, was shot and killed while intervening in a Palestinian clan dispute, the militia said yesterday. Anat Peled and Dov Lieber report for the Wall Street Journal.

President Trump plans to announce before Christmas that the Gaza peace process is entering its second phase and to unveil the new governance structure for Gaza, according to two U.S. officials. The sources say the U.S., Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey are negotiating with Hamas on an agreement under which the group will step back from governing Gaza and begin a process of disarmament. A Western source said Egypt and Qatar are optimistic, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Israel announced today that it has set its defense budget at 112 billion shekels ($34.63 billion) for 2026. “We are allocating a huge budget to strengthen the army this year, but also one that allows us to return the State of Israel to a path of growth and relief for citizens.” Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said. Alexander Cornwell and Steven Scheer report for Reuters.

SUDANESE CIVIL WAR

U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk yesterday said that he fears “a new wave of atrocities” amid a surge of fighting in the Kordofan region, Sudan. “It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in el-Fasher,” Türk said. AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Officials from Germany, Norway, the United Kingdom, and other countries attended a conference this week sponsored by the Israeli Defense Ministry that showcased battlefield technology tested in Israel’s military campaigns in Gaza, Lebanon, and Iran. In the auditorium, a video of two attack drones going into a building in Gaza was shown to the audience to illustrate the technology. Anat Peled reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Germany has deployed five Eurofighter jets and around 150 military personnel to Poland to help secure the country’s airspace following a series of drone incursions in September, the German air force announced yesterday. “With this mission, we are sending another strong message of support for our neighbour Poland and NATO in total,” German Air Chief Holger Neumann said. Sabine Siebold reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“We’re succeeding where so many others have failed and this has become the eighth war that we’ve ended in less than one year,” Trump said yesterday as he hosted the leaders of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) at the newly renamed Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace. Trump went on to praise yesterday’s agreement, which is set to open up the region’s copper and cobalt reserves to U.S. companies. “We’ll be involved with sending some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries,” Trump said. Fighting is ongoing in eastern DRC, and the economic deals agreed yesterday may prove difficult to implement due to instability in the region. Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Saikou Jammeh, and Ruth Maclean report for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

New data shows that in ICE operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and across Massachusetts, more than half of those arrested had no criminal record, despite the Trump administration’s position that the aggressive operations are necessary because sanctuary policies have made it harder for federal agents to go after immigrants who have committed crimes. The data was obtained through a lawsuit and made available by the Deportation Data Project. Albert Sun reports for the New York Times.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced yesterday that some migrants will now be required to renew their work permits every 18 months instead of every five years. The agency said it would help it screen and vet migrants more often, allowing it to identify people with “potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal.” Madeleine Ngo reports for the New York Times.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said yesterday that the Trump administration will be increasing the number of countries covered by the travel ban to more than 30. Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list. Ryan Patrick Jones reports for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A grand jury yesterday declined to re-indict New York Attorney General Letitia James, according to sources. Devlin Barrett and Jonah E. Bromwich report for the New York Times

The Supreme Court yesterday issued an order allowing Texas to use its newly redrawn congressional maps, temporarily blocking a lower court that found the maps were likely unconstitutional for racial gerrymandering. In a 17-page dissent, Justice Elena Kagan argued that the majority had wrongly overturned a careful 160-page lower court ruling, “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.” Abbie VanSickle reports for the New York Times.

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) had his security increased this week after Taylor Taranto, a pardoned Jan. 6 defendant who was previously convicted of threatening Raskin and former President Obama, allegedly showed up near Raskin’s house earlier this week, Axios learned. Andrew Solender reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Trump National Security Strategy was released yesterday, providing insight into the administration’s foreign policy strategy. The document focuses closely on increasing U.S. military presence in the Western Hemisphere to battle migration, drugs, and the rise of adversarial powers in the region, adding that this is largely about protecting the U.S. homeland. The document describes such plans as part of a “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, a notion from 1823 that the U.S. will not tolerate malign foreign interference in its own hemisphere. In relation to Europe, the strategy sets out that the administration will pursue a policy of “burden-shifting” intended to make Europe “stand on its own feet,” as “the days of the United States propping up the entire world order like Atlas are over.” Nahal Toosie reports for POLITICO; Ben Hall reports for the Financial Times.

The Government Accountability Office confirmed yesterday that it opened an investigation into Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, amid complaints about Pulte’s efforts to go after Trump’s political opponents. Ben Berkowitz and Courtenay Brown report for Axios.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday issued an administrative stay, blocking a lower court order that said the National Guard’s presence in Washington was unlawful and that the troops should be removed by Dec. 11. The order said that the decision was designed to give the court enough time to consider the issue, and “should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits” of the case. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

Addressing the event, Nikos Sitaropoulos, Head of the Division on Migration and Refugees, underlined that “The issue of protection of vulnerable persons, especially children, in migration and asylum has been at the heart of the Council of Europe Action Plan on Protecting Vulnerable Persons in the Context of MIgration and Asylum in Europe (2021-2025), and I believe that it will continue to be so in the years to come.”

He added that all legal practitioners need “to pay special attention to ongoing development of legal standards, especially the developing case-law of the Strasbourg Court, and the soft law produced by institutions such as the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers, which reinforce and advance protection of vulnerable people on the move.""

The Dream Act has historically attracted some bipartisan support.","WASHINGTON, D.C. (NEXSTAR) — Democrats and immigration advocates joined forces on Capitol Hill Thursday to call for renewed protections for young undocumented immigrants as the Trump administration ramps up nationwide immigration raids.

Lawmakers reintroduced the Dream Act, legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for people brought to the United States illegally as children, often known as “Dreamers.”

Advocates say stepped-up enforcement has left many in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) community living in fear.

“Our communities are being hunted,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, the executive director at United We Dream, said, urging Congress to act.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) who is retiring at the end of his term, noted he has introduced the Dream Act every Congress since 2001.

A“I’m not giving up,” Durbin said, calling himself “a proud son of an immigrant” committed to helping the next generation. He also urged former President Barack Obama to create the DACA program in 2012, which has allowed hundreds of thousands of undocumented young people to legally work and live in the United States without immediate threat of deportation.

Since Pres. Donald Trump returned to office, advocates report that immigration agents have detained as many as 20 DACA recipients. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif) said one of his constituents, a deaf DACA recipient, was detained while working at a Los Angeles car wash.

“He cannot hear, but he was stopped and detained by federal agents,” Padilla said.

The Dream Act has historically attracted some bipartisan support. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is the bill’s lead Republican sponsor, though she did not attend Thursday’s press event. Padilla said many Republicans privately express support but have yet to do so publicly.

“All I’m waiting for is for enough of my Republican colleagues to express their support publicly the way they’re sharing it privately,” Padilla said. “They know it’s wrong for so many young people to be limited in their opportunities.”

The bill still faces long odds. Some Republicans insist Congress must focus on enforcing existing immigration laws before considering broader reforms.

“There’s a process by which you can come here legally,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) “If you don’t abide by that process, you don’t have a right to be here.”

The Trump administration has encouraged undocumented immigrants to self-deport. While Trump has not moved to end DACA during his current term, he attempted to do so in 2017, an effort the Supreme Court blocked in 2020. The administration is now pursuing actions to prevent DACA recipients from accessing certain federal health and education benefits.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25249755383898-e1757597058271.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-05 10:59:24.277499

“Texas has also made a strong showing of irreparable harm and that the equities and public interest favor it,” the Supreme Court ruling said.
The District Court violated that rule here.” Acting at the behest of President Trump, Texas Gov.","The Supreme Court ruled for Texas and its GOP leaders on Thursday, clearing the way for the state to use a new election map in 2026 that is expected to send five more Republicans to Congress.

The justices set aside, for now, a 2-1 ruling by district judges who called the state’s map a racial gerrymander. Thursday’s vote was 6-3 along the usual lines, with the conservative justices in the majority and the three liberals in dissent.

The court’s five-paragraph order said the district judges “failed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith by construing ambiguous direct and circumstantial evidence against the legislature.”

“The impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple,” wrote Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. in a concurring opinion.

Texas lawmakers had said they acted out of partisan motives, not racial ones.

“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge — that put aside every consideration except getting the issue before it right,” wrote Justice Elena Kagan in dissent. “And today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race. Because this Court’s precedents and our Constitution demand better, I respectfully dissent.”

She was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The decision bolsters Republicans in their bid to retain control of the House, and it’s a setback for Democrats and voting rights advocates.

It is consistent with the conservative majority’s view that drawing election districts is a “political question” left to state lawmakers, not judges. But in the past, the court also said racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional under the 14th and 15th Amendments.

In response to the Texas mid-decade redistricting, California Gov. Gavin Newsom won voters’ approval for redrawing his state’s congressional districts with the aim of electing five more Democrats in 2026.

On Nov. 21, Texas state’s attorneys filed an emergency appeal at the Supreme Court, urging the justices to act quickly to block the lower court’s ruling.

They argued the new election map for Texas was drawn based on partisan advantage, not the race of the voters. And they said a further delay would disrupt the next election because Dec. 8 is the filing deadline for candidates.

They cited the so-called “Purcell principle” as grounds for setting aside the district court ruling because it came to close to an impending election.

The Texas mid-decade restricting arose in July.

“Texas has also made a strong showing of irreparable harm and that the equities and public interest favor it,” the Supreme Court ruling said. “This Court has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election. The District Court violated that rule here.”

Acting at the behest of President Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for a special session of the Legislature to redraw its 38 congressional voting districts with the aim of ousting five Democrats from the House of Representatives.

As justification, he cited the “constitutional concerns” raised by Harmeet Dhillon, the head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.

She contended the state had several unconstitutional “coalition districts” which had a “non-White” majority made up of Black and Latino voters.

Voting rights advocates said Texas Republicans followed her view and redrew districts near Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth to erase those where Latino and Black voters formed a majority.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown said the evidence showed the Texas “Legislature had redistricted not for the political goal of appeasing President Trump nor of gaining five Republican U.S. House seats, but to achieve DOJ’s racial goal of eliminating coalition districts.”

If so, he said, the new map should be set aside, and the state should use the 2021 map drawn by the GOP.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75d89e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff6%2F42%2F3bc5af52ca0364da41a6a470435e%2Fdac9254fd08e4a8c8f57f299e4ae126d,N,,2025-12-05 07:57:23.343265

The surge by Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expected to target individuals in the Twin Cities area with deportation orders, the official said. The exact scope and duration of the operation are not clear so far.

The crackdown comes as Mr. Trump castigates Minnesota's large community of Somali immigrants, regularly pointing to the country — often in incendiary terms — as a justification for his administration's sweeping mass deportation campaign.

During a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia ""garbage"" and claimed they ""contribute nothing.""

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" the president said Tuesday. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

In recent days, the Trump administration has halted all immigration cases, including citizenship ceremonies, for people from Somalia and 18 other nations on its travel ban, and has ordered a reexamination of all green cards issued to immigrants from those countries, CBS News has reported.

And last month, Mr. Trump said he was ending a deportation protection program called Temporary Protected Status for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that ""Somali gangs are terrorizing the people."" The TPS program for Somalia is set to expire in March 2026, though the Department of Homeland Security has not formally announced its termination.

Mr. Trump has also brought attention to a massive public assistance fraud scandal that has dogged Minnesota politics for years, in which dozens of defendants — most of whom are of Somali descent — were accused of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from food aid, autism services and housing programs. The president has blamed Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the fraud schemes and claimed Somali immigrants have ""ripped off that state.""

Democratic officials and members of Minnesota's Somali community have denounced Mr. Trump's statements, with Walz on Thursday calling them ""vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.""

""I am not garbage,"" Hamse Warfa, a Somali-born entrepreneur who lives in the Minneapolis area and runs a nationwide education nonprofit, told CBS News Minnesota. ""I'm a proud American citizen.""

Minnesota has one of the country's largest Somali populations, with some 76,000 people of Somali descent statewide — representing just over 1% of the state's population, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

The state's Somali community grew after the East African country descended into civil war in the early 1990s, causing scores of people to flee Somalia, which still faces instability, threats of insurgency and poverty.

In some cases, Somali refugees were resettled elsewhere in the U.S. before moving to Minnesota, drawn in many cases by job opportunities, safety, good schools and a longstanding network of nonprofits in the state that assist refugees, Somali American and Macalester College professor Ahmed Samatar told CBS News Minnesota in 2019. Just over half of Somali Minnesotans arrived in the U.S. before 2010, and one in five moved to the U.S. before 2000.

Apple Valley mom detained

“We’re trying to do whatever we can,” a man named Abdul, who doesn’t want to share his last name, quietly told 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS on Thursday.

The Apple Valley father-of-three spoke with reporter Richard Reeve outside the Whipple Federal Building near Fort Snelling, where his wife is being held in ICE custody.

“I’m an American citizen, all her children are American citizens,” Abdul said. “She was working for over 20 years in the area, especially with refugee settlement. She never had any crime.”

He says his wife was driving on Thursday to pick up her 11-year-old son at school, after the boy complained about not feeling well.

The woman says she was driving along Highway 77 when she was blocked in by several unmarked SUVs, and that one of the people detaining her said he had a warrant and that she was under arrest.

Steven Thal, her attorney, says that many years ago, an immigration judge granted the 45-year-old mother “withholding of removal,” which means she can’t be deported back to her native Somalia.

He says he’s still working to learn why his client was picked up by ICE agents.

“She’s able to live and work here in the United States,” Thal notes. “She’s paid her taxes, she’s filed for work permits, she’s stayed out of trouble.”

5 EYEWITNESS NEWS checked and was unable to find any criminal prosecution or conviction for the woman.

Thal says she’s being transferred to the Crow Wing County Jail.

He says he plans to file for a bond hearing before an immigration judge as early as Friday and possibly may file a writ of habeas corpus petition before a federal judge, challenging the legality of the woman’s detention.

Abdul says he’s not sure what’s next.

“Something like that, it’s not fair,” he says. “That’s not the America that we know. It’s not the America where we choose to live.”",https://kstp.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICE-IN.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 04:56:36.513277

Some of those citizens report having been beaten, tased, tackled, dragged, and shot by immigration agents during their arrests.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests have skyrocketed during President Donald Trump's second term, but they're still well below the benchmarks set by White House officials.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told Axios that since Trump's return to office, agents under DHS authority have arrested nearly 579,000 ""illegal aliens."" The spike in immigration arrests is credited to anti-immigration policies championed by White House Deputy Chief of Staff and immigration czar Stephen Miller.

According to government data obtained by the outlet, ICE has been arresting roughly 1,100 people per day in recent weeks. While this number is significantly higher than the 821 arrested on average per day in the first ten months of the year, it is still some way off the administration’s goal of 3,000-per-day.

The Trump administration initially insisted that only illegal migrants with criminal records would be targeted for its sweeps, but that standard has fallen by the wayside. A majority of those arrested don’t have a conviction, while agents are being encouraged to make “collateral arrests,” including undocumented people who happen to be with someone on a target list, according to Axios.

That is a departure from the Biden administration, when individuals without criminal records were not prioritized in immigration arrests.

""The new data confirms that the Trump administration isn't focused on legitimate public safety risks, but rather on hitting politically motivated arrest targets,"" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told Axios.

He said that DHS is ""sweeping up families and workers with clean records and arresting people who are complying with their obligations to attend court hearings and check-ins,""

In a recent incident, immigration agents arrested and deported a 19-year-old college student who was trying to fly home to surprise her family on Thanksgiving, even though a court order ruled that she should be allowed to stay in the U.S.

Immigration raids across the country have sparked lawsuits in their wake, but the Trump administration has been dragging its heels on complying with court orders resulting from that litigation.

In Chicago, a judge ordered that 600 people detained by immigration agents be released after they were arrested without a warrant. A judge in Washington, D.C. halted similar warrantless arrests following a lawsuit challenging the practice.

Mclaughlin told Axios that, despite the resistance, this is ""just the beginning.""

""This is just the beginning. President Trump and Secretary Noem have jump-started an agency that was vilified and barred from doing its job for the last four years,"" she said.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson made similar comments, insisting that President Donald Trump is ""delivering on the President's promise to the American people by carrying out the largest mass deportation operation of criminal illegal aliens in American history.""

""Despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful rulings by lower courts, the arrests and deportations will continue,"" she said.

That ""unprecedented number of legal challenges"" is likely to grow thanks to immigration agents' lack of discernment in their arrests. According to a recent ProPublica report, at least 170 — but likely many more — American citizens have been detained by ICE, with dozens held for more than a day without being given a chance to call loved ones or a lawyer.

Some of those citizens report having been beaten, tased, tackled, dragged, and shot by immigration agents during their arrests. Others report having been held outside in detention facilities in nothing more than their underwear.

KTVB obtained a video from a Nampa woman, who asked to remain anonymous, showing her family being detained on Amity Road in Nampa.

The woman told KTVB that four of her cousins were taken into custody during a traffic stop on Monday, Dec. 1. She said all four were undocumented but had no criminal record.

""They are not people with a criminal record, they are not bad people,"" she said. ""They are good, hardworking people who come to this country, taking risks to provide for their families.""

She mentioned that two were transferred to the Elmore County Detention Center, and one minor was released the same day.

KTVB confirmed two of the cousins are currently held in ICE facilities in Texas, while another is in Nevada.

""We were in shock by what happened yesterday, because it happened right outside our house,"" the woman said. ""I mean, it's not like they were speeding or anything like that. And it was early, around 7 a.m.""

Several witnesses to these traffic stops have told KTVB the officers involved were not wearing clear agency markings. Some also recall seeing Nampa police on the scene.

A spokesperson for the Nampa Police Department told KTVB they have no records of assisting with ICE-related traffic stops, but said – as with any law enforcement agency – they would respond if asked.

The Canyon County Sheriff's Office confirmed that ""ICE enforcement and removal operations"" are ongoing in Canyon County, but the sheriff's office is not involved in or assisting with these activities in any capacity.

Caldwell's police chief Rex Ingram says they are aware of ICE enforcement and traffic stops within Canyon County and Southwest Idaho. The chief's full statement is below:

“The Caldwell Police Department would like to address recent media reports concerning ICE enforcement and traffic stops within Canyon County and Southwest Idaho. We want to clarify that the Caldwell Police Department has not engaged in any traffic stops or detentions related to ICE activities and does not plan to do so in the future. Our department does not enforce federal immigration laws.

""We highly value our relationship with the Latino community and maintain open lines of communication with our community stakeholders. We recognize that this period may bring uncertainty and concern among residents. Therefore, we want to reassure everyone that the Caldwell Police Department will not engage in traffic stops that inquire about immigration status.

""The safety and trust of our community members are our top priorities. We are committed to serving and protecting all residents without prejudice.”

KTVB also contacted the Department of Homeland Security and Idaho State Police for comment, but has yet to hear back as of publication time.

The question remains whether ICE agents can carry out random traffic stops. Advocacy groups claim that ICE can perform such stops and sometimes identify themselves as ""police,"" even when they are not. Residents can always inquire whether an officer is local law enforcement or immigration authorities.",https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/3c2fea58-721c-434a-9359-c4030830879c/20251205T013020/3c2fea58-721c-434a-9359-c4030830879c_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 04:56:40.703335

Silent public witness at Atlanta ICE field office

What we know:

The American Friends Service Committee and Atlanta Friends will gather at 2 p.m. Saturday outside the Atlanta ICE field office for one hour of what they describe as silent public witness. The group says the event is part of a coordinated nationwide response to recent federal actions in multiple communities.

Prayer service to ‘bear silent public witness to the injustice’

What they're saying:

Jacob Flowers, regional director for the American Friends Service Committee, said his organization has been committed to human rights for more than a century.

""The American Friends Service Committee is a global organization committed to human rights. We’ve been working since 1917,"" Flowers said.

He told FOX 5 the rallies are meant to push back on federal immigration raids and show support for immigrant families.

""What we see going on in our community with immigrants is unacceptable,"" Flowers said.

""On Saturday, we’re coming out to the localized field office to bear silent public witness to the injustice that we see going on with our immigrant neighbors, brothers, sisters, co workers because of the actions of the Trump Administration,"" he said.

Flowers added that the group chose the ICE office in Atlanta because of the ongoing enforcement actions taking place across the nation.

""We want to be able to go there to pray silently, pray that this ends and really show love is an action towards hate,"" Flowers said.

He said similar events will be held in several major cities.

""We’ll be in solidarity here in Atlanta with other public worships happening in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and even in the Midwest in Des Moines, Iowa. All of those places, for one hour on Saturday, coming together in silent worship to say what we see happening to our immigrant neighbors, is wrong,"" Flowers said.

‘ICE is doing a public safety mission’

The other side:

Federal officials have defended their recent operations. In a separate interview, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said agents are focused on public safety.

""ICE is doing a public safety mission, and these are the people that people should want out of their neighborhoods,"" Lyons said.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed that position.

""So, these operations are based on where we have a criminal element to our illegal alien population that's in the country and what we can do to get them off of our streets and protect our children and people,"" Noem said.

""After a thorough investigation from Norfolk PD and the Navy, we now know this entire story was fabricated,"" Graves said in a Facebook post. ""The sailor was never stopped by Norfolk Police. There was no traffic stop of any kind. The accusation is 100% false.""

According to the sailor's account in the video, the service member was stopped for window tint and an ICE agent on scene detained the sailor for an hour. The sailor claims his service member showed a military ID but was told it wasn't acceptable and that he needed a passport instead.

The video gained additional attention when it was shared Wednesday morning by Virginia Del. Jackie Hope Glass on social media.

The Norfolk Police Department told WTKR News 3 Wednesday it does not ride along with ICE agents.

“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.” This article first appeared on Wisconsin Watch and is republished here under a Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License.","The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging five Wisconsin sheriffs’ practices of holding detainees in their jail for handoffs to ICE.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera. It names sheriff’s offices in Brown, Kenosha, Marathon, Sauk and Walworth counties as respondents.

All five sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers — nonbinding requests that a law enforcement agency assist ICE in taking custody of a person suspected of being in the country illegally by holding an inmate in a jail up to 48 hours past the person’s scheduled release. The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.

The lawsuit argues that the detainers qualify as an arrest and that state statutes prohibit law enforcement agencies from making arrests based on ICE’s administrative warrants.

While most Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers, the lawsuit claims that five named offices received roughly a quarter of all detainers issued to Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices between January and July of this year.

The sheriff’s offices have differing relationships with ICE. Brown and Sauk counties, for instance, also contract with ICE to hold immigrant detainees in their jails, meaning a person could remain in the same jail after entering ICE custody. Kenosha County has no such contract, but it does participate in a federal grant program that partially reimburses local law enforcement agencies for incarceration costs in exchange for data on undocumented inmates.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July of this year. Nearly 40% of those arrested were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case.

In its initial petition, Voces de la Frontera urged the Supreme Court to immediately take up the case as a statewide concern. The court’s order, published on Wednesday afternoon, allows the plaintiffs to skip the lower courts entirely.

Liberal justices have a 4-3 majority on the court. At least four unnamed justices voted to immediately accept the case. Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley, both conservatives, dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who often votes with conservatives, discussed the process in an opinion that did not specify his vote.

“When this court grants review in a case, we almost always let our grant order proceed without comment or dissent,” he wrote, later adding: “Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference.”

Voces de la Frontera has 30 days to file a brief in the case. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the case.

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.

“We are reviewing the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order and evaluating our next steps in this litigation,” Milwaukee attorney Sam Hall, who is representing all five sheriffs, wrote in an email Wednesday evening. “We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.”

During the hearing later Thursday, Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Hedges repeated the warning that Operation Midway Blitz is not over.","A Justice Department lawyer warned Thursday that it’s “wrong” to assume the deportation campaign that hit Chicago this fall is over, even though U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and others have left town for other cities.

With a judge poised to dismiss the high-profile lawsuit that’s been used to challenge the feds’ aggressive actions during “Operation Midway Blitz,” that lawyer also tried to argue the dismissal would foreclose future court claims if the campaign were to ramp up again.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis told her she was wrong.

The back-and-forth came in the first hearing in Ellis’ courtroom since lawyers who brought the lawsuit moved to dismiss it. They did so Tuesday after a 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel signaled its disagreement with a preliminary injunction Ellis handed down last month.

That injunction put restrictions on the feds’ use of tear gas and chokeholds, among other mandates. The appeals panel — made up of Judges Michael Brennan, Frank Easterbrook and Michael Scudder — called it “overbroad” and has blocked it since Nov. 19.

If the appeals panel were to rule more conclusively on the merits of the injunction, that could tie the hands of Ellis or other lower-court judges in the future.

Ellis made no formal rulings Thursday, but she set a hearing on dismissal of the lawsuit for Jan. 8.

The case was brought by protesters, clergy and media organizations including the Chicago Headline Club, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Newspaper Guild, which represents journalists at the Chicago Sun-Times.

The Sun-Times reported last month that, even though Bovino was leaving town, a Homeland Security source said 100 agents would be left behind to continue the campaign. The source also said 1,000 agents could return in March.

In a three-page filing ahead of the hearing in Ellis’ courtroom Thursday, Justice Department lawyers accused the plaintiffs of “seeking to throw in the towel” in a move that amounts to “transparent procedural gamesmanship.”

“This gambit should be seen for what it is,” they wrote.

They went on to say the plaintiffs were “wrong to allege that Operation Midway Blitz has ended.” And they insisted that dismissal of the lawsuit “with prejudice” — as sought by the plaintiffs — would mean “no named plaintiff or member of the certified class will be permitted to bring substantially similar claims in the future.”

The “certified class” includes anyone who “will in the future non-violently demonstrate, protest, observe, document, or record at Department of Homeland Security immigration enforcement and removal operations in the Northern District of Illinois.” Sub-classes include people who will engage in religious expression there or who will gather and report the news there.

During the hearing later Thursday, Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Hedges repeated the warning that Operation Midway Blitz is not over. That prompted Ellis to press for details.

“Are you saying that Operation Midway Blitz, in the manner that it was operating in September and October and early November of this year, is that going to happen again?” Ellis asked “Or are you saying it’s not going to happen again?”

Hedges insisted that Homeland Security will continue “its lawful enforcement operations in Chicago to the extent necessary.” She added, “I’m not prepared to stand here and give positions on where an agent might be at any given time.”

Hedges also repeated the other claim from the feds’ filing, that a dismissal with prejudice would preclude future claims by anyone covered by the certified class.

Ellis disagreed.

“I think, with respect Ms. Hedges, that you are not correct on the law,” the judge told her, “and that the preclusive effect that you would hope to achieve with a dismissal with prejudice is not what you think it is.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d25bf29/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2494x1424+0+120/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F6b%2F87fe3e9d4e06b36fa5d25b17ee38%2Fbovinohearing-102925-07.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 23:56:17.962352

Minneapolis city employees, including police officers, are legally prohibited from assisting in civic immigration enforcement activities under the city’s separation ordinance.
“Minneapolis is – and will remain – a city that stands up for our residents,” Frey said in a statement about the order.
Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city council member, sent out a note to his mailing list about “increased enforcement actions” in south Minneapolis, adding that there were “reports of residents being followed while driving, stopped and taken away”.
Jamal Osman, a Minneapolis city council member who is Somali, told CNN that Trump’s attacks on the Somali community and ICE activities remind him of “1930s, 1940s Germany”.","As Donald Trump went on another extended racist tirade against Somalis on Wednesday, Minneapolis activists prepared for more targeting of the community by conducting trainings on their rights and planning how they would protect their neighbors.

In the White House on Wednesday, a reporter asked the president about Minneapolis’s mayor, Jacob Frey, who has defended the Somali community. Trump responded: “I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somalian – look at their nation. Look how bad their nation is. It’s not even a nation. It’s just people walking around killing each other. Look, these Somalians have taken billions of dollars out of our country. Billions and billions.”

He again mentioned Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who is Somali and a US citizen, saying she shouldn’t be allowed to serve in Congress and “should be thrown the hell out of our country”. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, he said, was “crooked” and “incompetent”.

“Those Somalians should be out of here. They’ve destroyed our country. And all they do is complain, complain, complain,” he said. “You have her – she’s always talking about ‘the constitution provides me with uhhhh’. Go back to your own country and figure out your constitution. All she does is complain about this country and without this country she would not be in very good shape. She probably wouldn’t be alive right now. Somalia is considered by many to be the worst country on Earth. I don’t know. I haven’t been there, I won’t be there anytime soon, I hope.”

Earlier this week, he called Somalis “garbage” and said he didn’t want any of them to be in the US.

The Trump administration plans to send more federal agents into Minneapolis with the mandate to go after Somalis, particularly those with final orders of deportation, though the specifics of the surge are not yet known. Minneapolis city employees, including police officers, are legally prohibited from assisting in civic immigration enforcement activities under the city’s separation ordinance. Progressive city council members have called for strengthening the ordinance.

The city of Minneapolis said on its social media account that the city was “proud to stand behind our Somali community” and noted that there were free legal clinics with immigration attorneys available locally.

Frey issued an executive order on Wednesday night that prohibits federal, state and local agencies from using city-owned parking lots, ramps, garages or vacant lots to stage immigration enforcement operations, a similar order to one issued in Chicago as that city confronted increased ICE activity. He also directed the city to design a signage template that local businesses will be able to use to make clear that agents are not allowed on their properties.

“Minneapolis is – and will remain – a city that stands up for our residents,” Frey said in a statement about the order.

The right wing has seized on fraud cases, spanning multiple years, that involve dozens of Somali residents, more than 50 of whom have been convicted for their role in a wide-ranging fraud scheme that involved lying to the state to receive reimbursements for meal disbursements, medical care, housing and autism services. Rightwing media highlighted the fraud in recent weeks, catching the attention of the White House. The Trump administration previously threatened to revoke temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, citing the state as a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

Minnesota is home to the country’s largest Somali population, who have settled in the state over the last three decades. About 84,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota, and most Somalis in the state are US citizens or legal residents.

In the days since Trump first attacked Somalis, the local community has worked quickly to respond, honing their knowledge of legal rights and planning how they could look out for Somali residents.

Activists from Chicago held a training for Minnesota community members who wanted to know how to participate in “ICE watch”, sharing what they learned in their city about effective tactics and information sharing.

Neighbors called for volunteers to stand watch outside schools that have large populations of Somali students at the start and end of days.

County Republican party accounts, on the other hand, shared an “ICE tip line” phone number with the comment: “Turn them in! Send them home!”

The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota’s executive director, Jennifer Stohl Powell, said in a statement that the center stands with the Somali community, “who are being unfairly vilified by the administration and targeted by current ICE enforcement actions”.

“The majority of Somalis in Minnesota entered as refugees, and many are now US citizens,” Stohl Powell said. “We urge all non-citizens to know their immigration status and carry proof of that status. Non-citizens have rights, including the right to remain silent, the right not to sign anything without speaking with an attorney, and the right not to open the door unless officers present a judicial warrant with the correct name and address.”

Small businesses showed their support for Somalis. Some began handing out whistles, borrowing a tactic from Chicago, where people use whistles to notify others when ICE is around.

Jason Chavez, a Minneapolis city council member, sent out a note to his mailing list about “increased enforcement actions” in south Minneapolis, adding that there were “reports of residents being followed while driving, stopped and taken away”. He directed people to call in reports of federal activity to a rapid response hotline called Monarca.

The local Immigrant Defense Network said on Wednesday that it had received multiple reports of “rapid ICE operations” across the city, with action moving quickly. “By the time observers arrive, ICE has often left the scene,” the network wrote on Facebook.

Jamal Osman, a Minneapolis city council member who is Somali, told CNN that Trump’s attacks on the Somali community and ICE activities remind him of “1930s, 1940s Germany”.

“I never thought there would be a time where I will tell my community to carry their passport around because if you look Somali you might be stopped by ICE,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f69f52972bd85dee41eb1f549338059653d45301/469_0_2916_2333/master/2916.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=963293f1c152051104a37a6b5a0873ff",N,,2025-12-04 22:56:57.477682

The essential problem is that trafficking illegal drugs, while a serious crime, is different from an armed attack.
Against that backdrop, a broad range of experts in the laws governing the use of lethal force have called the administration’s armed conflict theory nonsensical.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth, they argue, have been giving illegal orders to the troops under their command to commit crimes.
And its premise reinforces the idea that the situation should be thought about through the lens of an armed conflict.","As Congress parses the details of a follow-on strike that killed shipwrecked survivors of President Trump’s first boat attack on Sept. 2, a much larger issue risks getting lost: whether Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have caused the military to commit crimes in a score of attacks.

Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who commanded the Sept. 2 operation, on Thursday showed lawmakers a video of the attack. The briefing was part of a congressional effort to understand his decision to order a second strike and determine whether the survivors of the first one remained “in the fight” or were technically shipwrecked, making it a war crime to kill them.

There have been shifting narratives emerging from the Pentagon, each resetting the analysis. But all of the scenarios consist of analogizing the actions of suspected drug runners to traditional combat activities. The comparisons are strained at best, legal experts say, because the laws of war were not written for and do not fit a drug smuggling situation.

“Debate over when a shipwrecked crew member loses protection from attack misses the point,” said Geoffrey S. Corn, who was formerly the Army’s senior adviser for law-of-war issues. “The real problem here is the dubious and legally overbroad assertion that the United States is justified in using wartime authority against a criminal problem.”

As a matter of plain reality, an unarmed speedboat, even if it is carrying cocaine, is not a warship. And none of the 11 people aboard — not merely the two initial survivors, but also the nine people the U.S. military killed in its first strike — were fighting anyone.

The Sept. 2 boat attack was the first in Mr. Trump’s policy of directing the military to summarily kill people who are suspected of smuggling drugs at sea as if they are enemy soldiers on a battlefield. The military has gone on to attack 21 more such boats, killing 87 people in all, according to the administration.

The conversation about whether that campaign amounts to murder has largely taken place among experts in laws governing the use of armed force.

The United States has long handled the problem of maritime drug smuggling by using the Coast Guard to intercept boats and to arrest people. That echoes how it works on land: Police officers who believe people are dealing drugs arrest them, and if they are convicted, they serve time in prison. They are not executed.

It would be a crime if officers instead simply gunned down suspected drug dealers in the street. Similarly, a military force is not allowed to target civilians, and being a suspected criminal does not make someone lose civilian status. In peacetime, targeting a civilian is murder. In an armed conflict, targeting a civilian is a war crime.

To justify the killings, Mr. Trump has declared that the United States is in a formal armed conflict against drug cartels, and that smuggling boat crews are “combatants” — all because he has “determined” so.

While Congress has not authorized an armed conflict, a memo by the president’s appointees at the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel accepts his claim that there is one. Based on that premise, it says the drugs suspected of being aboard the boats are lawful military targets because cartels could use the profits to finance their purported war efforts, according to people who have seen the memo.

It is difficult to find people knowledgeable about the relevant body of law and not working for Mr. Trump who think the United States is really in an armed conflict. The essential problem is that trafficking illegal drugs, while a serious crime, is different from an armed attack.

And to the extent the administration has tried to offer substantive justifications for Mr. Trump’s purported determination, they appear to collapse under scrutiny.

The White House has highlighted the deaths of tens of thousands of American drug users a year from overdoses. But even if those deaths somehow amounted to an armed attack, the surge in overdoses over the past decade was mostly caused by fentanyl that comes from labs in Mexico, which use Chinese chemicals . The dramatic increase has not been fueled by cocaine that comes on boats from South America.

The Trump administration has also suggested that it can used armed force against suspected drug runners as a matter of the collective self-defense of other countries whose security forces sometimes clash with well-armed cartel goons, such as Colombia and Mexico. But the presidents of both of those countries have condemned the boat attacks.

Against that backdrop, a broad range of experts in the laws governing the use of lethal force have called the administration’s armed conflict theory nonsensical. Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth, they argue, have been giving illegal orders to the troops under their command to commit crimes.

With the notable exception of Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, most lawmakers who have been arguing that the boat attacks are murders have been Democrats, who do not control Congress.

Until recently, however, most of Mr. Trump’s fellow Republicans have shied away from exercising oversight. A Nov. 28 Washington Post article that renewed attention to the Sept. 2 attack — focused on the follow-up strike — has made some Republicans in Congress willing to ask harder questions.

The focus on the second strike and the nuances of the law of armed conflict could end up being a favor to the Trump administration. The idea that something was bad about that particular strike implicitly suggests the first one on that boat — and all the others attacks on other boats — were fine. And its premise reinforces the idea that the situation should be thought about through the lens of an armed conflict.

The larger question now is whether the belated bipartisan interest in that particular strike will generate momentum for a broader look at the entire killing spree that Mr. Trump and Mr. Hegseth have led the U.S. military to perform, said Rebecca Ingber, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law and a former State Department expert in the law of war.

“There is a risk that the focus on the second strike and specifically the talk of ‘war crimes’ feeds into the administration’s false wartime framing and veils the fact that the entire boat-strikes campaign is murder, full stop,” she said.

She added: “The administration’s evolving justification for the second strike only lays bare the absurdity of their legal claims for the campaign as a whole — that transporting drugs is somehow the equivalent of wartime hostilities.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/04/multimedia/04dc-boat-qbpj/04dc-boat-qbpj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 22:57:01.150684

These signs, whether small and subtle or vivid and public, indicate that the political winds are shifting. Just a few examples include:

Veterans and military families from Ohio and other parts of the country roundly criticizing National Guard deployments in large, Democratic-majority cities as unnecessary and harmful to national security.

Businesses denouncing abusive immigration enforcement policies for harming the bottom line.

Disney shareholders criticizing the company’s politically motivated suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! as constituting a potential breach of fiduciary duty that was harming stakeholders’ financial interests.

Cattle ranchers across regions expressing disapproval of the administration’s plan to import Argentine beef as a betrayal of campaign promises.

Airport officials refusing to show a politicized Department of Homeland Security video.

An influential GOP fundraiser abandoning the party over what he says is its “increasingly corrupt and authoritarian” trajectory, and other Republicans distancing themselves from the administration following the party’s poor performance in November’s election.

JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon announcing that the company would not contribute to the White House’s ballroom construction, citing the potential risks of “doing anything that looks like buying favors.”

A few congressional Republicans criticizing a recent U.S.-Russia peace proposal for the war in Ukraine that heavily favored Russia, and some beginning to express concern over U.S. military strikes on boats off Venezuela’s coast, suggesting, as many experts have determined, that they may be illegal.

Public opinion polling showing increasing disapproval of actions by President Donald Trump and his administration not only over rising costs for ordinary Americans but also over the use – and abuse – of executive authority.

These signals of discontent and many more acts of noncooperation, particularly involving members of the Trump-aligned Make America Great (MAGA) movement, indicate cracks in the administration’s power base. The shifts show that a broad swath of people view their rights, liberties, and economic interests as being compromised. Their actions are significant at a time when many members of Congress, the Supreme Court, and loyalists installed in the federal bureaucracy are unwilling or unable to resist attacks on democratic governance, and when a range of former U.S. intelligence officials have warned of accelerating authoritarian dynamics in the country.

Stopping democratic backsliding in the United States will require not only sustained action from large numbers of people. It will also require an “economy of effort,” by which individuals draw on their specific skills, resources, and dispositions to both engage with and pressure the sources of support for authoritarian directions.

Expanding Resistance

Mass protests have widened across the country, including deep inside GOP stronghold areas. The Crowd Counting Consortium reported more than 2,150 protests across all 50 states, with between 2 million and 4.8 million participants in June 2025. The “No Kings” protests in October, possibly the largest single-day demonstration in U.S. history, occurred in 2,700 locations with an estimated 5 million to 7 million participants, including in deeply red areas.

Traditional institutional mechanisms such as voting, litigation, and advocacy remain important for countering abuses of power. However, because multiple political institutions have been compromised, broad-based civil resistance can serve as one of the most effective defenses against the intentional tearing down of democratic norms and systems. Civil resistance works in part because it draws in more diverse and larger numbers of participants into a nonviolent struggle against authoritarianism, including those whose support is crucial for autocratic regimes to maintain and consolidate their power.

A central mechanism linking civil resistance to success involves defections by key “pillars of support.” Governments depend upon the strength, resources, and legitimacy provided by an array of social, political, and economic groups and institutions. Security forces carry out orders, bureaucrats administer policies, businesses provide campaign contributions and market signals, media outlets shape public opinion, religious leaders provide spiritual legitimacy, local civic leaders and organizations confer credibility, and so on. Some especially significant pillars of the Trump administration include officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CPB); anti-immigration media; select Evangelical churches and Christian organizations; businesses like Amazon, Palantir, and the GEO Group; and donor networks and far-right political action committees.

Small loyalty shifts within the pillars of support — which are made up of individuals with a range of interests and identities — can bring about large changes. Among elements of the security and bureaucracy pillars, for example, even slight changes in their perception of the government’s ability to pay public-sector salaries can motivate decisive shifts.

Engaging Strategically for Democracy

Sustained, efficient, and strategic efforts will be critical to stopping authoritarian encroachment and to providing on-ramps for people to be a part of a movement that embraces fairness and a level playing field. There is no one-size-fits-all formula for effective individual and collective action — much will depend upon one’s position in and relationships with the various pillars of support. The Horizons Project, where we work, and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University recently published a report (authored by one of us, Adam) that discusses five questions that can help orient pro-democratic actors within key pillars.

Some will most effectively defend their freedoms by speaking out, especially those in positions of power and visibility, such as politicians, media personalities, faith leaders, and business leaders. Others will be most effective by engaging in public action to stem the tide of executive overreach — for example campaigning for pro-democracy Republicans in primaries or participating in No Kings demonstrations. Still others will maximize their efforts by standing in the way and refusing to comply with coercive pressure. Think of businesses barring ICE agents from their establishments or police officers refusing to carry out politically motivated arrests.

Apart from strategic questions about speech, action, and noncooperation, there is a separate question regarding whether to act within — or outside of — groups or institutions of which one is a part. It can also be conceptualized as “binding” within versus “breaking” from an organization. Breaking tactics can include refusing to work in jobs that further coercive agendas. For example, Social Security Administration employees resigned rather than complying with DOGE requests for access to sensitive government records. When Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called on the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco, a wave of criticism followed, including from Salesforce staff and alumni, along with Ron Conway, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who resigned from the board of Salesforce’s philanthropic arm in protest. Benioff later apologized and retracted his statement.

Binding can involve persuading one’s colleagues (or fellow congregationists or union members) behind closed doors to withdraw their support from leaders who abuse their constitutional power. For example, Ohio National Guard members recently have been communicating with each other through encrypted group chats, discussing their concerns about — and even unwillingness to participate in — politicized deployments. Binding tends to be less visible than breaking, but it is no less important. These tactics complement each other well: Insiders can quietly organize colleagues, gather information on the government’s abuses, and strategize about incentives and potential wedges within specific pillars. Meanwhile, outsiders can draw public attention and escalate pressure.

Building Broad Alliances

The larger and more representative a pro-democracy movement, the greater its chances of encouraging shifts in loyalty among key pillars of support to autocratic actions and regimes. Growth will be facilitated by the building of “unlikely allies,” who may disagree strongly about policy goals but agree on the need to preserve representative, accountable government. Even conservative-leaning constituencies in deep blue Los Angeles County, such as the Chamber of Commerce, the Farm Bureau, the Sheriff’s Office, veterans organizations, and faith groups, broke with the Trump administration over ICE raids and National Guard deployments. Their actions have included police protecting protesters, Chamber of Commerce statements condemning ICE activity and affirming the role of immigrants in LA’s economy, farmworker labor strikes, lawsuits against ICE raids at houses of worship, and an alliance between the LA Archdiocese and local businesses to provide critical services to immigrant families.

Unlikely alliances are possible in part because pillars are not monolithic. Dialogue and engagement with specific elements of pillars can increase the likelihood of defections. This was a key strategy of the Otpor movement in Serbia, which actively fraternized with state security forces as part of a broad-based movement to remove autocrat Slobodan Milosevic from power. The incentives for pillars to cooperate – or not — with anti-democratic forces can also shift as a result of sustained pressure, as evidenced by Disney’s decision to put Jimmy Kimmel Live! back on the air following a targeted consumer boycott and mobilization by fandoms, entertainers, and shareholders.

Facilitating Loyalty Shifts and Inclusion

Although there are challenges to shifting loyalties away from authoritarianism, ranging from retaliation from an administration to threats and harassment, there is plenty of evidence that defections need not be ruinous. The climate is shifting and there is strength in numbers. As the movement to protect constitutional government grows, so too will the incentives for acting courageously.

This highlights the importance of welcoming defectors without shaming them about their previous allegiances or asking them to give up their conservatism. Those considering withdrawing their support from authoritarian leaders and movements may find encouragement in knowing that they will be joining a movement grounded in widely shared values: freedom, self-rule, and constitutional government. And from a standpoint of pure self-interest, permitting the erosion of rights today sets a dangerous precedent that future leaders of any party can exploit, putting all at risk of retaliation.

While encouraging principled action is important, showing people that an alternative pathway is viable, and supporting them morally and materially along their journey, is perhaps even more important. People need to feel like they are joining a movement ready to provide support and celebrate them, notwithstanding political and ideological differences. Faith leaders, businesspeople, and conservative workers and professionals need to know that there will be spiritual, social, and financial backing to help them weather storms when they shift support away from a corrupt and abusive regime. They should believe they are contributing to a bigger project and will thrive in a world without authoritarian governance. This type of solidarity action and big-tent organizing is gaining strength, and is the way to normalize pro-democratic behavior.

While ideological and policy disagreement will be inevitable within the big tent, lowering the barriers to entry and welcoming in those who are newly ready to take action is the way to hand power back to “we the people.”",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-22416024821.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 23:56:20.561178

Liz Landers:

His deportation agenda was supercharged when the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July. It included almost $75 billion extra for ICE, making it the highest funded law enforcement agency in the U.S. government, outstripping the FBI.

And the agency announced a lofty recruitment goal of hiring 10,000 new agents by the end of the year, which would more than double the number of deportation officers from roughly 6,000 to 16,000.

John Sandweg, Former Acting ICE Director:

Joseph Cox is an investigative journalist at 404 Media and has reported on ICE's recruitment strategy. He says the agency aims to target two main groups, people with military and law enforcement experience and Gen Z.

Joseph Cox:

They're really trying to do essentially everything they can to target and find these people.

Liz Landers:

ICE has spent millions on broadcast ads aimed at police officers frustrated with their city's enforcement of immigration law.

Narrator:

You took an oath to protect and serve, but in too many cities, dangerous illegals walk free as police are forced to stand down.

Liz Landers:

And on social media, the Department of Homeland Security has launched a campaign it describes as aggressive. It's posted a meme referencing the video game Halo to its official X account with the slogan — quote — ""Destroy the Flood.""

Joseph Cox:

That's very dehumanizing language. The Flood is an insect parasite enemy in the video game. And you go through the replies and there are people who find it absolutely abhorrent and disgusting.

Liz Landers:

It's also shared images using wartime imagery, like Uncle Sam, and slang, like in this post with the caption — quote — ""Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys.""

But some critics worry this will draw recruits with the wrong motivation.

Wendy Via, Global Project Against Hate and Extremism: They're normalizing extremism, but also warping what it means to be a person who protects your country.

Liz Landers:

Wendy Via co-founded the Center for Global Hate and Extremism. She's tracked the campaign, including posts shared by far right groups like the Proud Boys.

Wendy Via:

The recruitment for the new staff is very much saying, come with us and we're going to make America different than what it is. They present it as a violent but white place.

Liz Landers:

When asked about their social media recruitment posts, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said — quote — ""These are the type of smears that vilify our brave ICE law enforcement and are leading to 100 percent increase in assaults against them. ICE only recruits patriotic professionals who have the integrity and moral compass to perform such critical roles in keeping America safe.""

While the agency emphasizes its mission to protect public safety and national security to potential recruits, a recent New York Times analysis found the majority of immigrants arrested and detained by ICE do not have U.S. criminal records and roughly 8 percent have been convicted of a violent crime.

Chad Wolf, Former Acting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security: When you talk about millions of individuals on a final order of removal here in the United States that all should be deported or removed, but yet you don't have the officers to go out there and to target them and apprehend them and remove them, you need to beef up their resources.

Liz Landers:

Chad Wolf, who led the Department of Homeland Security AS acting secretary during the first Trump administration, says the agency's recruitment tactics are not a main concern.

Chad Wolf:

Once you get those recruits, right, into the pipeline, and you start vetting them, you start talking to them, you start interviewing them, that's where the rubber meets the road, right? That's when you're really going to determine whether or not that person is suitable for that type of job, based on their background, based on their temperament, based on a variety of different factors.

Liz Landers:

But the agency has reportedly rushed new recruits into its training program before being properly vetted, leading some trainees to drop out due to failing background checks, academic requirements or fitness standards.

John Sandweg:

Yes, I mean, some of these moves, frankly, have resulted in some embarrassing candidates. ICE agents have tremendous authority when they're out there on the streets. We have to know that these people, A, have that integrity, are going to — when no one's looking, are they going to do things the right way?

And, secondly, they're getting into this for the right reason. Obviously, there's a tremendous concern as well that the administration is going after individuals who harbor some animus towards immigrants.

Liz Landers:

Assistant Secretary McLaughlin defended the agency's vetting process, saying — quote — ""Any individual who desires to join ICE will undergo intense background investigations and security clearances, no exception.""

Man:

From Texas to California, Border Patrol agents are being hired at a breakneck speed.

Liz Landers:

Former ICE Director John Sandweg sees parallels with the scramble to expand Border Patrol under President George W. Bush.

John Sandweg:

When we rushed to hire Border Patrol agents, we ended up getting individuals who just weren't well suited for some of the stressful encounters you have as a law enforcement agent. They resorted to force too quickly. They resorted to force that was unreasonable.

Liz Landers:

After loosening its hiring standards and training standards, arrests of CBP officers for misconduct increased, including for high-profile corruption cases involving agents working with cartels to smuggle drugs across the border.

Do you have concerns that this explosive growth in ICE could lead to some of those same problems that we have seen in the past?

Chad Wolf:

I understand the concern. I think that is a challenge, but it is doable. It's not — I mean, we're the United States. I think we can figure out how to hire thousands of individuals and give them the right training and put them out on the streets to do a job.

Liz Landers:

So far, the administration says its recruitment campaign is working, recently announcing that it will finish hiring 10,000 agents within days, an effort that is reshaping the face of law enforcement on America's streets.

WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Catherine Cortez Masto, and 19 of their Senate Democratic colleagues introduced the Upholding Protections for Unaccompanied Children Act to reverse the provisions in Trump’s Big Bad Betrayal Act that cruelly punish children seeking safety from trafficking, abuse, and exploitation in their home countries.

“MAGA Republicans created new fees and recurring charges for unaccompanied children fleeing violence as their cases are stuck being processed,” said Hickenlooper. “It’s a betrayal to our original promise of justice and freedom. We’re working to stop it.”

“All too often, our immigration system fails to protect unaccompanied migrant children seeking asylum,” said Bennet. “This legislation will protect unaccompanied children fleeing violence by reversing cruel provisions in Republicans’ Big Beautiful Bill. I won’t stop pushing the Trump Administration to ensure that these children are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.”

“As members of Congress, it’s our duty to stand up for those who can’t stand up for themselves,” said Cortez Masto. “That includes the unaccompanied children who come to the United States after escaping trafficking and abuse. It’s essential that we reverse the Republican tax law’s cruel provisions and protect these kids.”

This summer, Trump and congressional Republicans jammed through their Big Bad Betrayal Act which cuts $1 trillion from Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act to pay for his huge tax cuts for the richest Americans and largest corporations.

Their reckless bill also imposed a new $5,000 Border Apprehension Fee on any child who arrives to the U.S. between ports of entry while also requiring children to pay a mandatory asylum application fee and new annual asylum maintenance fees for every year their case remains pending in the government’s yearslong backlog. For children fleeing human trafficking and extreme violence, these fees are often impossible to pay.

Republicans’ Big Bad Betrayal Act also provides funding for intrusive body examinations of minors who are often the victims of abuse and trafficking and provides funding for deporting unaccompanied children who have not been screened for signs of trafficking or allowed a full review of their case before an immigration judge.

To reverse these provisions and protect unaccompanied children, the Upholding Protections for Unaccompanied Children Act would:

Exempt unaccompanied children from the following fees:

Asylum fee, employment authorization document fee, annual asylum fee, employment authorization renewal fees, and others

Repeals the Special Immigrant Juvenile Status fee.

Repeals provision that funds summary returns of “specified” unaccompanied children.

Repeals funding in the reconciliation bill for body examinations of children in Customs and Border Protection or Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody.

Prohibits ORR from sharing sponsor information with DHS or any other federal agency for the purpose of immigration enforcement.

Refund of fees that have been paid under any of the provisions that have been repealed or amended under this bill.

Hickenlooper has consistently pushed back on the Trump administration’s reckless efforts to undermine due process, slow the already backlogged immigration system, and obstruct congressional oversight of ICE detention facilities. This week, he launched an inquiry into the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) obstruction of congressional oversight of ICE facilities. He also recently urged DHS Secretary Noem to release a Durango father and two children from ICE custody after they reported being physically abused while in ICE detention. Despite having active asylum claims and no criminal record, DHS refused to release them.

In August, Hickenlooper visited the ICE detention center in Aurora to perform routine oversight and push for more transparency from ICE. During the visit, he raised concerns with ICE officials regarding delayed communication with congressional offices, irregular process changes, reports of ICE pressuring detainees to voluntarily depart instead of proceeding through a judicial process, and facility conditions. ICE failed to give satisfactory answers.

This spring, Hickenlooper helped introduce the Fair Day in Court for Kids Act of 2025 to guarantee unaccompanied children get legal counsel, after the Trump administration cut off funding for required services under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act and began fast-tracking kids into immigration proceedings.

Hickenlooper cosponsors the Immigration Enforcement Identification Act to increase transparency, accountability, and safety in immigration law enforcement. This bill prohibits law enforcement officers from obscuring their faces and requires that they clearly display their agency, name, and a unique identifier while conducting immigration enforcement functions.

In July, Hickenlooper joined 22 of his Senate colleagues to call out the Trump administration’s recent efforts to arrest noncriminal immigrants at their immigration court hearings and deport them without adequate due process. In April, Hickenlooper joined 65 other members of Congress to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to address the impact of the Executive Office for Immigration Review’s (EOIR) alarming decision to fire key judges as the immigration system faces a staggering backlog of cases.

The federal government will now require some migrants to renew their work permits every 18 months instead of every five years, according to a statement from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Thursday. The agency said the change would help it screen and vet migrants more often, allowing it to identify people with “potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal.”

The change applies to refugees, asylum seekers and people granted asylum, among others who qualify to work in the United States. It affects migrants who have pending applications or who file applications on or after Dec. 5. As of June, about 434,000 asylum seekers and about 24,000 people granted asylum had pending applications for work permits, according to the latest government data. More than 12,000 refugees also had pending applications.

“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in the statement. “After the attack on National Guard service members in our nation’s capital by an alien who was admitted into this country by the previous administration, it’s even more clear that U.S.C.I.S. must conduct frequent vetting of aliens.”

The five-year authorization itself had not been in place long. The Biden administration had expanded it from two years in 2023, saying the change was “in the interest of reducing the burden on both U.S.C.I.S. and the public.”

Some immigrant advocates said the move threatened to put migrants in limbo. Kennji Kizuka, the director of asylum policy at the International Rescue Committee, an organization that assists thousands of refugees and other migrants in the United States, said that migrants often tried to renew their work permits well before their expiration date, but that it could take several months to receive approval.

“That means that people are more and more likely to fall into periods where their work authorization has expired and they’re not able to get it renewed,” he said. “That makes life more impossible for asylum seekers to be able to support themselves and their families.”

The change is the latest in a blizzard of actions the administration has taken to curtail paths for immigrants to legally live and work in the United States since last week’s shooting, which left one of the Guard members dead. Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan man, was accused of the shooting and charged with first-degree murder. He has pleaded not guilty.

After the attack, Trump administration officials accused the Biden administration of failing to properly screen migrants from “high-risk countries.” But critics have questioned whether Mr. Trump is using an isolated killing to build on an already sprawling campaign against immigration that they say goes beyond his vow to target the “worst of the worst.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/04/multimedia/04trump-news-immig-work-permits1-bqfl/04trump-news-immig-work-permits1-bqfl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 21:56:41.862260

Krome detention centre plagued by overcrowding, medical neglect, and violent abuse

‘These findings confirm a deliberate system built to punish, dehumanise, and hide the suffering of people in detention’ - Ana Piquer

Amnesty International today released a new report exposing cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment at two immigration detention centres in Florida: the Everglades Detention Facility (“Alligator Alcatraz”) and the Krome North Service Processing Center.

The 61-page report - Torture and enforced disappearances in the Sunshine State: Human rights violations at “Alligator Alcatraz” and Krome in Florida - reveals human rights violations that, in some cases amount to torture, occurring at Krome and “Alligator Alcatraz” within an increasingly hostile anti-immigrant climate in Florida under Governor Ron DeSantis, whose administration has intensified criminalisation and mass detention of migrants and people seeking safety. Findings were gathered during a September 2025 research mission.

“Alligator Alcatraz”: a Florida State-run human rights disaster

The research concluded that people arbitrarily detained in “Alligator Alcatraz” are living in inhuman and unsanitary conditions including overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping, limited access to showers, exposure to insects without protective measures, lights on 24-hours-a-day, poor quality food and water, and lack of privacy – including cameras above the toilets.

People interviewed shared that access to medical care is inconsistent, inadequate, or denied all together, placing individuals at serious risk of physical and mental harm. People reported being always shackled when they were outside their cell. Other treatment which those detained have endured amounts to torture, including being put in “the box”, a 2x2 foot cage-like structure as punishment – sometimes for hours at a time, exposed to the elements with hardly any water – with their hands and feet attached to restraints on the ground.

“Alligator Alcatraz” operates outside federal oversight, without the basic registration or tracking systems used in ICE facilities constituting enforced disappearances when the whereabouts of a person being detained there is denied to their family, and they are not allowed to contact their lawyer.

Krome: overcrowded, chaotic, and dangerous

At ICE’s Krome Detention Center, operated by a private for-profit company, the research confirmed that despite having medical facilities on site, those detained reported serious medical negligence including failure to provide treatments and medical assessments. People detained at Krome confirmed previous reports of human rights violations. For example, there were reports of overcrowding, prolonged and arbitrary solitary confinement, lack of adequate medical care, overflowing toilets, lack of access to showers, constant illumination, and broken air conditioning.

People shared stories of violence and ill-treatment from guards. Amnesty staffers witnessed a guard violently slam a metal flap of a door to a solitary confinement room against a man’s injured hand. Other people reported being hit and punched by guards. People also reported difficulty in accessing counsel and not knowing how long they would be detained nor what would happen next.

“Everybody who’s in a detention facility is suffering”: immigration enforcement and detention in Florida

In February, Florida passed extreme and discriminatory immigration laws that are putting immigrant communities at grave risk. The expansion of 287(g) agreements that deputise local law enforcement to act as immigration officials and detain people for immigration purposes have led to wrongful arrests, racial profiling, and widespread fear that prevents families from accessing schools, hospitals, and other essential services.

Florida has become a testing ground for abusive immigration enforcement policies, closely aligned with the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant and racist agenda. Under Governor Ron DeSantis, the state has intensified the criminalisation of migration and relied on sweeping emergency powers to rapidly scale up mass detention. Since January 2005, Florida has increased the number of people in immigrant detention by more than 50 percent. Between June and August this year alone, the state issued 34 no-bid contracts totalling more than US$360 million for “Alligator Alcatraz”, with annual operating costs projected at US$450 million - all while cutting billions from essential health, food security, emergency response, and housing programmes.

Immigration detention in the United States has a long record of abuses. President Trump has increased its use by nearly 70% since his first term, while conditions in detention have sharply deteriorated. Of the at least 24 people who have died in ICE custody since October 2024, six deaths occurred in Florida facilities, including four at Krome.

Urgent Reforms Needed in Florida and Federal Immigration Detention

Amnesty is calling on both the government of Florida and the US government to address systemic human rights violations within immigration detention facilities. Amnesty urges Florida officials to close Alligator Alcatraz and to prohibit the use of any state-run immigration detention. The state must end the misuse of emergency powers, halt all no-bid procurement, and redirect detention funding towards essential health care, housing, and disaster-relief programmes. The recommendations also include banning shackling, solitary confinement, and punitive outdoor confinement; ensuring confidential access to legal counsel and interpretation services; conducting transparent and independent investigations into torture and medical neglect; and establishing meaningful, independent oversight for all detention facilities.

At the federal level, the US government must end its cruel mass immigration detention machine, stop the criminalisation of migration, and bar the use of state-owned facilities for federal immigration custody. The US government must ensure thorough investigations into all deaths, allegations of torture in custody and other abuses, and comply with international human rights standards. Also, the federal government must undertake a comprehensive review of ICE contracts with state and private actors to ensure human rights compliance, the restoration of protections for “sensitive locations” such as schools, hospitals, and churches, and increased federal funding to support universal legal representation and interpretation services in immigration proceedings.

Ana Piquer, Amnesty International’s Director for the Americas, said:

“These findings confirm a deliberate system built to punish, dehumanise, and hide the suffering of people in detention.

“Immigration enforcement cannot operate outside the rule of law or exempt itself from human rights standards. What we are seeing in Florida should alarm the entire region.

“These despicable and nauseating conditions at Alligator Alcatraz reflect a pattern of deliberate neglect designed to dehumanise and punish those detained there. Krome’s extreme overcrowding, medical neglect, and reports of humiliating and degrading treatment paint a picture of harrowing human right violations.

“The choice to prioritise punishment, dehumanisation and cruelty over public welfare is as shortsighted as it is appalling. The conditions we documented at Alligator Alcatraz and Krome are not isolated – instead they represent a deliberate system of cruelty designed to punish people seeking to build a new life in the US.

In the hearing, Durbin exposed the Trump Administration’s hypocrisy, underscoring that President Trump is slashing millions in funding for crime prevention efforts.","WASHINGTON – U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, met with Priests for Justice for Immigrants from the Chicago-area and members of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). During the meeting, they discussed the importance of supporting immigrants in the face of the Trump Administration’s cruel mass deportation scheme, including the so-called “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has been used as a mechanism by the President to sow fear in Illinois communities as Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) increased their aggressive immigration enforcement operations in the state. Durbin was joined by Father Gary Graf, Father Larry Dowling, and Father Brendan Curran.

“For more than three months, Chicago has endured President Trump’s ‘Operation Midway Blitz’ – a cruel campaign that has swept up innocent citizens, legal residents, and immigrants who pose absolutely no threat to public safety,” said Durbin. “These faith leaders have extended spiritual support to our communities, including by walking 800 miles to spread a message of humanity for immigrants and showing up to the ICE Broadview Processing Facility every day to offer their prayers. Today’s discussion with the Fathers reminded me that during these horrific times, we must come together and stand up for our immigrant communities.”

Photos of the meeting can be found here.

In response to the Trump Administration’s surge in federal law enforcement in Chicago and continuous threats to deploy the military in the area, Durbin has taken a number of steps to push back on these unlawful actions carried out by DHS and Secretary Noem under the direction of President Trump.

Durbin has taken the following actions to push back on the Trump Administration’s so-called “Operation Midway Blitz”:

Meeting with state, local, and community leaders. Durbin has been in regular contact with both Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson as the Trump Administration carries out “Operation Midway Blitz” without the consent or request of Illinois leaders. Durbin has also met with numerous local leaders and organizations, including: Little Village leaders; the American Immigration Lawyers Association; Brighton Park community leaders; the Resurrection Project; Elgin Mayor Dave Kaptain; Centro de Información; Alderman Mike Rodriguez of Chicago’s 22nd Ward; Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson; student organizers of the walkout at a Little Village school; and Latino state and local officials in Waukegan and Chicago.

Securing a commitment from Chairman Grassley for Secretary Noem to testify under oath. After Durbin repeatedly called for Secretary Noem to testify under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Grassley heeded Durbin’s call and agreed to schedule an oversight hearing with Noem.

Writing directly to the President to urge him to immediately call off his plans to deploy troops to Illinois. Shortly after the President made clear his intentions to deploy both the Illinois and Texas National Guard to the Chicago region, Durbin led all Democratic members of the Illinois delegation in sending a letter to President Trump to demand that he immediately reverse his decision.

Demanding DHS Secretary Noem end both “Operation Midway Blitz” and “Operation At Large”. Durbin led all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation in reprimanding DHS for violating due process, indiscriminately arresting immigrants with no criminal convictions, and escalating tensions at Broadview protests. In their letter, the lawmakers called out DHS leadership for its failure to communicate with Illinois’ elected leaders while carrying out excessive, brutal raids. The lawmakers submitted questions about reports that DHS has brought in social media influencers to promote immigration raids; reports about the use of military weaponry, including drones, during raids; and the training that federal officials have received on responding to and de-escalating protests. Secretary Noem has yet to respond.

Filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court in support of Illinois’s legal challenge to the Administration. Durbin spearheaded a group of 155 Senate and House Democrats in support of Illinois’s legal challenge to President Trump’s unwarranted National Guard deployment in Illinois.

Demanding answers from DHS, DOD, and FBI leaders about the President’s actions in Chicago. As President Trump began publicly considering deploying troops to Chicago despite explicit opposition from Illinois leaders, Durbin demanded answers from Secretary Noem, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and FBI Director Kash Patel about the potential deployment. Noem, Hegseth, and Patel have yet to respond.

Combatting the DHS misinformation campaign. Durbin led all Illinois Congressional Democrats in releasing comprehensive fact check refuting the Trump Administration’s false accounts of dangerous immigration enforcement actions in Illinois.

Introducing seven amendments to the NDAA to push back on the domestic deployment of troops. These amendments, which Durbin introduced alongside Duckworth, aimed to enhance congressional oversight over President Trump’s expansive use of the military for law enforcement in American cities, including without the consent or request of a state’s elected officials. A full list, as well as full text, of the amendments can be found here.

Joining Duckworth in calling on DOD and DHS to immediately stop misusing the Chicago Harbor Lock. Durbin and Duckworth sent a letter to DOD Secretary Hegseth and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to immediately stop using the Chicago Harbor Lock and U.S. Army Corps of Engineer facilities to support “Operation Midway Blitz.” The Senators questioned Secretary Noem and Secretary Hegseth on why DOD and DHS had deployed vehicles associated with ICE and CBP into the Chicago River.

Joining Duckworth in demanding ICE and CBP enforce body camera requirements. In their letter, the Senators demanded that the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) act immediately to ensure all CPB law enforcement officers assisting ICE wear and activate body-worn cameras when carrying out civil immigration enforcement operations in Illinois, in compliance with agency policy and a lawful order from a federal judge.

Joining Duckworth and Democratic colleagues in introducing legislation to ensure access to legal counsel for detainees. Durbin and Duckworth joined U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) and U.S. Representative Maxine Dexter (D-OR-03) in introducing the Restoring Access to Detainees Act, a bill to ensure the Department of Homeland Security allows noncitizens who have been detained to contact their legal counsel and families.

Attempting to conduct oversight at Broadview ICE Facility. On October 10, Durbin and Duckworth attempted to visit Broadview ICE Facility to conduct oversight, which is a core responsibility of their role as elected officials. Despite their constitutional and statutory authority to conduct oversight, they were barred from entering the facility. This was the fourth time that Durbin had attempted to visit the facility in recent months, but DHS officials turned him away each time. Durbin has pressed the Administration on its denials of Members of Congress to conduct oversight visits of ICE detention facilities.

Visiting Naval Station Great Lakes, which has provided limited logistical support to federal officers. Following reports that Naval Station Great Lakes would be used as a staging area for DHS agents, Durbin, Duckworth, and U.S. Representative Brad Schneider (D-IL-10) visited the Navy base for a briefing with base leadership on the support requested by DHS. While at Naval Station Great Lakes, the lawmakers also attempted to meet directly with DHS officials, but they were denied a meeting and were locked out of the office space used by DHS.

Leading 26 Senators in calling on the U.S. Department of Defense Acting Inspector General (DOD IG) to inquire into the Trump Administration’s domestic deployment of troops. In the Durbin-led letter, the Senators made clear that pulling National Guard troops away from their assigned duties to assist in law enforcement operations erodes public trust; diverts critical resources from communities in need, including those impacted by natural disasters; and costs American taxpayers millions of dollars. The Senators concluded their letter by calling for an inquiry into the legality of domestic troop deployments carried out by the Trump Administration.

Pressing DHS Secretary Noem on lax ICE hiring standards, inflammatory recruitment messaging. In the letter, Durbin pressed Noem on the recent changes to hiring practices at ICE and asked whether ICE has hired any rioters who participated in the January 6, 2021 insurrection. Following a massive funding increase by Congress, ICE is recruiting new staff by employing polarizing and inflammatory recruitment messaging while also lowering age and training requirements with signing bonuses. Secretary Noem has yet to respond.

Holding a meeting with the U.S. Secretary of the Navy to ensure that military resources are not allocated to Operation Midway Blitz beyond providing office space to DHS. At their request, Durbin, Duckworth, and Schnieder met directly with U.S. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan to discuss the limited logistical support provided by Naval Station Great Lakes to DHS and to ensure DHS would not conduct any operations on base. Naval Station Great Lakes has provided office space, parking, and storage space for nonlethal munitions. No Navy personnel or resources have been or will be involved in immigration raids directed by DHS in the Chicago area.

Joining U.S. Representative Delia Ramirez (D-IL-03) to call for a meeting with Chicago’s ICE Field Director. Durbin joined Congresswoman Ramirez in leading all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation in demanding a meeting with ICE Field Director Russell Hott to discuss the so-called “Operation Midway Blitz” as ICE agents escalated tensions through their inflammatory response to protests outside of Broadview ICE Facility. Director Hott did not respond to the request before he was removed from his position this month.

Questioning Attorney General (AG) Pam Bondi on the deployment of troops to Chicago during a Senate Judiciary Committee DOJ oversight hearing. During the oversight hearing, Durbin grilled AG Bondi about the White House’s rationale for deploying troops to American cities, and he further pressed for answers on whether she was involved in any discussions with the President about the potential deployment of the military to Chicago. Rather than provide any clear answer, AG Bondi deflected the questions with personal attacks.

Calling out his Republican colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee for failing to join him in upholding their constitutional oversight obligations. At executive business meetings, Durbin has called out his Republican colleagues for failing to condemn the Trump Administration’s unprovoked escalation in immigration enforcement in Chicago, as well as failing to uphold their constitutional oversight obligations.

Leading a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on crime in cities. Durbin initially requested this hearing with the intent that the Committee would focus on the President’s dangerous threats to deploy the military to American cities. The Republican majority reframed the hearing, choosing instead to focus on crime only in Democratic areas, despite statistics showing that Republican-leaning states consistently have higher rates of violent crime. In the hearing, Durbin exposed the Trump Administration’s hypocrisy, underscoring that President Trump is slashing millions in funding for crime prevention efforts.

Delivering remarks on the Senate floor about the excessive tactics used by DHS agents and speaking out about the President’s attempted deployment of troops. Durbin has taken to the Senate floor more than 10 times to speak out against the excessive force used by DHS agents during raids. Durbin also shared the story of 16-year-old Ofelia Torres, a cancer patient who receives treatment at Lurie Children’s Hospital, while her father was detained by ICE. Videos of Durbin’s floor remarks can be found here.

Holding a spotlight forum entitled, “Cruel and Unamerican: The Abuse of Immigrants to Attack our Constitutional Order.” The forum examined the Trump Administration’s ongoing abuse of immigrants to attack the fundamental rights of all Americans. Witnesses discussed how this Administration has used immigration to spearhead its efforts to undermine our constitutional order and the rule of law, including unprecedented attacks on due process; deploying the National Guard over the objections of local authorities; sending masked agents to arrest noncitizens for speech and expression protected by the First Amendment; disappearing noncitizens to El Salvador, South Sudan, and Guantanamo; and dismantling congressionally-authorized oversight.

Hosting a meeting with Senators and NORTHCOM leadership. Durbin, along with U.S. Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR), convened a virtual meeting with NORTHCOM leadership to request additional information about the troop deployments in Illinois, California, and Oregon. In the meeting, the Senators stressed that the nation’s military must comply with the Posse Comitatus Act.

Towards Justice is a plaintiff in the case, along with Colorado WINS, the state employee union, and Colorado AFL-CIO.","A Denver District Court judge has denied a request by Gov. Jared Polis to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a former state employee over disclosure of information to federal immigration authorities.

The lawsuit filed against the governor by Scott Moss, then the director of the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment Division of Labor Standards and Statistics, sought to prevent Moss from disclosing data sought by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Moss claimed, and the judge agreed through a temporary injunction issued in June, that complying with an administrative subpoena for information on 35 individuals who are custodians of unaccompanied minor children who are illegally staying in the U.S. would violate state laws passed in 2021 and 2024.

ICE claimed it wanted that information to ensure the children were not being subjected to human trafficking or other forms of exploitation. The subpoena reportedly did not provide any evidence of those claims.

In response to the dismissal, a spokesperson said Polis is “committed to protecting Coloradans against human trafficking. While he disagrees with the decision, he respects the opinion regarding standing and cannot comment further on pending litigation.”

State laws prohibit state employees and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, except when that information is sought either through a judicial warrant or criminal investigation.

In his Dec. 2 ruling, , Jones also granted standing to one of the parties – Towards Justice – in the lawsuit.

Moss left state employment in August after Jones issued a temporary injunction that blocked him from complying with the subpoena.

Moss is now full-time on the faculty of the University of Colorado law school. He had been a part-time faculty member while working for the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE).

Jones noted Moss had already left state employment but said the decision to reject the governor’s motion to dismiss was not based on whether Moss would be rehired by the labor agency.

“To the contrary,” Jones wrote, “it is based on his clinical role at CU Law in working with and arranging representation of immigrant workers, including undocumented individuals.”

Jones said Moss had “adequately alleged injury to his ability to engage in those activities if he cannot refer clients to the Department because of concerns about disclosure of their [personally identifiable information] in response to immigration-enforcement subpoenas.”

Jones said he also would reconsider the standing issue for Towards Justice.

Towards Justice is a plaintiff in the case, along with Colorado WINS, the state employee union, and Colorado AFL-CIO.

Jones wrote that Towards Justice had “adequately alleged that it is similarly situated to Mr. Moss and injured in its ability to represent and/or refer clients to the Department.”

One of the issues noted by Jones’ ruling is that the unaccompanied alien children and their sponsors would not be notified that ICE was seeking information and would be unable to assert their rights.

In the June ruling, Jones cautioned the Polis administration about going forward with complying with the ICE subpoena without first notifying the individuals whose information the federal agency sought.

By denying Towards Justice standing, Jones wrote, the interests of those parties would go unrepresented.

With the Dec. 8 candidate filing deadline fast approaching, the high court’s decision likely means Texas’ new map will be used for the 2026 midterm elections.

Justice Samuel Alito ruled that it was “indisputable” that Texas’ motivation for redistricting was “pure and simple” partisan advantage, which the court has previously ruled is permissible. Alito rejected the argument that Texas had engaged in racial gerrymandering.

The ruling is a major win for Republicans in Texas and nationally. President Donald Trump had pushed Texas to redraw its map over the summer, hoping to secure five additional GOP seats to shore up the party’s narrow majority in the U.S. House through the midterms.

Earlier this month, two federal judges barred Texas from using the new map for 2026, saying there was evidence state lawmakers had racially gerrymandered in redrawing the lines. Galveston District Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee, authored the opinion ordering Texas to return to its 2021 map, while 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith vociferously dissented.

The state asked the Supreme Court to overturn Brown’s ruling entirely, but that could take weeks or months to proceed through the court system, especially if the justices decide they want to hear arguments in Washington, D.C. With Thursday’s ruling, the justices have temporarily paused Brown’s ruling while that longer legal process can play out.

The ruling said the lower court, under Brown, “improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections.”

The new map, approved by the Texas Legislature and signed by Gov. Greg Abbott in August, is engineered to give Republicans control of 30 of the state’s 38 congressional districts, up from the 25 they currently hold under the 2021 map. Numerous Republican candidates have stepped forward to run in the newly favorable districts, while several Democratic incumbents were pushed into nearby districts already occupied by another Democrat, forcing them to contemplate primaries or retire.

Brown’s ruling upended those calculations. But in restoring the new map, the Supreme Court likely ensured that Republicans running for redrawn districts will get to campaign under the new lines in 2026.

Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated the ruling, saying it was a win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits.”

Texas Democrats, meanwhile, condemned the outcome, with House Democratic Caucus Chair Rep. Gene Wu of Houston saying the high court had “failed” Texans.

“This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won’t protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face,” Wu said.

In her dissent, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan criticized the court for reversing Brown’s 160-page ruling “based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.”

“Today’s order disrespects the work of a District Court that did everything one could ask to carry out its charge,” Kagan wrote on behalf of the liberal justices. “Today’s order disserves the millions of Texans whom the District Court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.texastribune.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-08-06-Texas-Redistrict-Hearing-REUTERS-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-04 19:57:24.125671

For AAPI women, the same systems that criminalize migration often deny our communities access to basic reproductive health care and bodily autonomy.","Washington, DC— Congresswoman Delia C. Ramirez (IL-03), Founder and co-chair of the Congressional Global Migration Caucus, Congresswoman Ayana Pressley (MA-07), Co-chair of the Reproductive Freedom Caucus, and Congresswoman Jill Tokuda (HI-02), Vice-chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, led 31 members of Congress in the introduction of a resolution (link is external)recognizing that immigrant justice and reproductive justice are inseparable and must be pursued together.

The resolution condemns immigration enforcement policies and practices like immigration detention that lead to coerced or denied reproductive health care, including sterilization, abortion, and contraception.

“The story of my mom– a woman who crossed the border pregnant with me– reminds me that migration and reproductive healthcare are inextricably tied. Despite people traveling miles in the hope of a better life, immigration status, financial conditions, and racism create significant barriers to care,” said Congresswoman Ramirez. “I’m proud to introduce this resolution alongside my colleagues because reproductive justice is a human right and immigrant justice demands the dismantling of systems that criminalize migration, tear apart families, and deny immigrants access to health care and full personhood.”

""This hostile Administration seeks to sow fear and chaos in our communities, criminalize migration, and traumatize our immigrant neighbors—including denying them access to essential reproductive healthcare,"" said Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, Co-Chair of the Reproductive Freedom Caucus. ""The fight for immigration justice and reproductive justice are inextricably intertwined. Pregnant women are being detained without necessary medical care. Their opportunity to raise families is further limited by the unlawful threat of deportation and family separation. Our resolution affirms these truths. No body should be policed, and everyone should be met with the humanity and dignity they deserve—which is why I'm proud to introduce this resolution with Congresswoman Ramirez.""

“Access to reproductive health care is a fundamental human right, regardless of a person’s immigration status. Everyone deserves the freedom to make decisions about their body and their future without facing fear, coercion, or delay,” said Rep. Tokuda. “That’s why I am proud to co-lead this resolution with my colleagues, Reps. Ramirez and Pressley, to ensure DHS and HHS uphold their duty to protect the health and safety of all people. Reproductive justice must include immigrant justice.”

The resolution also urges members of Congress to demand that the Department of Homeland Security implement transparent oversight and accountability mechanisms that monitor reproductive health care quality across all detention facilities, and that the Department of Health and Human Services ensure unaccompanied immigrant youth can access the health care that they need, including abortion, without delay, no matter what State they are held in. Additionally, it calls on the Secretary of Homeland Security to report to Congress all internal reports regarding individuals in detention to enhance oversight and accountability.

“Today, we proudly stand with Congresswomen Delia Ramirez, Ayanna Pressley, and Jill Tokuda in advancing this critical resolution affirming that reproductive rights do not end at the border or behind detention walls. No one should be denied essential prenatal or postpartum care, coerced into medical procedures, or stripped of their right to make decisions about their own body while in U.S. custody. This resolution is a vital affirmation that federal immigration policies should uphold, rather than violate, the fundamental right to humane treatment guaranteed under U.S. and international law.” Rachana Desai Martin, Chief Program Officer, U.S., Center for Reproductive Rights

“We applaud Rep. Delia Ramirez for introducing her resolution affirming immigrant justice inseparable from reproductive justice,” said Katherine Olivera, director of government relations at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice. “We’ve been outraged to learn about how immigrants are treated in detention centers, including being denied abortion, prenatal, maternal, and postpartum care. The everyday impact that anti-immigration policies have on our communities is a direct attack on reproductive justice and our freedoms to make decisions about our bodies and lives. Now more than ever, we need proactive policy solutions like this resolution that confront the structural systems depriving immigrant communities of health care.”

“By affirming that reproductive freedom and immigrant justice cannot exist without one another, this resolution lays the groundwork for inclusive and sustained policy change. For AAPI women, the same systems that criminalize migration often deny our communities access to basic reproductive health care and bodily autonomy. Calling on DHS to take accountability and protect access to care for all immigrants, including those in detention, is an important act of resistance in a time when our rights are under attack. These are the steps necessary to building toward a country where everyone can make decisions about their own bodies and futures, free from fear, discrimination, and government control.” – Fajer Saeed Ebrahim, Senior Director of Policy, National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum (NAPAWF).

“Immigrant Justice is deeply connected to Reproductive Justice because both are grounded in the shared belief that every person, regardless of immigration status, deserves full access to the health care they need to live and thrive,” said Regina Davis Moss, President and CEO of In Our Own Voice: National Black Women’s Reproductive Justice Agenda. “That’s why In Our Own Voice is proud to endorse Congresswoman Delia Ramirez’s House Resolution, which condemns current Department of Homeland Security policies that restrict or fully prohibit access to health care coverage for immigrants. The cruel denial of essential health care not only violates human rights, but is a direct attack on the bodily autonomy of immigrant women, girls, and pregnant people. We thank Congresswoman Ramirez for her bold leadership and commitment to Reproductive Justice, which can only be achieved when we build an inclusive immigration system that works for all of us.”

Human Rights Watch, in a July report, also accused Krome of dehumanizing conditions.
The alleged violations described in the report include: At Alligator Alcatraz, the lights remained on permanently, the men told human rights researchers, making it hard to sleep.
The men the human rights organization interviewed said they lived in unsanitary conditions.
Another said he spent 28 hours shackled on a bus, before being transferred to Alligator Alcatraz.","Alleging human rights abuses in two South Florida immigration detention facilities, Amnesty International released a 61-page report on Thursday describing inhumane conditions at Alligator Alcatraz and Krome North Service Processing Center.

The report, released a day after the organization opened a related art exhibit in Miami Beach, focuses on Florida’s efforts to lead the nation in aiding President Donald Trump’s mass deportation mandate by building and operating first-of-its-kind immigration detention centers like Alligator Alcatraz, and by deputizing local and state enforcement agencies to assist in immigration apprehensions. The human rights organization accuses the federal government of “chronic medical neglect” at Krome, and the DeSantis administration of “torture and ill-treatment” of detainees being held at Alligator Alcatraz.

At the makeshift tent facility in the middle of the Everglades, the report concluded that detainees did not have adequate access to medical care. It also alleged they were being detained “in inhuman and unsanitary conditions including overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping, limited access to showers, exposure to insects without protective measures, lights on 24 hours a day, poor quality food and water, and lack of privacy.”

Thirty-six miles away on the western edge of Miami-Dade County, the report also focused on Krome North Processing Center, finding that the facility had “alarming disciplinary practices” and “overcrowding in temporary processing areas.”

The organization’s assessment is based on a September tour of the Krome detention center led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, where they were able to ask ICE officials questions, and on interviews with four detainees who were held at both Krome and Alligator Alcatraz. Amnesty International also spoke to local organizations that have been in contact with detainees, including Americans for Immigrant Justice, Florida Immigrant Coalition and Sanctuary of the South.

According to the report, Amnesty International’s researchers requested a tour of Alligator Alcatraz but did not receive a response from the state, which is responsible for the site’s operations.

Molly Best, press secretary for Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office, disputed the report’s findings.

“This ‘report’ is nothing more than a politically motivated attack. None of these fabrications are true,” she said. “In fact, running these allegations without any evidence whatsoever could jeopardize the safety and security of our staff and those being housed at Alligator Alcatraz.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to the Miami Herald’s request for comment.

Since Alligator Alcatraz opened in July, the Miami Herald, other news outlets and civil rights groups have documented complaints from detainees, such as unflushable toilets, being swamped by bugs and limited shower access. The state has consistently denied mistreating its detainees, but has largely kept them off-limits to outside eyes, including lawmakers allowed to tour the facility.

Human Rights Watch, in a July report, also accused Krome of dehumanizing conditions.

Amy Fischer, the director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA, speaking to a Herald reporter at the Scope Art Show on Miami Beach, said it is important to “raise alarm” about the operations at state-run Alligator Alcatraz, “so that we can really start to bring global accountability for the suffering that is ongoing.”

Fischer said that, as Amnesty International researchers spoke with people in South Florida, many were surprised to learn that Alligator Alcatraz was still open. In August, a federal judge ordered the site shut down within 60 days, but an appeals court quickly reversed the decision.

“That is why we know it’s so important for this report to come out, for us to be having this art exhibit, to remind people that, yes, there has been a legal back and forth, yes, maybe it’s not on the front pages of the news every day,” Fischer said.

“Every single day, our immigrant friends and neighbors are being taken from their families, from their communities, and put into this facility that prolongs and profits off their suffering,” she said. “And we can’t let that leave the news.”

In the report, the detainees Amnesty International spoke with described a “2X2” cage-like structure called the “box” at Alligator Alcatraz, where they said detainees are placed for punishment, sometimes for hours, while chained and restrained to the ground in the heat. A detainee shared a story with Miami Herald news partner WLRN about the outdoor cell during the facility’s first weeks of operations, but said it was twice as large as the dimensions described in the Amnesty International report.

“The use of the ‘box’ at “Alligator Alcatraz” amounts to torture or other ill-treatment,” the report concluded.

Accusations of Inhumane conditions

The researchers from Amnesty International concluded that in its aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration, the state did not comply with either domestic or international human rights standards in its detention facility.

The alleged violations described in the report include:

At Alligator Alcatraz, the lights remained on permanently, the men told human rights researchers, making it hard to sleep.

The men the human rights organization interviewed said they lived in unsanitary conditions. The toilets were often clogged, and feces overflowed into their sleeping area. They also told the researchers they did not have access to showers, sometimes for over two weeks.

Others complained of being shackled for hours. One man said he was held on a bus shackled for 10 hours. Another said he spent 28 hours shackled on a bus, before being transferred to Alligator Alcatraz. At the facility, they were shackled whenever they left the chain-linked cell, sometimes even when eating or when they needed medical care, the report states.

At Krome, the men told the researchers they faced “arbitrary disciplinary action.” A detainee said he was held in solitary confinement for 24 days after a confrontation with a guard. During the tour of the solitary confinement area, human rights groups said a detainee slipped a note through a metal flap, which read, “Help Me. I’m on Hunger Strike.” The report found that the use of solitary confinement at Krome “amounts to torture or other ill-treatment in violation of international law.”

Also at Krome, detainees told the human rights group that a temporary, soft-sided processing area was crowded, and they were held there for more than seven days. One detainee said they had been there for a month.

The organization called on the state to immediately shut down Alligator Alcatraz, and recommended that Florida’s state and local law enforcement agencies terminate their 287g agreements allowing officers to actively engage in immigration enforcement activities otherwise reserved for federal agents.

Amnesty International also called for members of Congress to use their oversight authority on ICE detention centers, reduce funding for DHS departments like ICE and CBP and prohibit the use of federal funds to reimburse states for performing the federal function of immigration enforcement.

“Cruelty is the point”

Amnesty International timed the release of its report to the opening of an art exhibit on Wednesday featuring two commissioned pieces at the Scope Art Show on Miami Beach.

Fischer said the organization sought out artists to create an exhibit that makes people “feel that people are suffering nearby while we’re here enjoying art.”

“Art allows people to really engage with a subject from multiple dimensions, really sort of put themselves in the experience,” Fischer said.

Clarence James, a Washington, D.C.-based artist, said he drew inspiration from ICE recruitment posters circulating on social media that resembled World War II-era posters, calling on recruits to “defend the homeland.”

One poster with Uncle Sam reads, “Help your country..and yourself.” Another reads “America needs you.”

James said he took those posters and juxtaposed them with the “idea of freedom.” That meant, for James, incorporating pieces of American history, such as Native American tribes like the Miccosukee, whose tribal land and reservation is close to Alligator Alcatraz.

On the 10-by-6-foot piece, called “Cruelty is The Point,” he also included a chain-link fence representing the makeshift facility’s structure. The piece also has instructions for people to attach zip ties to it as a form of solidarity with the detainees.

James said he wants to “give people a chance to have some empathy and realize we’re all human, and we’re all participating in life out here, and just to understand the immigrant and what their history is.”

A few feet away, is the second piece, by Agua Dulce Gloriosa, a Miami-based artist and activist who created an altar with artifacts from the city to honor those detained at Alligator Alcatraz.

Dulce Gloriosa, who was born and raised in Miami, wanted the piece to be intentional about the representation of Miami. The multi-piece includes earth elements such as soil and water from outside Alligator Alcatraz, flower and mulch from Miami organizations, and seawater to represent the beach on which the exhibit was taking place. The artist included Haitian rum, coffee and a domino table surrounded by mirrors.

The piece, “Untitled (a hope is but a dream is but a plan yet put to action),” offers onlookers a moment to look into the mirror and reflect on the current times and the world they would like to create.

“I want people in relationship to this space to be able to believe, not just hope, but believe that another world is possible,” Dulce Gloriosa said. “And understand that it is their personal responsibility to act and to take responsibility to be a part of creating that different world, that new world, that more loving, just, equitable, caring world.”

The piece invites viewers to take a cafecito cup filled with sand or coffee and place it at the bottom of the altar to honor the detainees at Alligator Alcatraz. On the first public opening on Wednesday, more than three dozen cups of sand and coffee had been laid at the altar. Some placed a dollar as an offering.

The exhibit is open to the public from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., closing on Sunday evening.

CNN also reported the case of a 22-year-old US-born mother who was chased home by federal agents in an SUV from the grocery store in Marrero.
It’s just straight racial profiling.” The Trump administration insists it is going after “the worst of the worst”, people convicted for the most serious violent crimes.
But advocates demanded they go further and declare city property “ICE-free” zones where ICE agents and other federal personnel are not permitted to stage operations.
“It’s like a siege,” said Taber.","Dozens of people have been detained across the New Orleans area as the Trump administration’s latest sweeping federal immigration crackdown in a Democratic-led city entered its second day.

The city’s immigrant communities remain terrified and traumatized, advocates said, with many in hiding as people have been arrested in public spaces including parking lots outside Home Depots and Lowe’s hardware stores, at bus stops, shopping malls and in residential areas around the city.

Rachel Taber, an organizer with Unión Migrante, shared a video with the Guardian of masked border patrol agents questioning and then handcuffing a man in the parking lot of the Lowe’s on Elysian Fields on Wednesday. Agents ask the man where he was born. “I’m a US citizen,” he responds. “But where were you born,” the agent asks again, before repeating the question in Spanish. An unmarked white pickup truck is visible in the background. The man declines to answer any more questions, and the agent tells his colleague to handcuff him.

Taber has not been able to find out yet what happened to that man, but said she had learned of three incidents where US citizens were detained and held for questioning, before being later released after proving their citizenship. The Guardian approached the Department of Homeland Security to comment on those reports.

CNN also reported the case of a 22-year-old US-born mother who was chased home by federal agents in an SUV from the grocery store in Marrero. She told CNN: “I kept yelling at them, ‘I’m legal! I’m a US-born citizen! Please, leave me alone! I’m going home, my daughter is in the house. My baby is waiting for me!’”

“They’re not picking up criminals,” said Taber. “They’re picking up people off the streets, whoever they can catch – these are moms and dads coming home from work, ambushed getting out of their cars.” Taber was aware of 14 arrests on Wednesday and four so far on Thursday, including one in which federal agents smashed a man’s car windows in a Walmart parking lot before taking him into custody.

“It’s like psychological warfare. They’re attacking people who haven’t committed any crime, it’s just the color of their skin. It’s just straight racial profiling.”

The Trump administration insists it is going after “the worst of the worst”, people convicted for the most serious violent crimes. But when the Guardian reached out to the US Department of Homeland Security to verify how many of the arrests so far in so-called “Operation Catahoula Crunch” involved undocumented migrants with a criminal record, DHS said only that “dozens” of people had been detained, highlighting six individuals. In one case, the only conviction was for vehicle theft and forging documents.

“The people of New Orleans are against this,” Taber said, adding that her phone was constantly ringing with people wanting to help film and document what has been happening, and assist with things like carpools to get kids whose parents were in hiding safely to and from school. “That’s the only light we have right now.”

A city council meeting was disrupted for about half an hour on Thursday amid a heated protest over the federal operation.

Things got heated during the meeting’s public comment section, when advocates implored city officials to “please do more to protect us” from ICE and border patrol. They held up signs reading, “silence supports deportation” and “immigrants built and rebuilt this city”, a nod to the thousands of Hispanic reconstruction workers who powered the city’s recovery after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.

The council has set up an online portal for citizens to report alleged abuse and misconduct from federal officers, which includes information about your rights when interacting with law enforcement. But advocates demanded they go further and declare city property “ICE-free” zones where ICE agents and other federal personnel are not permitted to stage operations.

“Little kids are not going to school right now. People are not able to take their disabled parents to medical appointments,” said Mich Gonzalez, an activist and founding member of Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition, just before the suspension. “The grocery stores are suffering, the businesses will suffer. This city lives on hospitality. Who do you think washes all the dishes in those restaurants?”

As protesters cheered and applauded, the council president, JP Morrell, motioned to suspend public comments on the topic and cut their microphones, which spurred protesters to get more raucous, chanting “let the people speak” and “no ICE, no troops.” Police officers forced the protesters out after brief scuffles with pushing and shoving. In video footage, one person is forcefully carried out by police.

It remains unclear how long the federal operation will last, but some reports suggest it could stretch into January. “It’s like a siege,” said Taber. Many people have been staying home out of fear of arrest but “at some point, how are people going to pay their rent?” Taber said she had one friend looking to sell his truck in order to make rent, but would struggle to do his job without it after this is over.

As numerous businesses around the city remain shuttered and people continue to hunker down out of fear for as long as they can, the collective trauma inflicted on the immigrant communities of New Orleans will be hard to measure.

As Taber put it: “There are kids this Christmas who are not just going to be without presents, they’re going to be without parents.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a54580b14b914d3dd6a263e05e37eabef09be4ec/498_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac9e498ce4bca24bc4b2b1e956c54a35",N,,2025-12-04 18:58:27.752250

“These policies will tear families apart, endanger people fleeing persecution, and further damage US credibility on human rights,” Greene said.","(Washington, DC) – The Trump administration’s latest actions on immigration policy appear to be based on punitive hostility toward people of particular nationalities and carry an unmistakable current of racism as well, Human Rights Watch said today. The administration recently suspended immigration processing for nationals from 19 countries on its existing travel ban list and suspended pending asylum procedures for all nationalities in a dramatic escalation of its anti-immigrant policy agenda.

“Nothing meaningfully links the 19 countries except the administration’s opportunistic stigmatization and exclusion of people based on where they were born,” said Tanya Greene, US Program director at Human Rights Watch. “This sweeping change is not about safety. It is about scapegoating entire nationalities to justify discriminatory policies.”

In the immediate aftermath of a deadly incident in Washington, DC on November 26, 2025, in which an Afghan immigrant allegedly attacked two National Guard troops, killing one, President Donald Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all third world countries,” alongside other racially charged comments disparaging Somalis in particular.

Those comments were followed by new policies that halt a range of immigration processes, including green card and citizenship grants, for people from the following countries: Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen. Additionally, there is a suspension of all pending asylum applications regardless of the asylum seeker’s country of nationality.

US officials have not offered any evidence that asylum seekers generally or nationals from these 19 countries pose heightened public safety risks compared to people from anywhere else. Instead, the new policy directed against the 19 nationality groups revives and expands the logic of first Trump administration’s notorious “Muslim ban,” Human Rights Watch said.

The new restrictions undermine US commitments under international human rights law, including obligations to ensure the right to seek asylum.

“These policies will tear families apart, endanger people fleeing persecution, and further damage US credibility on human rights,” Greene said. “The administration should rescind them immediately.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/12/202512usp_us_cabinet_meeting.jpg?h=790be497&itok=TQ2v2Mmu,N,,2025-12-04 18:58:06.654279

Amnesty International is calling Florida officials to ""close Alligator Alcatraz and to prohibit the use of any state-run immigration detention.""
It is demanding the Trump administration ""end its cruel mass immigration detention machine"" and ensure compliance with international human rights standards.","A new report released Thursday by Amnesty International details what it describes as a ""deliberate system built to punish, dehumanize, and hide the suffering"" of immigrants in Florida, with documented human rights violations at two major detention centers that, in some cases, ""amount to torture.""

The report, ""Torture and enforced disappearances in the Sunshine State: Human rights violations at 'Alligator Alcatraz' and Krome in Florida,"" comes from an Amnesty International investigation of the state-run Everglades Detention Facility, known as ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" and the Krome North Service Processing Center.

""These findings confirm a deliberate system built to punish, dehumanize, and hide the suffering of people in detention,"" said Ana Piquer, Amnesty International's Regional Director for the Americas, in a statement accompanying the report. ""Immigration enforcement cannot operate outside the rule of law or exempt itself from human rights standards. What we are seeing in Florida should alarm the entire region.""

State and federal officials have dismissed similar claims made from immigrant advocates and others in lawsuits alleging mistreatment of immigrant detainees and other alleged human right violations at Krome and Alligator Alcatraz.

""Nearly every single day, my office responds to media questions on FALSE allegations about Alligator Alcatraz. The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true,"" said U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement in late August.

""Here are the facts: Alligator Alcatraz does meet federal detention standards,"" she said.

DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately to respond to a WLRN request for comment..

'Alligator Alcatraz': A State-Run Human Rights Disaster

The investigation found that conditions at ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in a remote area of the Everglades are profoundly inhuman and unsanitary. Detainees reported constant illumination, lack of privacy (including cameras above toilets), exposure to insects, and serious sanitation failures, including ""overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping.""

Among the most serious allegations were punitive measures, including the use of ""the box,"" described as a ""2x2 foot cage-like structure people are put in as punishment — sometimes for hours at a time exposed to the elements with hardly any water — with their hands and feet attached to restraints on the ground.""

Amnesty International also found that the facility is operated ""without the basic tracking systems used in ICE facilities,"" and keeps detainees in incommunicado detention, which the Amnesty International says ""constitutes enforced disappearances"" when a person's whereabouts are denied to family or legal counsel.

""These despicable and nauseating conditions at Alligator Alcatraz reflect a pattern of deliberate neglect designed to dehumanize and punish those detained there,"" said Amy Fischer, Director of Refugee and Migrant Rights with Amnesty International USA. ""This is unreal — where's the oversight?""

Krome: Overcrowding and Medical Neglect

At the Krome facility, Amnesty International investigators corroborated previous reports of overcrowding, prolonged and arbitrary solitary confinement, and critical failures in medical care. Detained individuals reported serious medical negligence despite medical facilities being on-site.

Amnesty International staff report witnessing violence firsthand, observing a guard ""violently slam a metal flap of a door to a solitary confinement room against a man's injured hand."" Detainees also reported being hit and punched by guards and facing immense difficulty in accessing legal counsel.

""Krome's extreme overcrowding, medical neglect, and reports of humiliating and degrading treatment paint a picture of harrowing human right violations,"" Fischer added.

Prioritizing Punishment Over Public Welfare

The Amnesty International report comes at a time when Florida has intensified its policies toward undocumented immigrants and scaled up detentions under Gov. Ron DeSantis. Florida has increased the number of people in immigrant detention by more than 50% since the beginning of this year. The expansion includes more than $360 million in no-bid contracts issued for ""Alligator Alcatraz"" alone, which Amnesty notes comes ""all while cutting billions from essential health, food security, emergency response, and housing programs.""

The crisis is also underscored by the death rate in Florida's facilities; of the at least 24 people who have died in ICE custody since October 2024 nationwide, six deaths occurred in Florida, including four at Krome.

But the DHS, like Trump’s White House, has added another element to its grift by capitalizing on the complaints that follow its theft of popular songs.
The DHS was forced to remove MGMT’s “Little Dark Age” from an ICE recruitment ad after the band issued a takedown request.
The video, posted in October, showed agents arresting protesters outside an ICE facility in Portland, Ore.
The DHS posted the song clip to its official social media channels, along with the caption: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation.","Another week, another pop star angry that their song was used without their permission in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement recruitment ad.

Singer Sabrina Carpenter’s song “Juno” appeared as the soundtrack for a Department of Homeland Security promotional video posted on the official X account of the White House. It featured a montage of clips appearing to show ICE officers chasing down, tackling and handcuffing people in what looks to be the city of Chicago. The lyrics — “Wanna try out some freaky positions? Have you ever tried this one?” — from the song play atop the footage.

“[T]his video is evil and disgusting,” Carpenter posted on Tuesday. “Do not ever involve me or my music to benefit your inhumane agenda.”

Too late, since the DHS had already done it without her knowledge.

Using the work of pop music performers minus their consent is the only way the White House can score their ICE campaign with music clips that actually appeal to people younger than 50.

The list of luminaries who have condemned the agency’s actions or filed legal copyright removal requests (Jay-Z had his song “Public Service Announcement” struck from a DHS social media post) reads like a sold-out Coachella lineup: Jay-Z, Olivia Rodrigo, MGMT, Zach Bryan, The Cure, Usher, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club. It also includes the estates and companies that represent Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down,” Pokémon’s original theme song “Gotta Catch ’Em All” and the “Wicked” soundtrack’s “Defying Gravity” as sung by Cynthia Erivo.

As for the catalog of bona fide stars and meme-made celebs who have expressed gratitude for hearing their work in an ICE detainment video? There is no such list.

From the Stones to Springsteen to Swift, GOP campaigns, rallies and election-year ads have featured the music of performers who didn’t want their songs associated with Reagan’s trickle-down economics, either Bush administration’s Gulf war, or Trump’s scorched-earth policies. There wasn’t, and still isn’t, a wealth of popular artists who openly embrace right-wing ideals. Kid Rock and Lee Greenwood, the latter of whom teamed up with Trump to release a “God Bless the USA” bible, can’t do it all.

The right’s strategy has been to use a song once, knowing that a copyright infringement complaint will likely follow, then avoid further legal action by moving on to another artist’s work. Call it poach and run.

But the DHS, like Trump’s White House, has added another element to its grift by capitalizing on the complaints that follow its theft of popular songs.

Carpenter’s response to her song being used without her consent was met with a trolling retort from the DHS. The department weaponized the singer’s own lyrics against her to capitalize on the negative attention (a hallmark of MAGA’s winning strategy in gaming the attention economy).

“Here’s a Short n’ Sweet message for Sabrina Carpenter: we won’t apologize for deporting dangerous criminal illegal murderers, rapists, and pedophiles from our country. Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson in a statement, referencing Carpenter’s recent single “Manchild” and the title of her 2024 album, “Short n’ Sweet.”

Crazy idea: The administration might also catch pedophiles and rapists by releasing unredacted copies of the Epstein files. But how to turn that ugliness into a “fun” video with a quippy caption?

The DHS was forced to remove MGMT’s “Little Dark Age” from an ICE recruitment ad after the band issued a takedown request. The video, posted in October, showed agents arresting protesters outside an ICE facility in Portland, Ore. It was captioned: “End of the Dark Age, beginning of the Golden Age.”

The White House also used British singer Jess Glynne’s 2015 single “Hold My Hand,” a song that recently made a comeback in a viral Jet2 holiday ad, to promote its deportation operation over the summer. The DHS posted the song clip to its official social media channels, along with the caption: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”

Glynne and the airline company condemned the ad. But by then, the DHS was on to the next song by an artist who wanted nothing to do with them.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51993f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6278x3296+0+445/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F83%2Fe5f427c54aaa9032cb083f3cad56%2Fap24161141532383.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 17:59:24.610473

“Many smugglers told us that stricter enforcement is actually fuelling demand,” said Chloe Sydney, the centre’s lead researcher.
Despite widespread assertions that smugglers are luring people into irregular migration, just 6% of the migrants surveyed said smugglers had influenced their decision.
The data made it clear that smugglers were not the cause of irregular migration, said Forin.
Instead, he pointed to the lack of safe and legal alternatives to explain why people were resorting to irregular routes.","Hardline migration policies adopted by governments across the globe have been a boon for people smugglers, fuelling demand and allowing them to raise their prices, according to a report.

The findings, released on Thursday by the Mixed Migration Centre of the Danish Refugee Council, and based on interviews with thousands of migrants and hundreds of smugglers, come as officials prepare to gather next week in Brussels to discuss how best to combat smuggling.

The centre said it had timed the release in order to provide policymakers – who have embraced slogans such as the British government’s “smash the gangs” – with evidence that could guide the discussions.

“Governments say they want to ‘break the business model’ of smugglers, yet our data shows the opposite is happening,” Roberto Forin, the acting director of the Geneva-based centre, said in a statement.

The findings draw on more than 80,000 interviews with people who were on the move across the globe between 2019 and the first half of 2025. More than 50,000 of them said they had used smugglers, with many of them linking their decision to the absence of accessible opportunities for legal migration.

The researchers also spoke with 458 smugglers in west and north Africa between 2021 and 2025. “Many smugglers told us that stricter enforcement is actually fuelling demand,” said Chloe Sydney, the centre’s lead researcher.

Case in point were the 102 smugglers interviewed on the central Mediterranean route. Even as irregular arrivals to Italy dropped in 2024, nearly half – 44% – of the smugglers said demand for their services had increased, partly because of the tighter border measures, said Sydney. “Instead of breaking their business model, it is being boosted.”

Among the smugglers interviewed, 57% said they had increased their fees, with 78% of them linking the higher prices to the increased risk they were taking due to hardline migration policies.

Nearly half of the smugglers (49%) admitted being in touch with officials such as border guards, police or detention staff, suggesting state officials were frequently complicit in smuggling operations.

Despite widespread assertions that smugglers are luring people into irregular migration, just 6% of the migrants surveyed said smugglers had influenced their decision. Instead, most of them said the decision had been their own or had been influenced by friends or relatives who were already abroad.

The report also looked at who was most likely to use smugglers, finding that those fleeing insecurity, conflict and limitations on their rights and freedoms commonly did, as did those embarking on longer, more perilous journeys.

The data made it clear that smugglers were not the cause of irregular migration, said Forin. Instead, he pointed to the lack of safe and legal alternatives to explain why people were resorting to irregular routes.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67bed2b6f7ce56e59434afaae6de6b0fbde8cde/213_0_4560_3648/master/4560.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=de104cea0687f337b51359a2dd9ab306",N,,2025-12-04 20:57:19.576251

(AP) — President Donald Trump’s effort to install political loyalists as top federal prosecutors has run into a legal buzz saw lately, with judges ruling that his handpicked U.S. attorneys for New Jersey, eastern Virginia, Nevada and Los Angeles were all serving unlawfully.

On Thursday, another federal judge heard an argument by New York Attorney General Letitia James that the administration also twisted the law to make John Sarcone the acting U.S. attorney for northern New York.

James, a Democrat, is challenging Sarcone’s authority to oversee a Justice Department investigation into regulatory lawsuits she filed against Trump and the National Rifle Association. It’s one of several arguments she is making to block subpoenas issued as part of the probe, which her lawyers say is part of a campaign of baseless investigations and prosecutions of Trump’s perceived enemies.

Her attorney Hailyn Chen argued in court that since Sarcone lacks legitimate authority to act as U.S. attorney, legal steps taken by him in that capacity — like the subpoenas — are unlawful. In response to a question from U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield, Chen said Sarcone should be disqualified from the investigation and the office.

“Sarcone exercised power that he did not lawfully possess,” Chen told the judge.

Justice Department lawyers say Sarcone was appointed properly and the motion to block the subpoenas should be denied. Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss argued that disqualifying Sarcone would be “drastic and extreme.”

“We don’t think that’s a proper remedy,” Belliss said.

Schofield, after peppering both attorneys with questions, did not say when she would rule.

The fight in New York and other states is largely over the legality of unorthodox strategies the Trump administration has adopted to appoint prosecutors seen as unlikely to get confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

The hearing came a week after a federal judge in Virginia dismissed indictments brought there against James and former FBI Director James Comey. That judge concluded that the interim U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed. The Justice Department is expected to appeal.

On Monday, a federal appeals court ruled that Alina Habba, Trump’s former personal lawyer, is disqualified from serving as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor.

Under federal law, the president’s nominees for U.S. attorney must be confirmed by the Senate. If a position is vacant, the U.S. attorney general can appoint someone temporarily, but that appointment expires after 120 days. If that time period elapses, judges in the district can either keep the interim U.S. attorney or appoint someone of their own choosing.

Sarcone’s appointment didn’t follow that path.

Trump hasn’t nominated anyone to serve as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in March. When his 120-day term elapsed, judges in the district declined to keep him in the post.

Bondi then took the unusual step of appointing Sarcone as a special attorney, then designated him first assistant U.S. attorney for the district, a maneuver federal officials say allows him to serve as an acting U.S. attorney.

Chen called it an abuse of executive power.

The New York subpoenas seek records related to a civil case James filed against Trump over alleged fraud in his personal business dealings and records from a lawsuit involving the National Rifle Association and two senior executives.

Belliss argued in court that the U.S. attorney general has broad authority to appoint attorneys within her department and to delegate her functions to those attorneys. Belliss said that even if Sarcone is not properly holding the office of acting U.S. attorney, he can still conduct grand jury investigations as a special attorney.

Sarcone was part of Trump’s legal team during the 2016 presidential campaign and worked for the U.S. General Services Administration as the regional administrator for the Northeast and Caribbean during Trump’s first term.

Habba also served as an interim U.S. attorney. When her appointment expired, New Jersey judges replaced her with a career prosecutor who had served as her second-in-command. Bondi then fired that prosecutor and renamed Habba as acting U.S. attorney.

The struggle for justice continues, and with it, the enduring strength of both our civil rights laws and the people they protect.","Civil Rights Endure in an Authoritarian Era

For over a year, the Trump-Vance administration has implemented a coordinated effort to undermine diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs across multiple fronts as part of a broader authoritarian agenda. Beginning with its earlier executive orders (EOs) targeting programs promoting racial inclusion and essentially erasing transgender communities, these efforts have permeated a range of contexts. The administration’s tactics have also included a barrage of new restrictions on federal grants, the weaponization of federal civil rights agencies, and the abandonment of LGBTQIA+ workplace civil rights lawsuits, among other things. The targets have spanned the federal civil service, labor unions, law firms, nonprofit organizations, the media, and higher education.

Many of the administration’s anti-DEIA directives rely on an overly broad and incorrect interpretation of the 2023 Supreme Court decision in Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) v. Harvard and SFFA v. University of North Carolina. While this consolidated decision undermined longstanding precedent regarding the consideration of race in college admissions, it was narrow in scope and limited to higher education admissions. Despite the rampant citing of the SFFA case in the attempts to destroy DEIA, the fact remains that our nation’s civil rights laws remain unchanged.

DEIA initiatives expand opportunity, strengthen institutions, and uphold the promise that every person deserves a meaningful opportunity to thrive. Defending these principles in court remains vital. Across the civil rights arena and beyond, litigation is essential to safeguarding democracy. Seeking justice from our courts is a critical tool in the fight against authoritarianism and a righteous commitment we share with so many members of the American Bar Association (ABA).

Fighting Back in the Courts

Democracy Forward Foundation (DFF) has secured numerous legal victories nationwide that have slowed or blocked significant harm to many communities in the first year of the Trump-Vance administration. The examples that follow represent several of the more than 100 legal actions the nonprofit organization has taken to date. Significantly, rulings against this administration have been issued by judges nominated by democratic and republican presidents, including President Trump, and are frequently upheld on appeal. These opinions underscore the resilience of the law and the people it protects. To be sure, the movement has experienced setbacks, particularly from the Supreme Court. But this persistence reflects a shared conviction with other civil rights organizations: Justice will be secured through collective action.

DFF’s civil rights-related litigation over the past year focused on a range of fronts, as detailed below: challenging the unlawful weaponization of federal funding, defending workers targeted under anti-DEIA directives, and fighting attacks on the implementation of DEIA initiatives in the legal profession. These cases reveal the breadth of the administration’s campaign to dismantle equity and inclusion—and the power of coordinated legal resistance to stop it.

Many of these cases confront the administration’s anti-DEIA EOs. For example, DFF moved swiftly to challenge the orders as unlawful and secured a broad, nationwide injunction blocking the implementation of these EOs in National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education (NADOHE) v. Trump. This was the first case to find that such orders likely violate the First Amendment, exceed presidential authority, and obstruct Congress’s constitutional powers. DFF won this ruling with co-counsel Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAAJ), in partnership with NADOHE, the American Association of University Professors, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, and the mayor and City Council of Baltimore.

After continued violations of the injunction, the court affirmed that its order applies to every agency within the executive branch. The Fourth Circuit has since stayed the injunction following the government’s appeal, and litigation efforts remain ongoing.

Notably, when pressed in court, in this case and others, government lawyers have repeatedly failed to define what the administration considers “illegal” DEIA activity. At times, they have claimed that executive orders and guidance merely ensure compliance with existing civil rights laws. In reality, by not defining what conduct is or is not allowed under these EOs, the administration is advancing vague, contradictory, and unenforceable directives deliberately designed to chill institutions and communities from maintaining DEIA-related initiatives.

These attacks on core civil rights protections by the Trump-Vance administration are matched by the resolve of the strong coalitions fighting back. DFF is far from alone in this effort to advance greater inclusion, and this work is also led by advocates including AAAJ, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Lambda Legal, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, National Women’s Law Center (NWLC), and others.

Challenging the Unlawful Conditioning of Federal Funding

DFF has brought several cases challenging the weaponization of federal grants, and many are connected to the president’s anti-DEIA directives. For example, the organization challenged the U.S. Department of Education’s “Dear Colleague” letter on behalf of a coalition of educators, unions, teachers, and academic sociologists in American Federation of Teachers (AFT) et al. v. U.S. Department of Education et al. A federal court vacated the policy changes that were directed in the letter—finding the department’s effort to withhold funds and weaponize compliance with civil rights protections unlawful. This was the first final judgment on the issue and affirmed what DFF and its clients have long maintained: The Trump-Vance administration’s crusade against civil rights, equity, and inclusion is unlawful.

DFF also successfully filed Anchorage School District et al. v. Department of Education et al. with co-counsel Jacobson Lawyers Group and DeLuca, Weizenbaum, Barry & Revens Ltd. Just days after the filing, the administration released the $6 billion in federal funds it had been withholding from public schools across the nation to support the school year. DFF secured this major victory after challenging the administration’s withholding of federal public education funds on behalf of a coalition of school districts, educators, and families.

The administration claimed it delayed funding to conduct a review, asserting that some programs improperly used federal funds to promote a “radical left-wing agenda.” The delay posed an immediate harm to school communities, particularly those serving low-income students. The litigation, a similar challenge by several state attorneys general and public pressure, forced the release of these funds and a commitment to release later funding on time without new conditions, protecting schools and students. The case illustrates how timely legal action can compel the administration to retreat from unlawful overreach even before a court order is issued.

In Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence v. Bondi, DFF, Jacobson Lawyers Group, NWLC, the Lawyers Committee for Rhode Island, and the ACLU Foundation of Rhode Island successfully represent 17 state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions challenging the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) new requirement that grant recipients must certify they do not operate any prohibited DEI programs, among other representations. The filing argues that the new requirements are unconstitutional, violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and impede the organizations’ ability to effectively serve the LGBTQIA+ community, immigrants, and racial minorities. Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus brief in support of the case. DFF won a preliminary injunction, temporarily halting the new grant conditions nationwide while the litigation proceeds.

In a similar case, Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence v. Kennedy, DFF and its co-counsel filed a complaint on behalf of the same group of state domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions as well as five nonprofit organizations addressing services for unhoused people to ask the court to block the administration from enforcing requirements that push grantees to restrict or deny DEI efforts, prohibit support for transgender individuals, and certify compliance with broad anti-equity mandates, or else face severe penalties, including liability under the False Claims Act. A federal judge in Rhode Island entered an order preliminarily blocking these unlawful restrictions on the grants.

Protecting Workers

Supporting federal workers implicates significant civil rights concerns, given the makeup of the federal government workforce. As a recent NWLC report documents, attacks on the federal workforce in the past year have particularly harmed women and people of color through the elimination of jobs that provided greater pay equity and stability relative to other industries. DFF has also sought justice for the thousands of workers who lost their jobs in the unlawful downsizing of the federal workforce.

Through a range of lawsuits and its Civil Service Strong initiative, DFF is helping coordinate resources and legal clinics for impacted workers. DFF has brought multiple lawsuits representing thousands of workers nationwide in close collaboration with unions and partner organizations including the American Federation of Government Employees; the American Federation of Teachers; the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers; the National Federation of Federal Employees; the National Association of Government Employees; the National Treasury Employees Union; and the Service Employees International Union.

The administration’s executive orders have harmed workers across both public and private sectors, eroding fundamental rights. DFF filed a lawsuit in support of transgender workers when it challenged the weaponization of a core federal civil rights agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). FreeState Justice v. EEOC, which DFF filed with co-counsel NWLC, challenges the agency’s unlawful “Trans Exclusion Policy.” EEOC adopted a policy of rejecting certain discrimination charges, but only when brought by transgender workers. This policy violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fifth Amendment’s Equal Protection guarantee, the APA, and the Bostock v. Clayton County precedent. In Bostock, the Supreme Court held that Title VII’s prohibition against employment discrimination includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, confirming protections for LGBTQIA+ workers across the nation, rights that EEOC had recognized for nearly a decade.

Confronting Anti-DEIA Attacks in the Legal Profession

The administration has also targeted the legal profession, including through attacks on DEIA initiatives. Some law firms have capitulated to harmful executive overreach that undermines the rule of law and our democracy. Others have remained firm, defending democracy, DEIA, and the First Amendment, including at personal and professional risk. Jenner & Block, Perkins Coie, Susman Godfrey, and WilmerHale secured important victories in legal challenges to these actions. For example, in Perkins Coie v. U.S. Department of Justice, the court granted summary judgment to the firm, finding that the administration’s filings “reveal the true motivation lurking behind the façade of discrimination allegations: the administration’s disapproval of plaintiff’s speech in favor of diversity.” The court reaffirmed that “public statements supporting diversity” are protected under the First Amendment.

Another example of attacks on the legal profession involved then acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas sending letters in March 2025 to nearly two dozen law firms to intimidate them over their DEIA practices. The letters demanded that the firms turn over detailed personal data about their applicants and employees, some reaching back a decade. In response, a group of law students represented by DFF filed Doe 1 et al. v. EEOC, seeking to block the release of their sensitive information absent legally required confidentiality protections. Of note, during the litigation, EEOC submitted documents to the court indicating that law firms had not provided the requested data, and the agency considers the matter “closed.” The parties are awaiting a court ruling.

Similarly, the ABA has faced direct retaliation from this administration for its longstanding commitment to inclusion. DFF represented the ABA in challenging the DOJ’s abrupt cancellation of millions of dollars in congressionally appropriated grants that fund critical training and technical assistance for lawyers who serve survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault and the judges who hear those cases. The timing was no coincidence; just one day before the termination, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued his April 9, 2025, memo restricting DOJ employees from participating in ABA events, citing the ABA’s amicus brief in the SFFA case.

In ABA v. DOJ, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction restoring the canceled grants, finding that the ABA was likely to succeed on its claim that the DOJ’s actions were retaliatory and violated the ABA’s First Amendment rights. In another example of the administration backing down when under pressure, the DOJ declined to appeal, and the court has since administratively closed the case.

In response to these and other attacks, DFF organized a cross-ideological coalition of more than 4,000 lawyers and legal organizations in writing to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on April 2, 2025. The letter urged her to reject political interference and defend attorneys and law firms from retaliatory attacks. Many of these assaults, drawn directly from the Project 2025 playbook, are designed to instill fear and deter people from exercising their rights.

Courage Is Contagious

Meeting this moment has demanded courage, collaboration, and a renewed commitment to the rule of law. In response, DFF has created new initiatives to address the challenges of this time. For example, DFF has expanded its capacity to bring affirmative civil rights cases and deepen its strategic collaboration and coordination with its civil rights litigation partners.

Additionally, Democracy 2025, the strategic legal network supporting the entire pro-democracy community, housed at Democracy Forward and comprising over 650 member organizations, has been credited with coordinating the largest and most effective strategy against unlawful administrative action in modern history. This network gives the pro-democracy legal community opportunities to connect, coordinate, and provide resources and support to act as a force multiplier for partners defending civil rights protections and more. Together, these efforts contribute to the infrastructure needed to sustain the fight for democratic values.

The struggle for justice continues, and with it, the enduring strength of both our civil rights laws and the people they protect. DFF will keep fighting for the rule of law and equality for all. Our nation’s civil rights laws remain a living promise, one that endures even amid unprecedented threats. The courts have shown that when people rise together, justice can prevail. Every case filed, every injunction secured, and every client who refuses to yield reminds us that progress is never guaranteed; it is earned, defended, and renewed through our collective actions.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/istock/16x9/16x9-multi-tool-92903077.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 18:58:10.571586

Mikki P. Hatfield was the first of the protesters to plead guilty, but more are expected to take similar plea deals soon.

Former Spokane City Council President Ben Stuckart, Collin Muncey and Bobbi Silva are set for change of plea hearings early next week. The remaining five – Justice Forral, Erin Lang, Thalia Ramirez, Bajun Mavalwalla II and Jac Archer – are currently scheduled for trial in May.

A plea agreement gives Hatfield the opportunity in 18 months to withdraw the felony plea and instead plead guilty to a less serious misdemeanor charge of depredation of U.S. property if Hatfield abides by release conditions until June 2027.

Under the agreement, Hatfield would not be jailed, fined or serve probation. Nick Vieth, Hatfield’s attorney, said Hatfield would be subject to pay a portion of about $10,900 in restitution, which would be spread among the defendants.

Hatfield could be imprisoned if she violates her supervised release conditions. The maximum penalty for the felony charge is six years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

“Mikki’s looking forward to moving on,” Vieth said.

He said he expects most of the rest of the defendants to have a “similar approach” to resolve their cases.

The nine defendants were indicted in July for their alleged role in a demonstration against U.S. Immigration and Customs for detaining two legal asylum seekers at a routine immigration check-in. Stuckart, Forral, Lang and Ramirez were also cited in Spokane County District Court on suspicion of failing to disperse, but those charges were dismissed.

Federal prosecutors claim the nine defendants conspired to use force or threats against federal officers on June 11 to prevent them from transporting the two asylum seekers to a detainment center in Tacoma, and that two of them –Hatfield and Silva – assaulted a federal officer amid the chaos in downtown Spokane.

Hatfield and Silva were the only defendants not released from custody at their first court appearances in July because they are the only two accused of assaulting an officer. Instead, they were released a few days later.

Stuckart sparked the protest that swelled to hundreds of people that day by posting a call to action on Facebook after ICE agents detained the two men who had appeared at ICE offices for a check-in.

Archer posted on social media a call for others to come and join, noting the intent was to “risk arrest to block the exits to ICE,” according to the indictment.

The indictment alleges Stuckart blocked a transport bus carrying the two immigrants. Archer, Stuckart and others blocked the pathway and door to the transport bus despite orders to disperse, the indictment says.

Others blocked the bus, released air from the tires and painted the windshield of the bus, making it unsafe to drive, according to the indictment.

Silva is accused of striking a federal officer from behind as the officer tried to clear the pathway for transport vehicles to leave ICE’s local Spokane operations building at 411 W. Cataldo Ave.

Plea agreement documents indicate Hatfield and others picked up smoke canisters, which police deployed to control the hundreds of people in the crowd who had blocked the facility and roads, and threw them back at Spokane County Sheriff’s Office deputies and Spokane police officers. Prosecutors will move to dismiss the federal assault charge when Hatfield is sentenced.

Hatfield and others placed trash cans, sand/cement bags, benches, signs and other objects in front of the ingresses and egresses to block the exit, prosecutors say in the indictment.

The proposed rule change announced last month would prohibit civil arrests of people “attending a court proceeding or having legal business” in any of Michigan’s trial or appellate courthouses. The rule as written would not interfere with criminal or court-ordered arrests.

If adopted, the amendment would add Michigan to the list of states attempting to limit immigration arrests following court proceedings, which have ramped up in recent months as President Donald Trump’s administration cracks down on illegal immigration enforcement.

States don’t have jurisdiction over what happens in immigration courts, which are federal property, and cannot bar arrests there.

But advocates argue Michigan should join New York, Connecticut, Illinois and other states in limiting arrests in local courts, which they contend could deter immigrants from attending court hearings.

“It’s an issue that affects everyone when you have any part of the population that is afraid to come and participate in our court proceedings,” said Susan Reed, executive director of the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center.

The Trump administration has unsuccessfully challenged similar policies in other states as “sanctuary” measures that obstruct lawful arrests.

Why now?

It’s unclear how many arrests have been made in courthouses, though one analysis from mathematician Joseph Gunther identified 2,388 likely arrests in federal immigration courts nationwide between May and July 2025, including nine in Detroit.

Immigration arrests appear to be less common when a person with no criminal history heads to a local courthouse to pay traffic tickets or testify in a hearing, but not unheard of.

Reed and Loren Khogali, director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, first called on Michigan courts to change the rules around civil arrests in April after an incident outside Plymouth’s 35th District Court where a US citizen was mistakenly detained by federal immigration enforcement.

Immigration enforcement in courthouses violates longstanding Michigan law protecting litigants from civil arrests and has “the potential to seriously disrupt the fair and efficient functioning of our state courts,” the directors of both organizations wrote in an April 11 letter.

Even the possibility of ICE or border patrol agents at courthouses can be enough to deter people from showing up to court at all, Reed said. That can complicate prosecutors’ ability to secure witness testimony and potentially endanger people who would otherwise seek state court assistance on issues like child custody or domestic violence.

“A rule would definitely go a long way to address fear,” Reed said. “To simply make the state court a place where state matters are adjudicated and not address these federal civil immigration matters there, it’s really a practical response by the Supreme Court that we’re very supportive of.”

The case for courthouse enforcement

Guidelines introduced under former President Joe Biden limited immigration arrests in courthouses and other so-called “protected areas” like schools, hospitals and places of worship. Those rules were reversed in January on the first day of President Donald Trump’s second term.

The latest guidance instructs U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to pursue civil immigration enforcement in or around courthouses “when they have credible information that leads them to believe” a person of interest will be present at a specific location.

The guidance indicates civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses should take place in non-public areas of the facility where possible and be “conducted in collaboration with court security staff.”

Using courthouses as a venue for civil immigration enforcement can reduce safety risks for federal agents and the public, ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons wrote in a May 27 memo outlining the policy, because individuals entering courthouses are typically screened for weapons or other contraband by law enforcement before entering.

In October, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that it was on pace to deport 600,000 people by the end of Trump’s first year back in office, and as of Nov. 16, more than 65,000 people were being held in US detention facilities.

What other states are doing

Several states already had laws or policies on the books limiting civil arrests in local and state courts before Trump’s second term began, and officials in other Democratic-leaning states have more recently considered the change.

New York’s 2020 law — passed during Trump’s first term — has a similar framework to what Michigan is considering, only allowing federal agents who have a criminal warrant or an order from a judge to make arrests in state or local courthouses.

In filing the suit, Attorney General Pam Bondi had argued the New York law amounted to a “sanctuary” policy “to prevent illegal aliens from apprehension” that contradicted Trump’s January executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border with Mexico.

A federal judge last month dismissed a lawsuit from the Trump administration that argued New York’s policy was unconstitutional and prevented federal authorities from apprehending criminals.

Illinois lawmakers approved a ban on courthouse civil immigration arrests in October, also creating a pathway for residents to sue immigration agents who violate their constitutional rights.

In Connecticut, state lawmakers recently passed legislation barring law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings in court in addition to limits on civil immigration arrests.

What’s next in Michigan

The Michigan Supreme Court — where six of seven current justices were appointed or nominated by Democratic governors — is collecting written public comments on the proposal, which must be submitted by Dec. 22 to be considered.

Justice Brian Zahra, the court’s lone Republican nominee, would have declined to publish the proposal for comment, according to the court order announcing the possible change.

Court spokesperson John Nevin said the court plans to hold a public hearing before taking action, which “might be as proposed, something different, or nothing at all.”

Most of the nearly 500 comments posted as of Dec. 1 support the proposed amendment, citing concerns that people who are attempting to handle legal matters the appropriate way might be deterred from doing so by federal immigration authorities.

“I have seen firsthand how fear keeps people from showing up for hearings, filing important documents, or even reporting harm,” Michigan attorney Jeremy Orr wrote in comments to the court. “When people are too afraid to enter the courthouse, they lose access to justice and the entire system suffers.”

Several opponents of the change said state courts shouldn’t interfere with federal enforcement activity, arguing that immigration law should be followed both inside and outside of courthouses.

“I do not believe the courts should be in the business of making laws from the bench,” Victoria Muterspaugh wrote in a comment submission. “Come here legally or ICE will see you to the door.”

“There has to be a welcoming message of people feeling comfortable to come to the United States,” LaHood said.
Yet there have been very visceral reminders of how the administration’s immigration crackdown could interfere with World Cup events.
During the Club World Cup tournament this summer, Alex Lasry, the CEO of the New York/New Jersey World Cup host committee, noticed official government social media posts warning that federal immigration agents would be “suited and booted” at the matches.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will take center stage at Friday’s World Cup draw in Washington, rolling out the welcome mat for teams and fans from around the globe at a time when his administration is expanding restrictions on travel to the United States for people from 19 countries and he has hardened his rhetoric against immigrants.

The administration is betting that its push to expedite visa processing for visitors and the excitement about the matchups for next summer’s tournament — hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico — will outweigh concerns that Trump’s immigration messaging undercuts the theme of global unity that the World Cup is meant to represent.

In the past week, Trump has said he wants to permanently pause immigration from poor countries and he has singled out Afghans and Somalis for particular contempt. The Republican president is also overseeing the signing a peace agreement between Rwanda and Congo on Thursday at an event with leaders from a host of foreign countries and he is expected to be honored for his peacemaking efforts by FIFA, international soccer’s governing body, during the World Cup draw.

Critics say the dueling messages are jarring.

“The Cup is supposed to be a moment when the world comes together, puts aside the differences to celebrate sport, and while it symbolizes the world coming together, you have a president of the United States who is trying to keep the world out, to keep people out,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“Right there at the most fundamental level, you have a president who represents everything that the World Cup does not stand for,” Van Hollen said.

But Andrew Giuliani, the executive director of the White House FIFA task force, told foreign reporters Wednesday that “there is a fictional narrative out there that the president is not welcoming to foreigners to come into the United States” and he dismissed concerns about Trump’s rhetoric.

“He’s a New Yorker like me; sometimes we say things that are a little different than polished politicians say,” Giuliani said.

Some Iranian soccer officials were denied US entry

Trump’s administration is preparing to expand a travel ban enacted in June. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday that she plans to recommend a “full travel ban on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

The restrictions have ensnared two countries that have qualified for the quadrennial tournament — Iran and Haiti. The ban bars entry to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, and there are heightened restrictions for visitors from seven others.

The ban includes exceptions for World Cup athletes, coaches, “persons performing a necessary support role” and their immediate relatives. Fans, a major source of tourism revenue for any World Cup event, from those banned nations cannot enter.

Iran has said it will boycott the draw at the Kennedy Center after visas were denied to key members of its delegation. But its soccer federation says the coach, Amir Ghalenoei, will be there with one or two staff members to ensure Iran’s seat is not left vacant.

Federation spokesman Amir-Mahdi Alavi told YJC.ir, a news agency affiliated with Iran’s state TV, on Wednesday that Ghalenoei’s attendance was purely technical and did not amount to walking back the federation’s protest.

Alavi said in initially announcing the boycott that federation officials faced visa obstacles that went beyond sports considerations. The White House referred comment on the matter to the State Department, which said the administration is committed to supporting the World Cup while upholding U.S. law and ensuring national security and public safety.

“Part of the delegation got approved and part of the delegation did not get approved,” Giuliani said. “Every single decision is a national security decision.”

The visa denials came despite assurances earlier this year by Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president who has close ties to Trump and is a frequent White House visitor. In October, he told reporters at a European Football Clubs assembly in Rome that “there will be no issues with regard to visas obviously for the participating teams and delegations and so on. And we are working on something for fans, hopefully some good news will come out very soon.”

A World Cup balancing act

The White House has emphasized it is pouring resources to expedite visa processing elsewhere for fans coming to 48-nation tournament, with the majority of the matches held across 11 U.S. cities.

Rep. Darin LaHood, who has participated in multiple FIFA task force meetings at the White House this year and is one of Capitol Hill’s most avid soccer fans, pointed to shortened visa wait times as proof of the administration “wanting to make this work and wanting people to come here.”

“I think sports and the World Cup transcends politics,” said LaHood R-Ill. He said FIFA will be part of a new public relations campaign featuring soccer legends emphasizing the welcoming nature of the United States.

“There has to be a welcoming message of people feeling comfortable to come to the United States,” LaHood said. “I think you’ll start to see that after the draw and things are set.”

The State Department has deployed more than 400 additional consular officers to handle global visa demand, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that in about 80% of the world, travelers to the U.S. can get a visa appointment within 60 days. A new system, “FIFA Pass,” allows those who have purchased World Cup tickets through FIFA to get expedited visa appointments.

Yet there have been very visceral reminders of how the administration’s immigration crackdown could interfere with World Cup events.

During the Club World Cup tournament this summer, Alex Lasry, the CEO of the New York/New Jersey World Cup host committee, noticed official government social media posts warning that federal immigration agents would be “suited and booted” at the matches. Lasry recalled that he immediately flagged the issue to Giuliani, who assured him that the agents’ presence would be the same as at any other major event.

Asked on Wednesday about the possibility of immigration raids at World Cup matches, Giuliani told reporters that Trump “does not rule out anything that will help make American citizens safer.”

Disappointed fans from Haiti

Some fans are already confronting the reality that they will not be able to travel to the United States.

Rich André, the director of state and local initiatives at the American Immigration Council, is the son of immigrants from Haiti, a “soccer-crazed nation” that qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 50 years. He said many Haitians would love nothing more than to come to the U.S. for the World Cup, but likely will not get the chance.

“Certainly, they’re trying to create a carve-out here so the show can go on,” André said, pointing to the exemptions for athletes, coaches and others close to the team. “But the show doesn’t go on without the fans being able to come and cheer their team on in person.”

Amnesty International recommended that the U.S. government address systemic human rights violations within immigration detention facilities and urged Florida officials to close Alligator Alcatraz and to prohibit the use of any state-run immigration detention.","A report released Wednesday by Amnesty International alleges cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment at two immigration detention centers in Florida: The Everglades Detention Facility (“Alligator Alcatraz”) in eastern Collier County and the Krome North Service Processing Center (Krome) in Miami.

The report, Torture and enforced disappearances in the Sunshine State: Human rights violations at “Alligator Alcatraz” and Krome in Florida, lists human rights violations that, in some cases amount to torture, occurring at Krome and “Alligator Alcatraz” within what the report calls ""an increasingly hostile anti-immigrant climate in Florida under Governor Ron DeSantis.""

The report further said that the DeSantis administration has intensified criminalization and mass detention of migrants and people seeking safety.

The report's findings were gathered during a September 2025 research mission.

“These findings confirm a deliberate system built to punish, dehumanize, and hide the suffering of people in detention,” said Ana Piquer, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Americas. “Immigration enforcement cannot operate outside the rule of law or exempt itself from human rights standards. What we are seeing in Florida should alarm the entire region.”

According to information from the report posted on the Amnesty International website, research concluded that people arbitrarily detained in “Alligator Alcatraz” are living in inhuman and unsanitary conditions including overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping, limited access to showers, exposure to insects without protective measures, lights on 24 hours a day, poor quality food and water, and lack of privacy – including cameras above the toilets.

The report said that people interviewed shared that access to medical care is inconsistent, inadequate, or denied all together, placing individuals at serious risk of physical and mental harm. People reported being always shackled when they were outside their cage. Other treatment those detained have endured amounts to torture, including being put in the “box”, described as a 2×2 foot cage-like structure people are put in as punishment – sometimes for hours at a time exposed to the elements with hardly any water – with their hands and feet attached to restraints on the ground.

The report said “Alligator Alcatraz” operates outside federal oversight, without the basic tracking systems used in ICE facilities. The absence of registration or tracking mechanisms for those detained at Alligator Alcatraz facilitates incommunicado detention and constitutes enforced disappearances when the whereabouts of a person being detained there is denied to their family, and they are not allowed to contact their lawyer.

“These despicable and nauseating conditions at Alligator Alcatraz reflect a pattern of deliberate neglect designed to dehumanize and punish those detained there,” said Amy Fischer, Director of Refugee and Migrant Rights with Amnesty International USA. “This is unreal – where’s the oversight?”

The criticism of ICE's Krome detention center in Miami was equally severe. At Krome, operated by a private for-profit company, the report said research confirmed that despite having medical facilities on site, detained individuals reported serious medical negligence including failure to provide treatments and medical assessments. People detained at Krome confirmed previous reports of human rights violations. For example, there were reports of overcrowding, prolonged and arbitrary solitary confinement, lack of adequate medical care, overflowing toilets, lack of access to showers, constant illumination, and broken air conditioning.

In the report, people shared stories of violence and ill-treatment from guards. Amnesty International staffers witnessed a guard violently slam a metal flap of a door to a solitary confinement room against a man’s injured hand. Other people reported being hit and punched by guards. People also reported difficulty in accessing counsel, and not knowing how long they will be detained nor what will come next for them.

“Krome’s extreme overcrowding, medical neglect, and reports of humiliating and degrading treatment paint a picture of harrowing human right violations,” said Fischer.

Amnesty International recommended that the U.S. government address systemic human rights violations within immigration detention facilities and urged Florida officials to close Alligator Alcatraz and to prohibit the use of any state-run immigration detention.

“The conditions we documented at Alligator Alcatraz and Krome are not isolated – instead they represent a deliberate system of cruelty designed to punish people seeking to build a new life in the U.S.,” said Fischer. “We must stop detaining our immigrant community members and people seeking safety and instead work toward humane, rights-respecting migration policies.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e4d448/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x2948+0+398/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F92%2F6d%2Ffeff76d6435cb0190602515096ce%2Fap25184776559748.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 14:57:36.855186

(AP) — A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an immigrant rights group arguing that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrant detainees at the request of federal authorities.

The Wisconsin lawsuit comes as federal agents have launched high-profile immigration crackdowns in cities including Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Another operation is expected in the coming days in Minnesota, targeting Somali immigrants. The enforcement tactics have been met with protests and lawsuits.

A majority of justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court voted to take the ACLU case directly as an original action, rather than have it first work its way through lower courts. The court is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

Four justices, who were not named, voted to accept the case, while conservative Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who most often sides with conservative justices, wrote separately to discuss the process, but he did not reveal how he voted.

None of the justices discussed the merits of the case in the order agreeing to take it.

The court’s decision means there could be a final ruling in the case by the middle of 2026, far faster than if it first had to wind its way through lower courts. All briefs in the case are due within two months, and the court will set a date for oral argument sometime after that early next year.

The ACLU brought the lawsuit against five county sheriffs in September on behalf of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant rights group based in Milwaukee.

“This is a historic step toward ensuring that Wisconsin’s law protects all residents, not just those with power and privilege,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. “Honoring ICE detainers has subjected hardworking immigrants to unlawful arrests for far too long.”

The lawsuit contends that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrants on detainers sent by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to local sheriff’s offices. The lawsuit was filed against sheriffs in Walworth, Brown, Marathon, Kenosha and Sauk counties, all of which honor those requests.

Sam Hall, one of the attorneys for the sheriffs, said they were reviewing the court’s order and evaluating next steps.

“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement,” he said in an email.

The sheriffs had argued that because the lawsuit involves a complicated area of the law — federal immigration law and the relationship between federal and state and local law enforcement — the case was best “resolved and refined” by first going through the lower courts, rather than skipping directly to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Honoring an ICE detainer means the sheriff agrees to hold the person for 48 hours after they otherwise should have been released under state law. The goal of detainers is to give ICE agents more time to pick someone up if they are suspected of being in the country illegally.

The ACLU wants the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prohibit sheriffs from holding people on ICE detainers, which are based on administrative warrants. Holding someone for extra time must be authorized by a judicial warrant, in which a court determines there is probable cause to keep them longer, the ACLU argues in the lawsuit.

The ACLU argues that keeping the person in custody for that extra time constitutes an illegal new arrest. It is illegal because Wisconsin law does not allow officers to make civil arrests except in certain circumstances, none of which apply to immigration enforcement, the lawsuit argues.

In the first seven months of this year, ICE sent more than 700 requests to local jails across Wisconsin, asking them to hold someone 48 hours beyond when they were set to be released, the lawsuit contends.

Republicans in the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature support a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with ICE detainers. The measure passed the Assembly, and if the Senate approves the bill it would head to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who is likely to veto it.",https://kfiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/wisconsin-supreme-court.webp,N,,2025-12-04 18:58:32.098132

The administration has been getting rid of the people who decide if immigrants can stay or must go. They've been firing immigration judges throughout this year, and the ones fired over the past week or so are different than the rest. NPR immigration policy reporter Ximena Bustillo is covering this. Ximena, good morning.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hi, Steve.

INSKEEP: What happened here?

BUSTILLO: Well, just before Thanksgiving, seven judges out of San Francisco, New York and Boston received a very short email. It's a generic email that says the attorney general has decided their time with the agency was over. Then on Monday, at least seven more judges, all out of New York, got that email, too.

INSKEEP: OK. And we should note, these are people who work part of the administration, not the judicial branch. That's why the attorney general will get rid of them. But we said these are distinct or different. How are these people different?

BUSTILLO: Right. These were more experienced judges. The administration has so far fired about 90 of these judges, and most of them were at the end of their two-year probationary period. This round, we identified 13 who had all been at the agency for longer than two years. Targeting tenured judges expands the scope of who could be let go, as the administration really looks to reshape these courts. As you mentioned, immigration judges are more like other federal workers. These courts within the Justice Department and under the direction of the president, ultimately, not the judicial branch of government.

INSKEEP: Well, why would the administration fire more experienced judges?

BUSTILLO: You know, it's hard to say. This administration has essentially been doing two things. First, it's put pressure on judges to move faster through a backlog of cases. There are currently nearly 4 million cases waiting for decisions in immigration courts. But the White House has also said that there has been a, quote, ""lack of integrity"" in the immigration court system. The implication here is that immigration judges have been biased in favor of immigrants but fired immigration judges have told me that they don't see it that way. Here's Jeremiah Johnson, who was fired in San Francisco recently.

JEREMIAH JOHNSON: I wasn't worried about my backlog. I wasn't worried about the crushing load that we found ourselves in at the end. I put that aside in every case I came in and I heard, and I took the time needed for each case to get it right.

BUSTILLO: Johnson and many others said that they did not get told specifically why they were terminated.

INSKEEP: Ximena, if you were here, you would have seen my mouth hanging open when you said there are 4 million cases waiting for resolutions. Is the administration doing anything to bring on more judges to do that job?

BUSTILLO: They have authorized the use of 600 military lawyers as temporary immigration judges. As a part of the move, the White House scrapped the requirement that these temporary judges should have immigration law experience. Some Democrats on the Hill, led by California Senator Adam Schiff, want to prevent that and have introduced a bill to make it harder to use people without immigration experience as temporary judges. There are currently 25 military lawyers serving in these roles. The problem, critics say, isn't that their background is military law. It's that they have to digest hugely complex immigration law in a matter of weeks and then make these huge decisions affecting immigrants' lives. Here's Emmett Soper, who was with the agency for 20 years before being fired this year.

EMMETT SOPER: It's not something that you pick up right away. And with all of these judges, many of whom are very experienced, being fired, the agency is losing something that it will take a long time to get back if they ever can.

INSKEEP: I'm remembering last year, Congress tried to hire more judges, and Republicans sank that on the orders the dictation of President Trump. So has the agency tried anything else to just hire more regular judges?

BUSTILLO: The Justice Department has launched a campaign to hire what it is calling, quote, ""deportation judges."" They did get a lot of money from Congress in order to do that this year, and the hiring campaign offers a pay recruitment incentive for those to work in courts out of New York, California and Massachusetts. Our reporting shows those locations have been particularly hit hard by the firings.

INSKEEP: NPR's Ximena Bustillo. Thanks so much.

BUSTILLO: Thank you.

If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.
Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in a CBS News interview on Monday.","Washington — Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved more than one strike, including one that killed survivors of the initial attack.

The Washington Post first reported the follow-up strike last week. The Post quoted an anonymous source as saying that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to ""kill everybody"" in the Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea, though Hegseth has denied this. He told reporters Tuesday that he did not see survivors in the live video he viewed and was not in the room when Navy Adm. Frank ""Mitch"" Bradley, the commander overseeing the operation, ordered a second strike. Bradley, according to the Post's report, was complying with Hegseth's directive as two survivors clung to the wreckage.

Two people who survived the strike on the alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News. The source said the survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs and appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and also alleged there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up. ABC News was first to report these details. A U.S. official told CBS News that a total of four missiles were used in the attack.

Bradley, the commander of Special Operations Command, briefed a small group of lawmakers on the strikes on Thursday. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the classified briefing that Bradley said ""there had not been a 'kill them all' order, and that there was not an order to grant no quarter.""

But Himes added that the lawmakers were shown video of the second strike, and said that ""what I saw in that room one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.""

""You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States,"" he said.

The Trump administration confirmed earlier this week the second strike was ordered by Bradley. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said the military official was ""worked well within his authority and the law … to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat of narco-terrorists to the United States was completely eliminated."" Hegseth authorized Bradley to conduct the strikes, Leavitt said, though she denied that the defense secretary had given the order to kill them all.

President Trump said Sunday he ""wouldn't have wanted"" the second strike and added that Hegseth had told him ""he did not order the death of those two men."" Mr. Trump made similar comments on Tuesday, telling reporters that he did not have all the information about the second strike.

Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.

Analysis from The Free Press: Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime

Members of Congress — mostly Democrats — were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The Post's report has further fueled debate about whether the U.S. is committing war crimes.

In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an ""armed attack"" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.

""We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,"" Mr. Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. ""They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.""

But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an ""expeditious declassification"" of the legal opinion in a letter last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

""Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,"" they wrote. ""We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.""

Consent from Congress

Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.

Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress ""in every possible instance"" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.

In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.

The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.

When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution ""has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.""

The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels ""at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel."" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as ""hostilities.""

Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.

But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.

""Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,"" says former military prosecutor

The Trump administration's claim of a ""non-international armed conflict"" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.

""There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,"" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.

Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.

""They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,"" Finucane said.

Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.

""There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,"" Hansen said.

Trump ""wants it both ways,"" expert says

The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an ""armed conflict"" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.

If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the alleged intentional killing of defenseless survivors may have.

The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be ""collected and cared for.""

The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, ""it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter."" The rule applies ""during non-international armed conflict.""

""The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,"" Hansen said.

Still, a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, the Post reported.

Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin — Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.

The second strike and what laws may have been broken

There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that allegedly killed two survivors is a war crime.

Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday that it would be ""an illegal act"" that is ""completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.""

""I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,"" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.

Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.

""If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,"" Hansen said. ""So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody — even if you think they're a criminal — without adjudication.""

""Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,"" Hansen added. ""Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.""

Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.

""Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,"" he said.

If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.

""Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,"" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. ""In short, they are war crimes.""

Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in a CBS News interview on Monday.

""The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.""

In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has ""only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean."" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that ""it's hard to find boats to strike right now.""

""Deterrence has to matter,"" he said. ""Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/14/4fbbf4e2-f152-4f96-8537-504640b41b06/thumbnail/1200x630/5641fae25c23e7c36b6ab278ca912597/boat-strike.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:57:34.583067

Immigration agents are targeting as many as 500 Somalis illegally in the city, which is home to the US’ largest population from the war-torn East African nation, estimated at over 80,000, according to several reports.

The operation follows the stunning revelation that scammers in the Somali migrant community have engaged in massive fraud — costing Minnesota taxpayers some $1 billion — which happened right under the nose of Gov. Tim Walz, according to the state’s Department of Human Services.

President Trump slammed Somali illegal immigrants during a White House cabinet meeting Tuesday, saying, “I don’t want them in our country,” and adding that Somalia, one of the poorest countries on the planet, “stinks.”

He also slammed US Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — who was born in Somalia — as “garbage.”

At the same meeting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed that half of all visa holders in the state had engaged in some form of immigration fraud, which was determined after US Citizenship and Immigration Services visited 1,000 immigrant households over a two-week period.

“Officers encountered blatant marriage fraud, visa overstay, people claiming to work at businesses that can’t be found, forged documents, abuse of the H1B visa system, abuse of the F1 visa, and many other discrepancies,” USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow told reporters after the operation concluded.

Wednesday’s enforcement operation was decried as “kidnapping” by local officials, who stoked animosity and fear in immigration agents were targeting Somalis for no reason other than their nationality.

Failed Minneapolis mayoral candidate and Somali immigrant Omar Fateh warned on X ahead of Wednesday’s enforcement operation that ICE has been “abducting our neighbors from the streets and homes.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara urged residents to call 911 if they see ICE agents “kidnapping” people during the immigration sweep at a press conference Tuesday.

At the same press conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey accused immigration agents of being prone to “mistakes,” and said “American citizens will be detained” in the operation.

Walz condemned the enforcement action as a “PR stunt,” and claimed ICE would “indiscriminately target Americans.”

The Department of Homeland Security insisted the operation was not targeting specific communities with its latest raids, which as of Tuesday expanded to include a stepped-up presence of ICE agents in New Orleans.

“Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country. What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally. We do not discuss future or potential operations,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday as the operation reportedly got underway.

Meanwhile, DHS launched an “enhanced” enforcement blitz in New Orleans Wednesday in an operation dubbed “Operation Catahoula Crunch” led by Border Patrol and executed in coordination with the FBI and Louisiana State Police.

Some 250 border agents were deployed, according to several reports, with the goal of arresting 5,000 people in Louisiana and Mississippi.

In a press release announcing the operation, DHS said it was “targeting criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies that force local authorities to ignore US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest detainers.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/2025-us-department-homeland-security-116652634.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-04 14:57:41.058283

“As a nation, we know in our hearts that we can and should do better.
As Christians, we must,” said Bishop Michael W. Fisher of Buffalo, New York.
“In terms that the merest of children can understand, Jesus details what it means to be a faithful follower and the reward which awaits those concerned with the well-being of others,” wrote Bishop Fisher.
Advent, during which “our hearts and minds are filled with expectation of the One who comes to us disguised as a vulnerable child from a distant place,” prompts renewed reflection on “our obligations to ‘the stranger’ among us,” said Bishop Fisher.","A New York state bishop has echoed a recent call from the nation’s Catholic bishops to respect God-given human dignity, regardless of immigration status.

“As a nation, we know in our hearts that we can and should do better. As Christians, we must,” said Bishop Michael W. Fisher of Buffalo, New York.

The bishop publicly released his pastoral letter “Once Aliens, Too” Dec. 1, having shared it with clergy Nov. 28 ahead of the first Sunday of Advent.

Addressing clergy, he also acknowledged the “horrible tragedy” of the Nov. 26 shootings of two West Virginia National Guard members on duty in Washington – an attack that killed one and critically wounded the other – by a suspect who is an immigrant from Afghanistan.

Bishop Fisher’s letter – drawing extensively on Scripture, multiple papal documents and Catholic social teaching – joins a growing chorus of statements and messages stressing the need to uphold human rights amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on unauthorized immigration, which has included sweeping enforcement raids and third-country deportations.

As of Nov. 16, more than 65,000 individuals are in ICE custody, with 73.6 percent of those detained having no criminal conviction. Many of those with convictions were responsible for minor offenses such as traffic violations, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops approved a special pastoral message on immigration Nov. 12 amid their annual fall meeting in Baltimore, with the Catholic bishops of New York state releasing a separate message Nov. 13 entitled “For You Too Were Once Aliens,” a title referencing the divine command in Leviticus 19:33-34 to care for the alien and the stranger.

Bishop Fisher’s pastoral letter, along with the USCCB and New York State Catholic Conference messages, all point to Catholic social teaching on immigration, which balances three interrelated principles – the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation’s duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

Bishop Fisher noted in his letter that he sought to offer “some personal perspective” on the recent USCCB message, which condemned the “indiscriminate mass deportation of people” and the “dehumanizing rhetoric and violence” against immigrants, while describing condemnation of law enforcement officers acting within their proper authority as “unacceptable.”

He began by quoting from the 25th chapter of Matthew’s Gospel, in which Christ judges the nations based on their works of kindness and mercy.

“In terms that the merest of children can understand, Jesus details what it means to be a faithful follower and the reward which awaits those concerned with the well-being of others,” wrote Bishop Fisher. “In demonstrating love and care for the most vulnerable – and compassion toward society’s outcasts – we serve Christ Himself.”

While “the bishops are under no illusions about the complexities involved with reforming our nation’s immigration system,” and “fully accept” that the government has a duty to secure the nation’s borders, “the requirement to act with charity toward friend and stranger alike, however, takes precedence over all other imperatives,” said Bishop Fisher.

He said that Catholic social teaching – which articulates the living out of holiness while building a just society – “begins with the premise that every person, regardless of nationality or legal status, possesses inviolable dignity and fundamental rights.”

Bishop Fisher cited Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 encyclical “Rerum Novarum” as a “foundational teaching on the inherent rights of the working class,” one “which also asserts the right of people to migrate, particularly when deprived of the dignity of having access to life’s basic necessities.”

Quoting the encyclical, Bishop Fisher said that Pope Leo XIII directly condemned “the ideas of the totalitarian and the imperialistic state, as well as that of exaggerated nationalism.”

The bishop also cited Pope Pius XII’s 1952 encyclical, “Exsul Familia Nazarethana,” which he said, “evoked the Holy Family’s exile in Egypt as a model for all refugee families, as well as the Church’s duty to care for migrants, regardless of the reasons for their displacement.”

Quoting Pope Pius XII – who warned of the dire consequences of neglecting migrants’ spiritual and material needs – Bishop Fisher added, “There never has been a period during which the Church has not been active in behalf of migrants, exiles and refugees.”

“Catholics are to regard migrants not as strangers but as true brothers and sisters,” he said.

The bishop said St. John Paul II had “further amplified” that requirement, stating in his 1996 message for World Migration Day that “for Christians, the migrant is not merely an individual to be respected in accordance with the norms established by law, but a person whose presence challenges them and whose needs become an obligation for their responsibility.”

Pope Francis had “issued a rebuke and call to action” in the 2020 encyclical “Fratelli Tutti,” which “made clear that the moral stature of a society is measured by how it treats the vulnerable,” said Bishop Fisher.

Pope Leo XIV has carried that message forward, with his first apostolic exhortation, “Dilexi Te” recalling “the long history of the Church’s requirement to show preference for the poor and demonstrate compassion toward immigrants,” said Bishop Fisher.

Advent, during which “our hearts and minds are filled with expectation of the One who comes to us disguised as a vulnerable child from a distant place,” prompts renewed reflection on “our obligations to ‘the stranger’ among us,” said Bishop Fisher.

“Mindful that our ancestors were also ‘once aliens’ in need of compassion, care, and opportunity, we must speak out for those who desire only the same,” he wrote.",https://cathstan-1f209.kxcdn.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/1204buffalo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 12:59:14.968131

The Polish managing authority and intermediate institutions of European funds responded quickly. Due to the risk of losing EU funds, some of these discriminatory resolutions were repealed shortly after enactment. These swift reactions indicate that, at least in part, some lessons have been learned from the previous involvement of local governments in discriminatory engagement of creating the so-called LGBT-free zones – where it took nearly six years of discrimination until the last free-zone was repealed only this year. Hence, despite all the big talk about alleged traditions, culture, and other safety concerns, it seems that when money talks, discrimination walks.

Local governments against the Migration Pact and refugee relocation

In March 2025, far-right activists and populist opposition party Law and Justice (PiS), which was in power between 2015 and 2023, drew on anti-immigrant sentiments and organized anti-immigration protests at the Polish-German border to stop alleged migrant deportations to Poland. The anti-immigration rhetoric was something that PiS politicians were using very effectively while in power.

Following these protests, some local governments in Poland started to adopt the resolutions against the Pact on Migration and Asylum. Opposition to the Migration and Asylum Pact is primarily related to the solidarity contributions specified therein, especially to relocation of migrants.

Some resolutions contain explicit discriminatory statements. In this context, it is worth mentioning the Resolution of April 29, 2025, adopted by Tarnogórki County, which justified opposition to the relocation of “illegal immigrants” under the Pact on Migration and Asylum in the following, discriminatory manner:

“We want to make it clear that our concerns do not come from any prejudice against foreigners in general, but are based solely on media reports about the behavior of illegal immigrants in other Western European countries. In these countries, residents are afraid to go out after dark, women are afraid to be in public places, children are afraid to play in playgrounds, and police are hesitant to intervene in many neighbourhoods settled by immigrants. The overrepresentation of illegal immigrants, especially from Africa and the Middle East, in crimes of a sexual nature, against life and health – including those involving dangerous tools – is very concerning. Most of these individuals show little interest in gaining employment or in respecting the laws, traditions, and culture of their host countries, and their presence only adds to the financial burden on those countries.”

Concerningly, resolutions opposing the Pact on Migration and Asylum were not adopted only by local governments, where most local assembly members come from populist right-wing parties. Instead, these resolutions also come from local governments with assembly members affiliated with liberal parties or local movements linked to the current liberal government. In these cases, the motion to adopt a resolution was most often submitted by residents inspired by populist parties. To avoid rejecting residents’ demands, the wording of these resolutions was amended to include support for government policy. The city of Białystok serves as a good example. In a Resolution of September 29, 2025, the city council, in addition to expressing support for the government’s policy, stated:

“The City Council of Białystok strongly opposes the forced relocation of illegal immigrants to our city and advocates for full respect for Poland’s right to decide on its own migration policy in the spirit of national solidarity and the safety of its residents.”

To complete the picture: these resolutions are not legally binding according to Polish law. They reflect the stance of a specific local government community. The government may or may not consider these positions. Hence, despite their lack of legal power, the main impact of these resolutions is to strengthen discriminatory and xenophobic views in Polish society towards migrants. These attitudes can lead to very real and serious consequences.

In addition, apart from the non-binding resolutions, the actual relocation of migrants to Poland is currently more of a political fiction due to the following two reasons. First, the government strongly opposes it. Second, on November 11, the European Commission published its first European Annual Asylum and Migration Report under the Pact on Migration and Asylum. The Commission classified Poland as a country “at risk of migratory pressure.” As a result, Poland will gain access to operational and financial support but will not be exempt from solidarity contributions. Hence, at least in the coming year, one cannot expect even an attempt to relocate migrants to Poland.

A change that (did not) happen

To better understand the phenomenon of anti-migration local government resolutions, it is worth outlining the current political and legal landscape in Poland. In 2023, a major shift took place in Polish politics. The populists who had been in power for eight years lost their parliamentary majority and their ability to form a government. While there are more differences than similarities between populists and the new democratic majority, some factors make the power transition hard to discern. This is especially true concerning migration, particularly across the Polish-Belarusian border.

Arguably the most notable example of this was the Polish government’s decision in February 2025 to suspend the right to asylum. The parliamentary majority, working with the populist President, passed a law allowing the government to suspend this right. The day after the President signed this law, the Polish Council of Ministers issued a decree suspending the right to apply for international protection at the border with the Republic of Belarus.

The new democratic majority did not halt the criminalization of humanitarian aid provided to migrants. A high-profile trial of the so-called Hajnówka Five serves as a good example. This group provided humanitarian assistance to people from the Middle East who had crossed the border irregularly. They were charged with “assistance in the illegal stay of foreigners,” facing up to 5 years in prison. In September 2025, the first-instance court found them not guilty of enabling illegal presence in Poland. However, the public prosecutor’s office announced it would appeal. The media covered the case, and several non-governmental organizations participated as parties. Despite public pressure, the prosecutor did not withdraw the charges. In this context, it is worth noting that the Prosecutor General, who can issue orders to any prosecutor, is linked in the Polish legal system to the function of the Minister of Justice. Therefore, if the government had been willing to close this case, one could have expected a reaction from the Prosecutor General. However, this did not happen, which indicates that there was no such willingness.

Given these actions, it is not surprising that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was one of the signatories of the controversial open letter from nine European governments to the European Court of Human Rights. In this letter, European leaders called for a new and open-minded discussion about interpreting the European Convention on Human Rights regarding “irregular migration” and the possibility to “expel criminal foreign nationals”.

Lessons learned

In April 2025, when the first anti-immigrant resolutions were adopted, the last resolution establishing the so-called LGBT-free zones in Poland was repealed. This marked the end of nearly six years of discrimination against the LGBT community. Many actors contributed to the repeal of these resolutions, with the European Union playing a significant role through financial pressure related to the risk of losing EU funding.

The pressure is now further reinforced by Regulation (EU) 2021/1060 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 24, 2021. Under this Regulation, Article 9 requires that Member States and the Commission ensure respect for fundamental rights and compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in implementing the funds. That contributed to some of the resolutions being repealed shortly after their adoption.

This was the case, for example, in Szczecin, which in the Resolution of June 17, 2025, claimed i.a.:

“The City Council fully endorses the actions of the Coalition Government on October 15 and Prime Minister Donald Tusk, which clearly and unequivocally oppose the idea of relocating illegal immigrants who have arrived in other European Union countries to Poland, including Szczecin.”

Following pressure from the Polish intermediate institution of European funds (Centrum Unijnych Projektów Transportowych), i.e. one of the authorities responsible for the administration of European funds in Poland, the Szczecin City Council repealed this resolution on October 18, 2025.

The same was true for the city of Bielsko-Biała, which adopted a Resolution on August 28, 2025, objecting to any relocation of immigrants to the city. Bielsko-Biała repealed its resolution shortly afterward, on October 8, 2025.

Law versus politics

When comparing reactions to resolutions opposing LGBT ideology and migration, the latter received a much quicker response. The experience of institutions managing EU funds proved effective. In debates within local government councils, the primary – if not the only – argument against them was the fear of losing funding for projects, often worth millions of euros. The same argument regarding the risk of losing funds was crucial for the Provincial Administrative Court in Wrocław. At the request of the provincial governor (the government representative in the local government), on 30 October 2025, case ref. IV SA/Wr 521/25, the Court issued an interim measure to suspend the enforcement of a Resolution adopted by the city of Jawor on May 22, 2025.",https://verfassungsblog.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/feature_vb.png,N,,2025-12-04 12:59:20.242775

Federal law has long prohibited undocumented immigrants from obtaining comprehensive coverage through Medicaid, Medicare, or Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.2 Yet, President Trump and Congressional allies attempted to reduce any substantive debate over the future of ACA Marketplace premium subsidies and $840 billion in Medicaid cuts (these cuts could lead to more than 14 million Americans becoming uninsured) to misleading rhetoric that their political opponents shut down the government to fund health care for undocumented immigrants.

The reality is that coverage options for undocumented immigrants are and will remain limited for the foreseeable future. Some are able to obtain private insurance, and a limited number of cities or states use nonfederal funds to offer coverage. Nevertheless, compared with US citizens, undocumented immigrants are more than 4 times more likely to be uninsured and less than two-thirds as likely to use health care services.1 Immigrants in the US are an extremely heterogeneous population in terms of country of origin, languages spoken, and socioeconomic status, and also in terms of legal status and program eligibility. In this context, a deeper understanding of how different immigrant groups do or do not interact with the health care system is necessary.

Emergency Medicaid

Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for federally funded coverage and instead rely on a patchwork of safety net providers, limited state and local programs, and care they can afford to pay for themselves. One of the only avenues through which federal funds can be used to cover some services for undocumented immigrants is emergency Medicaid, which pays for limited emergency care for individuals with serious medical conditions who would be eligible for Medicaid if not for their immigration status. Emergency Medicaid is not comprehensive insurance and it is often described as financial protection for hospitals because they are required under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to provide emergency treatment to all patients seeking care.

In July 2025, Trump signed the budget reconciliation law (often called the One Big Beautiful Big Act). This law reduces the federal share for emergency Medicaid from 90% to each state’s traditional match rate (roughly 50%-72%, depending on the state) for people who, apart from their immigration status, would qualify for Medicaid under ACA expansion. On this basis, Trump and Congressional allies have argued that Democrats’ calls to reverse the budget reconciliation law’s Medicaid cuts seek to provide free health care for “illegal aliens.” However, recent research shows that emergency Medicaid only represents roughly 0.4% of Medicaid spending at an annual cost of less than $10 per US resident.3 Given that the budget reconciliation law’s estimated cuts (of $840 billion) to Medicaid will overwhelmingly affect US citizens (who comprise >90% of the program’s enrollees), arguments that appear to equate the law’s Medicaid cuts with spending for undocumented immigrants are largely a red herring.

Cutting Coverage for Legal Immigrants

Although national debates about federal health care spending have predominantly focused on undocumented immigrants, even larger changes are looming for many lawfully present immigrants. First, the budget reconciliation law strips Medicaid eligibility from refugees and asylees, overturning decades of policy established in the Refugee Act of 1979. Defined as persons legally admitted to the US “because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” many refugees and asylees have traditionally relied on Medicaid as a key source of support while they attempt to rebuild their lives. Now, in a change that provides only modest budget savings, many refugees and asylees (including children) face the challenge of building new lives in the US without health care coverage. The Trump administration also has curtailed a related program, Refugee Medical Assistance. Together, these changes will affect millions of legal immigrants. Roughly 50 000 asylees and 100 000 refugees have been admitted annually to the US in recent years in addition to the millions of refugees and asylees from previous years.

The budget reconciliation law also partially repeals an underappreciated aspect of the ACA that boosted coverage rates for legal immigrants. Previously, lawful permanent residents (LPRs) who met certain income criteria could receive premium tax credits to purchase insurance on ACA Marketplaces, offering coverage during the 5-year waiting period required for LPRs to become eligible for Medicaid. This policy was effective at increasing coverage among lower- and middle-income legal residents,4 and likely played a significant role in the elimination of coverage disparities among Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups.5 However, under the budget reconciliation law, LPRs with incomes below 100% of the federal poverty level will no longer be eligible for premium tax credits.

The Trump administration also eliminated coverage options for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, who had been considered lawful immigrants and were eligible to receive subsidized ACA Marketplace coverage under a Biden-era policy. That policy has since been reversed, meaning an estimated 100 000 young adults (who have lived most of their lives in the US and identify as Americans) could lose coverage. These changes represent not only a rollback of health care access but also a symbolic withdrawal of the nation’s recognition of their belonging.

Last, the Medicaid work requirements from the budget reconciliation law will affect many legal immigrants and their families. Starting in 2027, work requirements are expected to lead to coverage losses for millions of beneficiaries who should still be eligible but will struggle with administrative burdens to prove eligibility or exempt status. These losses will mostly affect US citizens, who represent most of Medicaid’s participants. But for legal immigrants who still qualify for Medicaid, such bureaucratic obstacles may loom larger due to language barriers and likelihood of employment in jobs lacking adequate documentation to meet reporting requirements.

The Broader Pattern

The Trump administration and Congressional allies have conflated major cutbacks in health care access for legal immigrants and US citizens with the very small emergency Medicaid savings included in the budget reconciliation law. Some officials have gone further and argued that any Medicaid funds going to states could be repurposed to care for undocumented immigrants, thus justifying broad Medicaid cuts. But this logic implausibly suggests that any federal funding, even for example, highway funding, should be halted to prevent potential redirection to care for undocumented immigrants. Other policymakers have simply equated health care for any noncitizens (including millions of LPRs, refugees, and asylees) as health care for “illegal aliens,” scapegoating a population that is already legally excluded from most federal programs.

Short-term debate on the government shutdown and longer-term questions of Medicaid and ACA Marketplace eligibility do not exist in a vacuum. The rhetoric used by proponents of the budget reconciliation law’s sweeping health care cuts has been employed to justify assaults on the basic rights of all immigrants (documented and undocumented) to obtain health care. State and federal policymakers have broken a decades-old precedent that health care records should not be used for immigration enforcement, fundamentally eroding the clinician-patient relationship.6,7 Recent changes by the Trump administration now prohibit Federally Qualified Health Centers from using federal funding to care for undocumented immigrants, eliminating a long-standing source of health care for immigrant communities. Families who rely on Medicaid do not neatly fall into a single category of legal status. Many immigrant parents who will have to navigate these challenges have US-born citizen children; spouses and siblings may also differ in their legal status, yet all will be at increased risk of losing access to care. Clinicians, patients, and advocates must be aware of this shifting landscape.

Defenders of these policies seek to persuade the public that these health care cuts are primarily about saving taxpayer dollars spent on undocumented immigrants, but the reality is far more sweeping in scope, placing millions of legal immigrants, US citizens, and their families in harm’s way.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/images/logos/JAMA Health Forum.png,N,,2025-12-04 12:59:07.499832

The word “protection” is in the title and calls into service the National Guard to “under 10 U.S.C.","Is the Whiskey Rebellion good precedent from the founding for President Trump’s attempt to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago? In this slew of cases, the most detailed judicial discussion of this late 18th century history appears in Judge Ryan Nelson’s concurrence in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit’s Oregon v. Trump, which upheld Trump’s federalization of the Oregon National Guard. The concurrence argues that deference by the Ninth Circuit to the president’s decision to federalize the national guard in Portland is “bolstered by the history and tradition of the early Militia Acts.” Nelson says modern statute § 12406 “carr[ies] the old soil with it” of the militia acts and its use in the Whiskey and Fries’s Rebellions. And in a more recent decision on the Portland deployment, the district court judge also invoked the Whiskey Rebellion.

In the three pending domestic-deployment cases—including the appeal on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket and the en banc appeal of Oregon v. Trump, in which Judge Nelson concurred—the courts should not repeat Nelson’s historical inaccuracies. The Whiskey Rebellion, as carried out under the 1792 Militia Act, is poor precedent for broad, unreviewable presidential power over domestic deployments for four reasons: (a) The Whiskey Rebellion adhered to a norm of deploying the militia only as a last resort; (b) the original law was hedged with multiple guardrails missing from the statute at issue today; (c) the protective power doctrine played no role in the militia’s deployment, nor was it even invoked as a possible legal authority; and (d) the 1792 Militia Act is not the parent statute for 10 U.S.C. § 12406, which descends from the Dick Act. Nelson grounds his opinion in the “old soil” of the 1792 Militia Act, but he fails to contend with the rocks and roots that once constrained unilateral presidential deployments.

The Whiskey Rebellion in the Portland Court Decisions

Judge Nelson asserts that the Whiskey Rebellion supports deference to the president’s determinations under the statute. To federalize the National Guard, the president has invoked 10 U.S.C. § 12406, specifically the provisions that permit federalization if “there is a rebellion or danger of rebellion” or the “President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” In a separate case, also about the Oregon deployment, District Court Judge Karin J. Immergut also reaches back to the first Militia Act passed in 1792 to interpret terms such as “unable” and “rebellion.” She argues that when “employing a term of art obviously translated from another source,” the old meaning carries over to the new statute. Since § 12406 is a modern iteration or continuation of the 1792 statute, Immergut quotes from precedent that the current statute “brings the old soil with it.” Whether Immergut’s interpretation accurately captures the relationship between the two statutes is questionable, but understanding her logic is necessary to distinguish it from Nelson’s broader claim.

Judge Nelson also invokes the 1792 Militia Act and the idea of “bringing the old soil with it,” not to interpret the statute’s triggers such as “rebellion” but, rather, to support the idea of deference. In Newsom v. Trump, about the deployment of the military to Los Angeles, the Ninth Circuit’s majority opinion asserted and set the precedent that it must grant “a great level of deference to the President.” Nelson’s concurrence goes further. He argues that “when the President acts within the bounds of this historical tradition, it provides near irrefutable evidence of good faith lawful action. Indeed, it would satisfy an even less deferential standard to the President than the standard adopted in Newsom.” He then cites the Whiskey Rebellion as confirmation that such deference is warranted.

The Whiskey Rebellion

The Whiskey Rebellion was “the single largest example of armed resistance to a law of the United States between the ratification of the Constitution and the Civil War,” according to one of the leading historians of the event. In 1791, under then-Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton’s guidance, Congress enacted the new republic’s first broad federal tax on the production of a consumer good, specifically on distilled spirits like whiskey, to help finance the national debt. Resistance quickly coalesced in the backcountry of southwestern Pennsylvania (today’s Allegheny, Washington, Fayette, and Westmoreland counties). Violence began almost immediately: Mobs tarred and feathered federal excise collectors in 1791. Protesters also burned the inns in which excise officers were housed.

In the summer of 1794, the crisis escalated dramatically when the county’s district attorney obtained scores of writs summoning unregistered distillers to appear in federal court at Philadelphia. The service of warrants to unregistered distillers touched off armed attacks on the chief inspector’s mansion, culminating in a two-day shootout with multiple fatalities and the burning of the house. Insurgents then stopped the U.S. mail to identify opponents, mustered thousands in militia formation, and marched into Pittsburgh while threatening to burn down this “Sodom” unless leading officials of the whiskey tax were banished. They hoisted a new flag, invoked Robespierre, and even aired schemes for an independent western commonwealth.

Last-Resort Norm

Judge Nelson argues that the court must defer “when the President acts within the bounds of this historical tradition” of the Whiskey Rebellion. A key part of that tradition was that the militia should be used only as a last resort. Since President Trump is not adhering to that norm, the judiciary has no obligation to give him the benefit of the doubt.

Upon learning of a meeting in which a town had pledged to oppose the law through legal means, Hamilton, then serving as secretary of the treasury, advised the attorney general to press charges and then perhaps deploy the militia. Among the president’s advisers, Hamilton was the one most supportive of deploying the militia to enforce the tax he had designed. Yet even Hamilton paid at least lip service to the last-resort norm. In his letter to the attorney general, Hamilton wrote that “if the processes of the Courts are resisted, as is rather to be expected,” the government should “employ those means, which in the last resort are put in the power of the Executive.” According to Hamilton, this militia deployment, then, must occur only if the courts have failed and, even then, only as a “last resort.”

Rather than prosecute, Washington issued an informal proclamation in which he “most earnestly admonish[ed] and exhort[ed]” the protesters to “desist” from obstructing the operation of the laws. Hamilton had written the initial draft of the proclamation and had included a passage threatening to deploy the militia, but, on the advice of the attorney general that such a “charge to the military would inflame the country,” Washington removed any mention of the militia. At this stage, even the mere threat of military force was premature for Washington. Two days after issuing the proclamation, Washington wrote to Hamilton and reiterated the last-resort standard: “the employing of the regular troops [should be] avoided, if it be possible to effect order without their aid …. [I]f no other means will effectually answer, [the militia] must be used, in the dernier resort.”

Washington’s proclamation failed to dissuade the insurgents and the conflict intensified. On Aug. 4, 1794, Justice James Wilson certified that the president had the right to deploy the militia. But even with the permission of a Supreme Court justice, debate within the Cabinet focused on whether they had exhausted all other options. Letter after letter to Washington recounts, sometimes in exhaustive detail, the multiple efforts by law enforcement to quell the conflict. Meanwhile, Hamilton continued to push for deployment—and this time he was not alone. In the attorney general’s letter to Washington, he concluded that the executive was “reduced to the melancholy necessity of having recourse to the more efficient means ... by calling forth the militia. He seems to have no alternative left.” But at the same time, the attorney general warned that many militiamen might refuse to serve and instead pay the penalty “unless the public mind be satisfied that all other means in the power of the Executive have failed and that military coercion is absolutely necessary to support the laws.” He concluded that, therefore, Washington should issue another proclamation first, “defering the time of Assembling the Militia to a distant day.”

Because the last-resort threshold had still not been met, Washington again declined to send in the militia. He would try one last time to negotiate, but this time he prepared for the worst. He sent three “peace commissioners” to negotiate with the rebels. In the meantime, Washington issued the proclamation to disperse required under the 1792 statute, which remains part of the Insurrection Act today. He then readied the militia. In a private letter, the attorney general, serving as one of the peace commissioners, wrote that if their offer of a “full amnesty and oblivion of all that is past” should be refused, “the weight of the public opinion will give energy to the dernier resort.” Keeping to this approach, only once the commissioners’ negotiations had failed did Washington at last decide to send in the militia. Approximately three years elapsed between the first attack on an excise collector and Washington’s decision to deploy the militia

In present day, just three days after protests first broke out against immigration enforcement in Los Angeles did President Trump order the deployment of the National Guard, accompanied by the warning: “IF THEY SPIT, WE WILL HIT, and I promise you they will be hit harder than they have ever been hit before.” While court depositions indicate that the disturbances in Los Angeles were serious—with burning cars, pinned officers, and Molotov cocktails—their scale, violence, and intensity pale in comparison to the Whiskey Rebellion. The same disparity is true for Trump’s subsequent deployment attempts in Portland and Chicago. And Trump’s rhetoric has not invoked any last-resort constraint. Quite the opposite; Trump has celebrated the excessive use of force, most notably in his Truth Social post proclaiming that “Chicago [is] about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” posted alongside a meme from “Apocalypse Now.”

The 1792 Militia Act

Given how radically different the 1792 Militia Act is from today’s analog statute, Judge Nelson’s claim that there is historical continuity between the Whiskey Rebellion and today’s deployment is difficult to sustain. As described below, the two statutes differ so substantially that it is unclear whether the 1792 statute can meaningfully serve as precedent for the statute at issue in today’s litigation. Especially important differences are the guardrails the 18th-century statute imposed on the president through Congress and the courts. Insofar as the 1792 Act is precedent, it cuts against the lawfulness of today’s deployments.

The 1792 Militia Act—also known as the “calling forth” statute—was the first statute that operationalized the constitutional power to deploy the militia domestically. It was the legal basis for George Washington’s leading of the militia to put down the Whiskey Rebellion. Under the statute, the president could call forth the militia when one of three triggers was present: (a) invasion or imminent danger of invasion, (b) an insurrection against a state government, or (c) an obstruction of the execution of the law “too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested by the marshals in this Act.” Note that obstruction of the laws in itself was not sufficient; only when the efforts of either the courts or the marshals to suppress the obstruction failed could the president send in the militia.

The statute’s guardrails for each trigger varied, with the most extensive applying to the third trigger of obstruction of the laws. For invasion, there were no special guardrails in the statute. For an insurrection, the president could not act without state permission. Notably, the statute reserved its most extensive guardrails for the obstruction of law trigger. One of the Anti-Federalists’ common charges against the Constitution was that it would turn the militia and the standing army into enforcers of the laws, creating a “government of force” and opening the door to military dictatorship. Furthermore, resistance to the laws is an easier trigger to invoke because it is an everyday phenomenon, far more common than invasion and insurrection.

The obstruction-of-the-laws provision had three guardrails absent from the statute recently invoked by the Trump administration. The first was judicial certification: An associate justice or the district judge had to “notif]y]” the president that the obstruction had become too powerful for the judiciary or the marshals to handle. The second was about use of the in-state militia: The president’s default choice should be the use of the militia of the state in which the obstruction was occurring. Only if the in-state militia, “where such combination may happen, shall refuse or be insufficient to suppress the same” shall it “be lawful for the President ... to call for the militia of any other state.” Third, the use of the out-of-state militia required congressional permission. If Congress was out of session, the president could call forth the militia, but such a call would expire 30 days after Congress entered back into session. Each of these three guardrails played a role in the Whiskey Rebellion, and each may pose a potential obstacle to the Trump administration’s current deployment efforts.

Guardrail 1: Judicial Notification

The first guardrail is judicial notification. Although scholars have highlighted this 1792 provision, the mechanics of how this step operated in practice have not been detailed.

Most importantly, what evidentiary burden does notification entail? Notification may sound like a purely administrative act with little discretion for the judge. Notification could have been, for instance, merely a heads-up or an alert to the judge. The text therefore raises a basic question: Did “notification” carry any evidentiary burden at all?

While the record is inconclusive about the exact standard, it’s clear that at least some showing was required. The Washington administration submitted five documents to satisfy the notification requirement:

The report of federal excise inspector John Neville describing the July 16-17 attacks and burning of his home near Pittsburgh.

The report of Maj. Thomas Butler (Army, Fort Fayette) on the armed, lawless climate and intimidation of federal officers.

The report of Maj. Isaac Craig (Army, Pittsburgh) recounting the attack on U.S. Marshal David Lenox.

A sworn deposition of Col. Francis Mentges discussing four different incidents to conclude that it was “entirely impracticable” to enforce the laws by ordinary civil or judicial means.

A sworn deposition (now lost) of Post rider Thomas Gould on the July 26, 1794, robbery of the Pittsburgh-to-Philadelphia mail showing organized obstruction.

After receiving the documents, Justice James Wilson asked for evidence that the reports were authentic and received it shortly afterwards. Wilson issued the certification on Aug. 4, 1794, based on the “evidence, which has been laid before me.” His certificate was short, merely repeating the language of the 1792 statute.

In addition to what was submitted, the correspondence of key actors within the Washington administration makes clear that a substantive showing was required. Henry Knox, the secretary of war at the time, told Washington that whether the “evidence” submitted “is as such as the law contemplates ... will depend upon the opinion of Judge Wilson.” Edmund Randolph, the former attorney general and then-secretary of state, wrote to President Washington that a judge “ought not a priori to decide,” and he cautioned the attorney general “not to express to” Wilson “the most distant wish in the President, that the certificate should be granted.” Randolph also worried that the submitted “testimony is not, in my judgement, yet in sufficient legal form.” Lastly, Washington asked the governor of Pennsylvania to begin deploying the state militia under state law because certification by Wilson was uncertain and might take time. Washington told the governor that “the measures of the Gen’l Gov’t would be slow and depended on the certificate of Judge Wilson, to whom the document had been delivered for his consideration.” Note the language here of “certificate.” Whereas the statute’s language of notification sounds merely administrative, certification suggests an evidentiary burden and was used repeatedly by administration officials, more often than the statute’s own term of notification.

How much of an evidentiary burden was it? This record undermines the claim that the requirement was a mere “rubber stamp.” And it certainly rebuts the government’s assertion that judicial review of domestic deployments is constitutionally and categorically precluded. This account of the administration’s use of the 1792 statute supports Steve Vladeck’s conclusion, also drawing from the statute’s certification requirement that “there was no Founding-era aversion to a robust judicial role in these cases.”

But how robust? And how much of a check is the requirement for the judicial certification? One might be skeptical that it amounts to much. The evidence submitted of three reports and two depositions is not a lot. And the proceeding was ex parte; there was no chance for those who were against the military deployment to rebut the evidence. What’s more, the proceedings appear to consist solely of the submission of documents. One might analogize this to other ex parte proceedings such as obtaining a search warrant or a grand jury indictment where the standard is the low one of probable cause.

If the standard was this low, the Trump administration might well have satisfied it with sworn depositions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other officials on the ground. By contrast, the Whiskey Rebellion was so large and notorious that its context likely informed Wilson’s judgment. In closer cases, the requirement might have made the evidentiary burden clearer—and revealed it to be more demanding than it first appeared.

Beyond establishing that judicial involvement is not categorically precluded, the 1792 notification requirement offers limited guidance for modern cases. It no longer exists—the 1795 statute eliminated it, and it never reappeared in later iterations of the “calling forth” laws. The difficulty of extracting lessons from this one-off 1792 requirement for modern doctrine, in the absence of an analogous provision in present law, only underscores how misguided Judge Nelson’s framework is. Examining how the 1792 statute operated remains useful in some respects, but it yields few concrete lessons about judicial deference.

Guardrail 2: In-State Militia

The second guardrail was that out-of-state militia could be used only if the in-state militia “shall refuse or be insufficient to suppress” the insurrection. The problem in 1794 was not refusal. Although the Pennsylvania governor called for greater moderation, expressed reluctance, and at times exasperated Hamilton, the governor repeatedly reassured Washington—sometimes apologetically—that he would comply with whatever the president decided. And indeed, the governor issued a proclamation calling for a “prompt and faithful compliance with the orders of the government,” and in the initial deployment Pennsylvania supplied the bulk of the militia forces: 5,200 of roughly 13,000. The remaining troops came from New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia.

How, then, was the statutory requirement of in-state exhaustion formally satisfied? For Hamilton, as he explained in a letter to Washington, it was enough that the Pennsylvania governor had privately but “explicitly” told the president at a conference with key state and Cabinet officials that the militia of Pennsylvania alone would be “incompetent to the suppression of the insurrection.” For Hamilton, “this opinion of the Chief magistrate of the State is presumed to be a sufficient foundation for calling in ... the aid of the Militia of the Neighbouring States.” Hamilton’s embrace of such a low threshold is unsurprising: He was consistently the most eager to employ military force and prodded Washington in that direction.

Secretary of War Knox, by contrast, preferred a more formal and public declaration from the governor. He acknowledged that the governor had made a “verbal declaration that the Militia of Pennsylvania would be insufficient,” but he wanted that judgment in writing. Knox thought the process should begin with Washington, who would inform the governor “of the necessity of enforcing the laws” and then “request” the governor’s “opinion whether the ... Militia of Pennsylvania are sufficient [for the] purpose.” In that request, Washington was to indicate the number of troops he believed necessary, so that the Pennsylvania governor would have a concrete baseline for assessing whether Pennsylvania alone could supply an adequate force. Ultimately, it seems that Hamilton’s standard won out. There is no record of the governor publicly declaring an inability to quell the rebellion; in Washington’s annual message to Congress, Washington instead cited his conversation with the governor of Pennsylvania as proof and submitted to Congress executive papers, including Edmund Randolph’s testy letter to Mifflin (secretly likely written by Hamilton) documented the exchange.

A modern-day analog to this in-state exhaustion requirement would pose a substantial obstacle to the Trump administration’s attempts to deploy the Texas National Guard into Portland and Chicago. After Judge Immergut blocked the federalization and deployment of Oregon’s National Guard into Portland on Oct. 4, the administration attempted to circumvent the temporary restraining order by sending over 100 troops from California and Texas, prompting a second order from Immergut barring any federalized National Guard units from any state from deploying into Oregon. The purpose of sending the California and Texas forces was thus not, in the spirit of the 1792 statute, to secure additional firepower to quell an overwhelming disturbance but, rather, to exploit a perceived loophole in a judicial ruling. The administration also sought to deploy the Texas National Guard into Chicago, but of the three cities the case for the National Guard was weakest there: While in Los Angeles cars were set on fire and in Portland protesters shut down an ICE detention facility for three weeks, none of the protests in Chicago rose to a comparable level.

Guardrail 3: Congressional Permission

The third guardrail required congressional permission to use out-of-state militia. If Congress was out of session, the president could deploy the militia. Once Congress reconvened, however, any federalization of the militia would automatically expire 30 days later unless Congress affirmatively extended it. The Third Congress adjourned on June 9, 1794, and did not reconvene until Nov. 3 of that year. In the interim, on Sept. 25, 1794, Washington formally called into federal service the militias of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia—meaning congressional approval would be needed by Dec. 3. Four days before the deadline, Congress supplied that approval, authorizing the president to call out and station a corps of militia not exceeding 2,500 men in the four western counties of Pennsylvania.

Unlike the Whiskey Rebellion, the current deployments have occurred while Congress is in session. Would the present Congress approve President Trump’s deployment of the National Guard? Any answer is necessarily speculative, but the deployments are broadly unpopular, and it is plausible that moderate and retiring members of the Republican Party—in addition to almost all Democrats—would object.

The Protective Power

While President Trump’s attempt to federalize the National Guard is rooted in 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the Guard’s missions into cities themselves, however, appear to rest on the president’s claimed “protective power”—an asserted inherent authority to safeguard federal personnel, property, and functions (here, ICE officers, facilities, and operations). Proponents justify the protective power with the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, which states that the president must “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” The main legal authorization for the deployment—a June 7 Presidential Memorandum—relies heavily on the protective power. The word “protection” is in the title and calls into service the National Guard to “under 10 U.S.C. 12406 to temporarily protect ICE and other United States government personnel who are performing Federal functions … and to protect Federal property[.]”

As Chris Mirasola notes, there is little evidence that the founders recognized such a freestanding authority. My in-depth review of the Whiskey Rebellion record supports that conclusion. In the official materials—Washington’s proclamation to call out the militia, his address to Congress, and Justice Wilson’s certificate—the primary legal basis invoked for initial deployment and its extension was the 1792 militia statute. More strikingly, in Cabinet debates and correspondence, no one even floated a protective-power theory as independent legal ground for deployment. To be sure, participants referenced that the president had a duty to execute the laws, but it served as a rhetorical flourish. Its most formal role was supporting Washington’s early proclamation urging compliance. Because the Trump administration grounds its actions in the protective power, it departs from Washington’s approach that Judge Nelson claims if followed would warrant special judicial deference.

10 U.S.C. § 12406, the Militia Acts, and the Insurrection Act

What’s more, the 1792 Militia Act is a weak—or irrelevant—precedent because it is not the parent statute for 10 U.S.C. § 12406. The parent statute is the 1903 Dick Act, as amended in 1908. The Dick Act was an effort to modernize the National Guard, as discussed in Martin Lederman’s amicus brief in the pending Supreme Court case of Illinois v. Trump. And while there has been a long history of domestic deployments, including the Whiskey Rebellion, there has been only one plausible case of federalization under § 12406 with the great postal strike of 1970. Thus, it is the Dick Act’s history and implementation—not the 1792 Militia Act—that should be the immediate focus of any historical inquiry into § 12406.

Both 10 U.S.C. § 12406 and the 1792 Militia Act operationalize Congress’s power under the Constitution to legislate the conditions for deploying the militia or National Guard. Yet the logic of those conditions varies dramatically. While I have already noted the differences in safeguards, a second key difference concerns the scope of law enforcement authority.

The true descendant of the 1792 Militia Act is the collection of statutes known as the Insurrection Act. When invoked, the Insurrection Act authorizes the president to deploy either the National Guard or active-duty troops on American streets. And while the Posse Comitatus Act normally forbids law enforcement by active-duty troops, the Insurrection Act is an exception. Under it, the president may direct members of the military to engage in law enforcement, including seizures, detentions, and arrests. That is effectively what Washington used the militia to do during the Whiskey Rebellion: not only to put down the uprising but also to capture participants and bring them into the criminal process.

By contrast, that is not the function of 10 U.S.C. § 12406, because its lineage is different. Although § 12406 gives the president the power to federalize the National Guard—and those federalized units may be used for protective or security duties—few would likely contend that it authorizes them to perform general law-enforcement functions.

***

The Whiskey Rebellion is an awkward precedent for the broad deference Judge Nelson envisions, but it is also too simple to claim that Washington’s actions established a single, coherent tradition of restraint. For one, the statutory frameworks are dramatically different. And if the Whiskey episode reflects a last-resort model, Fries’s Rebellion, just five years later, points the other way. Like Whiskey, Fries arose from resistance to the enforcement of a federal tax, a tax on houses that required collectors to enter and count the windows of each house. But this time the resistance was small scale, and the 1795 “calling forth” act had fewer guardrails. The federal response was hasty and disproportionate: Within five days of an armed crowd forcing a U.S. marshal to release arrested tax resisters, President John Adams invoked the 1795 act and issued a proclamation ordering the insurgents to disperse. Even after they promptly complied by the dispersal deadline, Adams still sent troops and militia into eastern Pennsylvania; the force met little resistance but supplied treason prosecutions that produced multiple death sentences before he ultimately issued pardons. This rapid troop deployments under a more permissive statute and a readiness to treat relatively mild defiance as a national security threat resemble the Trump administration’s recent National Guard activations far more than Washington’s slow, lawyerly march to the frontier in 1794.",https://lawfare-assets-new.azureedge.net/assets/images/default-source/article-images/whiskey-rebellion.jpg?sfvrsn=8e3a7534_7,N,,2025-12-04 14:57:54.797025

Now, Thailand’s National Human Rights Commission found that the Thai Government, National Security Council and Immigration Office violated both international and Thai law, and undermined international confidence in Thailand, affecting Thailand’s global economic and trade relations and its standing among Muslim-majority countries.

In 2014, a group of Uyghur refugees managed to escape the CCP’s “Strike Hard Campaign”, which swept up 27,164 individuals in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region – a more than 95% increase in formal arrests from 2013, according to China’s Party-state media.

The murkiness of charges, opacity of trials, and the arrest of notable non-violent scholars such as Ilham Tohti showed a targeted campaign against Uyghurs as a people, rather than the propagated “crackdown on terrorism”.

However, for many of the escapees, the nightmare was far from over. Over 300 refugees were apprehended by Thai immigration authorities in 2014. 173 among them were resettled in Turkey, 109 were deported to China and at least five individuals died while in detention, including a newborn and child.

For more than 10 years, 48 of them remained in the permanent limbo of a Thai immigration detention center, stuck between pending UNHCR refugee status, offers of resettlement by third countries, and PRC pressure to send them back to China.

Despite the staggering amount of evidence on ongoing crimes against humanity and genocide in the Uyghur Region emerged, including the 2022 assessment by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which formally called on all UN Member States to refrain from sending any Uyghurs back to China under the international principle of non-refoulement, Thai authorities continuously refused to release the 48 individuals and allow for their resettlement.

Then, things went from bad to worse.

In late Fall 2024, the UN, democratic Governments and lawmakers, and NGOs protested the signaling that Thailand would deport 40 individuals to China.

In January 2025, UN experts issued a statement outlining the risk:

“The treatment of the Uyghur minority in China is well-documented,” the experts said. “We are concerned they are at risk of suffering irreparable harm, in violation of the international prohibition on refoulement to torture.”

And yet – and yet. On February 27, 2025, Thailand gave into the PRC’s demands and deported 40 of the Uyghur detainees to a country where genocide against their people has been recognized.

In an op-ed on the deportation, Professor Jeffrey Wasserstrom of UC Irvine compared the situation in Thailand to a decade earlier, and noted that the deportation served as a reminder of an hindrance to progress in Thailand on human rights – the linkage between the elite and China:

“On the side of disturbing patterns from the past, there is the deportation of the Uyghurs. This is a sign that the new civilian government in Bangkok, like the junta that came before it, is willing to take familiar kinds of actions against not just domestic critics, but also those seeking safety from the government of the powerful, autocratic neighbor to the north, whose favor Thailand's ruling elite, in each of its recent configurations, has shown itself eager to court.”

But in November 2025, the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand (NHRCT) announced that it had received four separate complaints regarding the deportation of the 40 Uyghurs to China.

The complaints were filed against the Thai government, the National Security Council, and the Immigration Office. The complaints alleged that the deportation took place “despite credible evidence indicating that they were at high risk of torture, enforced disappearance, and other inhuman treatment.”

The Commission conducted a fact-finding investigation and found “no evidence that the respondents ensured the Uyghurs’ safety or protection from torture upon return.”

Further, the Commission noted that the Thai government, National Security Council, and Immigration Office had “relied solely on diplomatic assurances from China and did not provide any verifiable evidence of their deportation process or proof of the Uyghurs’ voluntary consent.”

The Commission also noted that independent monitoring to ensure those deported is inadequate and determined:

“Thus, the NHRCT concluded that the three respondents either acted or failed to act in ways that constituted human rights violations. The deportation contravened the principle of non-refoulement, international human rights treaties, and the 2022 Act on Torture and Enforced Disappearance. It also undermined international confidence in Thailand, particularly following its election to the UN Human Rights Council (2025–2027). The incident additionally affected Thailand’s global economic and trade relations and its standing among Muslim-majority countries.”",https://safeguarddefenders.com/sites/default/files/2025-12/sm-photo-04-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:57:52.285525

Republican support for Congress’ performance dropped from 54% in September to 23% today, the survey found, with only 15% of independents and 4% of Democrats expressing approval.
The path forward for Republican healthcare legislation that could pass, much less with popular support, is far from clear.","Weeks after suffering bruising election losses across the country, and facing an unusually tight special congressional race in ruby red Tennessee, President Trump told reporters Tuesday that a “fake” national narrative has taken hold of an economy in trouble.

Americans are employed and consuming more than ever, he said. Foreign tariffs and investments are bringing in trillions of dollars. “The word ‘affordability,’” Trump added, “is a Democrat scam.”

It was a message in defiance of stark public opinion polling that shows a clear majority of Americans, across all ages and demographic groups, increasingly concerned with the state of the economy and the president’s approach.

A Fox News poll released before Thanksgiving found that 76% view the economy negatively. Surveys conducted since the holiday put Trump at the lowest point of his second term, and lower than any of his predecessors at this point in their second term since President Nixon. Gallup found that 36% approve of his job performance, with 60% disapproving, and an Economist/YouGov poll saw only 32% of Americans support Trump’s response to the country’s affordability crisis.

“Trump was not shy about promising to lower prices on Day One,” said Bill Galston, chair of the governance studies program at the Brookings Institution. “Not only do they not see prices coming down, but they don’t believe he is focused on those problems, taking the type of bold steps they expected him to take on the economy.”

Four key voter blocs — young adults between 18 and 29 years old, Hispanics, moderates and independents — are among those that swung most dramatically to Trump in last year’s election, and are most likely to respond to changing circumstances. “He is doing badly with all of them,” Galston said.

“There wasn’t a realignment that was a permanent shift of sympathy — they were dissatisfied with President Biden’s performance, so they decided to give Trump another chance,” Galston added. “But he didn’t own them. He just rented them. And the rent’s coming due.”

Republicans holding the line

The downward trend in support for Trump started over the spring once a trickle of revelations on the president’s ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, as well as his increasing focus on foreign conflicts, began dividing his core base of supporters.

Gallup now finds Trump’s support among GOP voters at 84% — the lowest of his second term so far — and at 25% among independents, his lowest ever.

Still, Trump’s remaining support suggests he continues to enjoy broad approval among Republican voters for his overall job performance, even if they disagree with some of his economic or foreign policy positions, analysts said.

“Compared to other presidents, Trump has a higher floor and a lower ceiling,” said Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster who has consulted Republican senators and governors for more than three decades.

For now, independents and moderates dissatisfied over prices and pocketbook issues are driving the president’s decline in support. While Trump earns higher approval numbers for his policies on immigration and crime, fewer Americans are listing those issues as top priorities.

“The administration is clearly at the lowest point of this term, but if you look at perspective, the averages are nowhere near the lowest point over the course of his two terms,” Ayres said. “He’s still holding up very well among Republicans. What’s causing the drop is a serious decline among independents.”

Trump has repeatedly demonstrated political agility over the last decade, recovering from challenging polling environments before. But his inability to run for another term, coupled with increasing attention on the age and stamina of the 79-year-old president, could be forcing Republican lawmakers and voters to reconcile with life for the party after his departure, analysts said.

It was in the doldrums of the 2008 financial crisis, with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan still raging and taking the lives of American servicemembers, that President Bush faced a dire 25% approval rating, driven by a collapse in Republican support that hit a low of 55%. That year, Democrats surged to their greatest electoral victory since the 1960s.

“It’s certainly possible that a combination of circumstances can drive a president’s approval rating within their own party much lower than Trump’s current Gallup number,” said Andrew Sinclair, an assistant professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. “What the theoretical floor is, or whether Trump’s theoretical floor is higher or lower than Bush’s, I don’t know — but we have seen lower within-party approval ratings, and that’s probably at least possible here.”

Ominous signs for the midterms

Historically, when a president’s job approval is above 50%, the president’s party still loses an average 14 House seats in midterm elections.

Much can change over the course of a year in politics. But Trump’s current standing bodes poorly for the party’s ability to hold its majority in the House of Representatives, regardless of the outcome of a series of mid-decade redistricting efforts across the country, Ayres said.

“Attitudes about Republican candidates are so closely tied to Trump — he has so thoroughly taken over the party — that there’s not a lot of room to differentiate,” he added. “But the president’s job approval is absolutely critical to his party’s performance in the midterms.”

The most recent Gallup poll showed that Trump’s remaining hold on Republican voters does not extend to his allies in Congress. Republican support for Congress’ performance dropped from 54% in September to 23% today, the survey found, with only 15% of independents and 4% of Democrats expressing approval.

Scrutiny of the GOP majority will only intensify this month, as Trump and congressional Republicans race to address a significant affordability concern: the expiration of expanded tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, which could see premiums skyrocket at the start of next year. The path forward for Republican healthcare legislation that could pass, much less with popular support, is far from clear.

Trump appeared aware of the polling landscape entering the holiday week, claiming on social media that he had just received “the highest poll numbers of my ‘political career.’” Just days earlier, he had acknowledged the reality of the problem.

“So, my poll numbers just went down,” Trump said, addressing the Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, “but with smart people, they’ve gone way up.”

Morning Reads

Bessent says Trump admin will be able to replicate tariffs even if it loses Supreme Court decision (Jeff Cox, CNBC) — U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday said the Trump administration can continue pursuing its trade agenda regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in this term’s tariffs case. Even if the court prevents the administration from using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs, “[w]e can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122″ of the 1962 Trade Act, Bessent contended, according to CNBC. “He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case.”

Judge orders Trump administration to halt warrantless immigration arrests in District of Columbia (Ryan Knappenberger, Courthouse News Service) — On Tuesday night, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell limited the circumstances under which the Trump administration can make warrantless immigration arrests in Washington, D.C., holding that the administration has improperly characterized “all immigrants who entered the U.S. without permission as ‘illegal alien criminals,'” according to Courthouse News Service. “First, ‘as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States,’” Howell wrote, citing the Supreme Court’s decision in Arizona v. United States. “As a legal matter, an immigration status violation is a civil violation. Consequently, viewing all immigrants potentially subject to removal as criminals is, as a legal matter, plain wrong.”

Texas families file class action lawsuit over law mandating Ten Commandments in schools (Steven Rosenbaum, CBS News) — On Tuesday, 18 families with children in Texas public schools filed a class action lawsuit over a state law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms. “[T]he lawsuit asks the judge to block all Texas school districts from enforcing the law,” claiming it “violates the First Amendment,” according to CBS News. The law is already on hold in certain districts in Texas due to previous lawsuits. These disputes likely will be impacted by a separate battle in Louisiana, where a federal district judge ruled last December that Louisiana’s own Ten Commandments law was unconstitutional, “citing a 1980 Supreme Court decision over a similar law in Kentucky.” Next month, “all 17 judges” on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which includes Texas and Louisiana, will consider Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law.

Oklahoma asks SCOTUS to ignore Muscogee citizen tax dispute or ‘revisit McGirt’ ruling (Sarah Liese and Robby Korth, Oklahoma Public Media Exchange, KGOU) — In its response to a petition for review from a Muscogee Nation citizen, the Oklahoma Tax Commission on Monday urged the Supreme Court to leave in place a state supreme court decision that “requires tribal citizens who work for their tribe and live on their reservation to pay Oklahoma income tax,” according to KGOU. In her petition, Alicia Stroble asked the court to review the state supreme court’s decision and hold that it violates McGirt v. Oklahoma, a 2020 case in which the Supreme Court held that the Muscogee (Creek) Reservation is Native American territory. “[T]he five largest tribes in Oklahoma have” filed friend-of-the-court briefs in favor of Stroble’s petition.

One-man play in Athens to celebrate life of Thurgood Marshall (Wayne Ford, Athens Banner-Herald) — A one-man play celebrating the life of former Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was a prominent civil rights lawyer before becoming the first Black Supreme Court justice, is coming to Athens, Georgia, this weekend, according to the Athens Banner-Herald. “Proceeds from the performances will support the Athens Area Paine College Holsey Scholarship Fund and the United Negro College Fund.”

A Closer Look: Supreme Court Clerks

We know that during their time on the court, the justices’ clerks play a crucial role in the court’s operations – among other things, they screen thousands of certiorari petitions to help the justices decide which cases to hear, prepare the justices for oral arguments, draft opinions, and review drafts from other chambers.

Indeed, the importance of clerks has grown significantly since the mid-20th century, when they began taking on more substantive legal duties amid an expanding docket, evolving from typists, in some scenarios, to full-on “extensions of the chambers’ work.” Today, the positions are extremely competitive, with only 36 spots available annually for active justices (four for each justice and five for the chief, although he does not typically hire a fifth clerk), drawing applicants from elite pipelines that involve recommendations from professors, “feeder” judges, and former clerks.

Aspiring clerks typically go to a handful of top law schools, with more than two-thirds of clerks over the past few decades hailing from Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Columbia, or the University of Chicago. One notable trend of late is that of multiple prior clerkships; two decades ago, nearly all clerks had just one federal appeals court clerkship, but today such individuals often have at least two of these under their belt (with some having three prior clerkships). Other shifts include greater demographic diversity, with the 2025-26 term’s class nearing gender parity (although, as Sarah Isgur has noted, multiple clerkships can add an additional burden on women and those that must take on debt from law school).

But what, exactly, do clerks do before and after their time at One First Street?

As Adam Feldman wrote for SCOTUSblog in October, Supreme Court clerks often form “networks of power” that extend far beyond their one-year clerkship – with many going on to work in the judiciary, government, and private sector. After their clerkships, many former clerks find themselves with a host of lucrative opportunities, with some Big Law firms offering signing bonuses of up to $500,000 (it’s little surprise then that this accounts for 70% of recent clerk placements upon finishing up, with many landing at firms like Jones Day, Gibson Dunn, and Kirkland & Ellis). Some go on to become federal judges, and a few even end up back on the court itself: Six of the nine justices – Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Elena Kagan, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson – previously served as Supreme Court clerks.

Trump v. Slaughter: An Explainer

On Monday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Trump v. Slaughter, a battle that has been brewing, on one hand, since soon after President Donald Trump took office in January and, on the other hand, for years. At the center of the battle are laws that limit the president’s ability to fire the heads of independent, multi-member federal agencies like the Federal Trade Commission. The court will consider whether such laws violate the separation of powers. For more on the case, read Amy’s explainer.

Many major news organizations released statements in October condemning the Pentagon policy as an incursion on the First Amendment.","The New York Times accused the Pentagon in a lawsuit on Thursday of infringing on the constitutional rights of journalists by imposing a set of new restrictions on reporting about the military.

In the suit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, The Times argued that the Defense Department’s new policy violated the First Amendment and “seeks to restrict journalists’ ability to do what journalists have always done — ask questions of government employees and gather information to report stories that take the public beyond official pronouncements.”

The rules, which went into effect in October, are a stark departure from the previous ones, in both length and scope. They require reporters to sign a 21-page form that sets restrictions on journalistic activities, including requests for story tips and inquiries to Pentagon sources. Reporters who don’t comply could lose their press passes, and the Pentagon has accorded itself “unbridled discretion” to enforce the policy as it sees fit, according to the lawsuit.

The suit said that “reporting any information not approved by department officials” could lead to punishment, “regardless of whether such news gathering occurs on or off Pentagon grounds, and regardless of whether the information at issue is classified or unclassified.”

The complaint sought a court order halting enforcement of the rules and a declaration that the provisions “targeting the exercise of First Amendment rights” were unlawful. The Times has retained Theodore J. Boutrous, a First Amendment lawyer who has argued major media access cases in federal court. Julian E. Barnes, a Pentagon reporter for The Times, is listed as a plaintiff alongside the company.

Sean Parnell, the chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement: “We are aware of The New York Times lawsuit and look forward to addressing these arguments in court.”

The new rules are the latest step in a monthslong effort by Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, to curtail the access and privileges of the Pentagon press corps.

Mr. Hegseth arrived at the Pentagon in January after a bruising confirmation process that surfaced allegations of excessive drinking and sexual assault, which he said were untrue. Early in his tenure, Mr. Hegseth proposed evicting from the Pentagon a veteran reporter at NBC News who had contributed to some of the coverage.

A draft of the new restrictions first emerged in September, and was revised after pushback from lawyers representing news organizations. The final rules were released on Oct. 6, and more than a week later, dozens of credentialed journalists — including six from The Times — surrendered their badges instead of signing the document. The departing outlets have continued reporting on the military despite the access limits.

Many major news organizations released statements in October condemning the Pentagon policy as an incursion on the First Amendment. “The policy is without precedent and threatens core journalistic protections,” said a statement from ABC News, CBS News, CNN, Fox News Media and NBC News.

In a press briefing on Wednesday, a senior Times lawyer said that there had been discussions with other news organizations about joining the suit but that the newspaper had decided to proceed alone.

The suit took issue with multiple provisions of the new policy, including one that empowered the Pentagon to deem a journalist “a security or safety risk.” Such a determination could hinge on whether the journalist engaged in unauthorized disclosure of classified information or certain unclassified information, among other considerations.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/00biz-pentagon-press-suit-mjhz/00biz-pentagon-press-suit-mjhz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 11:00:56.150330

While the group of about 12 protested outside, Gov. Tate Reeves, a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, spoke inside of the Madison restaurant. The protesters were far enough away from the restaurant to prevent any direct communications with Reeves.

Beginning this week, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security are conducting a two-month immigration crackdown in Louisiana and south Mississippi. Protestors marched in New Orleans during the weekend to oppose the campaign.

Protesters also oppose state agencies and local law enforcement assisting ICE’s immigration enforcement efforts .

On Wednesday, protestors in Madison stood across the street at the intersection in front of Mama Hamil’s, where Reeves was the keynote speaker at Grip N Grin, a monthly meeting to discuss current events. They waved signs as cars drove by, and some drivers honked as they passed.

Kathleein O’Beirne, a Ridgeland native, said this protest was made possible by a coalition of groups, including Mississippi United.

O’Beirne said immigrants contribute greatly to American society and the economy, and the president’s rhetoric around immigration is not rooted in truth.

“The truth of the matter is we Mississippians are smart enough to realize that there is a humane and civil way that respects families, that protects our communities, to address our immigration issues,” she said.

The crackdown in Louisiana and Mississippi is part of the Trump administration’s larger campaign of mass deportations, which O’Beirne described as a campaign of intimidation and harassment against immigrant communities in Mississippi.

Among the group was Paula Merchant, a U.S. Army veteran and former English as a Second Language teacher who founded Adelante, which works with the immigrant community in Jackson and helped organize the protest.

Her experience as an immigrant inspired Merchant to establish the group. She believes the current immigration system is broken and the focus should be on fixing it rather than deporting people.

“They’re not going to work,” she said of the immigrants. “The kids are not going to school, and they don’t want to separate from one another because they don’t know if they’re going to be taken.”

Merchant was born in Mexico to a Mexican mother and an American father. She and her mother moved to the U.S. when she was 4 after her father died. Her parents never married, making it difficult to prove her father was biologically related to her. Merchant said this meant she and her mother had to take the standard immigration process, which was long and expensive.

She said she didn’t get a green card until she was 14, and didn’t become a naturalized citizen until she was 28.

Michigan Hmong refugee Lue Yang, who was detained by immigration authorities in July over a decades-old criminal conviction, was released from federal custody Wednesday.

Yang, a St. Johns resident who serves as president of the nonprofit Hmong Family Association of Lansing, was detained for more than four months and slated for possible deportation based on a decades-old criminal conviction related to an attempted home invasion.

During an emotional reunion with his wife and children in Grand Rapids on Wednesday, the 47-year-old father of six said he’s “just glad to be home with family” and can’t wait to spend time with them after his monthslong detention.

Though Yang’s 1997 conviction had been expunged under Michigan law and is no longer public record, US immigration authorities can still reference those records when considering a person’s legal status.

Yang was one of several Hmong refugees and Laotians with varying criminal histories who were arrested in Michigan this summer and ordered removed by an immigration judge, according to ICE.

Yang’s Wednesday release came after several state and federal officials intervened on his behalf, including state Rep. Mai Xiong — a Macomb County Democrat who is also a Hmong refugee — and US Rep. Tom Barrett, R-Charlotte.

After the governor’s October pardon, immigration officials kept Yang in custody “while the legal ramifications of the state’s pardon on his immigration case are assessed as he is currently still subject to a final order of removal,” an ICE spokesperson said at the time.

Despite his release, Yang’s legal battles aren’t over, Xiong said Wednesday, noting he still needs to work through immigration court to remove his deportation order and resolve outstanding issues with his legal status.

But being out of detention will make it easier for him to do that and ease the burden on his family, she said.

“I think all the officials involved can see that he is going through the legal system and he’s following all the rules and doing the best that he can, so I would hope that they will continue to keep that in mind,” Xiong said.

Yang came to the US legally as an infant with his family after escaping political persecution in Laos following the Vietnam War.

His 1997 conviction has complicated Yang’s immigration status ever since: past attempts to get a green card were rejected, but he’s never been considered a resident of Laos or Thailand, either.

Immigration enforcement has been a key tenet of President Donald Trump’s second term, with the administration ramping up ICE recruitment efforts to boost arrest and detention rates.

The administration has said its focus is to remove the “worst of the worst” such as people with criminal records.

Yang’s family and advocates have said he’d never known a home outside of the US and feared his advocacy for Hmong veterans in the US could result in imprisonment or death if he were deported to Laos.

“Lue is not and never has been an illegal immigrant, and does not present a threat to our community, so I worked tirelessly to see him released from custody,” Barrett, Yang’s US representative, said in a statement.

“I appreciate the willingness of the administration to listen to my concerns about Lue’s case and to reach this outcome,” he continued.

Mario Díaz-Balart (FL-26) and Carlos A. Giménez (FL-28) released the following joint statement regarding the recent U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s decision to halt immigration applications:

“The Biden Administration’s reckless abandonment of border security and its systematic failure to properly vet nearly 10 million people(link is external) were a betrayal of national safety and a direct threat to American lives. We condemned it unequivocally from the start.

For four years, our urgent warnings, both in writing and in person, about the consequences of the Biden Administration’s grotesquely irresponsible open-border policies and non-existent vetting were ignored. Today, we are unfortunately dealing with the consequences.

The chaos that unfolded at our southern border allowed over 300 known terrorists(link is external) to enter the country, enabled hostile foreign operatives(link is external)–including Cuban regime pilot Luis Raul Gonzalez-Pardo Rodriguez, recently indicted for immigration fraud–and led to the preventable murders of Americans in their own communities. The tragic deaths of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley and Texas 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, the foiled Election Day 2024 terrorist plot by Afghan national Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, and the murder of a U.S. National Guard soldier in our nation’s capital by another Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, are not isolated incidents—they are direct consequences of Biden’s incompetence and failed leadership. Criminals applied for and exploited U.S. immigration privileges under an administration that simply stopped enforcing the rule of law.

President Trump inherited a number of problems, including a broken immigration system made worse by the Biden Administration. President Trump is protecting national security by restoring order, enforcing the rule of law, and strengthening vetting. That leadership is saving American lives.

We remain fully committed to permanently fixing our immigration system once and for all. We also hope this process is thorough and done quickly so that individuals with legitimate asylum claims have the opportunity to have their cases adjudicated expeditiously, something that did not happen under the Biden Administration.”

Detainees at the notorious Florida immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” were shackled inside a 2ft-high metal cage and left outside without water for up to a day at a time, a shocking report published on Thursday by Amnesty International alleges.

The human rights group said people held at the state-run Everglades facility, and at Miami’s Krome immigration processing center operated by a private company on behalf of the Trump administration, continued to be exposed to “cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment” rising in some cases to torture.

For instance the cage, known to detainees as “the box”, is used by guards for the arbitrary punishment of trivial or nonexistent offenses, according to the report, which was compiled from interviews with detainees and advocacy groups, and a site visit to Krome made by Amnesty workers in September. “It’s a box outside, exposed to the south Florida sun and humidity, and exposed to mosquitoes,” one detainee said.

A separate July report by Human Rights Watch alleged detainees were shackled with their hands tied behind their backs and made to kneel to eat food from Styrofoam plates “like dogs”.

Didn’t a judge order the facility to shut down? A federal judge in August ordered it to close after a wave of criticism and a lawsuit by environmental groups. However, by October, the facility was operating again with hundreds of detainees after two Trump-appointed appellate court judges – one whose husband has close ties to the Republican governor Ron DeSantis – blocked the closure ruling.

Has the state of Florida responded to the allegations? The press secretary to DeSantis told the Guardian the allegations were “fabrications” and part of a “politically motivated attack”.

House Democrats release new images of Epstein’s private Caribbean island

House Democrats released photos and videos from Jeffrey Epstein’s private Caribbean island on Wednesday, offering a rare glimpse into a secretive place where Epstein is alleged to have trafficked young girls.

The new images and videos show Epstein’s home, including bedrooms, a telephone, what appears to be an office or library, and a chalkboard on which words including “fin”, “intellectual”, “deception” and “power” are written. Several photos show a room with a dentist’s chair and masks hanging on the wall.

Why have they released these photos now? It’s unclear. Even though the images do not reveal anything new, they keep the pressure on the Trump administration ahead of a 19 December deadline for the justice department to release files, as per the Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed 19 November.

Israeli strike in Gaza kills five people including two children, says civil defence agency

An Israeli strike on Palestinian territory has killed five people, including two children, Gaza’s civil defence agency told Agence France-Presse on Wednesday.

The agency said the strike hit near the Kuwaiti field hospital in Khan Younis and “targeted” a shelter camp. The hospital said the five people killed included two children aged eight and 10, and another 32 people were wounded.

The Israeli military said it had struck a “Hamas terrorist” in southern Gaza in response to a clash with Palestinian militants in the area that left five soldiers wounded.

Also on Wednesday: the UN secretary general, António Guterres, told Reuters there was something “fundamentally wrong” with how Israel conducted its military operation in the Gaza Strip and “strong reasons to believe” war crimes had been committed.

A Guardian investigation found that the prices listed at Family Dollar and Dollar General often don’t materialize at checkouts across the country – and customers often don’t even notice they’re overpaying. Dollar General stores have failed more than 4,300 government price-accuracy inspections in 23 states since January 2022. A Family Dollar in Provo, Utah, flunked 28 inspections in a row – failures that included a 48% overcharge rate in May 2024 and a 12% overcharge rate in October 2025.

Climate check: The environmental costs of corn – can the US change how it grows its dominant crop?

Researchers say there’s a problem with how corn is grown: corn fertilizer is warming the planet and contaminating water. Farmers rely on heavy fertilizer use to sustain high yields. And when the nitrogen in the fertilizer breaks down in the soil, it releases nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

We asked Border Patrol and ICE about their tactics in North Carolina, but didn't hear back before our deadline.
Caveat: We still don't know much about the people Border Patrol arrested in North Carolina, like most of their names or criminal backgrounds.","What they're saying: Border Patrol leader Gregory Bovino has not sat for an interview with Axios Raleigh or Axios Charlotte, despite multiple requests, although he did discuss the work of the ""mean green team"" in Charlotte on a recent podcast.

""There's a strategy here ... And that is — self-deportations,"" Bovino told the retired federal agent interviewing him.

The big picture: DHS did not provide statistics about self-deportations before our deadline, but told The Atlantic's Nick Miroff that around 35,000 people self-deported this year by using a government app that arranges plane tickets.

Miroff writes that immigration agencies ""have embraced and promoted imagery of harsh street-level immigration enforcement to sow fear and intimidate people into leaving.""

Zoom in: Andrew Willis Garcés, a Greensboro-based strategist for Siembra NC, an activist group that supports immigrants, told Axios that masked agents chasing people as they take out the trash, do landscaping or go to church has that effect.

""That's the goal. It's to make people afraid to go to work or go to school,"" Garcés said.

Case in point: Photographer Logan Cyrus, who lives in east Charlotte and documented Border Patrol activity there last month for the Charlotte Optimist, told Axios that ""it was kind of surreal having these people dressed in combat gear all over the neighborhood.""

Border Patrol agents, including one armed with a gun, penned in his vehicle and questioned him one morning, Cyrus said.

Cyrus said a ""palpable fear"" lingers in Charlotte, mixed with defiance and confusion.

""It seems like cruelty is the point to a lot of this. Even if they're not catching anybody, the fact that they're scaring people is part of their whole operation,"" he said.

Between the lines: Garcés and Cyrus both say that in North Carolina, agents have shied away from media and others recording them.

Still, violent images that feed the sense of fear have emerged, like a Getty image of a bloody takedown inside a fast food restaurant under construction.

Context: Siembra NC is a network of mostly volunteers that assembled to support immigrants during President Donald Trump's first administration. They document immigration enforcement and chase down rumors submitted to their hotline (336-543-0353).

They find that most ICE arrests in North Carolina happen in early morning traffic stops.

""We think it's because they're looking for people on their way to work or school,"" Garcés said. ""We don't know if that will continue to be true forever, but it's currently the pattern.""

The other side: The Trump administration says its immigration enforcement efforts ""prioritize public safety"" and that agents are ""wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxed and targeted.""

We asked Border Patrol and ICE about their tactics in North Carolina, but didn't hear back before our deadline.

Caveat: We still don't know much about the people Border Patrol arrested in North Carolina, like most of their names or criminal backgrounds. DHS posted some mugshots, but hasn't given reporters a full list of people they detained.

CBS News obtained a government document on ""Operation Charlotte's Web"" that they report shows Border Patrol arrested 270 people, 90 of whom they categorized as ""criminal aliens.""

Bovino said on the podcast — without providing evidence — that Charlotte ""surprised even us"" with ""the amount of aggravated felons, gang members walking the streets with impunity.""

Safi was arrested as President Donald Trump and his administration confront a surge of terror cases tied to Afghan arrivals that occurred under the Biden administration.

The Trump administration put a stop to Afghan refugee resettlement after Trump returned to the Oval Office in January because it saw the program as a massive threat to national security.

Detention conditions since President Trump took office on January 20, 2025.

In particular, it focuses on detention conditions at the Krome North Service Processing Center (Krome) and the Everglades Detention Facility, also known as “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Krome is an ICE detention facility located in Miami-Dade County on the edge of the Everglades. In 2025, the facility has faced heightened scrutiny after reports of severe overcrowding and several deaths. Amnesty International documented delays in intake procedures, overcrowding in temporary processing areas, inadequate and inaccessible medical care, alarming disciplinary practices including the use of prolonged solitary confinement, and challenges in access to legal representation and due process at Krome.

“Alligator Alcatraz” opened in July 2025 with the capacity to detain around 3,000 people. Amnesty International’s research concludes that people arbitrarily detained in “Alligator Alcatraz” are being held in inhuman and unsanitary conditions, including overflowing toilets with fecal matter seeping into where people are sleeping, limited access to showers, exposure to insects without protective measures, lights on 24 hours a day, poor quality food and water, and lack of privacy.

Amnesty International considers that detention conditions at both facilities amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The use of prolonged solitary confinement at Krome and the use of the ‘box’ at “Alligator Alcatraz” amount to torture or other ill-treatment.

Amnesty International calls on the Government of the United States to:

Federal immigration officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","As for Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has repeatedly criticized the president’s rhetoric, Trump dismissed him as a “fool.”

“I wouldn’t be proud to have the largest Somali population,” in the U.S., he said.

Hamse Warfa, a Somali-born entrepreneur who now lives in the Minneapolis area, sees things differently.

“I am not garbage,” said Warfa, who has started a series of successful businesses and now runs a nationwide education nonprofit, World Savvy. “I’m a proud American citizen.”

He notes that anti-immigration rhetoric has long been a powerful political tool, such as the Haitian migrants in Ohio who Trump vilified ahead of the 2024 elections.

“Last presidential election it was the Haitians and how they eat cats and dogs,” he said. “The next iteration now is Somalis.”

The Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to about 84,000 people of Somali descent, who make up nearly one-third of the Somalis living in the U.S.

Trump made his comments Tuesday soon after reports that federal authorities are preparing a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota focusing on Somalis living illegally in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the planning. But most of the state’s Somalis are U.S. citizens, many born in this country.

Some Somali leaders said Wednesday they had received anecdotal reports about community members being detained by federal agents, but had no details. Federal immigration officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Refugees from the East African nation have been coming to the frigid plains of Minnesota since the 1990s, drawn in part by the state’s generous social services and then by the ever-growing diaspora community.

They have become fixtures in the Twin Cities, opening businesses and revitalizing neighborhoods of empty storefronts. They are also increasingly politically prominent, serving in the state Legislature and on the Minneapolis and St. Paul city councils. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar — a regular target of Trump, who on Tuesday singled her out as “garbage” — serves in the U.S. House.

Over the past few years they have also struggled with being typecast after dozens of people, many of them Somalis, were arrested in connection with schemes to defraud social service agencies of what some officials say could total hundreds of millions of dollars. Many of the arrested Somalis are U.S. citizens.

Last week, Trump called Minnesota “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” after a report by a conservative activist said fraud money flowed to the militant group al-Shabab, an affiliate of al-Qaida that controls parts of Somalia. But there has been little, if any, evidence, showing such a link, and federal prosecutors have not charged any defendants with supporting terrorists.

Trump’s recent comments also came days after his administration announced it was halting all asylum decisions following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington. The suspect is originally from Afghanistan but Trump has raised questions about immigrants from other nations, including Somalia.

Also Tuesday, the administration said it was pausing all immigration applications for people from 19 countries, including Somalia, that were banned from travel to the U.S. after the National Guard shooting.

Somali leaders and allies like Gov. Tim Walz and Frey have vowed to protect the community.

“Minneapolis is — and will remain — a city that stands up for our residents,” Frey said in a statement.

Several Democratic legislators and Minneapolis City Council members held a news conference Wednesday to reinforce that message.

They called on Republican lawmakers to denounce the president’s attacks, saying history will judge them.

“Where are the Republicans now?” asked state Sen. Zaynab Mohamed, of Minneapolis, who said she had urged Republican political leaders to attend the news conference.

As for Warfa, he just wishes the rhetoric would die down.

NPR's Martin Kaste is in New Orleans.
MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.
As we mentioned, New Orleans police aren't supposed to help with immigration enforcement.
KELLY: NPR's Martin Kaste reporting from New Orleans.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

Federal agents launched a long-expected immigration enforcement sweep today in New Orleans. It's the latest metro area targeted by the Trump administration's campaign to step up arrests and deportations of immigrants in the country without legal status. NPR's Martin Kaste is in New Orleans. We're going to join him for the latest. Hey, Martin.

MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.

KELLY: So we have seen these kind of immigration enforcement sweeps in other Democratic-run cities this year - I'm thinking of LA, of Chicago, of Charlotte. Are we looking for the same type of operation in New Orleans?

KASTE: Well, so far, the Feds are promising something similar here. They say they're going after people who are in the country illegally and have committed crimes. And in New Orleans, they say that means looking for people with criminal histories who were let out of the local jail but not turned over to ICE. That's what the Feds want local jails to do - turn those people over if they're in the country illegally. Trump has been highly critical of what he calls sanctuary policies, which he says protects criminals from being deported. But all that said, this operation probably won't focus only on criminals because what we've seen in other operations, such as in Chicago, is that most of the people who were swept up on immigration violations did not have criminal records.

KELLY: And you're there. What are you seeing so far? This is Day 1 of an operation that's expected to go - what? - for weeks?

KASTE: Probably, yeah. Well, we're getting scattered reports from volunteer spotters with immigration advocacy groups who say they've seen immigration agents at places like Home Depot and Lowe's - the same kinds of businesses that were targets in Los Angeles earlier this year. But what's more noticeable in this city, I really should say, is the scattered closures of some smaller sort of mom-and-pop restaurants and some bars that have temporarily shut their doors or maybe reduced their hours. Some people say it's because they don't have enough workers showing up, but others say, in some cases, it's preemptive to avoid a raid.

KELLY: Bars closing in New Orleans.

KASTE: Yeah.

KELLY: No small thing. I'm also recalling all of the pushback against ICE in other cities, thinking of Chicago in particular. What kind of reaction could ICE expect there in Louisiana?

KASTE: There seems to be a difference between New Orleans proper and the suburbs on this. For instance, there's a suburb called Kenner which saw a big increase in Latino residents in the last few years. There, the city and the police chief have welcomed ICE. And Latinos in the community say they're getting a similar vibe from some of their nonimmigrant neighbors.

I talked to a man named Jesse Bermudez (ph) earlier today. He runs a Latin American grocery store. I should say that store was completely empty, and he says that's really typical right now. People just aren't coming out. But he told me that a lot of the people in that neighborhood came here to help rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. And now, he says, at least on social media, they're being told it's time to go.

JESSE BERMUDEZ: I'll see on the comments that, you have a lot of people. It's good that they leave. You know, they're not supposed to be here and whatnot. But one of y'all probably called to get a roof fixed, or one of y'all probably called to get a door fixed or, you know, replace something. So it's really a distasteful feeling that - just seeing people - our own community turning their backs on someone that really helped out.

KELLY: Martin, you've been sharing some of the reaction in the suburbs. What about in New Orleans itself - the city - which is so dependent on tourists?

KASTE: Very much so, and Mardi Gras is coming. As we mentioned, New Orleans police aren't supposed to help with immigration enforcement. The police superintendent, Anne Kirkpatrick, calls immigration a civil matter. It's not her responsibility. But I'll say officials here are under a lot of pressure from the state, from Republican Governor Jeff Landry and the legislature because they want to see local law enforcement cooperating with the Feds. So unlike Chicago or LA, which were backed by their state sanctuary policies, New Orleans really is kind of alone. It's on its own on this.

KELLY: NPR's Martin Kaste reporting from New Orleans. Thank you, Martin.

KASTE: You're welcome. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",https://www.nhpr.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-04 09:00:03.720291

Professors shared their expertise on emerging topics like artificial intelligence, providing a deeper look at new technology through a Jesuit lens. Loyola magazine put a spotlight on the members of Loyola’s alumni community who are creating touch-sensitive artificial limbs and breaking the NBA’s biggest news.

As the year draws to a close, catch up on the most-read stories from Loyola magazine and Loyola Today.

1. How ESPN’s Shams Charania (BA ’17) became the NBA’s scoop king

Shams Charania (BA ’17), the sports journalist who broke the massive trade between the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers earlier this year that included stars Luka Dončić and Anthony Davis, has become the premier NBA breaking news source. Charania worked relentlessly through his early career, balancing breaking stories with his classwork at Loyola, where he studied at the School of Communication.

“Anytime you’re young and trying to pursue something, there’s no template,” Charania says.

2. Honoring an icon

When Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, BVM, died in October at the age of 106, the Loyola community gathered in a week of remembrance that culminated in a well-attended wake and funeral mass at Madonna della Strada Chapel. Rev. Michael J. Garanzini, S.J., president emeritus of Loyola, offered a homily celebrating the “small acts of kindness that endeared [Sister Jean] to thousands.”

“No one better exemplified a Christian Ignatian educator,” he said, calling her an “ever-present surrogate grandmother to countless students.”

3. Rooted in Jesuit tradition, Loyola builds community among faiths

From its 1870 founding as St. Ignatius College in Chicago’s Near North Side neighborhood, Loyola has made Jesuit, Catholic principles the bedrock of its mission and ethos. An 1870–1871 school catalog notes that Catholic students were “frequently and carefully instructed in their holy religion,” with “the most solicitous attention paid to the morals of all.”

“We take our religion so seriously, but because we do, we educate all and meet people where they are. We propose, we discuss, but we don’t insist,” says Michael Murphy, the director of Loyola’s Hank Center for the Catholic Intellectual Heritage. “We ask, ‘What is God doing over there? Where might we need to meet with our imagination to cultivate faith, reason, and a more humane and just society?’”

4. With head, heart, and guts, Allison Guth is coaching the Ramblers to success

Ramblers women’s basketball Head Coach Allison Guth shares her inspiring on resilience, failure, and teamwork that provides the foundation for her coaching leadership.

“The ability to push yourself to the limit, to see the world outside of yourself, and to serve, that’s what the game of basketball is. It’s about celebrating the stat that doesn’t show up. It’s the charge take, the gut play. It’s our entire culture at Loyola,” Guth says.

5. How Loyola is bringing artificial intelligence and ethics into the classroom

As they integrate AI in their classrooms, many professors at Loyola are attempting to strike a delicate balance: embracing the technology for education and research aimed at benefiting the common good, while taking steps to heed the warnings of Pope Leo XIV, who, in his inaugural address to the College of Cardinals, noted the risks artificial intelligence—if not properly addressed—poses to “human dignity, justice and labor.”

Using artificial intelligence ethically and responsibly—to support and augment critical thinking, rather than to stand in for it—will “make a big, big difference in our students’ abilities to get jobs,” said Executive Lecturer Steven Keith Platt, who directs the AI Business Consortium and the Lab for Applied AI in the Quinlan School of Business.

7. How a Loyola alum built the world’s first touch-sensing bionic hand

Aadeel Akhtar (BS ’07, MS ’08) has made it possible for amputees to simulate feeling with the Ability Hand, a bionic prosthetic hand that allows its user to more easily perform two handed functions. Inspired by a trip to Ecuador, Akhtar created a top-tier, easy-to-use device that was also economically accessible.

“For us, at PSYONIC, yes, we are pushing to make the most advanced technologically possible bionic limbs, but we also have to make them accessible because if they’re not accessible, then it defeats the entire purpose of everything that we’re trying to do,” Akhtar says.

8. At the U.S.-Mexico border, Loyola law students learn to be people for others

Loyola law students joined six faculty members on a weeklong immersion trip to southern Arizona for a course called Immigration Practicum: Advancing International Human Rights Protections.

The Loyola School of Law’s Center for the Human Rights of Children, an interdisciplinary academic center with a mission to advance and protect the rights of young people, spearheaded the trip, which engaged students in critical questions surrounding asylum and human rights.

“Many, many components of the University have been focused on this one issue: How do we serve and accompany migrants?” Michèle Alexandre, the dean of the School of Law, said.

9. Meet the Loyola alum whose honey has Chicago foodies abuzz

Abdullah Motiwala (BS ’14) grew up hating honey. Once Motiwala tried the real stuff—raw, unfiltered, unpasteurized—he could immediately taste the difference. That taste of the good stuff formed the foundation for what would become Heaven’s Honey, the Elmhurst-based honey business that Motiwala founded in 2015.

“There was this gap between the chefs who wanted the product, and the supplier who couldn’t meet demands,” Motiwala told Loyola Today. “There had to be somebody who was in the middle as a beekeeper, as someone who cares deeply about the bees and understands the culinary world, to say, ‘OK chef, we’ll work with you.’”",https://news.luc.edu/app/uploads/2025/12/top10-2025.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 09:00:12.726445

Deqa Dhalac, D-South Portland, also gave speeches during the event.","PORTLAND — A day after the season’s first storm blanketed the city, hundreds of students marched through the snow to protest the detention of two of their peers, and the increased presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their city.

“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted.

“Funding for jobs and education, not for mass incarceration!”

More than 500 students from Portland’s public middle and high schools and the private Waynflete School marched from Monument Square to City Hall on Wednesday afternoon in a show of solidarity for their detained classmates and other Mainers affected by immigration enforcement.

The event comes weeks after two Portland high schoolers, 16-year-old Joel Andre and 14-year-old Estefania Andre, were detained by ICE along with their mother and older sister after being denied asylum in Canada. The family is originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

An immigration judge ordered the removal of the family in February because they had entered the country illegally, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. The family appealed that decision, but it was dismissed on Oct. 31, after which they sought asylum in Canada.

As of last week, Joel and Estefania were being held in immigration custody in Texas with their mother, while their older sister was separated from the family and is being held in New York. Todd Pomerleau, an attorney representing the family, said his firm has filed a petition with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston to review the family’s request to stay in the country.

Pomerleau said in a phone call Wednesday that he and his colleagues are working to have the family released from custody so they can be reunited.

Joel is a junior at Deering High School and Estefania is a freshman at Casco Bay High School.

Wednesday’s event was organized by Casco Bay seniors Evie Jones and Caroline Chong, and Waynflete junior Omari Brent, who said they quickly received support from other schools and community groups. Jones and Chong said after news broke about the detention of the Andres, students in the freshman class at their school were deeply upset, which inspired them to organize the rally.

Students left their schools around 12:15 p.m. (organizers said they worked with the Greater Portland Metro to send extra buses to Casco Bay and Deering high schools) and arrived in Monument Square, where they gathered before marching to fill the plaza in front of City Hall.

From the steps of the municipal building, students, teachers and other community members said through megaphones that Maine and Portland should be safe places for immigrants and refugees to live, work and go to school. They stressed the importance of speaking up for those who can’t out of fear.

“We are the only ones who can break the pattern and work towards a country that embraces peace and diversity,” Chong said.

Speakers in Portland focused on the lives and personalities of the detained students. Estefania was described by her classmates as a bright light, and by her teacher Kerry Herlihy as the first student to class every day, who would share her lunch with everyone, and as “someone who can bring joy into any room she enters.” And Joel was a beloved member of Portland’s soccer community, who teammate and Deering senior Jack Borland called loyal, supportive, and the “guy who shows up when no one else does.”

“Instead of being in school, and instead of practicing with us, instead of living in a community that loves him, Joel is sitting in a detention facility in Texas,” Borland said. “Not because he’s dangerous, not because he’s done harm, but because our system is broken. It targets people of color, treating them with suspicion first and humanity second.”

Speakers also criticized the actions of ICE agents in Portland and around the country, while signs held by attendees called for an end to the agency.

The public walkout came just one day after President Donald Trump, who has made aggressive immigration enforcement a hallmark of his second term, targeted Somali Americans during a Cabinet meeting, calling them “garbage.” His administration also pledged to increase ICE presence in Minnesota, which like Maine has a large population of Somali immigrants.

Deering junior Anfa Ahmed’s sign read “ICE should only be in my drink.” She didn’t know the Andre family directly, but showed up because, she said, nobody should have to go through what they have, and to stand with the community.

“I believe it’s important that we all come together to face this issue head-on,” she said.

Portland Assistant Superintendent Abdullahi Ahmed, speaking as a private citizen and not a representative of the district, and Rep. Deqa Dhalac, D-South Portland, also gave speeches during the event.

“No one should be forced into the shadows simply because they came here searching for a better life,” said Dhalac, the former mayor of South Portland and the country’s first Somali-American mayor. “No one should be caged for seeking safety.”

The demonstration ended with a singalong to the Woody Guthrie folk anthem “This Land is Your Land.”

At another market about 2 miles away, 24 Somali Mall, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey paid a visit to calm jangled nerves and show his support on Wednesday afternoon.
They asked him for his identification before letting him go, the man later told CNN.
“I’m a numbers guy.” Still, Mohamud said he believes Trump’s rhetoric will boost the president’s standing at the expense of the local Somali community.
“You know, people will rally behind him, you know … making America great, whatever that means, right?” Nasir Abdi, a patron at 24 Somali Mall, echoed the sentiment.","Everything seemed normal at Minneapolis’s Somali markets: Men sat in barber chairs, women browsed colorful garments at the boutiques and patrons sampled fried sambusas and rice dishes at the eateries, sometimes as the Muslim call to prayer was sung at low volume over the loudspeakers.

But beneath the calm surface, a quiet anxiety was palpable.

Pockets and purses hung a little heavier with immigration documents and passports as the specter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown loomed over the gathering spots for the Somali diaspora in the Twin Cities – home to the nation’s largest population of people from the East African country.

A new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation targeting undocumented Somali immigrants has begun in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, a source with knowledge of the plans told CNN Wednesday. The cities are the latest target of Trump’s sweeping deportation push that has seen a surge of federal agents flooding the streets of blue cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans.

With the President of the United States disparaging their community as “garbage,” many in Minneapolis’s Somali community were feeling unsettled – as evidenced by the sparser than normal crowds at two different malls and the occasional shuttered shop.

A young man working at a bakery at the Karmel Mall south of downtown Minneapolis said the shopping center on Tuesday night was dead compared to usual.

The man, who only gave his first name, Fawzi, said he is nervous even though he was born in Minneapolis.

“I feel scared,” he said. “Imagine you’re just sitting in your car and then just someone walks up and is like, ‘Yo, you gotta come with me.’”

At the sprawling indoor mall, offices offering visa and overseas shipping services are interspersed with henna shops, rows of boutiques selling traditional Somali attire, colorful prayer mats and gold jewelry. Overhead, a blue ceiling with white stars symbolizes the flag of Somalia.

At another market about 2 miles away, 24 Somali Mall, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey paid a visit to calm jangled nerves and show his support on Wednesday afternoon.

Frey was waiting in line to buy a Somali confection at a bakery when a woman went up to him and showed him her green card. She told him she was carrying it because she was scared.

“I mean, she’s an American citizen,” Frey later told CNN. “She’s been here for 25 years, in Minneapolis.”

Carrying ID cards and papers out of fear

As the mayor posed for photos and chatted with shoppers at 24 Somali Mall, a different scene played out just outside.

Three vehicles with tinted windows and Virginia plates pulled to a stop near a man who was panhandling on a snowy street. Multiple armed men in law enforcement vests marked “ERO,” or Enforcement and Removal Operations, came out, CNN witnessed.

They asked him for his identification before letting him go, the man later told CNN.

The man, who declined to give his name, said he is a 35-year-old US citizen who was born in Buffalo, New York.

He said he showed the agents his “papers,” and added he wouldn’t have had a problem with doing so had the agents not been so “aggressive.”

“They grabbed my hand,” he said. “You shouldn’t do that. … Other than that I got no problem being verified.”

Frey noted that of the more than 80,000 people of Somali descent in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the vast majority are citizens or legal residents; just a few hundred have temporary protected status – a protection that President Donald Trump has threatened to remove.

“It’s a fairly small number, but again, they are here legally,” he said, adding he fears federal agents will violate the Constitution by “arresting American citizens for looking like they’re Somali.”

Others told CNN they, too, were carrying ID cards and papers for fear of getting stopped.

Kamal Ali, who runs a dump truck business with his father and brother, made sure to stick his passport in his wallet before heading to Karmel Mall to grab dinner.

“I don’t want no issues,” said the 39-year-old, who said he came to the US at age 10 with his parents after living in a refugee camp in Somalia.

The mayor on Wednesday signed an executive order to prohibit federal, state and local law-enforcement agents from using city-owned parking lots, ramps, garages or vacant lots for staging immigration enforcement operations.

The order was modeled on a similar policy in Chicago, where federal immigration authorities had previously used municipal lots to stage operations, Minneapolis city officials said in a statement.

Frey’s order will also create a “signage template” for local businesses and property owners who want to mark their property as off-limits for these activities, the statement said.

Abdul Abdullahi, who runs an employment office at 24 Somali Mall, said he finds Trump’s words about the Somali community “shameful.”

“It’s very unfortunate for someone in the highest office in the world to generalize and demean a whole community by saying that they are garbage – they’re of no good,” said Abdullahi, 39, who said he’s been living in Minneapolis for decades. “This is just an attempt to divide us – an attempt to pit us against each other.”

When asked about comments from President Donald Trump about not wanting Somali immigrants in the United States, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, speaking with CNN, cited data analysis on Somalis in Minneapolis and other parts of the country that suggests there is “widespread fraud, particularly marriage fraud, when it comes to immigration.”

Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority — 87% — are naturalized US citizens.

Citizens of Somalia were first granted Temporary Protected Status in 1991 when the country was plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown. In 2013, the US officially recognized the Somali government in Mogadishu for the first time in two decades.

Somalis have maintained Temporary Protected Status “due to insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees,” according to the legislation.

Mixed opinions within the community

Not all who spoke with CNN were critics of Trump. Some said they voted for him.

Among them was a 40-year-old patron at Karmel Mall who said he attended a Trump rally in Minneapolis in 2019 but was turned away as the venue was filled to capacity.

“The economy was really good the first term,” said the man, a mechanical engineer who only wanted to share his first name, Mohamud. “I’m a numbers guy.”

Still, Mohamud said he believes Trump’s rhetoric will boost the president’s standing at the expense of the local Somali community.

“This will give him a boost of support,” he said. “You know, people will rally behind him, you know … making America great, whatever that means, right?”

Nasir Abdi, a patron at 24 Somali Mall, echoed the sentiment.

“This is just a show,” he said.

Some Somali residents addressed a $300-million fraud scandal in Minnesota in which dozens of people – the vast majority of them of Somali descent – were charged.

Trump referenced the scandal, which diverted money meant to feed children during the pandemic to fraudsters, a week before Thanksgiving, calling Minnesota a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” as he announced plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents in the state.

“There’s a few bad apples, you know, that committed crimes and broke the law, but at the same time, you can’t do a collective punishment,” said Ali, the man who works at his family’s dump truck business.

Frey put a similar point in stronger terms.

“If you stole food from children and money that should have gone towards housing, you should go to jail,” he said, while eating a plate of goat meat and rice at 24 Somali Mall. “You do not hold an entire community accountable for the actions of the fraudsters.”

He added: “I’m Jewish, and nobody ever held me accountable for Bernie Madoff’s financial crimes.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-12-03t131100z-2034913129-rc2m8ia0h3fk-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-minnesota.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-04 06:57:27.988310

""Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

""It is asinine that these monsters were released back onto New Orleans streets to COMMIT MORE CRIMES and create more victims.

""Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.""

In its announcement, DHS included several examples of illegal immigrants who were released from custody despite their criminal records. Those on the list were arrested for crimes such as aggravated assault with a firearm, domestic abuse, driving under the influence, home invasion and sexual battery, among others.

New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick sparked backlash last week after saying that illegal immigration by foreign nationals in the U.S. is a ""civil issue"" and that her agency would not enforce certain immigration laws.

""We will not enforce civil law, and so our support is to make sure they're not going to get hurt and our community is not in danger,"" Kirkpatrick said.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media that she spoke with Kirkpatrick about the remarks and reaffirmed that ""it is a state crime to obstruct ICE and federal immigration enforcement.""

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY DRIVING DRUNK AT EXTREME SPEED KILLED WOMAN IN VIOLENT CRASH: DHS

The Trump administration has put an emphasis on its crackdown on illegal immigration, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accusing the Biden administration of using DHS to ""invade the country with terrorists.""

""If you think about what Joe Biden did with the Department of Homeland Security, he used this department to invade the country with terrorists. He opened up the borders, let anybody come in that wanted to,"" Noem said at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. ""He put 'em on airplanes, he let them through our airports, where if they could figure out a way to get to our shores and in our country, he just opened the door and invited them in. So, it's our job to get 'em out.""

As part of the launch of Operation Catahoula Crunch, DHS released a list of 10 illegal immigrants who the department said had been arrested and then released back onto the streets of Louisiana. DHS said that two of the men on the list have since been deported.

Juan Ramon Dubon-Argueta, a Honduran national who DHS notes was ""previously removed"" from the U.S., was arrested for aggravated assault child endangerment, aggravated assault with a firearm, domestic abuse, home invasion and property damage.

Vu Hoang Pham, an illegal immigrant from Vietnam, was arrested for a litany of crimes, including aggravated battery, domestic abuse and aggravated assault, grand theft auto, aggravated assault, second-degree aggravated battery, battery of a police officer, simple burglary, public intoxication, theft, burglary — criminal conspiracy, driving under the influence, possession of burglary tools, fraud, false impersonation and other drug related crimes, DHS said.

Jose Fernando Arzu-Osorto, a Honduran national in the U.S. illegally, was arrested for indecent behavior with a juvenile under 17 and armed robbery. He was released due to sanctuary policies and went on to be arrested again for armed robbery.

Darwin Alexis Murillo-Ponce, an illegal immigrant from Honduras, was arrested for second-degree aggravated battery and was subsequently released due to sanctuary policies, DHS said.

DHS also named Hared Fransisco Cruz-Alvarado, an illegal immigrant from Honduras who has been deported, was arrested while in the U.S. for third-degree rape, simple battery, and criminal trespass.

Qise Awni Ahmad Al Besani, an illegal immigrant from Jordan, was arrested for sexual battery.

Andres Lopez-Castillejos, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who has been removed from the U.S. four times, was arrested for domestic abuse, child endangerment, armed robbery and driving without a license.

Melvin Arnaul Velasquez-Ordonez, who hails from Honduras, was arrested for domestic abuse, child endangerment and simple assault while in the U.S. illegally, DHS said.

The department said Guatemalan illegal immigrant Andy Javier Ruano-Reyes was arrested for possession of a stolen firearm.

Also named was Jason Steven Arce-Arce, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador who has been deported after being arrested for burglary and minor in possession of alcohol.

On Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released new guidance pausing immigration from 19 countries, 12 of which were on full travel bans while the other seven were under partial restrictions. The impacted nations are Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

The immigration pause, which is effective immediately, applies to nationals from the 19 listed nations who entered the U.S. on or after Jan. 20, 2021, the date of former President Joe Biden's inauguration. Migrants from one of the 19 countries who came into the U.S. after that date will be subjected to a re-review process that could include an interview to screen for all possible national security and public safety risks.

It also impacts all green card and citizenship applications for anyone hailing from one of the now-restricted countries. Individuals from one of the 19 nations who have already passed the citizenship test will not be able to have U.S. citizenship ceremonies until after the guidance is lifted.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/ice-new-orleans-immigration-protest.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 05:56:46.785716

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement about the New Orleans operation that it is “targeting criminal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies that force local authorities to ignore U.S. immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest detainers,” or requests to hold people authorities have arrested for ICE.

Trump had not specified as of Wednesday morning how many guard troops he would send.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that those targeted in New Orleans include people released after being arrested for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto and rape.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has said he welcomes the administration’s intervention in the Democrat-run city, which has logged significant drops in crime and is on pace to have its lowest number of homicides in nearly 50 years, according to crime data from the police department.

Shortly after the DHS announcement, the FBI in New Orleans said that federal agents and state police will launch a joint effort to “deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement action” during DHS’ immigration enforcement in the city.

Ahead of the start of immigration operations in New Orleans, some of the state’s immigrants said they were afraid and were taking precautions, with one Honduran immigrant telling Noticias Telemundo he hadn’t left his home in two weeks. “We’ve stopped going to work because our fear is that we’ll be stopped,” the immigrant, who was not shown on camera and whose name was withheld, said. “We’re shut in, and like me there are many.”

On Wednesday, New Orleans resident Rocío Tirado said she was delivering groceries and paychecks to families who were too scared to leave their homes. “They’re afraid because everybody’s hiding,” she told NBC News.

Tirado said only eight of 140 children had come to soccer practice Tuesday night; many of their parents are immigrants.

“This is just sad,” she said. “It’s horrible to see it.”

Tirado added she has been waking up at 6 a.m. to drive some of the children to school because their parents are too scared to leave their homes.

“Some of these people have a work authorization and they have Social Security,” she said, and they are still too scared.

It’s also affecting children, Tirado said, recalling a child who told her she called her mom three times from school and got scared the one time she didn’t pick up. “She was scared her mom was gone,” she said.

The state and New Orleans had seen growth in their Latino and immigrant populations since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when citizens and noncitizens arrived to clean and restore the city and surrounding areas. Much of the state’s Latino population is based in Jefferson Parish, where Hispanics are 19% of the population. The parish includes the city of Kenner, where Hispanics are about 30% of the population.

The Trump administration also began an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News Wednesday.

Confirmation of that launch follows reports that the administration was planning an immigration crackdown this week in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where a number of Somali immigrants and their family members live.

A senior law enforcement administration official told NBC News that ICE officers are not specifically targeting Somali immigrants and their families but may be arresting some who they allege have violated immigration laws.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump ended a Cabinet meeting by unleashing a tirade against Minnesota’s population of Somalis, saying “they should go back to where they came from” and calling Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., “garbage.”

“I don’t want them in our country. I’ll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care. I don’t want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason,” Trump said. The president previously also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling him a slur that disparages people with disabilities.

A representative for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but she said on X: “His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.” Omar’s family fled the civil war in Somalia and lived in a Kenyan refugee camp before she moved to the U.S. and became a citizen.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-immigration-enforcement-new-orleans-mn-1320-00aedf.jpg",N,,2025-12-04 03:57:41.721468

Most of them entered the United States with a special status called humanitarian parole under a program called Operation Allies Welcome.
Mr. Trump has announced additional measures that could jeopardize the ability of Afghans in the United States to remain permanently.","In the frenzied American exit from Afghanistan, Obaidullah Durani, a fighter pilot who had been trained by U.S. forces, was scrambling to get his family out, too. His daughter, Hela, was hoisted over the fence by a Marine at the Kabul airport as the family rushed to make a departing plane. But Mr. Durani’s wife, Shafaro, was separated from him and their two children and never made it onto an evacuation flight.

Allowed to enter the United States through a special program for people who worked with American forces, Mr. Durani settled in Arizona, with his infant daughter and toddler son. He had never changed a diaper in his life, he said, but he was now a single father juggling parenting with delivery jobs. Yet he felt safe in the United States and hopeful that the family would eventually be reunited.

That all changed with the deadly attack on National Guard members last week in Washington, D.C., which authorities say was carried out by a 29-year-old Afghan man.

Following the attack, President Trump directed his administration to suspend all Afghan immigration cases and immigration agents have been ordered to track down nearly 2,000 Afghans who have what are known as final deportation orders but are not in detention.

That threatens the lives built by the Duranis and thousands of other Afghan families in the United States.

Mr. Trump has seized on the shooting to intensify his broader anti-immigration campaign, and he has sought to depict the attack and the man charged, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, as evidence of a dangerously broken system he inherited from President Biden.

“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” the president said on Truth Social. “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”

All told, about 200,000 Afghans who were considered wartime allies of the United States have been admitted to the United States since the chaotic pullout that concluded the 20-year occupation. Many had worked alongside U.S. troops in combat or on bases; others were employed by organizations — including The Times and other media outlets — as well as institutions that supported U.S. operations or interests.

The rhetoric and the threats from Mr. Trump have stirred panic in communities that are home to many Afghan arrivals, including the Phoenix area where about 4,000 have settled since 2021.

On Monday, after school pickup, Mr. Durani was among dozens of Afghans who crowded the Arizona Refugee Center, a nonprofit in Mesa, outside Phoenix, seeking answers.

He and his children have a green card interview scheduled for Dec. 17. He had many questions: Would the interview still take place? And, if it did, could his family end up being detained? Deported? What about his wife, whose process to enter the United States was now at a standstill?

“Every Afghan is worried,” said Mr. Durani, who delivers Amazon packages. “They shouldn’t punish all of us because of one person.”

“I’m here contributing, working, paying my taxes,” he said. “This is a country of laws and democracy; the man has been arrested.”

“Right now, if you leave the country, you might not be allowed back,” Ms. Peterson told one caller, who had plans to visit family members in Pakistan. “It’s too risky, even if you have a green card.”

Mirwais Daudzai, who also visited the center, works at the Phoenix airport assisting passengers who require wheelchairs. He greets them with a smile, asks about their journeys and eases them into the chairs. When travelers learn that he fled to the United States from his native Afghanistan, he said many tell him they are glad he is safe in America. Some slip him a generous tip.

That kindness seemed to vanish last week, Mr. Daudzai said, after the deadly attack in Washington, D.C., and the anti-immigrant measures announced by the government.

On Thanksgiving, the day after the shooting, a traveler was about to hand Mr. Daudzai a $20 bill, but shoved it into her pocket instead after hearing he was from Afghanistan.

It happened again over the long holiday weekend, Mr. Daudzai said. It was a hostility he had not previously encountered since arriving in the United States.

“Before this problem, I’m so happy and relaxed in this country,” said Mr. Daudzai, 31. “I have a job, I’m safe, I have no enemies.”

Now, “people are looking at all Afghans as terrorists,” said Mr. Daudzai, who was a police officer in his homeland and is in the United States with his wife. Both have active green card applications.

In the days since the shooting, U.S. officials have disclosed that Mr. Lakanwal was part of a paramilitary force that worked with the C.I.A. and was admitted to the United States as part of the effort to protect Afghan allies after the Taliban returned to power. Earlier this year, Mr. Lakanwal was granted asylum, which allowed him to remain in the United States and to seek a green card and citizenship.

For years, the admission into the United States of Afghans who supported the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan has enjoyed bipartisan support.

Before being allowed into the United States, the evacuees underwent extensive vetting. Many spent weeks or months in overseas way stations, such as Qatar, where they had to complete security checks, medical screenings and immigration paperwork. Once in the United States, they typically spent weeks on military bases before being resettled in communities across the country.

Most of them entered the United States with a special status called humanitarian parole under a program called Operation Allies Welcome. They then applied for asylum, which put them on the path to permanent residency in the country that gave them safe haven.

“They have worked for the last four years to achieve stability and integrate into American life,’’ said Ms. Larsen, co-founder of the refugee center in Mesa, Ariz.

Thousands of Afghans awaiting approval have been stranded in third countries, including Pakistan, which has stepped up its own expulsion of Afghans who have settled there.

The Trump administration had already sharply restricted Afghan immigration as part of a travel ban announced in June, dashing hopes of many separated families that they would be reunited any time soon.

But the future of many Afghans, both those already in the United States and those hoping to immigrate, has been clouded by the Nov. 26 shooting, which killed one Guard member, Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and wounded another, Andrew Wolfe, 24.

Mr. Trump has announced additional measures that could jeopardize the ability of Afghans in the United States to remain permanently. Among them is a plan to conduct new security checks of people already granted green cards, or lawful permanent residency.

As of Tuesday, the Trump administration has suspended the processing of all immigration applications filed by nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, who had been barred from entering the United States under an executive order Mr. Trump issued in June. It is unclear when, or if, the suspension might be lifted.

Hekmatullah, 38, who said he was a former spokesman for the Ministry of Transport in Afghanistan, visited the center to seek camaraderie with fellow Afghans. His immigration status is especially precarious.

He, his wife and their three young daughters fled first to Iran, then to South America, where they joined the wave of humanity trudging through the perilous Darien Gap to make their way to North America.

They crossed the U.S. border with Mexico early last year and headed to Phoenix, where a brother-in-law, a former cargo plane pilot, had been resettled in 2021.

Hekmatullah, who spoke on condition that he be identified only by his first name to protect relatives in Afghanistan, applied for asylum, got a work permit and found a job at the airport.

His daughters, 11, 9 and 7, are thriving in school and already speak flawless English. In Afghanistan, they would be deprived of educational opportunities because they are girls.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/03/multimedia/00nat-phoenix-afghans-1-lfwv/00nat-phoenix-afghans-1-lfwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 01:56:36.105991

Texas appealed Biery’s ruling, sending the case to the same court where a three-judge panel recently blocked Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law from taking effect.","More legal battles are brewing over Texas’ requirement that schools display posters of the Ten Commandments, as a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a state law that has the potential to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on Jan. 20 will hear both the Texas case and a similar case happening in Louisiana, which was the first state to pass a requirement to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.

The Texas lawsuit is one of several cases that families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds have brought forward challenging the state’s Ten Commandments law. Two federal district judges have blocked more than two dozen Texas school districts from complying with the law, saying that the legislation is unconstitutional.

The rulings in those cases only apply to the 25 school districts named in the lawsuits. The civil rights organizations sued another 16 districts in early December. In that class action lawsuit, they asked a federal judge to block every Texas school district from displaying the Ten Commandments.

The attorney general’s office has insisted that school districts not involved in the lawsuits implement the law. It sued the Round Rock, Leander and Galveston districts in November for allegedly not complying with the requirement as arguments over its constitutionality proceed in federal court.

Attorneys representing the families and the attorney general’s office have argued in court over the role Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison played in developing the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment, which protects people's freedom of religion.

Both parties have debated the influence of the Ten Commandments on the country’s legal and educational systems, and whether the version of the Ten Commandments required to go up in schools belongs to a particular religious group. They have also sparred over whether the law reflects an attempt by Texas officials to coerce students into adhering to Judeo-Christian principles.

Texas' Ten Commandments law was one of the latest measures passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year. Critics say the law inappropriately injects religion into the state's public schools, attended by roughly 5.5 million children.

Here are the latest details about the cases against the law:

The latest

U.S. District Judge Orlando L. Garcia on Nov. 18 ordered 14 districts to remove the posters from classroom walls by Dec. 1. Garcia concluded that the law “makes it impossible” for children to avoid the Ten Commandment displays. He noted that districts have a “strong incentive” to comply with the law, citing the state’s recent lawsuit against the Galveston school district for its alleged noncompliance.

In August, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blocked 11 other school districts from posting the Ten Commandments. Biery concluded that the law favors Christianity over other faiths, is not neutral with respect to religion and is likely to interfere with families’ ""exercise of their sincere religious or nonreligious beliefs in substantial ways.""

""There are ways in which students could be taught any relevant history of the Ten Commandments without the state selecting an official version of scripture, approving it in state law, and then displaying it in every classroom on a permanent basis,"" Biery wrote in his opinion, adding that the law ""crosses the line from exposure to coercion.""

Texas appealed Biery’s ruling, sending the case to the same court where a three-judge panel recently blocked Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law from taking effect. Texas requested that all 17 active judges on the court hear the case, as opposed to a three-judge panel.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and a coalition of religious freedom organizations are representing the families in both cases. Attorneys had expressed hope that other districts would not implement the law, but they later told the court in a legal filing that many districts are implementing it or have signaled an intent to do so.

Soon after Biery’s ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called on every school district not blocked by the courts from posting the Ten Commandments to follow the law. Paxton has sued the Galveston, Round Rock and Leander school districts for allegedly not complying. The Leander district pushed back, saying it is in compliance.

The background

Senate Bill 10, by Republican Sen. Phil King of Weatherford, required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms on donated posters sized at least 16 by 20 inches. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law in late June, the day after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found a similar law in Louisiana was ""plainly unconstitutional."" The court ruled that requiring schools to post the Ten Commandments would cause an ""irreparable deprivation"" of First Amendment rights. An Arkansas judge ruled similarly in a separate case.

Supporters argue that the Ten Commandments and teachings of Christianity broadly are vital to understanding U.S. history, a controversial message that has resurged in recent years as part of a broader national movement to undermine the long-held interpretation of church-state separation. Texas GOP lawmakers have passed a number of laws in recent years to further codify their conservative religious views, a trend encouraged and celebrated by Christian leaders.

""This issue is likely to get to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biery, the judge, told a San Antonio courtroom prior to opening arguments in one of the Texas cases.

Biery’s August ruling blocking the law from taking full effect applied to the following school districts: Alamo Heights, North East, Lackland, Northside, Austin, Lake Travis, Dripping Springs, Houston, Fort Bend, Cypress-Fairbanks and Plano.

The latest ruling from Garcia blocks the law in the following districts: Comal, Georgetown, Conroe, Flour Bluff, Fort Worth, Arlington, McKinney, Frisco, Northwest, Azle, Rockwall, Lovejoy, Mansfield, McAllen.

Two of those districts — Arlington and McAllen — are no longer part of the lawsuit but agreed to follow the court’s rulings.

Another group of parents filed a similar lawsuit in Dallas during the summer. That lawsuit does not appear to have made any meaningful progress. A judge has threatened to dismiss the case if the plaintiffs do not provide required legal documents to the defendants by Dec. 1.

The most recent lawsuit, filed on Dec. 2, asks the court to block the law in the rest of the state, but it specifically names the following districts in the complaint: Argyle, Birdville, Carroll, Clear Creek, Deer Park, Fort Sam Houston, Hurst-Euless-Bedford, Katy, Liberty Hill, Magnolia, Medina Valley, Pearland, Prosper, Richardson, Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City and Wylie.

What are the plaintiffs saying

Oral arguments in the first Texas case, Rabbi Nathan v. Alamo Heights Independent School District, concluded in August, several weeks after 16 families represented by the religious freedom organizations sued the state over what their lawyers called “catastrophically unconstitutional"" legislation.

""Posting the Ten Commandments in public schools is un-American and un-Baptist,"" Griff Martin, a pastor, parent and plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""S.B. 10 undermines the separation of church and state as a bedrock principle of my family's Baptist heritage. Baptists have long held that the government has no role in religion — so that our faith may remain free and authentic.""

The lawyers made a similar argument during a November hearing for Cribbs Ringer v. Comal Independent School District, the latest legal filing, which includes more than a dozen new families.

In the lawsuit brought by the North Texas parents, the plaintiffs, who identify as Christian, said the law was unconstitutional and violated their right to direct their children's upbringing.

One of them, a Christian minister, said the displays will offer a message of religious intolerance, ""implying that anyone who does not believe in the state's official religious scripture is an outsider and not fully part of the community."" That message, the minister argued, conflicts with the religious, social justice and civil rights beliefs he seeks to teach his kids.

Another North Texas plaintiff, a mother of two, is worried she will be ""forced"" to have sensitive and perhaps premature conversations about topics like adultery with her young children — and also ""does not desire that her minor children to be instructed by their school about the biblical conception of adultery,"" the suit states.

The plaintiffs in the ACLU suits come from diverse religious backgrounds, including families who are nonreligious. Allison Fitzpatrick said in a statement that she fears her children will think they are violating school rules because they don't adhere to commandments like honoring the Sabbath.

""The state of Texas has no right to dictate to children how many gods to worship, which gods to worship, or whether to worship any gods at all,"" said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which brought the lawsuit alongside the ACLU.

The attorneys called the version of the Ten Commandments in SB 10 a “state-sponsored Protestant version,” which was corroborated by their witness, constitutional law professor and religious history expert Steven Green. They argued against the notion that the Ten Commandments were central to the development of the country’s legal and educational systems, which Green agreed lacked historical support.

The ACLU lawyers have also noted that students are legally required to attend school and have virtually no way to avoid seeing the state's required version of the Ten Commandments, which they say interferes with children's and families' rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has already found public schools' display of the Ten Commandments unconstitutional, and the attorneys have made clear that only the Supreme Court can overturn its previous rulings.

What the state is saying

The attorney general’s office has argued that the Ten Commandments are part of the nation’s history and heritage, and that previous rulings from federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the commandments from going up in classrooms did not examine that historical significance.

Attorneys for the state have noted that the Supreme Court recently shot down the test that courts previously relied on to determine when a government had unconstitutionally endorsed or established a religion. And attorneys pointed out a decades-old ruling in a Nebraska case, regarding a Ten Commandments monument on city property, where an appeals court decided in favor of the monument that displayed the same version of the commandments Texas wants to show in public schools. They relied on that ruling to make the case that SB 10 does not favor a particular religious group.

""There is no legal reason to stop Texas from honoring a core ethical foundation of our law, especially not a bogus claim about the ‘separation of church and state,' which is a phrase found nowhere in the Constitution,"" Paxton said in a recent statement.

The attorney general’s viewpoints were supported in court by Mark David Hall, a professor and author who studies religious liberty and church-state relations. Hall, the state’s expert witness, recently wrote a book that considers how “Christian Nationalism Is Not an Existential Threat to America or the Church.”

Attorney William Farrell from the attorney general’s office described SB 10’s requirement as a “passive display on the wall” that does not rise to the level of coercion because students can choose to ignore the posters if they wish. The law would ""probably cross the line,"" he said, if it also incorporated the Ten Commandments into lessons or assignments — but that is not the case.

The posters must only go up if they are donated to the school, he further argued, and the law does not specify what would happen if districts choose not to comply. The state views that as evidence that it poses no threat or harm to families, even though Attorney General Ken Paxton recently issued a legal advisory threatening action if schools do not comply and has sued three districts for their noncompliance.

“SB 10 doesn’t restrict anything,” Farrell said. “It doesn’t exclude anything or specifically require any … participation by students.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/26111335/20250626_TenCommandments_03-1500x1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 22:57:39.363625

These sweeping measures represent a dangerous escalation of discriminatory immigration policy and threaten to upend the lives of tens of thousands of families.

“This policy is clear discrimination, not security,” said Jamal Abdi, President of the National Iranian American Council. “By threatening American green card holders and halting all immigration processes based on where you were born, the administration is inflicting collective punishment on entire communities. These actions are unlawful, cruel, and designed to spread fear.”

NIAC has published a detailed community FAQ on the policy and is actively exploring litigation to challenge the legality of these actions. Individuals with pending green card, citizenship, or asylum applications that have been halted are encouraged to submit their information through NIAC’s confidential litigation intake form so the organization can assess potential legal action on their behalf.

“These actions will cause profound harm to longtime U.S. residents, families seeking reunification, and individuals fleeing persecution,” said Abdi. “Lawful permanent residents nearing naturalization now face their futures being thrown into sudden chaos. Asylum seekers escaping political and religious repression are being turned away from safety. Families with spouses awaiting green cards are at risk of prolonged or indefinite separation.”

The announcement comes amid already rampant and arbitrary detention and deportation of Iranian nationals. The level of anguish and insecurity this will cause – on top of existing enforcement abuses – cannot be overstated.

“The administration is once again trying to divide people into ‘good’ and ‘bad’ immigrants to justify cruelty,” Abdi said. “We reject that lie. Every person deserves dignity, due process, and the chance to build a safe life.

Minneapolis parking executive order

What we know:

The order comes after reports that federal immigration agents in Chicago used municipal lots as staging areas before city leaders issued a similar order, according to a news release from the mayor's office.

Executive Order 2025-02 requires city departments to take the following actions:

Identify all city-owned or city-controlled parking lots, parking ramps, vacant lots, or garages that could be used for staging civil immigration enforcement operations;

Post clear signage stating that the space may not be used by any government entity for those purposes: ""This property is owned and/or controlled by the City of Minneapolis. The City of Minneapolis does not authorize this property to be used, and it may not be used, by any federal, state, or local government entity or personnel as a staging area, processing location, operations base, or any other similar use for civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Immediately report any violation of the Executive Order.

Design an optional signage template for private property owners and leasers who wish to lawfully restrict civil immigration enforcement activities in non-public areas.

What they're saying:

Mayor Frey released the following statement:

""Minneapolis is — and will remain — a city that stands up for our residents. City parking lots need to be used for City purposes, which do not include civil immigration enforcement. There’s no place in our Minneapolis for fear-based tactics or operations that undermine community trust. This Executive Order makes it clear: City parking lots, ramps, garages, and vacant lots cannot and will not be used to stage civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara shared the following statement:

""Our work as a police department depends on the community, which includes immigrant communities. Everyone must feel safe seeking help, reporting crimes, and working with our officers.""

What we don't know:

It is not clear how the city plans to enforce this executive order.

FOX 9 has reached out to Minneapolis officials to ask what enforcement actions they can take and will update this story if the city responds.

President Trump targeting Minneapolis Somali community

The backstory:

Twin Cities leaders say an immigration enforcement operation by the Trump Administration to target reportedly undocumented Somali residents in Minneapolis is underway, and federal agents are already knocking on doors.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a Tuesday news conference as many as 100 federal agents will be deployed to the Twin Cities with a specific purpose to target the Somali community. Federal agents have also previously exercised other operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte in recent months.

A local immigration attorney in the Somali community tells FOX 9 he is hearing from clients that an immigration enforcement operation is already underway, and started over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

The source tells FOX 9 one of his clients called him from Fort Snelling after being arrested by ICE officials Tuesday morning outside his home, on his way to work. The client is seeking asylum, with a pending case and authorization to work in the U.S. The man arrested has been in the U.S. for less than two years.

There have also been reports of ICE officers knocking on doors in Minneapolis.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox9.com/www.fox9.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1280/720/mayor-frey.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-03 21:57:45.875681
