One of the GSA employees said ICE has urgently requested the agency find around 300 fully furnished properties with private office space to lease by this winter.

According to three employees at GSA, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive internal operations and to avoid retribution, the agency has created an ""ICE surge"" team in recent weeks, referring to an effort to lease private offices to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency officers to establish long-term work space in the cities where they are operating.

Last week, the GSA's Public Buildings Service posted a solicitation for ""as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space in support of administrative operations for law enforcement"" in 19 cities across the country. The listing estimates each lease would include workstations for 70 people and notes the ""unique"" quick period of one week to submit bids.

One of the GSA employees said ICE has urgently requested the agency find around 300 fully furnished properties with private office space to lease by this winter.

The push is happening just months after the informal White House advisory group, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, fired a large number of GSA employees and terminated a huge chunk of government leases, decisions that are now being reversed in many cases in order to accommodate government procurement needs. There's no clear evidence those cuts saved significant amounts of taxpayer money.

It's also happening alongside a government-wide effort to divert resources towards immigration enforcement, from federal leasing efforts to law enforcement expertise from other agencies like the FBI. Limited enforcement resources, including a lack of funding to bring on more people to conduct arrests and investigations and litigate cases, have been one of the biggest challenges to scaling up the pace of arrests, detentions and deportations.

Congress this summer provided ICE with $75 billion to hire more officers, expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests and deportations. The agency, which started the year with about 20,000 people, is looking to hire more than 10,000 new officers by the end of the year. The agency is offering candidates large signing bonuses of tens of thousands of dollars in a streamlined hiring effort that immigration policy experts and other critics fear could compromise vetting standards.

The agency is also increasing its detention capacity and launching enforcement operations across the country aimed at increasing the number of people arrested and detained. The administration has promoted large-scale operations in cities like Boston and Chicago.

The most recently available immigration detention data publicly published by ICE shows that there are 58,000 people in detention. Immigrant rights advocates have warned that the rapid expansion of arrests and detention is leading to widespread concern over human rights and due process violations for immigrants.

Public polls have increasingly shown that American voters disapprove of how ICE is carrying out its operations, particularly in places like hospitals and other ""protected areas.""

Meanwhile, GSA employees are finding themselves swept into the immigration crackdown.

""It's been incredibly chaotic,"" said one of the GSA employees familiar with the new ""emergency"" lease project.

In addition to finding new office space to lease for ICE, the agency has also requested that GSA identify existing federally owned or leased property that might be suitable for their use in a range of cities across the country. Those cities include Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, New York City, Denver, Chicago, Kansas City, Mo., Greensboro, N.C., and Fort Myers, Fla., according to a list shared with NPR. The list mentions that the properties would be used in enforcement and removal operations. In Boise, Idaho, ICE is looking to spend over a million dollars to expand an existing, leased office space, according to a permit application filed with the city uncovered in reporting by the Idaho Statesman.

The efforts are causing frustration among some GSA employees, who dealt with months of DOGE downsizing and reorganizing at the agency. Now, with around half the staff they had before the government restructuring efforts began, they're being forced to renegotiate cancelled leases with landlords who are ""increasing their rates substantially,"" said one of the GSA employees.

(WTVO) — The City of Rockford shared a “community update” on Thursday morning, informing residents of the presence of ICE vehicles.

According to city officials, an SUV with markings consistent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was seen parked at Rockford Police District 2 headquarters on Broadway.

At 8:23, authorities said ICE agents approached the building, which was closed at that time, but made no contact with anyone inside. The SUV departed at 8:40 p.m., authorities said.

“The Rockford Police Department had no contact with ICE before, during, or after this incident, and we have no information about whether they remain in our community,” the city posted.

In Illinois, the TRUST Act, signed by former Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) in 2017, prevents state law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

Earlier this year, Rockford Police Chief Carla Redd issued a statement on the department’s policy, saying, “The enforcement of civil immigration laws is the primary responsibility of federal agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Rockford Police Department does not participate in civil immigration-related investigations or actions.”

Winnebago County Sheriff Gary Caruana said in a January statement, “Local law enforcement agencies are prohibited from honoring ICE detainers or acting on an individual’s immigration status without a judicial warrant. These legal restrictions limit the ability of local law enforcement to collaborate with federal partners, including ICE, in addressing certain public safety concerns.”

ICE are currently conducting “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago, in an effort to detain and deport “criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

The Department of Homeland Security said the operation was in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed by an undocumented migrant in a drunk-driving crash in Illinois.

Organizers of several Mexican Independence Day and Hispanic Heritage Month events in Rockford said they had canceled the activities due to “safety concerns” over possible ICE enforcement activities.

Earlier this month, DHS had installed a temporary perimeter fence around the federal courthouse building, at 327 S Church Street.

Mayor Tom McNamara has been a vocal opponent of President Donald Trump and his effort to deport criminal aliens from the U.S. interior, calling the president a “dictator” and “sexual predator” at a “No Kings, No Troops” rally on September 6th.

“To our immigrant neighbors: please know this — you are valued, you are cared for and you are an important part of who we are,” the city posted in a Facebook statement earlier this month.

Since President Trump's election last November, federal use of the state database skyrocketed 188%, with ICE searches for driver and vehicle records jumping from approximately 540 in November to over 1,600 in May - a threefold increase.

Washington passed legislation in 2018 preventing state agencies from sharing residents' personal information with federal officials for immigration enforcement as part of its sanctuary state protections.

""It has clearly not protected our folks. We have learned that that data has been shared and we need to do more,"" Norouzi said.

State Rep.

NVIDIA commits £2 billion to catalyze the U.K.’s AI startup ecosystem and accelerate the creation of new companies, jobs and globally transformative AI businesses.

Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court will join NVIDIA’s investment in the U.K. market, underscoring their commitment to foster the U.K. AI ecosystem.

The investment will bring new capital and advanced AI infrastructure to major U.K. hubs like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester — empowering researchers and developers across the country to scale the next generation of AI businesses.

LONDON, Sept. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced an investment of £2 billion in the U.K. market to catalyze the nation’s AI startup ecosystem and scale the next generation of globally transformative AI businesses. The new capital will be used to foster economic growth, develop more innovative AI technologies, create new companies and jobs, and empower the U.K. to compete in the AI market globally.

Scaling AI companies in the U.K. has been challenging due to limited access to supercomputing, constrained venture capital outside London, rising energy costs and difficulty for VCs to access leading academic institutions, where many researchers are also entrepreneurs. NVIDIA, in collaboration with Accel, Air Street Capital, Balderton Capital, Hoxton Ventures and Phoenix Court, will accelerate the U.K. AI ecosystem by providing new capital for AI startups.

“This is the age of AI — the big bang of a new industrial revolution,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “The United Kingdom is in a Goldilocks moment, where world-class universities, bold startups, leading researchers and cutting-edge supercomputing converge. There has never been a better time to invest in the U.K. — AI is unlocking new science and sparking entirely new industries. With new capital and advanced infrastructure, we are doubling down to empower the U.K. to lead the next wave of AI innovation.”

The investment will expand access to capital in key U.K. economic centers, AI growth zones and deep technology ecosystems like London, Oxford, Cambridge and Manchester. NVIDIA’s investment, combined with new, world-class AI infrastructure, will empower researchers and developers nationwide, fueling the launch and growth of AI startups.

“NVIDIA’s investment is a major vote of confidence in the U.K. both today and long into the future,” said U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. “By backing our startups, empowering our researchers and connecting capital with talent, this partnership will create jobs, spark new industries and ensure the U.K. remains at the forefront of global AI leadership.”

NVIDIA is committed to working closely with the U.K.’s leading company founders and VCs — especially in London, home to world-renowned academic AI labs — and partnering with top U.K.-based funds to ensure capital and compute reach the most ambitious entrepreneurs and most dynamic regions, including the U.K. government’s newly announced AI growth zone.

Following NVIDIA’s recent commitment to manufacturing up to a half-trillion dollars’ worth of AI supercomputers in America, the investment will be domiciled in the United States and activated in the United Kingdom, celebrating the transatlantic partnership between the two countries. NVIDIA is purposefully investing in the U.K.’s future, unlocking opportunities for the next generation of British innovators.

“In collaboration with NVIDIA, we're accelerating the growth of U.K. AI startups,” said Sonali De Rycker, partner at Accel. “World-class compute and fresh capital will empower the next wave of entrepreneurs and AI startups, create new jobs and further enable the U.K. to compete in the AI race. The U.K. has long been a hotbed for AI talent, with a strong community of researchers, founders and world-class universities, and this new investment will supercharge the AI flywheel.”

“We’ve embarked on a new journey where scaling AI unlocks capabilities that, when we started in this industry over a decade ago, would have been considered magic,” said Nathan Benaich, general partner at Air Street Capital. “The U.K. has world-class talent and research, but the infrastructure has not kept pace. This commitment aims to bridge that gap by providing U.K. founders with the resources needed to build globally significant AI companies.”

“We are in the midst of a seismic technology shift as people and companies around the world increasingly depend on more intelligent hardware and software,” said James Wise, partner at Balderton Capital. “The U.K. is fortunate to be home to some of the teams and companies leading that wave. The challenge facing us, however, is how to overcome constraints like the cost of energy or ability to access compute. Investment from firms like Balderton and companies like NVIDIA will help smooth the path, so more global winners can be built and thrive here in the U.K.”

“The U.K. has the talent, research institutions and entrepreneurial drive to build world-leading AI companies — but turning breakthrough ideas into global impact requires collective action,” said Hussein Kanji, founder and partner at Hoxton Ventures. “We’re thrilled to partner with NVIDIA to commit resources to help Britain’s brightest founders commercialize their innovations and build the next generation of transformational AI companies.”

“Britain has the science and the talent. This collaboration with NVIDIA puts capital and computing power in their hands to scale globally,” said Saul Klein, founder and executive chair of Phoenix Court. “With nearly 800 venture-backed U.K. companies generating revenues of over $25 million, the opportunity now is to back the next wave of truly differentiated AI companies solving real-world challenges.”

Meanwhile, the federal immigration crackdown is also having a significant impact on some local business, with sales in some cases plummeting. Restaurants are also struggling as undocumented employees are not showing up to work.

On Thursday morning volunteers canvassed the city's Northwest Side and passed ""Know Your Rights"" flyers to keep people informed.

""On Tuesday, five members of our community were detained as they traveled to work and yesterday, Wednesday, we experienced widespread ICE presence occupying our neighborhoods,"" Palenque LSNA Board Secretary Viviana Barajas said.

Elected leaders and immigrant advocates gathered across the Home Depot along Normandy and Grand Avenue. They said a day laborer was taken into custody this week.

""Here at this Home Depot we received video of a Hispanic man roughly in their 40's getting detained by two agents pretty aggressively at this parking lot...we have not been able to fully connect with the family or identify where he got taken,"" Northwest Side Rapid Response Team Sandra Puebla said.

Organizers shared cellphone video with ABC7 showing federal agents flashing lights and recording the people inside the vehicle. The footage was taken Thursday morning as volunteers say they were inside their car filming ICE activity near Kostner and Grand.

The Trump administration reiterated that they are going after criminals during their operations.

The parking lot and corner of the Home Depot remained pretty empty Thursday morning as we are told many day laborers have been scared to return following ongoing immigration enforcement.

On the city's Southwest Side, a lunchtime visit to Little Village Thursday told a story. The business corridor on 26th Street, once bustling, is now more of a bust.

Vendors and businesses are struggling as people in the community remain on high alert for ICE.

Luz Martinez and her brother set up her hot dog stand shortly before noon, wondering how many customers might come by and how many might stay away, concerned about ICE showing up.

""Well, the sales had decreased. Like, really bad. There's barely any people out here, and if they're out here, they're like, in a hurry, trying to get home safe to their family,"" Martinez said. ""But we gotta come out. We have family to feed, and we have no other choice but to be out here working.""

She said the ICE crackdown has cast a sense of fear over many people in Little Village. Before, she says she sold about 150 bacon-wrapped hot dogs a day.

""We put mayo, ketchup, mustard, grilled onions, tomato and sliced pepper,"" Martinez said.

Now she sells maybe 50, a two-thirds decline in sales. It's a common report from vendors, including some in the very not busy discount mall.

""It's just been very quiet, very everyone just kind of is, you know, living out of fear. Especially, it's been a lot of workers who just are choosing not to come in,"" said Jack Santiago with Georgie's Ice Cream Shop.

It is a problem not limited to Little Village, but the restaurant industry as a whole, which provides employment for many undocumented immigrants.

""They are very on edge about ICE coming into the businesses,"" said Sam Toia, President of the Illinois Restaurant Association. ""We've heard from some members that it's up to 20% of their team members not showing up to work.""

One community leader, Little Village Community Council President Baltazar Enriquez, thought he spotted ICE agents in an unmarked vehicle just off 26th Street near the hot dog stand.

""But we're encouraging people to come out to Little Village, shop in Little Village, enjoy Little Village, and support the small businesses here that are suffering at the moment,"" Enriquez said.

He hopes the operation is over after 30 days.

""We try to keep our hopes up and not give up and come out and let the fear, but like deep down, we are scared and we try our best to not worry about it,"" Martinez said.

At least 18 DACA recipients are detained, according to a Home is Here tracker.
So far, Home is Here has pinpointed DACA recipients detained in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Virginia.
DACA recipients have to reapply every two years for a renewal fee of $520 and pass a background check.
The Democrats said they would continue to speak out against the detention of DACA recipients and provide assistance in litigation for families.","WASHINGTON — Advocates Thursday raised alarm over immigrants with special deportation protections facing detainment across the country, as the Trump administration continues its aggressive mass deportation campaign.

Home is Here, a coalition of advocates for immigrants with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status, has documented a pattern of immigration agents targeting DACA recipients. At least 18 DACA recipients are detained, according to a Home is Here tracker.

So far, Home is Here has pinpointed DACA recipients detained in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Texas, New Mexico, New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Virginia.

The immigrant advocates were joined at a press conference by congressional Democrats and family members of DACA recipients currently detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawmakers included Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of Carlifornia and Reps. Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Delia Ramirez of Illinois.

“The Trump administration is killing DACA piece by piece,” Garcia said.

DACA tied up in court

The Trump administration tried to end DACA during President Donald Trump’s first term, but the Supreme Court blocked the effort. Republican-led states have challenged the legality of DACA and its fate is tied up in an appeals court.

There are roughly 550,000 DACA recipients, a program created under the Obama administration for undocumented children brought into the country without legal authorization by their parents.

DACA allows that group to be shielded from deportation and obtain work authorizations and driver’s licenses. DACA recipients have to reapply every two years for a renewal fee of $520 and pass a background check.

Ramirez said the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaign is indiscriminately targeting immigrants and has instilled fear in Latino communities.

“The whole (Trump) administration are waging a campaign of terror against our neighbors, against our own families, against our loved ones as they advance their fascist agenda and they try to cast immigrants as a public enemy,” said Ramirez, who is married to a DACA recipient and is the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants.

The Democrats said they would continue to speak out against the detention of DACA recipients and provide assistance in litigation for families. A handful of Democrats have sued ICE over blocked access to detention facilities to conduct oversight.

An arrest, and detainment

The wife of a DACA recipient in ICE detention, Alejandra, who spoke at the press conference, said that she saw through a home security camera her husband, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira, being arrested by masked men in the driveway of their Texas home.

Alejandra said their children were in the car and they could be heard screaming on the video. Her husband remains in detainment. The ACLU of New Mexico said in a statement he is 28 years old and the father of four U.S. citizen children.

“No family should ever have to endure that kind of terror,” she said. “For more than a decade, Paulo has been able to renew his status without issues. He has always followed the rules, done everything this country asked of him, and yet, under this administration, it feels like none of that matters anymore.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/dreamers-1024x683-1-1.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=eSTRkXqC,N,,2025-09-18 15:58:05.742923

In court documents made public Wednesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled that Khalil should be deported for failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The decision marked a setback for Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident and recent Columbia University graduate student who became the first person targeted by President Donald Trump’s aggressive crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists. But while the ruling puts him one step closer to a final order of removal, it is far from the last word in the case.

For now, Khalil remains protected from detention and deportation under a separate judicial order. His legal team has said they intend to appeal the immigration judge’s ruling, which Khalil has characterized as “further evidence of retaliation” from a “kangaroo court.”

WATCH: Mahmoud Khalil speaks at Newark airport after release from immigration detention

Here’s a look at where things stand in the ongoing legal battle:

What did the immigration judge in Louisiana decide?

The Sept. 12 ruling by the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, builds on her previous order issued in April, which found Khalil could be forced out of the country as a national security risk.

Khalil’s attorneys had challenged that decision, citing his lack of criminal history and close ties to the United States. His wife is a U.S. citizen, as is his 5-month-old son, who was born while Khalil was in federal custody.

Khalil was a prominent figure in protests at Columbia University against the war in Gaza, which spread to campuses nationwide. He was arrested inside his campus apartment building this past March and accused by the Trump administration of supporting “pro-Hamas” activity, referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Khalil has repeatedly denied the charge and the federal government has not provided evidence for it.

Khalil has argued he is being targeted for exercising his free speech, pointing to a memo by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that justified his arrest on the grounds that his pro-Palestinian beliefs could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.

In her latest decision, Comans said she lacked the authority “to question foreign policy determinations” and that Khalil’s “limited family ties” to the country did not amount to a compelling reason to waive her prior ruling.

Comans then sided with the government on a separate claim, finding that Khalil had “willfully misrepresented” facts about his background on his green card application, including his role in a United Nations agency that provides services to Palestinian refugees.

Khalil has maintained that any omissions on the application were unintentional.

What happens now?

Khalil’s attorneys said Wednesday that they intend to appeal the decision. But they also expressed concern about their odds of success in the reliably conservative federal appeals court with jurisdiction over the case.

If he were to lose his appeal, Khalil would be stripped of his permanent residency status, further restricting his ability to work and travel, according to his attorneys. But the government would still be prohibited from removing him under a June 11 order from a federal judge in New Jersey, Michael Farbiarz.

That order will remain in place while his civil rights case plays out in New Jersey. It may soon be “the only meaningful impediment” to Khalil’s deportation, according to a letter that his attorneys sent Wednesday to Farbiarz.

Oral arguments in that case could begin as soon as next month.

Where would he be deported?

Judge Comans has said Khalil would be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or “in the alternative” Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

Attorneys for Khalil have said the publicity surrounding his case would leave him in mortal danger if he were forced to return to either country.

Khalil, 30, fled Syria for Lebanon in 2013 after joining protests against then-President Bashar al-Assad. His family has roots in Tiberias but were displaced during the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what is now Israel, according to court documents.

Khalil has said he will continue advocating for Palestinians as his legal battle plays out. He is also currently suing the Trump administration for $20 million in damages, alleging that he was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite.

Other officials, including U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, have said that they have been able to collect much information about “Operation Midway Blitz” from federal officials.","CHICAGO (NewsNation) — An ongoing large-scale federal immigration enforcement operation continues to focus on targeting what the Trump administration considers the “worst of the worst” in the greater Chicago area, despite ongoing opposition from elected officials.

NewsNation got an exclusive look at how Immigration and Customs Enforcement is actively working to take immigrants who entered the United States illegally and who have criminal convictions off the streets as part of “Operation Midway Blitz”.

On Tuesday, ICE arrested Arturas Pivoras, who first entered the United States in 2001. Pivoras appeared before an immigration judge who, in August, revoked Pivoras’ bond, ordered him back into custody and gave him 30 days to appeal. Officials said he never did.

Officials said that Pivoras, a 41-year-old Lithuanian national, was convicted of aggravated assault on a police officer, burglary, criminal trespass and drug possession. That made him a priority for ICE, officials told NewsNation during an exclusive ride-along this week. Pivoras was arrested without incident after his wife convinced him to surrender to federal officers.

“This is definitely a success,” Marcos Charles, the acting executive associate director of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations team, told NewsNation. “Any time we have a cooperative individual, we have to wait on them a little bit longer, but it’s cooperative. It’s safe for our officers, it’s safe for the individual, (and) that’s a win.”

In Pivoras’ case, the fact that he chose to surrender to ICE peacefully is considered a win for federal agencies.

Pivoras was wearing an ankle monitor, which alerted ICE to his location. But because he lived in a building with a doorman who did not permit ICE officers to enter the building, the process of taking Pivoras into custody was drawn out. But rather than having to force their way in, ICE officials spoke with Pivoras’ wife, who convinced her husband to give himself up.

ICE officials told NewsNation they plan to remain in Chicago indefinitely and “until the job is done.”

“They’re all characterized as bad guys,” Charles said of those the agency is targeting for arrest. “If there’s somebody we can grab right away, that’s what we’re going to do. We’re after all of those people. It’s not like we’re targeting one group of bad guys. We’re targeting all bad guys.”

ICE isn’t alone in Operation Midway Blitz

Although ICE often draws much of the media attention in federal immigration enforcement operations, the Chicago operation is leaning into more of a whole-of-government approach.

Customs and Border Protection agents, along with the U.S. Border Patrol’s elite tactical unit, BORTAC, are all working together in a mission led by Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino. On Tuesday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem was part of a BORTAC enforcement operation that targeted a home in suburban Elgin, where two undocumented immigrants with previous criminal convictions were taken into custody.

DHS officials announced that Christian Lopez-Cervantes, a Mexican national who had been charged with felony assault, domestic violence and felony illegal re-entry, was arrested on Tuesday.

DHS officials also announced the arrests of other criminal targets who had previously been charged with weapons offenses or had been convicted of murder. Others had either been arrested on allegations of domestic violence or criminally charged, the agency said.

Two other people, identified as Us.S residents, were detained by CBP during the Elgin operation. However, they were released after DHS officials said they were briefly held for their safety and that federal officers, the agency said.

DHS officials said that the two people were not arrested, which some local media outlets had reported had taken place. DHS officials said that holding people found at locations where enforcement operations take place is part of the agency’s protocol.

One of those released by CBP, Joe Botello, told the Chicago Tribune that masked and armed agents forcibly entered the home just before 6 a.m. He said officers were calling out the name of another person in Spanish and that officers destroyed a front door and a glass patio door in the process of entering the home.

“I’m just blessed that I’m still alive,” Botello told the newspaper. “I’ve been hearing it and seeing it through social media. But it never crossed my mind that it was going to happen here at the house … where I live.”

Botello said that he was handcuffed and led out of his home before he was released after showing officers his identification as an American citizen.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has criticized the ongoing federal operation, saying that ICE and other agencies have not been transparent about their activity. That includes the fatal shooting of an ICE target last week in suburban Franklin Park.

Pritzker has called for more answers after ICE officials said the suspect attempted to hit officers with his car during a traffic stop and dragged an ICE officer. An FBI spokesperson would not confirm or deny to NewsNation whether they are leading an investigation into the incident.

Other officials, including U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat, have said that they have been able to collect much information about “Operation Midway Blitz” from federal officials.

Underwood’s office announced Monday that the lawmaker has been informed that 250 arrests have been made by federal officers since the Chicago-based operation began last week. Underwood said that those being arrested have been transferred to detention centers in Indiana and Wisconsin, but that family members are experiencing difficulty reaching those being detained.

But she fears that incidents like those that have been taking place in both Chicago and the surrounding suburbs will continue to stoke fear.

“Everyone deserves to feel safe in their community. Like all Illinoisans, I’ve been concerned and alarmed by reporting about ICE’s conduct and operations in our state under Donald Trump,” Underwood, the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations, said in a statement released by her office.

An Underwood spokesperson told NewsNation on Wednesday that the lawmaker had not received information on the Elgin arrests. A Pritzker spokesperson accused Noem on social media of “coming to Chicago “for a few hours to capture content (and) fled before taking questions from the press or public.”

Still, federal officials said they will not be deterred by the opposition they are facing from Pritzker and other Democrats.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/09/ICE-vehicles.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 16:57:09.867418

Immigration and children's advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children's removal.
Another federal judge in Washington granted advocates a temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing Guatemalan migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases.","WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump's administration from immediately deporting Guatemalan migrant children who came to the U.S. alone back to their home country, the latest step in a court struggle over one of the most sensitive issues in Trump's hard-line immigration agenda.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly comes after the Republican administration's Labor Day weekend attempt to remove Guatemalan migrant children who were living in government shelters and foster care.

Government officials with the Department of Homeland Security nor the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of the children, offered no immediate response to the judge's order.

Trump administration officials said they were seeking to reunify children with parents who wanted them returned home. ""But that explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later,"" Kelly wrote. ""There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.""

Advocates for the children also submitted a whistleblower account to the court that suggests many of the children who were found eligible for deportation had likely been victims of child abuse, like death threats, gang violence, and human trafficking, Kelly noted in his order.

""The court saw through the government's repeated misrepresentations of critical facts to try to justify the indefensible targeting of vulnerable children who would have faced danger if forcibly sent to other countries,"" Efrén C. Olivares, vice president of litigation & legal strategy at the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement.

There was already a temporary order in place preventing the removal of Guatemalan children. But that was set to expire Tuesday. Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, granted a preliminary injunction extends that temporary protection indefinitely, although the government can appeal.

Kelly did rebuff advocates' push to block the removal of children from additional countries, though he said any attempt to remove those children in a similar way would likely be unlawful. Legal advocates working with Kids in Need of Defense visited Honduras last week and found government officials and nongovernmental organizations working ""furiously"" to receive as many as 400 children back from the United States.

There are also temporary restraining orders in separate cases in Arizona and Illinois, but those cases are much more narrow in the scope of children they cover, underlining the importance of the Washington case.

In a late-night operation Aug. 30, the administration notified shelters where migrant children traveling alone initially live after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border that they would be returning the children to Guatemala and that they needed to have the kids ready to leave in a matter of hours.

""Our clients were terrified-many had tear-soaked faces and some were visibly shaking with fear,"" Mishan Wroe, directing attorney at the National Center for Youth Law, one of the plaintiff attorneys, said in a statement.

Contractors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up the Guatemalan children from shelters and foster care and transported them to the airport. The government has said in court filings that it identified 457 children for possible removal to Guatemala although that list was eventually whittled down to 327. In the end, 76 got as far as boarding planes in El Paso and Harlingen, Texas, on Aug. 31 and were set to depart to Guatemala in what the government described as a first phase.

Bertilda López's 17-year-old son was among those slated to be sent to Guatemala. Over Labor Day weekend, he called his family late at night to tell them he was being sent home and she drove through the night to get to the capital.

She expressed mixed feelings about the judge's decision Thursday.

""As a mother I want him to be well, whether that's sending him (home) or him being locked up there,"" López said. ""Maybe it's better that they send him back because he's really sad. The way things are there (in the U.S.), it bothers me that my son is locked up.""

Elisabeth Toca, who is sponsoring the boy and hopeful he will be allowed to stay, said she's still hoping she will be able to get him out of U.S. custody and ""give him a better life.""

Guatemala's government declined to comment, saying only that it was an internal U.S. justice process.

Immigration and children's advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children's removal. The advocates argued that many of these children were fleeing abuse or violence in their home countries and that the government was bypassing longstanding legal procedures meant to protect young migrants from being returned to potentially abusive or violent places.

""This was a tragedy in the making that was barely averted thanks to the tireless efforts of advocates across the country who saw that children were being endangered and raised the alarm,"" Shaina Aber, executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice, said in a statement.

Another federal judge in Washington granted advocates a temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing Guatemalan migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases. That initial 14-day order was set to expire on Sunday, and then Kelly extended it through Tuesday to give him extra time to examine the case.

The government has argued that it has the right to return children in its care and it was acting at the behest of the Guatemalan government. But the government walked back an initial claim alleging the parents requested their children be sent back.

The Guatemalan government has said that it was concerned over minors in U.S. custody who were going to turn 18 and would then be at risk of being turned over to adult detention facilities.

Children who cross the southern border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.

After advocates got the temporary restraining order approved for Guatemalan children, they also asked the court to extend protections from deportation to children of other nationalities after hearing reports that the government was intending to remove Honduran children as well.

The unanimous three-judge panel on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift a lower order blocking the restructuring as Democratic-led states press ahead with their lawsuit.

The 19 states, joined by the District of Columbia, sued as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s leadership moved to terminate 10,000 employees and dismantle several of its subagencies.

U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose, an appointee of former President Biden, blocked the restructuring in July by finding it was likely unlawful.

It halts mass layoffs at four offices under HHS: the Center for Tobacco Products, the Office of Head Start, components of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.

In its appeal, the administration contended the states have no legal right to sue, federal law requires their claims to go before an agency that guards the federal employee merit system rather than a court, and the restructuring is lawful anyway.

The argument heavily relies on a July ruling from the Supreme Court enabling the Education Department to lay off roughly half its employees. It became the latest battle over how to interpret the high court’s recent emergency orders siding with the administration, which have often come with no or little explanation.

“The Supreme Court has clearly determined that agencies should be able to proceed with their restructuring efforts while litigation proceeds, even in the face of all the legal and equitable arguments that plaintiffs advance here,” the Justice Department wrote in court filings.

The states pushed back, arguing the justices’ ruling “says nothing about the district court’s conclusions regarding the distinct factual record and narrow preliminary relief here.”

The 1st Circuit panel comprised U.S. Circuit Judges Lara Montecalvo, Julie Rikelman and Seth Aframe, all nominated to the bench by Biden.

October 2025 Visa Bulletin Update: Big Advancement

FY 2025 EB-5 Unreserved Category Reaches Annual Cap

USCIS Reintroduces Revised Naturalization Civics Test

Supreme Court Allows Immigration Detentions in Los Angeles to Continue

October 2025 Visa Bulletin Update – Advancement! Get Ready to File AOS Cases

Although several FY2025 Immigrant Visa limits were reached in September, the Department of State’s October 2025 Visa Bulletin marks several developments for employment-based immigration categories.

Final Action Date Chart: EB-1, EB-2, and EB-3 categories show modest advancement, with some countries, including China and India, seeing progress of up to 3.5 months.

Dates for Filing Chart: EB-1 through EB-3, with certain categories advancing over a year.

Impact: Employers should review the updated Final Action and Filing Charts to identify employees who may now be eligible for adjustment of status. It’s essential to prepare related I-485 applications, I-140 petitions, and other documentation promptly to avoid delays and risk of missing the filing window. Clear communication with affected employees will ensure they understand next steps and expectations.

FY 2025 EB-5 Unreserved Category Reaches Annual Cap

The Department of State has confirmed that the EB-5 Unreserved immigrant visa category has reached its annual limit for FY 2025 and will remain unavailable until October 1, 2025, when the new fiscal year begins. Until then, U.S. embassies and consulates will not issue EB-5 Unreserved visas, and USCIS cannot approve adjustment of status (AOS) applications in this category.

Applicants may still submit AOS filings, but adjudication and final approval will be paused until new visa numbers are released in October. Interviews may proceed, though final decisions will not be issued until the category reopens.

Impact: Employers should anticipate short-term delays for employees or candidates in the EB-5 Unreserved category and communicate this clearly to manage expectations. Planning for October filings and monitoring the Visa Bulletin will be essential to minimize disruption to onboarding and workforce mobility plans.

USCIS Reintroduces Revised Naturalization Civics Test

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced it will implement the 2025 Naturalization Civics Test, effective for applications filed on or after October 18, 2025. The new test draws heavily from the 2020 version, with about 75% of questions carried over from the 2008 test and 25% updated or newly created. Applicants will be asked up to 20 questions from a 128-question bank and must answer 12 correctly to pass, with officers now stopping once an applicant either passes or fails to reduce unnecessary questioning.

Applications filed before October 18, 2025, will continue to use the 2008 civics test. Applicants age 65+ with 20+ years of permanent residence remain eligible for a simplified 10-question version, based on their filing date. Updated study materials for both versions will be published by USCIS to ensure applicants can prepare appropriately.

Impact: While this change primarily affects employees pursuing U.S. citizenship, HR and mobility teams should expect questions from staff on timing, eligibility, and preparation. Employers can support employees by helping them understand which test applies based on filing date and directing them to updated USCIS study resources.

Supreme Court Allows Immigration Detentions in Los Angeles to Continu

On September 8, 2025, the Supreme Court granted a stay in Noem v. Perdomo, allowing immigration officers to continue detaining individuals in the Los Angeles area based on factors such as language, race/ethnicity, or type of employment while litigation proceeds. This means workplace-adjacent stops at car washes, construction sites, farms, and day-labor gathering areas may continue, raising visibility of enforcement in the community.

Justice Kavanaugh concurred, citing extraordinary levels of illegal immigration, while Justice Sotomayor dissented, warning the practice risks sweeping in U.S. citizens and lawful residents and raises constitutional concerns.",https://wolfsdorf.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/News-Digest-Header-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 13:58:32.012986

“Following an investigation, the City of Portland will send a land use violation notice this Friday for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in [South] Portland,” said city spokesman Cody Bowman, “launching a process to determine whether the site’s detention practices comply with the conditions of the site’s land use approval.”

The city said in its statement that, based on federal government records, it identified “more than two dozen detention policy violations of the facility’s land use conditions of approval with the city, which does not allow detainees to be kept overnight or held for more than 12 hours.”

The ICE facility on South Macadam Avenue has been the site of frequent clashes this spring and summer between protesters and federal officers, some resulting in arrests.

Khalil and his lawyers have rejected the fraud claim as a post-hoc justification to retaliate against him after Farbiarz ruled that he couldn’t be deported on the foreign policy ground.","An immigration judge who works for the Justice Department ordered Mahmoud Khalil’s removal to Algeria or Syria, but lawyers for the pro-Palestinian activist who’s been targeted by the Trump administration are still pressing for relief in an independent federal court.

Khalil’s attorneys laid out the latest in a New Jersey federal court filing Wednesday to U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz, a Biden appointee who has overseen some of Khalil’s litigation, which has been playing out in different courts following his March arrest. The lawful permanent U.S. resident argues that the administration has been retaliating against him for speaking out for Palestinians. (He was born in Syria and is a citizen of Algeria.)

Farbiarz ordered his release in June, finding Khalil wasn’t a flight risk or danger to the community, and the litigation has continued as the administration keeps pressing for his deportation.

The DOJ immigration judge, Jamee Comans, ruled Sept. 12 that Khalil isn’t entitled to a waiver of his removal. While noting factors in his favor like having family ties via his U.S. citizen wife and infant son, the immigration judge wrote that she “lacks authority to question foreign policy determinations” by the administration, which has claimed Khalil’s presence “has potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

Comans said that deference alone precludes a waiver. Noting that Farbiarz previously precluded removal on that ground, she gave additional reasons as well, citing what she called Khalil’s “fraud” during the immigration application process when he “failed to disclose his involvement” in pro-Palestinian groups.

Khalil and his lawyers have rejected the fraud claim as a post-hoc justification to retaliate against him after Farbiarz ruled that he couldn’t be deported on the foreign policy ground. One of Khalil’s lawyers, Ramzi Kassem, said that when “the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailor all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result.” Kassem said the “plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly free-falling credibility of the entire U.S. immigration system.”

In their Wednesday filing to Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said the government’s continued pursuit of his removal based on what they called the “Post-Hoc Charge,” as well as what they called the “highly unusual developments” in his immigration proceedings, “is part and parcel” of the government’s retaliation “for his constitutionally protected expression in support of Palestinian rights.” They said it’s a “substantial threat” to his “liberty, family integrity and if ultimately removed, his physical safety.”

As for what’s next in the litigation, they noted that they have 30 days from Sept. 12 to appeal Comans’ order to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which, like DOJ immigration judges, is housed within the executive branch, not the judicial branch, like Farbiarz.

His lawyers told Farbiarz that, given the administration’s targeting of Khalil, they expect the appellate board to swiftly approve Comans’ order, which, they wrote, would mean Khalil “will lose his lawful permanent resident status, including his right to reside and work in the United States, and have a final order of removal against him.”

That’s not the end of the case, because Khalil can appeal the removal order in federal court. But, as they explained to Farbiarz, the circuit in which that appeal would proceed — the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit — “almost never grants stays of removal to noncitizens pursuing petitions for review of BIA decisions.”

That led them to tell Farbiarz that “the only meaningful impediment” to Khalil’s removal would be a prior order from him to block removal while federal habeas corpus proceedings are pending. They concluded by telling the New Jersey judge that they will be pressing their litigation in his court regarding Khalil’s claim that the administration’s action against him is “pretextual First Amendment retaliation.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250918-mahmoud-khalil-mn-0830-6fc377.jpg",N,,2025-09-18 13:58:36.135666

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought. As our country has evolved and expanded rights and advanced democratic reforms, this framework – through its many iterations and amendments – has remained true to its core throughout. Through civil war and depression, world wars and social upheavals, through the peaceful transfer of power across generations and parties, Americans have been able to count on the Constitution being there.

Today we are facing a new type of threat. There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy. This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.

Alarmingly, we’re witnessing the intrusion of military force into civilian life. Earlier this summer the president deployed Marines and National Guard units to crack down on protests in Los Angeles and has thousands of Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. The administration has signaled that this is just the start, with plans to deploy more troops onto American streets in Chicago and possibly elsewhere.

There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.

This violates a founding principle of American governance, enshrined in the Posse Comitatus Act, that military forces should not police civilians. The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies. Immigration detention centers under construction on military bases echo some of the darkest chapters in our history and represent a dangerous conflation of military and civilian authority.

As we saw in Los Angeles, the deployment of troops is a fear tactic meant to silence opposition and criminalize dissent. But the attacks on the First Amendment are not isolated to targeting peaceful protest. The Trump administration has ushered in a new McCarthy era, sending a clear message that if someone disagrees with our government, they will be punished.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened.

Just look at this administration’s actions. Federal agents have repeatedly detained or arrested public officials conducting legitimate oversight, including Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka,Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, andSenator Alex Padilla, who was tackled and detained for asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions. Students, including green card holders, have been detained and threatened with deportation for writing op-eds or expressing views that deviate from what the administration deems acceptable.

The administration is not content with silencing critics — it rejects the very concept of legitimate political opposition. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller recently declared ""The Democrat party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization."" Coming from an administration that’s literally prosecuting a democratic congresswoman on invented felony charges stemming from her oversight of an ICE facility, this explicit rejection of political pluralism is chilling.

Perhaps most dangerously, the Trump administration is ignoring the rule of law and corrupting justice itself. The president has targeted law firms whose attorneys investigated him, stripping their security clearances, barring attorneys from federal buildings, and terminating government contracts unless firms agree to coercive demands for ""pro bono"" services. He excoriates judges who issue unfavorable rulings, calling them ""radical left lunatics"" and ""deranged,"" while encouraging calls for impeachment or worse. Ominously, the Justice Department is now seeking financial sanctions against immigration attorney Joshua Schroeder for filing emergency motions to halt his client's deportation — the first case under a new Trump directive to personally target lawyers who challenge administration policies.

Military forces now police civilians. Members of Congress are arrested for doing their jobs. The president's top adviser declares the opposition party illegitimate. Judges and lawyers face threats for upholding the law. This is the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened. Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it. At a moment when we are seeing political violence escalating — claiming lives and threatening the very free discourse our Constitution protects — we must choose peaceful democratic engagement over dehumanization and violence. The power ultimately lies with the people, and as a country we must decide whether we will defend our Constitution or let it fall.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/defend-the-constitution-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:57:47.025473

Mr. Khalil, who was a Columbia University graduate student when he was abruptly arrested by the Trump administration this year, is not in imminent danger of deportation.

A standing order from the federal judge, Michael E. Farbiarz, prohibits Mr. Khalil’s removal from the country. He has until October to appeal the immigration judge’s decision and further appeals could forestall his deportation.

But several months after he was released from detention in Louisiana, his legal plight is growing more dire.

Mr. Khalil’s case is progressing in two separate courts: A federal court in New Jersey, where Judge Farbiarz is scrutinizing constitutional issues, and an immigration court in Louisiana.

Immigration judges are part of the executive branch, not the judicial, and Judge Jamee E. Comans, who works for the Justice Department, appears eager to speed the matter along.

The tension between the judges has intensified, and the request by Mr. Khalil’s lawyers that Judge Farbiarz intervene, made in a court filing on Wednesday, could escalate the battle between the executive branch and the judiciary.

Mr. Khalil’s lawyers asked Judge Farbiarz for permission to refile their initial complaint with arguments that would encompass Judge Comans’s latest action, which they characterized as part of a pattern of retaliation by the Trump administration.

Mr. Khalil was a prominent presence at pro-Palestinian protests on the Columbia campus. When he returned to the White House, Mr. Trump was quick to crack down on those demonstrations and the schools that hosted them.

Since Mr. Khalil’s March arrest, the Trump administration has sought to deport him, although he is a legal permanent resident whose wife and infant son are American citizens.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, cited a rarely used statute as the legal rationale for Mr. Khalil’s deportation, saying that his mere presence in the United States spread antisemitism.

More than a week later, after Mr. Khalil’s lawyers had begun to fight for his freedom, the administration added a separate rationale for deportation, saying that Mr. Khalil had failed to disclose membership in several organizations when he applied for legal residency in March 2024. A lawyer for Mr. Khalil has called those allegations “bogus.”

Mr. Khalil was detained in Louisiana for more than three months. He was behind bars in April when his wife gave birth to their son.

In May, Judge Farbiarz ruled that the law cited by Mr. Rubio was likely unconstitutional. The following month, the judge said that Mr. Khalil could no longer be held on that basis. After the government argued that it was instead holding Mr. Khalil based on the allegations related to his residency application, Judge Farbiarz ordered his release.

But the immigration court process continued.

On June 20 — the day of Mr. Khalil’s release — Judge Comans put in a written order her earlier statement that Mr. Khalil could be deported on the basis of the statute Mr. Rubio cited.

In July, Judge Farbiarz ordered that decision nullified.

Judge Comans heeded his order, but responded furiously in footnotes, accusing Judge Farbiarz of “interfering with the legal process and the authority of the immigration court.”

Last week, she said that Mr. Khalil could be deported in light of the allegations about his residency application.

According to Mr. Khalil’s lawyers, she continued to grant weight to Mr. Rubio’s determination.

She also said that because Judge Farbiarz had refused to allow her to rely on that determination, she was “compelled to make alternative findings.” Therefore, she indicated, she was using the allegations about Mr. Khalil’s residency application as a basis for deportation.

The Trump administration has accused Mr. Khalil of neglecting to disclose that he had worked with a United Nations agency that assists Palestinian refugees, as well as membership in Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition of student groups involved in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

Mr. Khalil’s lawyers have said that Mr. Khalil participated in an internship at the U.N. agency through Columbia and considered it coursework rather than employment. They say Mr. Khalil was not a member of the coalition but a mediator, and that he took on that role after he applied for permanent residency.

In a statement Wednesday, Mr. Khalil said the administration had “resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide.”

A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, saying that the Executive Office for Immigration Review does not comment on cases before the agency.

Mr. Khalil has 30 days to appeal Judge Comans’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which may then consider his case at length. Mr. Khalil’s lawyers are concerned that the process might be swift — the board is also part of the Justice Department.

He could then appeal to a federal appeals court in Louisiana, though, as his lawyers noted, that appeals court often refuses to allow immigrants to stay in the country as they are appealing.

Those facilities are the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral and the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia.
“The report mischaracterizes the Otero County Processing Center (OCPC) and conflates allegations across multiple New Mexico facilities,” Lawhead said in an email to New Mexico Political Report.
The recommendations in the report also called for an end to county-level pass-through contracts for immigrant detention, which have been used to set up the three immigrant detention centers in New Mexico.
A spokesperson for Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham hinted earlier this year that the governor was considering a ban on federal detention centers in an agenda for the upcoming special legislative session scheduled in October.","The companies that manage the three New Mexico immigrant detention centers are pushing back against a new report that recommends closing those facilities due to concerns over the alleged mistreatment of detainees and unsafe conditions.

Last week, the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights released a report entitled “Civil Rights in Immigrant Detention Centers in New Mexico,” which stated that in July the committee’s nine members voted 7-2 to recommend closing the three immigrant detention centers following an inquiry initiated in October. Those facilities are the Cibola County Correctional Center in Milan, the Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral and the Torrance County Detention Facility in Estancia.

The report details five major areas that it says guided the committee’s decisions: limited access to legal representation and rights education, shortcomings in credible fear interviews for asylum seekers, concerns about physical conditions and safety at the facilities, a contracting structure that the report describes as undermining oversight, and insufficient oversight and transparency.

According to the report, Christopher Saucedo, the advisory committee’s chair, and Douglas Turner, the committee’s vice chair, voted against the recommendations.

Representatives for CoreCivic, a Tennessee-based company that provides detention management services and operates the facilities located in Cibola and Torrance counties, and Management & Training Corporation, which is based in Utah and manages the Otero County Processing Center, defended the records of their respective companies.

Emily Lawhead, communications director for Management & Training Corporation, said her company refutes the allegations made in the report.

“The report mischaracterizes the Otero County Processing Center (OCPC) and conflates allegations across multiple New Mexico facilities,” Lawhead said in an email to New Mexico Political Report.

She added that the Otero County Processing Center operates under the daily oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and is routinely inspected and audited using ICE’s Performance-based National Detention Standards. Lawhead said that the Management & Training Corporation “consistently meet and exceed required benchmarks.”

“The people in our care have on-site medical and mental-health services, confidential access to legal counsel, private spaces for credible-fear interviews with certified language interpretation, and multiple documented grievance avenues,” she said.

Lawhead added that the staff is provided robust training as part of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, has zero-tolerance policies and shares performance data with government partners.

“Safety, dignity and process guide our work every day, and we welcome transparent oversight and visits to our facility to see our operations firsthand,” Lawhead stated in the email.

Brian Todd, public affairs manager for CoreCivic, defended the company’s record. He cited CoreCivic’s 40 years of providing services to the federal government under presidential administrations of both parties, and the company’s human rights policy that outlines its commitment to detainee rights, including policies related to legal rights, access to medical care, and security.

“Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process they are entitled to,” he said. Detainees, Todd said, are provided with a high standard of care, including 24/7 medical care and three meals a day.

Todd also countered claims of a lack of transparency. He stated that CoreCivics’s facilities are routinely subjected to independent audits without prior notice. He added that facilities are frequently visited by immigration attorneys, community volunteers, elected officials and friends and families of detainees.

The recommendations in the report also called for an end to county-level pass-through contracts for immigrant detention, which have been used to set up the three immigrant detention centers in New Mexico. According to the report, under such agreements, a county acts as a pass-through entity to provide ICE detention capacity using private contractors.

Opponents of the agreements say they allow contractors an avenue to bypass competitive bidding and federal procurement rules.

“By circumventing the ordinary federal procurement process, there might be a decline in transparency and competition that could improve the conditions of the facilities,” the report stated.

For years, immigrant rights activists and some lawmakers have lobbied for passage of legislation that would prohibit local bodies — such as counties— from entering into such agreements and requiring the termination of any existing ones. Such legislation passed the New Mexico House earlier this year but did not make it to the Senate floor.

A spokesperson for Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham hinted earlier this year that the governor was considering a ban on federal detention centers in an agenda for the upcoming special legislative session scheduled in October. New Mexico Political Report has since reported that the governor’s office has opted to push the issue off until the regular January session.",https://nmpoliticalreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2020/07/22-dju_20190606_Estancia_Loving_200-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 12:58:15.540392

The Legal Debate Over IEEPA and Tariffs There are two issues at play in the ongoing legal debate over the Trump administration’s use of IEEPA.
Transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight: Importantly, the revised IEEPA should impose transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight requirements on the process.
And, importantly, the national emergency finding and measures imposed would have to be reviewed and updated every 2 years, subject to the same transparency, accountability, and oversight requirements.
The changes would be highly unlikely to undermine sanctions important to U.S. national security, such as the Iran or Russian sanctions programs.","U.S. President Donald Trump has asserted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gives him the authority to take unprecedented economic measures, including imposing tariffs, to address purported international emergencies. Courts are now hearing legal challenges to some of these measures while commentators struggle to make sense of their implications. The Trump administration’s uses of these national emergency powers have underscored the longstanding need for IEEPA reform. While litigation in the courts unfolds, Congress can take steps to revise IEEPA and strengthen transparency, accountability and oversight when the executive branch leverages U.S. economic powers in pursuit of national security and foreign policy goals.

Background on IEEPA

At issue are a wide array of sanctions programs that are a critical component of the U.S. national security and foreign policy toolkit. When resort to military force is not warranted, economic sanctions can exert U.S. economic power to address behavior contrary to U.S. national interests by foreign states or non-state actors as well as to demonstrate American resolve to confront international crises. IEEPA has been used to impose sanctions on Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Libya, Venezuela, Myanmar, and other countries, as well as on foreign terrorists and transnational criminal organizations. Depending on their scope, IEEPA sanctions can prohibit or restrict U.S. trade or transactions with sanctioned countries or entities, limiting their access to the U.S. banking system (and thus the global financial system) and to U.S. goods, services, and funds, ideally to alter or deter their behavior.

Trump has now used IEEPA authority to impose for the first time large tariffs across the global economy for widely disparate reasons, including to address large and persistent trade deficits globally; to sanction Brazil’s efforts to prosecute its former president and to respond to the country’s purported human rights violations; and most recently, to push India to stop buying Russian oil. No president has used IEEPA throughout its 50-year history to impose tariffs or steer trade relations, in large part because the U.S. Constitution expressly provides Congress with the power to “lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises.” As a result, tariff rate-setting has traditionally been reserved to trade negotiations that require congressional approval.

The Legal Debate Over IEEPA and Tariffs

There are two issues at play in the ongoing legal debate over the Trump administration’s use of IEEPA. First, there is a narrow interpretive question: whether the president can impose tariffs under IEEPA’s broad grant of authority to “regulate … importation,” notwithstanding the statute’s absence of an express reference to tariffs or duties. Second, there is a more existential question of whether there are legal boundaries that courts can supervise regarding the president’s ability to declare a national emergency under IEEPA.

Can the President Impose Tariffs Under IEEPA?

The first question will have one of two fundamental outcomes. One view is that IEEPA does not include tariff imposition among its list of eight enumerated powers given to the president once a national emergency is declared—and that Congress would not have omitted the word “tariff” if it had intended to include that authority among IEEPA’s enumerated powers. The second view is that the power to “regulate … [the] importation …of” goods, which is a phrase contained in IEEPA, encompasses the power to impose tariffs.

To adopt the second interpretation, a court would need to engage in some interpretive gymnastics. It would first need to go beyond the plain language of the statute and read the power to tax into the power to regulate, against a backdrop in which Congress itself has consistently legislated tariffs for generations. In doing so, the court would also need to overcome the “major questions doctrine,” which limits the executive branch’s ability to interpret a statute broadly to regulate matters of “major economic and political significance” — which likely includes the unprecedented tariffs imposed by the president on almost all U.S. trading partners in response to longstanding trade conditions.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit articulates a narrow third way between these two outcomes: that the specific “trafficking” tariffs imposed on China for its failure to stop “chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other [transnational criminal organizations], criminals at large, and drugs” and the “reciprocal tariffs” imposed on a swath of countries to address large and persistent trade deficits are not authorized by IEEPA, without foreclosing the use of IEEPA to impose tariffs “at all.”

Can Courts Limit the President’s Ability to Declare National Emergencies Under IEEPA?

The second question is more challenging to assess. Conventional wisdom for government national security lawyers—myself included—is that the president’s ability to declare a national emergency is (more or less) unbounded, given the president’s preeminent authority in the arena of national security and foreign affairs and the lack of a meaningful, justiciable standard for courts to apply. Federal courts will understandably be unlikely to take on this issue out of due regard for the separation of powers, particularly where, as Justice Robert Jackson stated in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, the President acts “pursuant to an express or implied authorization of Congress.”

As the ongoing IEEPA litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has highlighted, courts face challenges in developing judicially manageable standards to constrain presidential decision-making, particularly in the context of an international emergency. The president leads a co-equal branch of government and one with greater power and expertise in foreign affairs, so courts have good reason to tread lightly.

There are various principles that a court could potentially invoke to test whether a president’s decision to declare and carry out a national emergency makes sense. For example, was the action made in “good faith”? Was there a “rational relationship” between the national emergency and the measures imposed? Did Congress expressly authorize the action, or did the president act in a “zone of twilight”? Or, as the dissent in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in VOS Selections recently stated, was there “an action as crossing the statutory boundary, after scrupulous and humble recognition of all the predictive, evaluative, and other judgment-call-based elements that, though people may passionately hold contrary views, are not subject to objective proof of error.” Faced with these difficult judgments, courts have declined to review the national emergency altogether, finding it to be a political question.

The deference historically afforded by courts in this area has perhaps encouraged or tacitly endorsed the longstanding practice by presidents across the 50 years since IEEPA’s enactment to declare national emergencies with only cursory public explanations for their actions. Presidents regularly declare national emergencies with a summary paragraph or two explaining the factual basis for the emergency in the chapeau of an executive order. The reasoning is often conclusory, and there is little fact-finding or analysis: Iran sponsors terrorism and is developing nuclear weapons; the import of conflict diamonds fuels armed conflict and human rights violations in Africa; Zimbabwe’s political leadership undermines its democratic processes, contributing to the breakdown of the rule of law; Russia’s invasion of Ukraine undermines peace and stability. The reasoning and factual basis given for a particular national emergency has generally been fairly scant.

Let’s consider an admittedly absurd example to illustrate the problem: Under current law, it would not be straightforward for the courts to decide whether a national emergency is appropriate to impose tariffs on imports of, for example, white tennis shoes. The president could declare that such shoe imports constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security, foreign policy, or the economy. They could state that tariffs are needed to ensure a sufficient supply for national security purposes, or that white tennis shoe imports exacerbate trade deficits. Even more absurdly, the president could maintain that the increased albedo resulting from too many white tennis shoe imports could blind the U.S. military’s pilots. Just maybe?

In each of these absurd cases, it is not obvious whether the courts would review the national emergency declaration at all, what standards they would apply, how courts would come out on any such review, or how they would go about rejecting the president’s findings. Administrations have historically exercised IEEPA’s significant powers where there is some consensus on the need for action and the authorities used, and litigants have infrequently challenged the president’s declaration of a national emergency. Courts have to date mostly punted on this decision-making, noting a considered preference to stay out of national security and foreign policy judgments. Even with a need or opportunity to delve into the facts underlying a national emergency, courts may be reluctant to ask the Executive branch to develop a factual record for a host of reasons, including questions about the applicability of the Administrative Procedure Act, the absence of express authority to do so under IEEPA, and the broader context with respect to the political questions doctrine.

If absurd cases like the white tennis shoe example might vex jurists to an extent, courts will almost certainly balk at assessing whether large and persistent trade deficits can constitute a national emergency—even after many years of economic diplomacy. Likewise, courts may be disinclined to second-guess whether the Brazilian prosecutor’s decision to prosecute former President Jair Bolsonaro, along with other actions by the Brazilian government purportedly to restrict free speech, undermine U.S. national security or foreign policy. Some commentary has deemed these national emergencies to be outrageous, but will courts be able to draw effective lines to discipline abuse of the IEEPA authorities?

Checks introduced by Congress in legislative reforms in 1976 to the president’s ability to impose and continue a national emergency have proven illusory. The National Emergencies Act requires termination of a national emergency after one year unless the president transmits a notice to Congress continuing the national emergency. The form and content of the continuation notice are not prescribed in the legislation, and the reports, transmitted largely by the Department of the Treasury on an annual basis, are often devoid of salient information on the need to continue the emergency. Congress ostensibly plays a role by having statutory authority to terminate a national emergency through a joint resolution of Congress. This congressional check, however, is limited given that only a joint resolution enacted as law can terminate a national emergency—in practice, a two-thirds majority of both the House and the Senate that can survive a presidential veto.

Going Forward: Congressional Reform of IEEPA

Congress can make sensible changes to IEEPA to provide greater transparency, accountability, and meaningful judicial oversight while preserving presidential discretion to use IEEPA as it has been used successfully in the past: to leverage U.S. economic tools in support of foreign policy and national security goals in circumstances that are truly unusual and extraordinary.

Wide discretion, but with meaningful limits: First, the president should continue to have broad authority to declare national emergencies to respond to unusual and extraordinary threats to U.S. national security or foreign policy—but that authority should be limited in time. The president should be limited to 180 days during which they can impose emergency economic measures. After 180 days, the national emergency terminates, subject to the qualifications described below.

The 180-day period provides enough time for the ordinary legislative and policy-making process to take hold. Congress could pass a law to take appropriate action in response to the underlying threat. If there is a congressional stalemate, the revised IEEPA could provide an alternative mechanism as a safeguard—but not just a routine extension. Under a statutorily-prescribed process, the Secretary of State, as the lead of a committee composed of the Secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, and other relevant departments, could be required to publish a finding within 45 days of the national emergency declaration supported by an administrative record that provides the factual basis for the measures imposed.

This is not novel; existing committees such as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and agencies such as Commerce, in the context of determinations under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act to restrict imports of goods that present a national security threat, can take economic measures to respond to national security challenges based on careful analysis, due process, or published findings, supported by administrative records.

Transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight: Importantly, the revised IEEPA should impose transparency, accountability, and judicial oversight requirements on the process. In addition to the requirement for a fact-based administrative record, consideration could be given to an expedited notice and comment process—to permit stakeholders to provide input on unintended consequences—and an analysis of the economic and political impacts.

The administrative record should be reviewable by the federal courts under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), potentially under a clearly erroneous standard for findings of fact, and an arbitrary and capricious standard for any legal determinations or measures. APA provisions that provide exemptions from its procedures where foreign affairs matters are involved should not apply to this process. Courts should be able to apply special procedures to handle and review any classified information in the administrative record.

And, importantly, the national emergency finding and measures imposed would have to be reviewed and updated every 2 years, subject to the same transparency, accountability, and oversight requirements.

Achieving Flexibility, Transparency, and Oversight is Possible

These suggested changes to IEEPA would preserve presidential flexibility to respond to sudden changes in the national security and foreign policy arena while enhancing transparency and independent oversight for responses that evolve from crises to long-term international challenges. The changes would be highly unlikely to undermine sanctions important to U.S. national security, such as the Iran or Russian sanctions programs. There would be greater administrative burdens on the government, although there should be ample material to make this burden manageable, even with short timeframes, and there will be increased potential for litigation than is likely now.

Overall, the reforms would drive more purposeful policy making by requiring the executive branch to take a hard look at its sanctions programs and justify its decisions to the public to the maximum extent practicable. Lastly, it would give judges a framework in a national security and foreign policy context for doing what they do best—assessing facts and making decisions based on clearly articulated standards.

And what impact would these changes have on a national emergency declared to impose tariffs on white tennis shoe imports? While it would not guarantee that such orders would be invalidated, it would force the executive branch to justify such actions with a fact-based explanation for why extraordinary measures are needed and give the courts the power to review those decisions. That would be an improvement over the status quo, in which it is often taken for granted that IEEPA provides a blank check to the president.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-22167800081.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 13:58:46.351737

Washington, D.C. — UnidosUS, joined by 43 leading civil rights and advocacy organizations, today released a letter calling on Congressional leaders to take immediate action to stop the unlawful deployment of military forces in U.S. cities and protect the civil rights of all Americans.

The letter is addressed to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) as they work to avert a government shutdown. It warns that recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and executive branch actions — including those enabling racial profiling and using military resources for immigration enforcement and routine law enforcement — “perpetuate executive branch overreach, undermine constitutional safeguards and civil rights and set a dangerous precedent for all American communities.” The groups note that these actions will weaken legal protections and exacerbate civil rights abuses against all U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.

“The military’s role is to defend our nation, not patrol our neighborhoods. Families are already bracing for deep cuts to health care and food assistance, and now they are being forced to live in fear of military patrols in their own communities. Normalizing military involvement in immigration enforcement or routine law enforcement threatens the very foundation of our democracy and puts all of us at risk. Congress has both the authority and the responsibility to ensure that taxpayer money is not used to support these unlawful deployments,” said Janet Murguía, president and CEO of UnidosUS.

The letter cites deployments of the National Guard and other military resources in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles as violations of the Posse Comitatus Act. It warns that these practices “weaken trust in government and destabilize families and neighborhoods” at a time when fear and division are already at dangerous levels.

UnidosUS and civil rights allies and advocacy partners urge Congress to use its constitutional authority to:

Prevent the misuse of military resources for immigration enforcement or routine law enforcement in U.S. cities, including National Guard troops in Title 10 or Title 32 status.

Hold federal officials accountable for violating the civil rights of citizens and law-abiding immigrants.

Ensure that funds and taxpayer dollars are not used to support unlawful military deployments, including activities prohibited under 18 U.S.C. § 1385 (Posse Comitatus Act), such as crowd control, search and seizure, checkpoints, arrests or interrogations.

UnidosUS and the organizations joining the letter have requested a written response from Congressional leaders by Friday, September 26, outlining the steps Congress will take to meet these demands. The groups emphasize their readiness to work with Congress to safeguard democratic principles and ensure that the rights of all Americans are protected.

“Make no mistake: this isn’t just about Washington, D.C. or Los Angeles. President Trump is attempting to write himself a blank check to deploy federal agents and military troops against the very people they are supposed to protect. Congress must hold the Trump administration accountable for using federal forces to suppress dissent and target our immigrant neighbors and unhoused people,” said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer at the American Civil Liberties Union.

“This misuse of the military is not only impacting our immigrant community but also citizens. As someone who works in higher ed, I had to cancel a trip to DC to a Smithsonian after multiple (citizen) students expressed their discomfort at the idea of being present in DC. This is impacting education, civil rights and so much more,” said Ana Lopez Martinez of Casa de la Cultura.

“In Eagle Pass, multiple military deployments have led to repeated rights abuses, including racial profiling, asylum pushbacks, family separation, physical violence and death, as well as community trauma, destruction of public property and pollution. The military has no place in public safety and community health. On the contrary, they put our lives at risk,” said Ari Sawyer, co-director at Frontera Federation.

“Deploying the National Guard into our communities only serves to stifle local economies, instill fear, break trust and divert vital federal funding from lifesaving programs. The National Guard should not be used as a political ploy to intimidate, nor is it to be used as a tool for civilian law enforcement. The manner by which the Trump administration is using the National Guard is a threat to our democracy. Hispanic Federation calls on Congress to take action and pass meaningful legislation to prevent the misuse of military enforcement on our communities,” said Frankie Miranda, president and CEO of Hispanic Federation.

“The militarization of our cities is a direct assault on the civil rights of working families — especially immigrants, Latinos and communities of color. For decades, these communities have carried the weight of discriminatory policing and surveillance, now intensified by executive overreach and unconstitutional enforcement. When neighborhoods are treated like battlefields and families like expendable pawns, our democracy suffers. Congress must act decisively to end these abuses, safeguard due process and ensure that working people are protected. True security will never come from armed patrols in our streets, but from justice, solidarity and the power of people standing together,” said Evelyn DeJesus, national president at Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.

“Deploying the military into our neighborhoods is unlawful, dangerous and a direct assault on civil rights and democratic freedoms. Latinos, along with other minority communities, know too well the pain, fear and harm caused by racial profiling, over-policing and surveillance. Normalizing the use of troops against our own people is not public safety — it’s abuse of power. We call on Congress to act now to end these practices and defend every family’s right to live in dignity and safety,” said Katharine Pichardo, president and CEO of Latino Victory.

“As a Marine veteran and LULAC President, I cannot stay silent while the freedoms I wore the uniform to defend are trampled here at home. For 96 years, LULAC has fought to protect Latino families and all Americans from discrimination. The Supreme Court’s green light for racial profiling, paired with unlawful military deployments in our neighborhoods, undermines the Constitution and dishonors the values our service members risk their lives for. The military’s duty is to defend our nation—not police our communities. LULAC stands with our allies to say clearly: no community is expendable, and we will not allow civil rights to be sacrificed under the guise of enforcement,” said Roman Palomares, national president and board chairman of LULAC.

“Our families deserve safety, dignity and full protection, not unlawful use of military deployment in our neighborhoods. Misusing the military to engage in racial profiling is abuse of power and a dangerous violation of human and civil rights. This is not who we are as a democracy. Congress must act now to uphold civil rights, due process and constitutional protections for every family in this nation,” said Hector Sanchez Barba, president and CEO of Mi Familia Vota.

“We need Congress to step up and protect the people who voted for them. Across the country, this president is abusing military and federal police powers to sow chaos and fear throughout Black and brown communities while trampling on our civil rights. American citizens, lawful immigrants and innocent youths have been swept up in needless and cruel arrests, upending their lives. This must end. If Congress fails to act, then the American people will send a clear message to lawmakers that civil rights are non-negotiable,” said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the NAACP.

“Deployment of the military against civilians not only violates deeply held constitutional principles, but also poses a grave threat to civil rights by evading democratic oversight and enabling the use of force without public accountability. It’s an erosion of constitutional safeguards and an infringement on the freedoms guaranteed to every American citizen,” said Marc H. Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League.

“This is not a drill. Federal immigration and law enforcement agents’ unhinged overreach is wholly at odds with America’s foundational and historical values. Our federal bureaucracy should not order militarized and forceful government actions against people in our communities and neighborhoods. As things stand, all of our civil, constitutional and democratic rights hang in the balance. We must act now, or we risk losing everything generations of Americans have fought to protect for nearly 250 years,” said Drew P. Schaffer, director of the William E.

Introduction

H-2B is one of many U.S. temporary work visa programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 created some of the existing temporary work visas, including the H-2 visas for foreign nationals “coming temporarily to the United States to perform other temporary services or labor, if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.” In 1986, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) split the H-2 visa into two separate visas: the H-2A for temporary workers employed in agricultural occupations and H-2B for temporary workers in occupations outside of agriculture. More specifically, the purpose of the H-2B program is for circumstances when nonagricultural employers cannot find sufficient U.S. workers in seasonal or temporary jobs and can prove to the U.S. Department of Labor that their need for an H-2B worker is legitimate. In practice, the most common H-2B occupations are in landscaping, construction, forestry, seafood and meat processing, traveling carnivals, restaurants, and hospitality. Legislation enacted subsequently to IRCA, the Immigration Act of 1990, established an annual numerical limit of H-2B visas that could be issued, of 66,000 visas, to take effect in fiscal year (FY) 1992. This annual numerical limit of 66,000 visas is often referred to as the H-2B annual “cap.”

As presently constructed, the H-2B visa program is deeply flawed. Like other temporary work visa programs, it is rife with abuse and in desperate need of reform. It fails to ensure that migrant workers are paid fairly and treated with dignity, and it fails to prevent harm to workers who already reside in the United States. It is of great concern that the current structure does not prevent employers with track records of labor, and wage and hour violations from hiring through the H-2B program. Current rules also make it easy for employers to game the system to bypass available U.S. workers who may be seeking seasonal jobs, and to then underpay migrant workers recruited through the H-2B program. Employers control the immigration status of their H-2B employees, leaving workers with little bargaining power or even the ability to leave a lawbreaking employer without losing their ability to earn back the significant investments migrant workers make to participate in the H-2B program. In addition, the families of H-2B workers, in practice, are not able to join workers in the United States, and H-2B workers have no path to permanent residence and U.S. citizenship, which prevents them from fully participating and integrating into American society, and reduces their potential contributions to the U.S. economy. Together, these flaws call into question the credibility of the program.

This is relevant today because employer demand for more H-2B visas continues to escalate, and successive presidential administrations have repeatedly used authority ceded by Congress to increase the size of the H-2B program since FY 2016. In light of the second Trump administration’s policies and actions to carry out “mass deportations,” employers are lobbying furiously for more H-2B visas to fill jobs left vacant by workers who have been deported or have left voluntarily, or who lost their work authorization as a result of the Trump administration’s canceling of temporary immigration protections like parole and Temporary Protected Status. The recent funding allocated for immigration enforcement via H.R.1 (the Republican-led budget bill that was passed by Republican lawmakers and signed into law by President Trump in July 2025 ) will turbocharge both deportations and employer pressure for more workers employed with temporary visas like H-2B. Meanwhile, neither the Biden administration nor the first or second Trump administrations has taken any actions to implement much-needed reforms that would protect migrant workers and U.S. workers as the H-2B program expands.

This report also assesses one industry, meatpacking, as a case study of an industry in which employers are currently not heavy users of the H-2B program but have been lobbying furiously to do so and may find a sympathetic Congress and administration, given Republican control of all three branches of government. Meat and poultry processing jobs are not all temporary jobs; in fact, most are year-round, permanent jobs, and current law requires that H-2B jobs be temporary, meaning 9 months or less (with some exceptions). This report considers the impact of expanding the H-2B program to year-round jobs in the meatpacking industry compared with providing green cards to currently unauthorized workers and hiring new permanent immigrant workers with green cards, who would have a path to a citizenship.

Arguably the United States needs pathways that allow more migrants to come to the United States—especially given demographic realities and the fact that nearly all prime-age workforce growth in the past 30 years has come from immigration. But the H-2B program is not a model for a fair and safe pathway because of flaws that leave workers vulnerable to wage theft, forced labor, and other forms of employer and labor recruiter lawbreaking, including human trafficking. In addition, as this report discusses, the available data on labor standards enforcement show that many employers have engaged in mass lawbreaking by stealing billions in wages from workers in major H-2B industries over the past 25 years.

In light of the abuses taking place in those industries, Congress and the executive branch expanding a flawed work visa program that channels vulnerable workers into those same problematic industries—rather than using the legal authority they have to improve the program so that both migrant and U.S. workers are adequately protected—is misguided. Rather than expand H-2B, the Trump administration should work with Congress to implement reforms that would protect all workers in H-2B industries and provide green cards for workers instead of temporary visas.

Background on the H-2B visa program size and appropriations riders

A previous report published in 2022 provides a fuller explanation of the background of the size of the H-2B program and a history of the legislative riders in appropriations bills that have been used to expand the size of the H-2B program. Nevertheless, a brief recap here is warranted. First, in fiscal year 2016, Congress authorized a “returning worker” exemption, through appropriations legislation to fund the operation of the U.S. government. The legislation included language (known as a “rider”) exempting H-2B workers from the cap in fiscal year 2016 if they were previously in H-2B status in any of the preceding three fiscal years. There was no cap on the number of returning H-2B workers under the exemption.

In each year since FY 2017, Congress has, through appropriations riders, given the executive branch the discretionary legal authority to roughly double the number of H-2B visas available. The Democrats and Republicans in the congressional appropriations committees who included and supported the language to expand H-2B failed to specify the level of increase they wanted for the H-2B program—passing the buck instead to the executive branch by directing DHS, in consultation with DOL, to determine how many additional H-2B visas are appropriate, if any. DHS has interpreted the statute as allowing them to issue up to 64,716 supplemental visas in the corresponding fiscal year. In total, it has been 10 years (FY 2016–2025) since Congress first permitted increases to the size of the H-2B program through an appropriations rider, and appropriations legislators have proposed rider language that would allow for additional visas beyond 64,716 for fiscal year 2026.

These additional visas above the cap set by Congress are generally referred to as “supplemental” visas. The Biden administration added 55,000 supplemental visas in 2022, setting the total H-2B cap for that year at 121,000. In the following three fiscal years (2023, 2024, and 2025), DHS under the Biden administration used the full authority granted to it in the legislative riders allowing the agency to issue 64,716 supplemental visas, raising the total H-2B annual limit to 130,716. While the first Trump administration used the authority granted to it by Congress to increase the size of the H-2B program with supplemental visas, representatives from the second administration have yet to state publicly any opinions on the size of the program and whether they would take action to expand it if granted the authority by Congress.

The true size of the H-2B program has reached 170,000

In 2021, USCIS began providing data, through the H-2B Employer Data Hub, on individual H-2B petitions that USCIS has adjudicated. H-2B petitions data are categorized under either new or continuing employment, including how many petitions for H-2B workers were approved or denied, and whether each approval was counted under the original annual cap of 66,000 or the supplemental cap for the corresponding fiscal year, or whether the H-2B job was exempt from the caps. In 2024, USCIS updated these data to provide additional clarity on the types of petitions filed on H-2B within those categories. The data now specify which petitions were for continuation of an H-2B petition with the same employer (in other words, H-2B workers who had their visas extended), how many petitions were for H-2B workers who changed employers, and how many were for H-2B workers who amended their conditions of employment. (H-2B visas that are approved for extensions, changing employers, and amending conditions of employment are not counted against the annual cap.) The newly released data date back to fiscal year 2015 and allow us to have a more complete picture of the true size of the H-2B program, even compared with the estimates published in 2022.

Figure A shows that in 2015, while the statutory cap of 66,000 was still in place, the total number of H-2B workers was higher at 75,122, of which 69,684 were H-2B workers with newly issued visas from the State Department, and 1,572 were H-2B workers who had their employment extended with the same employer. An additional 3,866 were H-2B workers who changed employers.

By 2024, when 64,716 supplemental H-2B visas were added to the statutory cap of 66,000, for a total cap of 130,716, there were a total of 169,177 H-2B workers, a total that is more than 2.5 times the size of the original H-2B annual cap. Of those nearly 170,000 H-2B workers, 139,541 were H-2B workers with newly issued visas from the State Department, and 4,580 were H-2B workers who had their employment extended with the same employer. An additional 25,056 were H-2B workers who changed employers.

H-2B workers are in a small number of industries and occupations for an average of 7.6 months

As discussed above, the data clearly show that the H-2B program is growing to unprecedented levels. However, H-2B workers are not spread across a wide range of industries and occupations but are highly concentrated in just a few.

Table 1 lists the top H-2B occupations by number of approvals in the USCIS H-2B Employer Data Hub, including approvals for initial employment (representing new H-2B jobs), continuing employment with the same employer (workers who have their H-2B job and status extended), and H-2B workers with approved petitions for changing employers. The data provided by USCIS for H-2B occupations are for broad occupational categories, which are reflected in Table 1. (Data on certified H-2B positions that are provided by DOL, on the other hand, categorize H-2B occupations under narrower titles distinguished by specific Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes, which fall under the broad categories provided by USCIS. DOL occupational data are discussed and analyzed later in this report.)

By far the top broad occupational category according to USCIS petition data is building and grounds cleaning and maintenance operations, accounting for 45.9% of all H-2B petitions counted, which corresponds to landscaping, maids and housekeepers, and janitors. The second largest occupation is food preparation and serving-related occupations, accounting for 14.1%, which correspond to jobs like restaurant cooks, food servers, and persons employed in fast food restaurants. The third largest is construction and extraction occupations, accounting for 7.7%, which correspond to construction laborers and other construction jobs like cement masons and concrete finishers.

As Table 1 shows, the top-10 occupations by number of approvals in the USCIS H-2B Employer Data Hub accounted for 98.8% of all H-2B approvals in 2024. If we exclude occupation number 7, “N/A”—which represents data observations in which the occupation field was missing—the remaining nine occupations still account for 94.5% of all H-2B approvals in 2024.

The average duration of H-2B jobs can be found by analyzing data from DOL’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification. The 243,798 certified jobs in fiscal year 2024 were approved for jobs with a duration of 232 days, or 7.6 months, with 86% of the jobs having been certified for 6 months or more, 75% certified for 7 months or more, 53% certified for 8 months or more, and 28% certified for 9 months or more.

A high-road employment strategy prioritizing green cards: Meatpacking as a case study

Despite the rapid increase in the size of the H-2B program, H-2B workers are concentrated in a small number of industries and occupations. By law, an employer’s need for an H-2B worker must be temporary or seasonal, but employers have been lobbying to expand H-2B into year-round, permanent jobs. Especially given the Trump administration’s determination to undertake a campaign of mass deportation and the massive influx of funding it has received through the Republican-led budget bill that was signed into law in July 2025, employers in many low-wage industries are looking for alternative employment strategies. One notable industry in which this push from employers for year-round H-2B workers is occurring is meatpacking—which we define as meat and poultry processing.

In this section, we consider some of the impacts on the industry, workers, and local economies if meatpacking employers were able to significantly increase their hiring of H-2B workers compared with a scenario in which workers have a permanent immigration status instead. In other words, if current unauthorized immigrant workers were provided with a path to a green card and citizenship, and/or if newly recruited immigrant workers were hired with a green card in hand.

Meatpacking is an industry with a clear history of employers weaponizing immigration trends and policies to hamstring the power of workers to demand higher job quality. In the early 20th century, meatpacking was arduous and unsafe work done overwhelmingly by foreign-born workers for extremely low pay. However, from the 1940s until the early 1980s, unionization rates in the sector were higher than in the manufacturing average, and this labor market power showed up as wages in the meatpacking sector actually exceeding the average of even the rest of the relatively high-wage manufacturing sector.

In the 1980s, however, unionization rates in the “animal slaughtering and processing” sector declined sharply, falling from 37.4% in 1983 to 20.5% in 1989. (This sector includes both meatpacking and poultry processing.) Historical research indicates that unionization trends (both the post-World War II increase and the subsequent fall) in this sector were largely driven by meatpacking. Unionization rates in this larger sector stayed roughly steady through the 1990s and 2000s, standing at 21.7% in 2007, right before the Great Recession. Since 2007 there has been a shallow (if uneven) decline, with unionization rates averaging under 19% since 2007. The year 2024 saw a very sharp one-year drop in the rate to 13.5%; it is unclear if this is a statistical blip or instead represents sustained downward pressure on unionization rates. Unionization rates in the animal processing sector remain about twice as high as the private-sector average (13.5% versus 6.7%) but far below rates prevailing in the early 1980s.

This decline in unionization rates corresponds with a rise in the share of the workforce that is foreign-born (shown in Figure B). This swapping out of unionized workers for many nonunionized immigrant workers was an intentional strategy of meatpacking employers who undertook aggressive recruitment campaigns in immigrant communities to find nonunion labor, including from beyond the borders of the United States. (Nevertheless, unions can and do unionize some foreign-born workers, despite the added difficulties caused by their immigration status, which makes them more vulnerable to exploitation and retaliation. However, data on their immigration statuses are not readily available (i.e., whether they are naturalized citizens, green card holders, or lack status)).

The precarity of much of the immigrant workforce in the meatpacking sector keeps wages suppressed—and not just for the foreign-born. In light of newly aggressive immigration enforcement, meatpacking employers may well be thinking about alternative ways to keep their workforce disempowered, especially if the option of large-scale employment of unauthorized workers becomes less viable. An obvious alternative model of immigration-based labor precarity would be to increase hiring through the H-2B visa program, since the program fails to fully protect the rights of migrant workers. At present, relatively few meatpacking employers hire through H-2B because the law only permits temporary jobs to be filled by H-2B workers, whereas meatpacking work is not temporary or seasonal. Expanded hiring of H-2B workers in meatpacking would require a statutory change, and reports from industry publications suggest that employers are, in fact, lobbying for that, as well as a change to allow hiring through the H-2A visa program, an uncapped visa program that is currently only permitted for seasonal farm jobs.

Why a precarious workforce for meatpacking is bad for local economies

A replacement of the existing precarious immigrant workforce with another precarious and temporary migrant workforce would do nothing to spur needed job-quality improvements in meatpacking. If the widespread adoption of H-2B visas went beyond this and began displacing unionized positions, already insufficient job quality would degrade significantly.

The possibility of visa-enabled suppression of workers’ wages and bargaining power would obviously be bad for meatpacking workers themselves, but this would also be bad for the local economies that meatpacking plants often anchor. The meatpacking industry in recent decades has seen pronounced concentration, with more and more meatpacking done by a smaller number of very large firms, but also done in more geographically concentrated plants, usually located far from metropolitan centers. The concentration of meatpacking in less urban parts of the United States means that meatpacking workers’ leverage is weaker due to a lack of easily obtainable alternative job options, should they lose their meatpacking jobs.

This geographic concentration also means that the local meatpacking plant is often a key engine of local economies. Anything that degrades workers’ wages at these plants translates directly into less money flowing into the local economies. The corresponding increase in profits and business income that accompanies successful wage suppression efforts is far less likely to redound to the benefit of these local economies. The owners of today’s meatpacking plants tend to be large corporate conglomerates that distribute profits to the shareholders and managers who overwhelmingly live outside the counties and towns that plants are located in.

Going forward, the choice facing the meatpacking industry seems to be a high-road or low-road workforce strategy, both of which will require changes to current U.S. law. The high-road strategy—converting today’s precarious immigrant pool into a unionized workforce (composed of both foreign-born workers with a permanent immigration status and U.S.-born workers)—will raise wages for meatpacking workers and raise spending and demand for labor in the local economies anchored by these plants. The low-road strategy—converting today’s precarious immigrant labor pool into tomorrow’s precarious temporary migrant labor pool—will do the opposite. Namely, the low-road strategy entails replacing current unauthorized immigrant workers and workers with time-limited protections like Temporary Protected Status and parole, with H-2B workers on temporary visas that fail to provide fundamental labor and workplace protections. That scenario will keep meatpacking wages extremely low and sap demand in local economies.

Wage gains from providing workers with a permanent immigration status would raise demand for goods and services in local economies

The potential stakes in this decision are not trivial. According to the Current Employment Statistics (CES) of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the animal slaughtering and processing industry (including poultry processing) employs roughly 560,000 people in the United States. According to data from the Census of Manufacturing, these workers earn a combined payroll of nearly $30 billion. There were animal processing facilities in 37 states in 2022, and in 23 of them, its value of shipments (revenue) exceeded 1% of total gross state product (GSP). In recent decades, a growing share of meatpacking plants has been concentrating in rural and nonmetropolitan areas, making this one of the few key hubs of economic activity that is growing, rather than shrinking, in these regions.

In Table 2, we show the 23 states in which revenues of meatpacking constitute an economically significant part of the state’s overall activity—a threshold we define as 1% of GSP. Table 2 shows the total GSP in the 23 states, and then the value of shipments (revenue), payroll, value-added, and value of shipments as a percentage of GSP for animal slaughtering and processing, including poultry processing.

Table 3 shows total employment in animal processing (which includes both meat and poultry processing), and the shares of workers who are U.S.-born and foreign-born, and the subsets of the foreign-born who are naturalized citizens and noncitizens. Currently, foreign-born workers in the sector constitute over 40% of the workforce, and roughly three-fourths of these workers are not U.S. citizens. Noncitizen workers are likely a mix of unauthorized immigrant workers, green card holders including refugees and asylees, migrant workers with temporary visas, asylum seekers, and workers with temporary immigration protections like parole and Temporary Protected Status that provide legal work authorization.

Table 3 also shows that the implied labor market precarity of this workforce appears in average wages: Wages for U.S.-born workers are more than 25% higher than for foreign-born workers. Further, wages for both U.S.-born workers and foreign-born workers in the sector are significantly higher than wages reported for the 311 total jobs certified by the U.S. Department of Labor for new H-2B workers in the “butchers and meat cutters” and “slaughterers and meat packers” occupations in 2024.

The last two columns in the bottom half of the table show how wages in the meatpacking sector stack up against wages in the overall economy. The second column shows the ratio of average wages in the meatpacking sector to median wages in the overall economy for each group. The last column shows average wages per group in the overall economy, showing that average wages for all workers are significantly higher than for both U.S.-born and foreign-born meatpacking workers. One takeaway from this table is that for U.S.-born workers, the meatpacking sector is notably low wage, with average hourly wages constituting just 83.2% of typical (median) wages for U.S.-born workers across the overall economy. However, for foreign-born workers, average hourly wages in meatpacking exceed the median for foreign-born workers across the wider economy.

This wage advantage we see here for U.S.-born workers is right in line with many research-based estimates of the wage premium for having a permanent immigration status (a green card or citizenship) relative to either temporary work visas or the lack of an immigration status and work authorization. For example, Gass Kandilov found a 24.7% increase in wages for migrant workers on temporary visas, following the receipt of a green card, while Mukhopadhyay and Oxborrow also found a 25.4% increase in wages from transitioning from a temporary visa to a green card.

Similarly, Edwards and Ortega find that legalization erases 20% of the gap in observed productivity of unauthorized and U.S.-born workers, indicating that legal status alone would raise wages by (at least) 20% for workers receiving permanent status.

Given these estimates, we can provide a very rough calculation about how much wages would rise if the current foreign-born workforce in meat and poultry processing received a change in immigration status that granted them the same labor market rights and power as U.S.-born workers. These wage gains would translate essentially dollar-for-dollar into increased demand for goods and services in the local economies in which they work.

A 20% wage gain due to being granted permanent status (the midpoint of these estimates) would raise the overall payroll in meat and poultry processing—and hence, the demand flowing through the local economies surrounding meatpacking plants—by roughly 3.75%. In dollar terms, this would generate $1.1 billion additional dollars for the local economies surrounding meatpacking plants.

Importantly, Apgar finds that unauthorized workers and those in temporary work visa programs face essentially identical wage penalties relative to immigrants with long-term permanent status. She finds raw wage penalties of roughly 25% and regression-based wage penalties of 10–15%, and no significant difference in these between visa holders and unauthorized workers. This means that an employer strategy that instead sought to replace today’s unauthorized foreign-born workers in meatpacking with workers on temporary visas would not generate these wage gains and, hence, would fail to provide any boost to the local economies where these workers live.

Permanent immigrants will invest more in local economies because they send fewer remittances abroad than temporary migrants do

Besides the additional boost to local economies stemming from higher wages induced by granting permanent status to currently precarious workers, there are other potential benefits that would accrue from a program of granting permanent status and full workplace rights to today’s foreign-born meatpacking workforce. For one, evidence indicates that permanent immigrants spend more of their income in their country of residence than do temporary migrants. Temporary migrants tend to direct more consumption spending in their country of origin (often by taking more frequent trips there), and they also tend to remit a higher share of their income than permanent immigrants do.

The magnitude of these effects could be considerable. William Olney, for example, found that immigrants residing in Germany remitted 11% of their income abroad. This looks in line with what data from the United States would suggest: In 2024 remittances from the United States were roughly $230 billion based on the aggregate labor income of foreign-born workers of roughly $2.1 trillion in 2023.

Findings from two studies (one by Dustmann and Mestres and another by Pinger ) indicate that remittance rates among “temporary” migrants are 30% higher than rates for “permanent” immigrants. While it seems clear that workers on temporary visas in the United States are “temporary” and workers with permanent lawful status are “permanent,” it is not entirely clear how unauthorized immigrants currently living in the United States fit into these categories. However, if the Trump administration’s sharp increase in deportations and cancellations of status protections like TPS and parole continue, and it results in a large chunk of the current meatpacking workforce being replaced, the choice facing the meatpacking industry in terms of whether to take the low- or the high-road in constructing this future workforce maps near perfectly onto this “temporary” versus “permanent” distinction. Either the industry pushes for a system that allows employers to hire temporary workers on visas or a system in which long-term immigrants who are permanent residents can be recruited and will work in unionized jobs. The difference between the low- and high-road will have nontrivial effects on remittances—and by extension, the amount of income that meatpacking workers will spend in local economies.

If we take the foreign-born noncitizen share of the meatpacking workforce shown in Table 3 (29.9%) and assume that 5% of those workers have a permanent status via green cards, that means roughly 25% of workers in meatpacking are foreign-born and lack permanent status. Assume this workforce is converted to one with temporary work visas. In this case, those workers would likely remit 13.5% of their earnings (the average for foreign-born workers without permanent status). Conversely, a permanent regularization of status that saw their wages rise by 20% would also see their remittance rate drop to 10.5%. This, in turn, implies that remittances would drop by $220 million, and this money would flow to local economies.

While this likely overstates the number of “temporary” immigrants (because some share of the unauthorized population has resided in the United States for many years), it does give a sense of how important the temporary versus permanent distinction is for remittance behavior and how big an economic effect would be triggered by changes in the temporary or permanent classification. The obvious implication is that any move in either meatpacking or the wider economy to increase the share of the overall workforce on temporary work visas will see a rise in remittances that will come at the expense of demand for goods and services in local economies.

Family unity through green cards brings additional economic benefits

The remittances flow to the places where workers’ families live, which highlights another potential benefit from granting permanent status: Temporary migrants are far less likely to bring their families to the United States, including their spouses. This is especially true for workers on H-2A and H-2B visas. While H-2B workers are legally allowed to apply to have their spouses accompany them through H-4 visas, those spouses are not allowed to obtain work permits. Given that H-2A and H-2B workers earn very low wages, it does not make economic sense for them to apply for H-4 spousal visas, since the couple would have to survive in the United States—a higher-wage country than the countries of origin of most H-2A and H-2B workers—on just one low-wage salary. Also, as others have observed, there are additional reasons that contribute to very few spouses of H-2A and H-2B workers obtaining H-4 visas. If workers in the United States doing low-wage work on temporary work visas have spouses who remained in their country of origin, it seems obvious that workers on temporary work visas will remit a higher share of their income to support their families. If spouses are allowed to accompany workers to the United States, the remittances that previously went to spousal support abroad will instead spur demand for local economic output.

Additionally, spouses of working immigrants are themselves potential workers. If workers who would be employed in the United States on temporary work visas were instead granted permanent status—and hence, were able to bring working spouses to the United States—it would increase the labor supply and the rate of new business formation in local communities.

Consider two scenarios. In the first, the 25% of workers in the meatpacking industry who are foreign-born but not naturalized U.S. citizens or permanent residents, then become H-2B visa holders, and hence, are almost universally unable to have working spouses accompany them. In the second, these workers are instead granted permanent immigrant status via green cards. Assume that half of workers with permanent status bring working spouses to the United States and that two-thirds of the spouses work at a wage that is two-thirds as high as the spouses in meatpacking. This would generate an additional $1.3 billion in labor income for local economies surrounding meatpacking plants.

A high-road employment strategy for meatpacking with green cards would result in an additional $2.62 billion flowing to local economies surrounding meatpacking plants

In sum, the high-road employment scenario discussed here would lead to significant economic benefits for local economies surrounding meatpacking plants. First, there would be an additional $1.1 billion based on the likely wage gain due to workers having permanent status through green cards. There would be an additional $220 million resulting from the drop in remittances from workers having a green card compared with them being temporary workers. And an additional $1.3 billion in labor income would result from meatpacking workers with green cards who are able to keep their families together and have spouses who are permitted to work in the United States. Thus, the full economic impact of a high-road labor and immigration policy strategy for the meatpacking industry sums to about $2.62 billion in additional money flowing to local economies surrounding meatpacking plants. In the 23 states we identified previously that account for 80% of meatpacking activity, the average boost to state economies would be roughly $85 million per state.

Wages are still too low in H-2B occupations and undercut U.S. wage standards

Another important element of the H-2B program, and one that has been ripe for reform for many years, is the H-2B wage methodology, which sets out the minimum wages that employers must pay their H-2B workers. In most cases, since 2015, the DOL’s H-2B wage methodology has required that employers advertise most H-2B jobs to U.S. workers at the local average wage for the specific occupation and pay their H-2B employees that wage—according to data from the DOL’s Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) survey. While at first glance, this appears to be a reasonable wage rule, in practice, the available evidence makes clear that the H-2B wage rule is undercutting wage standards at the national level in H-2B occupations and is, therefore, not consistent with the law establishing the H-2B program.

To illustrate, see Table 4, which shows the top-15 H-2B occupations in fiscal year 2024 by Standard Occupational Classification code, according to the number of H-2B jobs certified by DOL. (These are narrower occupations that fall within the broader occupational codes used in Table 1 and by USCIS.) For context, as Table 4 shows, the top-15 H-2B occupations accounted for 82% of all certified H-2B jobs in 2024. The column to the right of the number of certified jobs is the nationwide average hourly wage for all certified H-2B workers in each of the occupations, according to our analysis of DOL disclosure data.

To the right of the H-2B average hourly wage column are the 2024 average hourly wage rates for all workers in the occupation nationwide, according to DOL’s OEWS survey, which is the same data set used to set H-2B wage rates, making it an apples-to-apples comparison. The final two columns show the difference between the average hourly certified wage for all H-2B workers nationwide in the occupation and the average hourly OEWS wage for all workers in the entire country—the dollar amount and in percentage terms. In other words, these numbers reveal the amounts by which certified H-2B wages are undercutting national-level wage standards in H-2B occupations. Table 4 clearly shows that the H-2B program is allowing employers to legally undercut U.S. wage standards, which harms all workers, regardless of whether they are U.S.-born citizens or foreign-born.

While, as noted above, H-2B wages are set at the local level according to each job, we must instead look at the impact of the H-2B program on the average wages of H-2B occupations at the national level because the H-2B statute sets a national standard for the protection of U.S. labor standards. The H-2B statute clearly states that H-2B workers can be hired only “if unemployed persons capable of performing such service or labor cannot be found in this country.” In order to determine whether there are “unemployed persons” in the United States capable of doing a job before an employer can hire an H-2B worker, employers should be required to offer at least the local, state, or national average wage for the occupation (whichever is highest), recruit U.S. workers nationwide, and offer to pay for housing and transportation for both U.S. and H-2B workers. But under the H-2B recruitment and wage regulations, that’s never been the case.

Table 4 shows that in all of the top-15 H-2B occupations in fiscal year 2024, the average hourly wage certified nationwide for H-2B workers was lower than the OEWS average hourly wage for all workers in the occupation. The biggest wage differential was found in the forest and conservation workers occupation: The national average hourly wage was $5.08 higher than the average wage certified for H-2B workers. The next biggest difference was for cement masons and concrete finishers, where the national average wage was $4.88 higher than the average wage certified for H-2B workers. If, for example, an employer hired an H-2B cement mason to work for 40 hours per week for the average duration of an H-2B job (approximately 33 weeks) at $4.88 per hour less than the national average wage—due to local wage variations, as the H-2B wage rule allows—the employer would save, and an H-2B worker would be underpaid by $6,442.

In the top occupations of landscaping and groundskeeping workers—which accounted for 37% of all H-2B certified jobs in 2024—the average H-2B wage was $2.11 lower per hour than the national average wage, almost 11% less. The construction laborers’ occupation, which is consistently one of the top H-2B occupations every year, had an average H-2B wage that was $3.79 less than the national average wage for the occupation, over 15% less. Employers in the seafood industry, who every year are some of the loudest voices calling for an increase in the H-2B cap, collectively paid their H-2B workers $4.13 less per hour than the national average wage in the meat, poultry, and fish cutters and trimmers occupation, over 22% less.

An easy way to fix this so that the H-2B wage rule no longer undercuts existing U.S. wage standards and so that it is consistent with the statute that establishes the program would be to require that employers pay at least the highest of the local, state, or national average wage for the occupation according to DOL’s OEWS data. DOL could even require a higher wage—for example, the 75th-percentile wage instead of the average—in order to incentivize additional recruitment of U.S. workers. DOL has the legal authority to make these changes via regulation—and given the popularity of the H-2B program among employers and employer pressure to increase the size of the program, the Trump administration should consider implementing such a rule in order to protect wage standards in H-2B occupations and ensure that migrant workers in H-2B are not exploited and underpaid relative to U.S. wage standards.

There’s an additional element of the current H-2B wage rule that allows employers to undercut wage standards in H-2B: employer-provided private wage surveys. Employers have the ability, under the current rules, to cherry-pick the data source they like in order to establish the legal minimum wage rates for their H-2B employees through non-governmental wage surveys that DOL approves. One can rightly assume that employers never go through the trouble of using one of these private wage surveys to increase the minimum wage they’ll pay their H-2B workers—they only use them to lower it. Seafood employers are fond of this loophole, and examples exist showing they are able to pay their workers much less than what the local and state average wage for the occupation would have required.

Wage theft is a massive problem in major H-2B industries: Employers have stolen over $2.2 billion from workers since 2000

As discussed in this report, H-2B workers are concentrated in a small number of industries and occupations. Data on labor standards enforcement paint a picture of rampant wage theft and lawbreaking by employers in those few industries that employ most H-2B workers, revealing that workers are being recruited into industries where they will be vulnerable. This is cause for concern, but especially so now given the rapid growth in the H-2B program and employer pressure to change the law to allow them to hire through H-2B for year-round jobs.

DOL’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) publishes and annually updates tables with summary data on the outcomes of WHD enforcement actions in what it calls “industries with high prevalence of H-2B workers.” The seven industries WHD lists in these data tables include landscaping services, janitorial services, hotels and motels, forestry, food services, construction, and amusement. Data on the top H-2B occupations (from the USCIS H-2B Employer Data Hub and DOL labor certifications cited in Tables 1 and 4) show that the vast majority of H-2B jobs that are certified by DOL and approved by USCIS are within these broad industries.

The published WHD enforcement data include tables for individual fiscal years in four different categories, for fiscal years 2014–2024. WHD previously published data going back to 2000, but they are no longer available online (but have been preserved by the author and used for this analysis). The first set of tables, “Compliance Action Summary,” includes data on violations of all wage and hour laws enforced by WHD in the listed industries. The second set of tables, “H-2B Violations Only,” summarizes employer violations of H-2B program laws and regulations. The third set, “FLSA Violations Only,” summarizes employer violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The final set, “All Other Violations,” summarizes violations of all laws that WHD enforces, except for violations of FLSA or H-2B laws and regulations.

It is important to note that the violations and back wages owed that are detailed in these tables from WHD do not represent enforcement actions that involve only H-2B workers; they represent violations and back wages owed to any worker in the seven selected H-2B industries. These may include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (i.e., green card holders), H-2B workers, or workers of any other immigration status, including unauthorized immigrant workers.

Table 5 sums the total numbers of listed compliance actions and employees involved, along with the total amounts of back wages owed and civil money penalties (CMPs) across all 25 fiscal years, 2000–2024, adjusting WHD’s data on back wages owed and CMPs assessed to constant 2024 dollars. The average back wages owed per employee were calculated from WHD’s data and are also included.

Table 5 shows that across the 2000–2024 period, there were 247,180 compliance actions by WHD, and over 2 million workers were involved—i.e., were potential wage theft victims—in the cases that detected violations. Over 1.8 million of those workers were assessed by WHD to have actually been victims of wage theft—that is, their employers had failed to pay them the full wages to which they were entitled by law.

For those 1.8 million employees, WHD assessed a total of over $2.2 billion in back wages that were owed to them by their employers during the 25 fiscal years from 2000 through 2024. That’s an average of $89.5 million stolen per year from low-wage workers in the main industries that employ H-2B workers. Such a large dollar amount of stolen wages is particularly shocking when considering that most of the jobs in the seven major H-2B industries are associated with very low wages, as shown in Table 4.

It’s also important to remember that $2.2 billion represents only the extent of wage theft detected in the cases WHD investigated. There is no way to know the actual amounts of wages stolen in these industries. We do know that workers, especially low-wage workers—regardless of whether they are U.S.-born or foreign-born—often hesitate to report wage and hour and labor violations for fear of retaliation. We also know that WHD has limited investigative capacity, with annual funding that is flat and record-low numbers of WHD investigators on the job, with only 611 policing a labor market of 170 million workers as of May 2025. For these reasons, the actual extent of wage theft is likely higher—perhaps significantly higher—than $2.2 billion.

Table 5 also shows that on average, each worker who was assessed back wages was owed $1,228 by their employer. Back wages owed to workers were highest in construction with an average of $1,768 per worker. The second-highest amounts of back wages owed per worker were in landscaping—the industry that every year accounts for roughly 40% of all H-2B jobs—at $1,202 per worker.

In terms of civil money penalties, the total amount assessed during 2000–2024 was nearly $167.6 million. The largest share, $96.1 million (representing 57.3% of the total penalties), was assessed in food services. Construction accounted for 17.2% of the CMPs assessed at nearly $29 million.

The best solution: Major structural reforms to H-2B that provide a path to permanence for workers

As this report has shown, H-2B workers are underpaid and can only make temporary minor contributions to local economies under the status quo. Meanwhile, employer groups are lobbying furiously to expand the H-2B program by changing the law to allow employers to hire H-2B workers for year-round jobs—despite the rampant wage theft and employer lawbreaking occurring in major H-2B industries.

However, if members of Congress and the Trump administration believe in improving wages and working conditions for all workers, they should send a message to the business community that rather than expanding the deeply flawed H-2B program, a major reform is long overdue and needs to move forward. President Trump and congressional leaders should revamp the H-2B program by providing migrant workers with new protections, fairer wages, and a path to permanent resident status and citizenship. They should also implement reforms that would improve the integrity of the program, for example, by revamping the DOL system for recruitment to ensure that employers make adequate and genuine attempts to recruit and hire U.S. workers for open temporary and seasonal jobs. The administration and Congress should also prohibit lawbreaking employers from being allowed to recruit and hire through the H-2B program.

In general, legislation should be avoided that proposes to allow employers to hire more temporary H-2B workers or to hire through H-2B for permanent year-round jobs in industries like meatpacking. Instead, any proposed legislation should shift away from the use of temporary workers and create green cards—allowing migrant workers to stay in the United States permanently, increasing their economic contributions and participation in social and political life. That could contribute to stabilizing the workforce for employers and improving wages and working conditions for all workers, regardless of immigration status.

In terms of federal rulemaking, President Trump already has the legal authority to direct the leadership at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Labor to implement the many needed reforms through new or updated joint regulations and agency guidance. As of yet, there is no evidence showing that the Trump administration acknowledges the flaws in the H-2B program and that it will make an attempt through the regulatory process to protect U.S. workers employed in H-2B industries or migrant H-2B workers. If the Trump administration decides to propose regulations that would improve labor standards in H-2B industries, they should include, at a minimum:

the creation of a new registration system at DOL to screen and prohibit employers with a record of violating labor, wage and hour, civil rights, and anti-discrimination laws from hiring through the H-2B program

new regulations on wages and worker protections that require employers to pay the highest of the local, state, or national average wage for the specific job, and that end the use of employer-provided wage surveys to set H-2B wage rates

improvement of the January 2025 final rule that provides H-2B workers with limited portability to change jobs and employers, by increasing transparency for H-2B workers and making it easier for them to leave an abusive employment situation

These executive reforms would ensure that H-2B workers are paid fairly, would help prevent employers with records of violating labor and employment laws from hiring through the H-2B program, and would make it easier for workers to leave an abusive employment situation without losing the ability to earn money for the rest of their authorized employment period in the United States.

Together, congressional and executive reforms could transform a program that brings a temporary, exploitable, and underpaid workforce into one that brings permanent workers with full and equal rights to the United States. These workers would make long-term contributions and investments in local economies across the country, including in rural areas that desperately need them.

If an H-2B worker had an approved petition for a change of employer in the following fiscal year after having an approved petition for new employment, then they should be counted as an individual H-2B worker. However, it is possible that some H-2B workers may have an approved petition for new employment in the same fiscal year as an approved petition for changing employers, which would lead to those workers being counted twice in the data.

Approved H-2B petitions for an employment change with the same employer, new concurrent approvals, and amended approvals were excluded from the calculation and totaled 8,444.

The foreign-born share of the workforce in meatpacking is likely to be significantly higher, as Angela Stuesse and Nathan Dollar have argued, in part because of the inability of population surveys to adequately reflect what researchers have observed in ethnographic research. See Angela Stuesse and Nathan T. Dollar, “Who Are America’s Meat and Poultry Workers?” Working Economics Blog (Economic Policy Institute), September 24, 2020.

To calculate this, we first need an estimate of the workforce that would see a clear wage gain from normalization of immigration status. 30% of the animal processing workforce is foreign-born and lacks citizenship. This number is likely higher in meatpacking than poultry processing, but for now we will use it to be conservative. If we assume (also likely conservatively, given qualitative research on this subject) that 5% of the noncitizen workforce in the sector has a green card, this leaves 25% of meatpacking workers who would see a 20% wage increase due to normalization of status. If we multiply the 25% of the workforce that this wage gain would apply to by the 20% increase and then by 75% (which is the share of industry-average wages they earn), this yields the 3.75% stated here.

This is calculated by multiplying 3.75% by the estimated 2024 payroll of $30 billion in the industry.

On the overall labor earnings of immigrants in the United States, see Daniel Costa, Josh Bivens, and Ben Zipperer, “Immigration FAQ,” Economic Policy Institute, April 2025.

Pia Pinger, “Come Back or Stay? Spend Here or There? Return and Remittances: The Case of Moldova,” International Migration 48, no. 5 (October 2010): 142–173.

The overall remittance rate for the United States is roughly 11% ($230 billion in remittances on an immigrant wage bill of $2.1 trillion). Say that half of the foreign-born, noncitizen population of immigrants in the United States can be considered temporary and that this group makes 75% what foreign-born citizens make. This would imply that temporary immigrants account for 10% of the entire immigrant wage bill. Given this information and the fact that temporary immigrants’ remittance rates are 30% higher, we can calculate the remittance rate for permanent immigrants by dividing the overall remittance rate of 11% by the sum of 0.9 and (1.3*0.1), giving a permanent remittance rate of 10.7%. Multiplying by 1.3 gives a temporary remittance rate of 13.9%.

This calculation is based on the fact that the current payroll of meatpacking is $30 billion. Because foreign-born workers without permanent legal status constitute 25% of the workforce but make just 75% what other workers do, this implies their share of the overall wage bill is just under 19% (or $5.7 billion). If normalizing status reduces their remittance rate by 3.2% (the difference between the temporary remittance rate of 13.9% and the permanent remittance rate of 10.7% from the previous note), multiplying this by $5.7 billion and then by 1.2 to account for the wage boost from normalization implies $220 million in lower remittances and greater demand for local output.

See for example, David J. Bier, “The Facts About H-4 Visas for Spouses of H-1B Workers,” Cato At Liberty Blog (Cato Institute), June 16, 2020.

The assumptions on employment rates and wage rates of spouses are likely highly conservative. The employment rate of prime-age immigrants in the United States is closer to 80%, and even assuming all “spouses” of immigrants are female, the gender wage gap for low- to middle-wage workers is well under a third.

It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.
FALSE CLAIM: “During the first few weeks, some toilets and sinks didn’t work.” THE FACTS: Temporary maintenance issues were resolved immediately.
For many illegal aliens this is the best medical care they have received in their entire lives.
FALSE CLAIM: “One detainee had been given psychotropic medication but there was no record of that person ever consenting to it.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today set the record straight about the Washington Post’s false and misleading report on the Camp East Montana detention facility at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

“As our brave ICE law enforcement is facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults the Washington Post is choosing to smear them,"" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Here are the facts: any claim that there are “inhumane” conditions at ICE detention centers are categorically false. All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members. It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

The following are FALSE claims made in the Washington Post’s article, as well as the facts:

FALSE CLAIM: “ICE’s inspectors found some people at Fort Bliss were being held without many basic human necessities.”

THE FACTS: Every detainee receives food, water, medical care, bedding and clean clothing. The Post twisted preliminary inspector notes into a smear campaign. The facility is climate-controlled and staffed to ensure safe and secure housing.

FALSE CLAIM: “During the first few weeks, some toilets and sinks didn’t work.”

THE FACTS: Temporary maintenance issues were resolved immediately. Detainees always had access to functioning lavatory and hygiene facilities.

FALSE CLAIM: “By September… only one of the four planned outdoor recreation areas had been completed… some detainees reported only getting three sessions in a two-week period.”

THE FACTS: Recreation is provided consistent with ICE standards.

FALSE CLAIM: “Due to concerns that detainees were not being given enough food, the facility decided to increase ‘overall meal calories by 30%,’… inspectors noted this plan had not been implemented.”

THE FACTS: The claim that ICE underfeeds detainees is false. They receive three meals a day. Certified dieticians evaluate meals and ensure they meet the appropriate standards.

FALSE CLAIM: “Inspectors also said contractors failed to follow mandatory procedures for medical care… charts never filled out… screenings never conducted.”

THE FACTS: Every detainee receives a medical intake screening and proper medical care. For many illegal aliens this is the best medical care they have received in their entire lives.

FALSE CLAIM: “One detainee had been given psychotropic medication but there was no record of that person ever consenting to it. Another had been placed on suicide watch but there was no record of anyone watching them.”

THE FACTS: ICE and its medical contractors follow federal medical guidelines. Oversight is constant, and serious cases are escalated immediately. This is fearmongering clickbait. All detainees have access to appropriate medical, dental, and mental health care, including emergency services. Health care staff have a valid professional licensure and/or certification for the jurisdiction in which they practice and will perform duties within the scope of their clinical license. Facility mental health providers, by virtue of their education, credentials, and experience, are permitted by law to evaluate and care for the mental health needs of patients in ICE custody. Medical treatment shall not be administered against the detainee’s will. If the detainee refuses to consent to treatment, medical staff will explain the medical risks to the detainee of declining treatment and make reasonable efforts to convince the detainee to voluntarily accept treatment in a language or manner that the detainee understands.

A detainee may be placed in administrative segregation when the detainee’s continued presence in the general population poses a threat to life, property, self, staff, or other detainees; for the secure and orderly operation of the facility; or for medical reasons. Staff shall observe and log observations on an irregular schedule; For cases that warrant increased observation, the staff shall observe detainees accordingly.

FALSE CLAIM: “When federal inspectors arrived in September… Camp East Montana had 286 security personnel for more than 1,200 detainees… only a portion of the 452 officers promised.”

THE FACTS: Staffing levels at new facilities scale with population. Camp East Montana’s ratio of officers to detainees fully meets safety requirements. The Post misled readers by comparing phased staffing numbers without sufficient background context.

FALSE CLAIM: “Armed guards stationed along the facility’s perimeter… instructions did not explain which situations would justify the use of lethal force.”

THE FACTS: ICE officers follow clear and strict rules on use of force consistent with federal law. The Post’s claim is irresponsible fear-baiting. The facility contract security staff is reviewing their Use of Force policy to align with ICE’s Use of Force policy.

FALSE CLAIM: “For the first three weeks of August… legal representatives and Rep. Veronica Escobar… were turned away.”

THE FACTS: Tours and legal visits are accommodated after construction is complete and security protocols are in place. This member showed up when they facility wasn’t even open yet. ICE did not “hide” conditions — safety dictated phased access. Congressmembers are aware of ICE’s 7-day visitation request requirement. There was absolutely no notice given to ICE despite policies that are in place in order to protect detainees and law enforcement.

FALSE CLAIM: “Inspectors later found that detainees were in the dark about their cases… they didn’t even know who their assigned deportation officer was.”

THE FACTS: Detainees are provided access to lawyers and have full due process—in fact the average illegal alien gets far more due process than most Americans.

The decision by U.S. District Judge Timothy J. Kelly comes after the Republican administration’s Labor Day weekend attempt to remove Guatemalan migrant children who were living in government shelters and foster care.

Trump administration officials said they were seeking to reunify children with parents who wanted them returned home. “But that explanation crumbled like a house of cards about a week later,” Kelly wrote. “There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return.”

There was already a temporary order in place preventing the removal of Guatemalan children. But that was set to expire Tuesday. Kelly, who was appointed by Trump, granted a preliminary injunction extends that temporary protection indefinitely, although the government can appeal.

Kelly did rebuff advocates’ push to block the removal of children from additional countries, though he said any attempt to remove those children in a similar way would likely be unlawful.

There are also temporary restraining orders in separate cases in Arizona and Illinois, but those cases are much more narrow in the scope of children they cover, underlining the importance of the Washington case.

In a late-night operation Aug. 30, the administration notified shelters where migrant children traveling alone initially live after they cross the U.S.-Mexico border that they would be returning the children to Guatemala and that they needed to have the kids ready to leave in a matter of hours.

Contractors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up the Guatemalan children from shelters and foster care and transported them to the airport. The government has said in court filings that it identified 457 children for possible removal to Guatemala although that list was eventually whittled down to 327. In the end, 76 got as far as boarding planes in El Paso and Harlingen, Texas, on Aug. 31 and were set to depart to Guatemala in what the government described as a first phase.

Immigration and children’s advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children’s removal. The advocates argued that many of these children were fleeing abuse or violence in their home countries and that the government was bypassing longstanding legal procedures meant to protect young migrants from being returned to potentially abusive or violent places.

Another federal judge in Washington granted advocates a temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing Guatemalan migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases. That initial 14-day order was set to expire on Sunday, and then Kelly extended it through Tuesday to give him extra time to examine the case.

The government has argued that it has the right to return children in its care and it was acting at the behest of the Guatemalan government. But the government walked back an initial claim alleging the parents requested their children be sent back.

The Guatemalan government has said that it was concerned over minors in U.S. custody who were going to turn 18 and would then be at risk of being turned over to adult detention facilities.

Children who cross the southern border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.

After advocates got the temporary restraining order approved for Guatemalan children, they also asked the court to extend protections from deportation to children of other nationalities after hearing reports that the government was intending to remove Honduran children as well.

The Canadian government opened the temporary visa program in January of 2024.
He said his sister and mother were later permitted to enter Canada through a separate visa program, and they have since applied for refugee status.
As of July 29, a total of 880 Palestinians have arrived in Canada through the visa program, which had a cap of 5,000, according to Canada's Immigration Department.","When immigration lawyer Hana Marku opened her email weeks ago to a photo of an emaciated infant in the Gaza Strip, she said she felt helpless.

The child is among about 50 Palestinians the Toronto-based lawyer is representing. She said each one was blocked without explanation from submitting applications under the temporary visa program the Canadian government created to help them flee the Israel-Hamas war.

""She's a baby girl who was born last year, and she was born into this war,"" Marku said. ""An infant whose bones I can count just by looking at a photo of her.""

Marku said her clients in the Gaza Strip are facing death every day. One narrowly escaped being killed as he was bringing home flour after a bomb fell nearby, she said. Some have witnessed loved ones crushed by falling rubble.

The situation has prompted her to request a ruling from Federal Court declaring the Immigration Department has unreasonably delayed the processing of her clients' applications, and that it acted unfairly by failing to explain the reason for the delays. She also wants the Federal Court to order the Immigration Department to reopen and consider her clients' applications.

The Canadian government opened the temporary visa program in January of 2024. As part of the process, family members based in Canada were asked to submit documents then wait for a reference code that would allow them to finalize their applications.

Program hit cap

Marku said that despite all her clients applying within a month of the program opening, none were given the chance to complete their applications, because their codes never arrived. The Immigration Department never communicated with her clients to say why they had not received codes or to explain the status of their applications either, she says.

Then this March, more than one year after the program opened, each of her clients received an email from the Canadian government stating that the program had reached its cap and had closed — and that none of them would be able to complete applications.

Marku says the government did not follow the procedures it set for the visa program.

""The instructions, which the applicants relied upon, said that as long as the web form submissions were complete they would either receive codes, or an explanation about why they are not eligible,"" she said.

The Canadian Press spoke with a family member of several of Marku's clients, and agreed not to name him because of his fears that revealing his identity would put his family at risk in the Gaza Strip.

He said he submitted applications for six family members on Jan. 9, 2024, but none got approved under the program.

""We followed the process,"" he said.

He said his sister and mother were later permitted to enter Canada through a separate visa program, and they have since applied for refugee status.

He said he had to take matters into his own hands to get them out of Gaza, since Canada couldn't evacuate them. In April 2024, he flew to Cairo, paying US$15,000 in cash to smugglers who managed to transport two sisters and his mother through the Rafah border into Egypt on April 28.

""They were lucky,"" he said.

One of his sisters remains in Cairo, he said, because she couldn't get approval to come to Canada.

Canadian government endorsed UN-backed finding

Marku submitted a letter to the Federal Court this August requesting an emergency hearing to resolve the issue.

""Under the Federal Court rules, there is no mechanism to seek an expedited decision at this stage. It just doesn't exist,"" she said, saying her request for an emergency hearing wasn't meant to serve as a legal argument, but rather as a humanitarian plea.

The court has acknowledged Marku's request, but she said it didn't indicate how it plans to move forward.

The Canadian government publicly endorsed a UN-backed finding in August that famine is occurring in the Gaza Strip.

In a letter obtained by The Canadian Press, lawyers for the Immigration Department wrote that while they recognize the situation in Gaza is difficult, the case is ultimately ""futile and moot.""

""The policy cap has already been reached,"" they wrote to the Federal Court. ""Receiving unique codes cannot assist them with their situations in Gaza.""

In a statement, the Immigration Department told The Canadian Press its policy only required it to process applications submitted before it had reached its cap. The department declined to comment on the litigation.

As of July 29, a total of 880 Palestinians have arrived in Canada through the visa program, which had a cap of 5,000, according to Canada's Immigration Department. Over 1,775 have also left Gaza and have been approved under the program, but have yet to arrive in the country.

Two weeks ago, U.S. immigration officials arrested almost 500 foreign nationals working at the construction site of a multibillion-dollar Georgia battery plant jointly owned by Korea’s LG and Hyundai. The raid, led by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and supposedly the largest-ever at a single location, has set off a firestorm of commentary regarding the very public arrest, detention, and expulsion of the 300-plus South Korean citizens involved—and a furious debate over whether they were working illegally at the Georgia site (and thus worthy of arrest).

Now that the workers have returned home and the South Korean government has opened a human rights investigation into their treatment, it's increasingly clear that ICE messed up badly. The New York Times, for example, reports that the agency originally targeted only a few Hispanic workers and had no Korean translators on hand when the arrests were made. Even more suspiciously, ICE has refused to explain what immigration laws the Koreans actually broke, and their removal documents uncharacteristically lacked an express admission of wrongdoing. Other reports, meanwhile, note that U.S. immigration officers treated the Koreans terribly while in detention and wanted them all handcuffed upon departure—a second “perp walk” that was thankfully avoided. Several U.S. government officials have also apologized to the Korean government, including once in public. For an administration that prides itself on never backing down, this is about as clear an admission of fault as you’ll get.

Whether the Koreans were technically violating U.S. immigration law is less clear. The Times notes that most of them were here on B-1 or B-1/B-2 visas, which are issued for business trips of up to six months, or through the State Department’s visa waiver program (ESTA), which allows for 90-day business or tourism trips without a visa. Other outlets have added that similar arrangements are common for foreign companies setting up new and complex facilities here—including for other Korean investments in Georgia. The Times admits, however, that this approach falls into a legal gray area about the exact type of work that’s allowed while in-country, and that it’s often used because a more clear-cut H-1B visa for skilled immigrants is difficult to get, especially quickly. Reuters adds that some Korean workers had expressed concerns about continuing to use “questionable” B-1 visas during an era of heightened U.S. enforcement.

Getting answers to these questions is all well and good, but there are also several important policy issues that the LG/Hyundai raid addresses—and none of them are good for the United States.

U.S. Immigration Law Remains a Mess

First, the incident is a clear example of the United States’ insanely bureaucratic and wildly irrational immigration laws—and how their needless complexity effectively creates an open license for government abuse. As noted above, several informed observers speculate that it may have been more appropriate for these workers to use an H-1B visa to avoid limits on the type of work they perform or the duration of their stay. But, the Times notes, a low and arbitrary cap on H-1Bs (only 85,000 total are issued each year) make them “expensive to apply for and in high demand,” and a lottery system for allocating these visas makes quickly obtaining one extremely uncertain. H-1B visas also have their own rules, another immigration expert tells me, that might exclude some of the Korean workers at issue. He speculates that the H-2B visa might be better for those folks, but—to the surprise of no one—it has its own onerous rules and arbitrary cap.

South Korea also lacks the kind of streamlined visa category that several other U.S. free trade agreement partners have (so those nations’ citizens can, quite logically, support the increased trade and investment the agreements generate). Combined, these legal hurdles have pushed Korean companies and their lawyers to look for quicker “workarounds” to bring in support staff for new U.S. investments—workarounds that wouldn’t be necessary if our immigration laws made any sense.

But they don’t, so many Korean firms (and other foreign investors) have turned to the B-1 visa and ESTA waiver to bring in temporary, specialized workers because those approvals are faster and easier to obtain than an H-1B. Yet they too come with headaches. As the Economic Innovation Group’s Sam Peak detailed last week, for example, the B-1 visa “prohibits most work activity,” including rote construction work, but contains exceptions for certain specialists and types of work (e.g., equipment installation). He speculates that these B-1 rules—and similar ones for the ESTA waivers the Koreans also used—allowed the workers at issue to legally enter the U.S. and work at the LG/Hyundai site. In practice, however, strict compliance with the visa’s restrictions would be messy:

[E]mployers would need to differentiate between manual labor that any tradesman can do versus highly specialized work that only the foreign worker can do. This distinction can get unreasonably blurry and burdensome very quickly. Somebody who is tasked with bolting foreign equipment to the floor might need specialized knowledge about that equipment. Having a domestic tradesman do this while following orders from a foreign specialist who is only fluent in Korean doesn't seem very efficient and could result in many mistakes.

Endless technicalities and legal gray areas also hand the government a ton of discretion regarding who gets arrested and who doesn’t—and provide a recipe for abuse. If a project and its foreign workers are favored by the government, scrutiny could be light. (Various news reports indicate, in fact, that this kind of leniency has been common for big, flashy foreign investments.) On the other hand, if government agents really want to arrest and publicly humiliate foreign workers on a project that doesn’t have Washington’s blessing, the system gives them plenty of nits to pick. Never mind, of course, that the system is so complicated and ambiguous that—as the LG/Hyundai raid and aftermath show—even U.S. agencies in the same administration can’t seem to agree on what the exact rules are.

A simplified immigration system with fewer categories, conditions (e.g., who can work where, at what wage, and for how long), and arbitrary limits would greatly reduce these problems—and it would have considerable economic benefits to boot.

Speaking of …

Industrial Policy, Again

Second, the incident is a classic case of how optimistic U.S. industrial policy plans can be thwarted by other government policies that increase costs, extend timelines, and otherwise discourage the very production and investment that the government says it wants. This conflict, as we’ve discussed, is one reason why bold predictions of industrial policy success often ring hollow: Subsidized projects that look good on paper run headfirst into other policies that impede, if not scuttle, the projects’ actual implementation. They’re also why industrial policy skeptics (like me) have long recommended policymakers fix well-known government impediments to domestic production (tax, trade, regulatory, immigration, etc.) before deciding that subsidies are needed to help “strategic” producers overcome supposed “market failures.” Refusal to follow this order of operation, we’ve warned, could be both costly (for taxpayers and the economy) and, ultimately, counterproductive.

In the current case, the policy conflict is clear: On the one hand, the LG/Hyundai facility has received billions of dollars in subsidies—$2.1 billion in state and local incentives, plus plenty more in federal Inflation Reduction Act tax credits. And it’s just the type of “strategic” foreign-invested factory that President Trump says his tariff and manufacturing policies are encouraging. (He even took credit for a separate Hyundai facility in Georgia that opened earlier this year—never mind the timing.) The U.S. government thus has a strong bipartisan interest that facilities like the LG/Hyundai battery plant get up and running as soon as possible, and it’s even established a new “investment accelerator” to speed the projects up.

On the other hand, the Trump-led government has also vowed to strictly enforce every letter of U.S. immigration law, even though it’s a well-known and longstanding brake on domestic investment and growth—especially for innovative industries like advanced manufacturing that depend on workers with big brains and specialized skills. (As we’ve discussed, for example, past U.S. reductions in skilled immigration have caused multinationals to move offshore so they can better access the talent they need; and the first Trump administration quietly accelerated visa approvals for semiconductor giant TSMC for this very reason.) Draconian enforcement efforts, which encourage (if not demand) very public shows of force and the achievement of arbitrary arrest/removal quotas, undoubtedly amplify immigration restrictions’ harms in this regard—something we also discussed when looking at past U.S. deportation campaigns.

This problem is now playing out in Georgia, bigly. The ICE raid immediately halted construction at the factory, and it won’t resume until the Korean companies find willing and capable replacements. That process will take months, because Korean workers aren’t excited to return (duh) and because there aren’t American replacements due to the specialized nature of the work at issue—such as installing Korean machinery. (It’s now being reported, in fact, that construction is paused until 2026.) According to Korean news reports, moreover, “at least 22 other factory sites involving Korean business groups, in autos, shipbuilding, steel and electrical equipment, have been nearly halted.” The raid and ICE’s subsequent abuse of the Korean workers have fueled a huge public backlash in Korea and, as several educated observers speculate, could discourage future Korean investment in the United States more broadly.

Exactly the opposite, in other words, of what an “investment accelerator” should do.

Indeed, the Trump administration itself seems to understand these risks and the damage the raid—and, by extension, restrictive and complicated U.S. immigration law—has already done. The detainees’ release, for example, was delayed because Trump offered to let the Koreans return to Georgia to keep construction moving—an offer all but one refused. (Just the kind of preferential treatment the law foments, by the way.) The State Department had its second-in-command publicly “express deep regret over the occurrence of this situation,” hope that the situation will be “a turning point to improve the system and strengthen Korea-U.S. relations,” and reiterate that the U.S. highly values Korean manufacturing investment. President Trump himself then took to Truth Social to explain why he wants and welcomes foreign companies “building extremely complex products, machines, and other ‘things’” bringing in their own specialists: because without such an arrangement, “all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place.” The Trump administration has even established a joint “visa working group” with South Korea, “with discussions said to include Seoul’s desire for a separate U.S. visa quota for its workers.”

Maybe—just maybe—the U.S. government should have considered this stuff before the subsidized investments and ICE raids got rolling.

The Perils of Zero-Sum Thinking

Finally, the entire episode is yet another warning against the type of zero-sum thinking that pervades our modern political discourse and, unfortunately, has been increasingly adopted by younger generations in the United States. As we’ve discussed, research overwhelmingly demonstrates that skilled immigrants are linked to increased wages and stable or expanding employment for native-born U.S. workers. In one very recent study, skilled immigrants were found to have raised the wages of less-educated native workers by around 2 to 3 percent from 2000 to 2019, while other studies have shown that reductions in skilled immigration did not boost native born employment (and in fact may have led to job losses). These gains are achieved via several channels—specialization, complementarity, entrepreneurship, innovation, agglomeration, tax revenues, etc.—but they all point to the same general conclusion: Skilled foreign workers usually support, rather than displace, their native-born American counterparts.

The LG/Hyundai plant shows this positive-sum outcome in practice: By the Koreans’ accounting, the detained workers were engaged in temporary, specialized work that complemented construction activities undertaken by (mostly) local workers. Even if the Korean workers actually were displacing American technicians, however, the same positive-sum conclusion would hold. That’s because the factory that those foreigners were building over the course of several months will eventually require the long-term employment of some 8,000 individuals, almost all of whom will be Americans. And the economic activity that the Korean-owned facility generates—activity, again, effectuated by those Korean technicians—will support lots of other local companies and jobs, too.

To ritualistically oppose the facility’s construction and praise the ICE raid because not everyone there was a native-born American, because some of them might be displacing Americans, or because the Koreans’ paperwork was (maybe) wrong denies this positive-sum reality—as well as the dynamic nature of the U.S. economy and the broader gains that immigration and trade often produce. It’s a reality that even our notoriously zero-sum President seems to get.

If only his most ardent supporters would get it too.

Let us know!

Immigrant rights advocates gathered across from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Wednesday evening, calling on Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to end state collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and expand protections for immigrant residents.

“We want Governor Shapiro to use his executive power to stop state collaboration with ICE and to protect our constitutional rights, including the right to due process,” said Tammy Murphy, public policy and advocacy manager at Make the Road PA. “We feel that it’s a shame that the governor hasn’t spoken publicly about protecting immigrants and protecting our constitutional right to due process, and that puts all of us in danger.”

Advocates’ demands include ending ICE access to state databases; strengthening state troopers’ ICE policy; ending collaboration between the state Department of Corrections and ICE; prohibiting immigration enforcement arrests in state facilities; and never leasing a state facility to ICE.

Blanca Pacheco, co-director of New Sanctuary Movement of Philadelphia, an interfaith immigrant advocacy organization, said people can end up being deported if they are stopped for minor traffic infractions and don’t have a driver’s license.

She wants Shapiro to support the bill, and immigrant communities as a whole.

“Varios gobernadores al nivel del país, alcaldes al nivel del país, legisladores, han hablado fuertemente en apoyo a los inmigrantes, y acá no se ha dicho nada, y eso se sienten las comunidades”, dijo.

“Several governors throughout the country, mayors throughout the country, legislators, have spoken out strongly in support of immigrants, and here they haven’t said anything, and that’s felt by the communities,” she said.

Pacheco said the increase in ICE raids in the Greater Philadelphia region have taken a toll on immigrants as well as allies who have seen their parents, brothers and fellow church members detained, and have been left feeling “grief and pain all of the time.”

“El oír que … tanto el gobernador Shapiro como la alcalde de la ciudad u otros gobernantes no dicen absolutamente nada aun expande ese sentimiento de duelo y de abandono y de incertidumbre de qué es lo que va a pasar el dia de mañana”, dijo ella, “si las personas salen a trabajar y no regresan, si los niños son dejados en la escuela y regresan y no tienen padres”.

“To hear that … Governor Shapiro and the mayor of the city and other elected officials aren’t saying anything expands that feeling of grief and abandonment and uncertainty about what’s going to happen tomorrow,” she said, “if people leave for work and don’t come back, if children are dropped off at school and come home and don’t have parents.”

Murphy said organizers also want to see Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker speak out in support of immigrant communities amid ongoing ICE raids in the city.

“There is a void of leadership on immigration rights, and people are waiting to hear,” she said. “We have families that are afraid to go to work, afraid to send their kids to school, afraid to go to the grocery store, afraid to go see the doctor.”

Parker did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

One question on that test that had drawn scrutiny was: “Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?” The correct answer was, “to stop the spread of Communism.” Another question on that test was, “Who does a U.S. Senator represent?” Previously, the answer had been “all people of the state”; on the test introduced in December 2020, it was “citizens” in the state.

The difference between that test and the one being introduced now is that officers will be required to ask questions until the applicant passes or fails. So, if an applicant answers the first 12 questions correctly, he or she will not need to continue answering all 20 questions.

Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in July that the test was too easy. “The test as it’s laid out right now, it’s not very difficult,” Mr. Edlow said in an interview with The New York Times. “It’s very easy to kind of memorize the answers,” he said. “I don’t think we’re really comporting with the spirit of the law.”

The U.S. government has administered citizenship tests in some form since the early 1900s. There was no standard test, however, so local judges and magistrates administered their own until the Internal Security Act of 1950 made knowledge of U.S. history and civics a prerequisite for naturalization. The current pass rate for the citizenship test, according to U.S.C.I.S., is 91 percent.

Applicants have two chances to pass the test before they must restart the application process from scratch.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/18/multimedia/18xp-citizenship-test-pvfw/18xp-citizenship-test-pvfw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 11:57:52.368887

Doing so would almost certainly trigger a government shutdown, something Democrats avoided earlier this year but is increasingly looking inevitable this fall.

Democratic senators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the looming shutdown has been the chief topic of discussion in recent caucus meetings.

They said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.), who took enormous heat from his left flank after voting for a GOP funding bill earlier this year, has not laid out any plan B to avert a shutdown before the Sept. 30 deadline.

“Donald Trump gave us the middle finger. There is no alternative,” said one Democratic senator, who requested anonymity to discuss caucus strategy.

A second Democratic senator said a brief shutdown would give Democrats a “win,” even if it doesn’t result in any concrete policy concessions from Republicans. This Democrat said doing so would send a “message” to Trump that the White House can’t continue to steamroll Congress.

“Without some accommodation, some compromise, I think there probably will be a shutdown for a period of time,” the lawmaker said.

The second senator said they would not vote for the stopgap measure funding the government through Nov. 21, which House Republicans plan to pass later this week.

“I hate a shutdown anyway, we don’t have any choice. We can’t go along with what they’re doing,” the senator said. “We should use every lever we have, and this is one of the very few levers where we can actually push [Trump].”

“If Trump declares martial law, well, let him be transparent and show the world that’s what he thinks his ultimate goal is,” they added.

Congress has little time to avoid a shutdown. Lawmakers are expected to be out next week for Rosh Hashanah and would return to the Capitol on Sept. 29 on their current schedule.

Democratic senators familiar with the deliberations within their caucus right now count six Democratic votes — at most — for the seven-week continuing resolution that is expected to reach the Senate on Friday or Saturday.

The party likely would need at least eight votes to help Republicans reach the 60 votes necessary to move Senate legislation forward. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has said he will vote against the funding measure because it prolongs spending put in place by the Biden administration.

Senate Democratic leaders haven’t conducted a formal whip count yet, but lawmakers believe Sens. John Fetterman (Pa.), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Jacky Rosen (Nev.) and Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with Democrats, are likely or possible “yes” votes.

Fetterman has said repeatedly he will not vote to shut down the government.

He said a shutdown “is never a good idea,” even though he “fully supports” extending the enhanced health insurance premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are due to expire at the end of the year.

Fetterman is worried his Democratic colleagues have staked out such a strong position ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline that a shutdown is inevitable.

“They are actively painting themselves into the corner. That’s why I’m deeply concerned there will be a shutdown,” he said. “I won’t be a part of it.”

Senate Democrats have crafted an alternative government funding measure that would extend the expiring health insurance subsidies, restore Medicaid funding cut by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and prevent the Trump administration from clawing back previously appropriated funding through “pocket rescissions.”

Republicans, however, say these demands are a nonstarter.

Senate Democrats say there’s been a dramatic shift in strategy since March, when Schumer and nine other members of the Senate Democratic caucus voted for a House-passed, Republican-drafted continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown.

Schumer’s vote sparked a furious backlash from the Democratic Party’s base and briefly raised questions about his future as Democratic leader.

Six months ago, Schumer didn’t take a hard line against the House-GOP drafted continuing resolution while it moved through the lower chamber, leaving it ambiguous whether Democrats would ultimately support it in the Senate.

Democratic senators say it was clear in March that Schumer wasn’t ready to force a shutdown to push back against Trump.

Sources familiar with conversations among Senate Democrats in March said they didn’t have a clear strategy over how to handle the continuing resolution if it passed the House and defaulted to just hoping Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) couldn’t muster enough votes to send it across the Capitol.

Now, Schumer is making it clear to Republicans that the House-crafted stopgap will fail in the Senate, even though he hasn’t laid out a plan B.

“When President Trump goes on Fox News and says to Republicans, ‘Don’t even bother dealing with [Democrats]’ … when he says out lout he doesn’t need or want our votes, that means Donald Trump wants a shutdown. Full stop,” Schumer said after meeting with Democratic colleagues Tuesday.

Schumer in a joint statement with House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said the short-term funding proposal put together by House Republicans “fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis.”

Democrats say as much as they hate the idea of shutting down the government, they can’t swallow the House Republican funding bill after GOP leaders repeatedly ignored their requests to negotiate the measure.

“We have a lot of diverse views in the caucus, but we’re all professional politicians. And an iron law in politics is if you want a vote, you have to ask what it would take to get it, and they haven’t even asked,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), the Democratic chief deputy whip, referring to Republicans.

Schatz voted for the partisan GOP stopgap measure in March but warned he will vote “no” on the continuing resolution unveiled this week by House Republicans.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/AP25260540283590.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-18 13:57:55.776896

Melissa Stewart, Trump v. CASA and the Risk of Statelessness (July 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. What processes could reasonably be put in place to protect individuals at risk of statelessness? Are there vulnerabilities in leaving any such protections to executive branch policy-making?

B. Use of Military in Border Enforcement

Mark Nevitt, The New “National Defense Area” at the Southern Border (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Is reforming the National Emergencies Act necessary and, if so, in what ways? For instance, should the ability of the executive branch to bypass congressional approval for certain actions during a national emergency be restricted in some way? Or should the circumstances in which the president declares a national emergency at all be circumscribed? Why might the drafters of the legislation have originally provided for exceptions to congressional approval upon the declaration of a national emergency?

ii. In what ways can we understand the (possibly purposeful) ambiguity of the military purpose doctrine regarding national security, and its concomitant effects on immigration? Should the military purpose doctrine be reimagined? How so?

William Banks, Expert Backgrounder: Federalizing the National Guard and Domestic Use of the Military (February 2024)

Discussion prompts:

i. Should Congress establish heightened limitations on presidential discretion in the Insurrection Act? What limitations would you propose, and how effective do you anticipate these limitations would be? What problems might remain, if any, and how might you address those?

C. Detention

Margy O’Herron, Big Budget Act Creates a ‘Deportation Industrial Complex’ That Will be Hard to Dismantle (August 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. If you were to reapportion the budget for immigration-related activities, how would you apportion funds, and for what reasons? Which immigration efforts should receive the most funding, and why? Or, should immigration-related funding be reallocated to another executive branch initiative entirely? What would be the benefits and drawbacks of doing so?

Jonathan Hafetz and Rebecca Ingber, What Just Happened: At Guantanamo’s Migrant Operation Center (February 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Do individuals held at Guantanamo for immigration enforcement purposes have the same constitutional rights, such as due process, access to counsel, and habeas protections, as those held within continental United States? Should they? What implications does this have for other U.S. legal positions, such as in the DOD law of war detention context where the United States has taken the position that Guantanamo is not the United States and that U.S. law does not apply there?

Just Security, Series: Executive Order 9066 (February 2022)

Discussion prompts:

i. In reflecting on Executive Order 9066 and considering contemporary issues in immigration regulation and enforcement in the United States, what actions would you advocate should be taken now, and by whom, to incorporate the lessons from history into law, policy, and public discourse in a way that meaningfully mitigates the abuse of national security authorities? What lessons from Executive Order 9066 do you think are most at risk of repeating (or already are), and what implications does that have for the current legal infrastructure in which national security authorities are exercised?

D. Deportation

1. Non-Refoulement

Scott Roehm & Rebecca Ingber, In Congress, a Welcome, But Flawed, Step to Stop Trump’s Transfers to Torture (May 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Why is it important for Congress to be specific about the kind of information it seeks from the State Department regarding El Salvador’s human rights records, U.S. work to promote human rights in that country, and U.S. efforts to remedy rights violations associated with transfers? What would the categories of information detailed by the authors allow Congress to more effectively do?

ii. In addition to (or perhaps instead of) 502B resolutions, are there more systemic approaches to Congressional oversight over U.S. security assistance and the conditions in the countries which receive it that you might recommend? What would those be, and how would they be an improvement over the current 502B framework?

Rebecca Ingber and Scott Roehm, The Trump Administration’s Recent Removals to El Salvador Violate the Prohibition on Transfer to Torture (March 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Can you make an argument for why it is in the national security interests of the United States to adhere to the law regarding non-refoulement? What core U.S. objectives does compliance with this requirement potentially advance?

ii. Is a violation of non-refoulement ever justified? Why or why not, and under what circumstances?

Oona A. Hathaway, Mark Stevens, and Preston Lim, COVID-19 and International Law: Refugee Law – The Principle of Non-Refoulement (November 2020)

Discussion prompts:

i. Although the overt emergency raised by the COVID-19 has largely passed, questions regarding the limits that public crises can and should be able to place on international legal obligations remain highly relevant. How should governments balance the exigencies of extreme public health or other significant crises, on the one hand, and the requirements of international law that may be in tension with certain efforts to mitigate such a crisis, on the other hand? Should international law account for such circumstances in some way that it currently does not? What would be the risks of doing so?

2. Punishment and Constitutional Limits

Ahilan Arulanantham, Deportation to CECOT: The Constitutional Prohibition on Punishment Without Charge or Trial (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. What circumstances of incarceration would not constitute punishment, under current conceptions of the law? Are these circumstances appropriate, or would you argue for a differing approach? If so, why?

ii. Are there circumstances when incarceration without trial is justifiable, in the context of immigration enforcement? Why, or why not? Do the transfers to CECOT constitute such a circumstance?

Frank O. Bowman III, Immigration Is Not an “Invasion” under the Constitution (January 2024)

Discussion prompts:

i. What do you make of the constitutional, caselaw, and non-immigration arguments regarding the use of the word “invasion” in the context of immigration levels? Are there any additional arguments (or counterarguments) that might also be available, in addition to those raised in the article? Are there any limitations to the arguments you identified?

ii. What do you think the greatest risks of framing immigration as an “invasion” are, and why? Is there potential for any unintended consequences?

E. Special case study: Alien Enemies Act

Rebecca Ingber, Judicial Deference and Presidential Power Under the Alien Enemies Act (May 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Is a finding that the president’s factual determinations are not judicially reviewable supportable under the political question doctrine? Why or why not? What are the risks to this approach, and when (if ever) might there be justification for it?

ii. How has the March 2025 invocation of the AEA differed from prior invocations of the authority? What relevance do any of these differences have, if any, for our understanding of its March 2025 use?

Ryan Goodman, The Absence of “State Secrets” in US-El Salvador Agreement: On Removal and Imprisonment of Non-US Citizens (May 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. The DC Circuit states in the decision in Ellsberg v. Mitchell that “the privilege [of State secrets] may not be used to shield any material not strictly necessary to prevent injury to national security.” If U.S. officials had not shared so much information publicly about the United States-El Salvador arrangement (or the State secrets argument was otherwise stronger), would there be legitimacy to the national security argument in the case of transferring non-U.S. citizens to El Salvador? Why or why not?

Marty Lederman, Remarkable Things in the Government’s Alien Enemies Act Briefs to the Supreme Court (April 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Does the government’s position regarding habeas petitions in the context of removals made under an invocation of the Alien Enemies act violate the 5th Amendment’s Due Process Clause? How or how not? Are there specific aspects of the government’s arguments regarding habeas petitions that you find more or less problematic than others?

ii. Which of the author’s arguments do you find the most compelling, and why? Can you think of any counterarguments, and any responses to those counterarguments?

Katherine Yon Ebright, The Courts Can Stop Abuse of the Alien Enemies Act – the Political Question Doctrine is No Bar (March 2025)

Discussion prompts:

i. Should there be additional checks on the president’s ability to invoke the Alien Enemies Act? In light of the political question doctrine, is it more appropriate (or potentially more effective) for the judiciary or for Congress to serve as a check? Why, and in what ways might each institution best do so? What are the limitations of either institution’s ability to do so?",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Syllabus-Image.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 09:56:40.408820

(AP) — Portland, Oregon, said Wednesday it will issue a land use violation notice to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, accusing the facility of detaining people beyond the limits of what its land use approval allows.
Under Portland’s sanctuary policy, city employees, including police officers, do not enforce federal immigration law.
Oregon also has a sanctuary law that prohibits state and local law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement without a warrant.

Landowners have 30 days after receiving a notice of violation to correct the issue.","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Portland, Oregon, said Wednesday it will issue a land use violation notice to the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, accusing the facility of detaining people beyond the limits of what its land use approval allows.

The building’s conditional land use approval, in place since 2011, does not allow people to be kept overnight or held for more than 12 hours. The city alleges that this provision was violated 25 times over the 10-month period from last October through most of this July.

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a news release. “I am proud of our team for conducting a thorough, thoughtful investigation, and referring the matter to the next steps in the land use violation process.”

The city said it will issue the notice, which also references a second violation regarding boarded-up windows, on Thursday. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Recently, the building has been the site of nightly protests, which peaked in June, with smaller clashes also occurring since then. Immigration and legal advocates often gather there during the day to help those arriving at the building, while protesters, often dressed in black and wearing helmets or masks, show up at night.

While disruptive to nearby residents, the protests are a far cry from the racial justice protests that gripped the city in 2020. They nevertheless have drawn the attention of President Donald Trump, who recently said he was considering sending in federal troops, as he has also threatened to do to combat crime in other cities. He signed an order Monday to send the National Guard into Memphis, Tennessee, and deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles over the summer and as part of his law enforcement takeover in Washington, D.C.

Most violent crime around the country has actually declined in recent years, including in Portland, where a recent report from the Major Cities Chiefs Association found that homicides from January through June decreased by 51% this year compared to the same period in 2024.

Under Portland’s sanctuary policy, city employees, including police officers, do not enforce federal immigration law. Oregon also has a sanctuary law that prohibits state and local law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement without a warrant.

Portland said its permitting bureau launched an investigation into the ICE building in late July in response to formal complaints. It reviewed data released by ICE to the nonprofit Deportation Data Project under public records requests, which indicated that the most recent of the 25 detention violations between Oct. 1, 2024, and July 27, 2025 occurred on May 20, the city said.

Landowners have 30 days after receiving a notice of violation to correct the issue. A fine can be issued if there is “substantial evidence of violation,” the city said.

The city’s permitting bureau can also initiate a “reconsideration” of a land use approval by scheduling a hearing at least 60 days after a notice is given, the city said. Decisions from the hearings officer can be appealed to the city council.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/f4bfd21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+312/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fb2%2F38%2F3e78ab7ee450cd977c745d49252e%2F6a0c02e6d05540c0abd2cfb6fc240363,N,,2025-09-18 11:59:06.977936

However, it is unclear how many people have been deported from the site or transferred to other immigration detention centers.
Other lawyers say they must schedule an appointment three days in advance to meet with their clients in person at Alligator Alcatraz.
Alligator Alcatraz was built in just over a week on a former airstrip in the Everglades, the vast wetlands west of Miami.
The state established another immigration detention center north of the peninsula, in a former men’s prison, which it named Deportation Depot.","Hundreds of people detained at the Alligator Alcatraz immigration processing center west of Miami, Florida, appear to have vanished. They have disappeared from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online database, and their lawyers and families have been unable to locate them, according to immigrant advocacy groups.

“When searching for people detained there, the ICE locator now says, ‘Call the Florida Department of Corrections for details,’” says Luis Sorto of Sanctuary of the South, a network that offers legal services and participated in a lawsuit against the government over restrictions on access to lawyers for detainees at the infamous immigration jail.

All of the plaintiffs who were being held at the center were transferred to another location after a new lawsuit was filed in August challenging Florida’s authority to detain people there, Sorto added. That lawsuit also noted that the detainees did not appear in ICE’s tracking system.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which filed the lawsuit, described Alligator Alcatraz as a “black hole,” noting that some people were “missing,” effectively “off the radar” of the immigration system, and “their lawyers and families often don’t know where they are or how to contact them.”

Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, told EL PAÍS that ICE’s “persistent refusal” to promptly update detainee locations “is a significant obstacle to effective attorney-client communication, undermines due process, and is yet another hallmark of the detention system’s cruelty.”

A Miami Herald report indicates that about 800 detainees no longer appeared in ICE’s online database as of late August, and another 450 did not have a location, but rather the message: “Call ICE for details.”

A judge ruled in August that the state must dismantle the camp following a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and a local Native American tribe, but an appeals court halted the ruling and allowed the center to continue operating while the litigation continues.

Following the ruling, however, a state official said that the facility would be empty within a few days, and authorities indicated they were transferring detainees to other facilities, including some in Florida flagged by human rights organizations for poor conditions, and others outside the state. Reports indicate that the number of people detained there has decreased significantly.

However, it is unclear how many people have been deported from the site or transferred to other immigration detention centers. Some detainees told the Miami Herald that authorities are pressuring them to voluntarily agree to deportation, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said in late July that about 100 had been deported from the site.

Alex Solomiany, a Miami immigration attorney, told the Miami Herald that he went to see one of his clients in immigration court at the Krome detention center southwest of Miami, where he learned he had been accidentally deported to Guatemala. Solomiany told EL PAÍS on Wednesday that his client remains in Guatemala and is “working with ICE” to obtain parole that would allow him to return to the United States.

Other lawyers say they must schedule an appointment three days in advance to meet with their clients in person at Alligator Alcatraz.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in an email that “the number of detainees at Alligator Alcatraz fluctuates constantly as they are deported and transferred to ICE detention centers for further removal proceedings,” and that “all detainees have opportunities to communicate with attorneys and family members.” “ICE’s goal is to remove illegals from the country as quickly as possible,” DHS said. ICE did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Alligator Alcatraz was built in just over a week on a former airstrip in the Everglades, the vast wetlands west of Miami. President Donald Trump endorsed it with a visit for its inauguration in early July, and it began receiving detainees almost immediately. Allegations of poor hygiene, food, and mistreatment soon arose. The Florida Department of Emergency Management operates the facility.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

In a social media post, President Trump yesterday said that he is designating Antifa as a “major terrorist organization.” It is unclear what mechanism Trump hopes to use to implement, as “antifa” is an umbrella description for far-left-leaning movements, and there would be no statutory authority to designate domestic terrorist groups like there is for foreign terrorist organizations. Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

The Trump administration yesterday announced the launch of a new civics education coalition. The coalition unites the Education Department and more than 40 groups aligned with Trump’s Make America Great Again movement, including the Heritage Foundation, Turning Point USA, and the America First Policy Institute. The Education Department said the initiative is dedicated to “renewing patriotism, strengthening civic knowledge, and advancing a shared understanding of America’s founding principles in schools.” Michael C. Bender reports for the New York Times; Sequoia Carrillo reports for NPR.

The White House is drawing up an executive order on political violence and hate speech, a Trump administration official indicated yesterday. According to the official, the plan could be unveiled later this week, and its specifics are still being hammered out by Trump’s top advisers, including White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. James Oliphant and Jeff Mason report for Reuters.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other military leaders are cracking down on Pentagon staffers’ alleged mocking of Charlie Kirk’s death. According to a congressional aide and a source close to the Pentagon, several troops have been fired or punished for social media posts that do not necessarily attack Kirk. A Defense Department official indicated that a suspension process has also been started in response to far-right influencers flagging service members they believe are making negative comments about Kirk. Paul McLeary and Jack Detsch report for POLITICO.

U.S. POLITICAL VIOLENCE

Disney-owned ABC yesterday announced it would “indefinitely” suspend comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show. On Monday, Kimmel criticized “the MAGA gang” as “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it,” with his remarks drawing sharp reactions from conservatives. In a podcast episode released yesterday, Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr implied that the FCC could suspend ABC’s broadcast licenses if it does not “take action on Kimmel.” John Koblin, Michael M. Grynbaum, and Brooks Barnes report for the New York Times; Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair Rep. James Comer (R-KY) yesterday asked the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit to testify about the “radicalization of online forum users” at an October 8 hearing following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. David Shepardson reports for Reuters.

House members will be allowed $10,000 per month to cover personal security costs in the wake of Kirk’s assassination, twice the funding currently available under a pilot program created this summer to boost member security, House leaders announced yesterday. Katherine Tully-McManus and Jennifer Scholtes report for POLITICO.

A GOP resolution to censure Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) over comments and a social media repost she made on Charlie Kirk’s death failed yesterday. Republican Reps. Cory Mills (FL), Jeff Hurd (CO), Tom McClintock (CA), and Mike Flood (NE) joined Democrats to defeat the measure in a 214-213 vote. Katy Stech Ferek and Jasmine Li report for the Wall Street Journal.

Russian, Iranian, and Chinese state media have mentioned “Charlie Kirk” over 6,200 times between Sep. 10 and Sep. 17, according to a social media analytics tool used by NewsGuard, a company that tracks disinformation online. All three countries framed the killing as a Western conspiracy and spread false narratives about Kirk’s death, although the details of their claims differed. Steven Lee Myers reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer today and announce the unveiling of a £150 billion ($205 billion) package of U.S. investment in the United Kingdom. Starmer is also expected to discuss foreign affairs with Trump, hoping to persuade him to take stronger action against Russia and Israel. U.S. companies that are expected to invest in the United Kingdom under the deal include Blackstone, Palantir, and Boeing. Steve Holland, Elizabeth Piper, and Andrew Macaskill report for Reuters; Shawn McCreesh reports for the New York Times; Charlotte Edwards and Michael Race report for BBC News.

The International Monetary Fund is likely to tap Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s Chief of Staff, Dan Katz, as the IMF’s second-in-command, sources say. Katz’s nomination could be announced as soon as tomorrow, the sources add. Victoria Guida and Megan Messerly report for POLITICO.

Some military lawyers and Defense Department officials are raising concerns about the legality of Trump’s campaign of military strikes on vessels allegedly affiliated with Latin America-based drug cartels, sources say. According to the sources, the concerns relate both to the legal justification for the strikes themselves as well as legal implications of the campaign for U.S. military personnel. At least some defense officials and career military lawyers who provided their opinions on the matter to Pentagon decision-makers believe they are being ignored or deliberately sidelined, one of the sources added. Lara Seligman reports for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. described the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “the most corrupt federal agency in the world” and said CDC staffers are “horrible people” who were “bought by the pharmaceutical industry” and “were killing children and they don’t care,” former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee yesterday. Monarez also said that Kennedy said that he had spoken to the White House about replacing her if she did not commit “to blanket approval to each of the recommendations” made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Robert King reports for POLITICO.

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, one of the United States’ most respected scientific bodies, yesterday issued a review of climate science concluding that the evidence of climate change was “beyond scientific dispute.” According to the chair of the committee that authored the report, Shirley Tilghman, the “study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA … as it considers the status of the endangerment finding.” Alex Guillén reports for POLITICO.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Nvidia has agreed to invest $5 billion in Intel, announcing today that the two companies will “multiple generations of custom data center and PC products.” Nvidia’s investment will give it a 4% stake in Intel, making it one of the chipmaker’s largest shareholders, and follows the U.S government’s purchase of a 10% stake in Intel a few weeks ago. Ian King reports for Bloomberg; Reuters reports.

Microsoft, Google and Nvidia have announced more than $40 billion in investments for AI in the United Kingdom during Trump’s state visit this week. Several U.S. tech leaders are participating in Trump’s visit, including Open AI’s Sam Altman and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. A U.S. tech industry representative told Politico that with these plans for investment in Britain, “we would like to see [is] a trade barrier being lowered in the digital service tax.” Tim Bradshaw, David Sheppard, Stephen Morris and Michael Action report for the Financial Times; Adam Satariano reports for the New York Times; Tom Bristow and Aaron Mak report for Politico.

China’s State Administration for Market Regulation is dropping its antitrust probe into Google, two sources told the Financial Times. The sources say this is a tactical decision to focus on Nvidia as a point of leverage in U.S.-China trade talks while sending a positive sign to Washington by dropping its investigation into Google. According to a source, “China is trying to narrow its retaliatory targets to make them more potent.” Stephen Morris reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Dozens of Israeli tanks yesterday entered Sheikh Radwan, a major residential district of Gaza City, according to local residents and eyewitnesses. The district is considered one of the city’s most densely populated areas. Israeli strikes have also cut off phone and internet services in the city, making it harder for Palestinians to call for help, the Palestinian Telecommunications Regulatory Authority said. The Israeli military said that it is looking into the incident and does not deliberately target public communication networks. Rushdi Abualouf reports for BBC News; Julia Frankel and Samy Magdy report for AP News.

No food aid has entered northern Gaza since Friday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said yesterday, saying that Israel’s military had closed an important border crossing, Zikim, on that date. According to the office, aid groups have “grave concerns over fuel and food stock depletion” due to the closure. Separately, the Israeli military agency that manages aid to Gaza, COGAT, said that 230 aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday, including through the Zikim crossing. COGAT declined to explain the discrepancy between its account and the U.N. report. Cassandra Vinograd, Rawan Sheikh Ahmad, Gabby Sobelman, and Liam Stack report for the New York Times.

The destruction in Gaza could be turned into a “real estate bonanza” under a plan that is currently on Trump’s table, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said yesterday. Smotrich also said that he has “started negotiations with the Americans” because Israel “paid a lot of money for this war, so we need to divide how we make a percentage on the land marketing later in Gaza.” Babak Dehghanpisheh and Omer Bekin report for NBC News.

The Palestinian death toll in the Israel-Hamas war has now surpassed 65,000, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry. Julia Frankel and Samy Magdy report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The United Kingdom will this weekend formally recognise Palestine as a state ahead of the U.N. General Assembly next week, the Times reports, adding that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is delaying an announcement on the issue until after Trump’s visit concludes his state visit to Britain. Steven Swinford reports.

SYRIA — U.S. RESPONSE

Syria’s interim Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani is expected to visit Washington, D.C., today for talks on permanently lifting the remaining U.S. sanctions against Syria, lawmakers and U.S. officials say. Shaibani is expected to meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio tomorrow, according to Axios. Barak Ravid reports.

Some top-ranking U.S. diplomats working on Syria have been abruptly let go from their posts in recent days, several sources say. The diplomats who were let go reported to the U.S. special envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack. One of the sources said that the departures would not affect U.S. policy in Syria, while a Western diplomat suggested that the move was in part driven by a “divergence” in views between the staffers and Barack on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Jonathan Spicer, Suleiman Al-Khalidi, and Humeyra Pamuk report for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Fifteen people have been charged with terrorism offences in Lithuania for the detonations of explosives carried in packages by DHL and DPD from Vilnius to Germany, Poland and the UK in July last year, Lithuanian prosecutors announced in a statement yesterday. The prosecutors said that the incidents were coordinated by individuals with links to Russian military intelligence services. George Wright reports for BBC News; Andrius Sytas reports for Reuters.

Polish Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz arrived in Ukraine today for talks on developing Poland’s drone capabilities, following the Russian incursion last week. “We will be signing an agreement concerning cooperation between the ministries, but also acquiring capabilities when it comes to operating drones”, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. AP News reports.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced yesterday that Denmark will acquire long-range precision weapons in response to Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine. Frederiksen called it “a paradigm shift in Danish defense policy” and said “there is no doubt that Russia will be a threat to Denmark and Europe for many years.” Maya Tekeli and Jeffrey Gettleman report for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Saudi Arabia and Pakistan signed a mutual defense pact yesterday, strengthening their existing security partnership. “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means,” a senior Saudi official told Reuters when asked whether Pakistan would provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella. Maha El Dahan and Saeed Shah report.

Thai security forces clashed yesterday with Cambodian protestors in a disputed border area, with 28 people injured and no deaths reported according to Cambodian official statements. A Thai army spokesperson said that the Thai authorities considered the incident to be a provocation and an intentional violation of the ceasefire agreed in July. The Cambodian government issued a statement that Thai security forces “used tear gas against Cambodian civilians in an attempt to surround land that Cambodians have long lived on.” Sopheng Cheang and Grant Peck report for AP News.

Yulia Navalnaya alleged yesterday that lab tests of biological samples taken from her husband, Alexei Navalny, prove that he was poisoned. She did not provide evidence of the test but urged the laboratories, in two unspecified countries, who conducted the tests, to publish them. Matthew Luxmoore reports for the Wall Street Journal.

The Taliban administration yesterday announced the imposition of an internet ban intended to “prevent immoral activities” across large parts of northern Afghanistan. The ban is the first such ban since the Taliban took over in August 2021. Mohammad Yunus Yawar reports for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Trump administration cannot, for now, proceed with its planned overhaul of the Health and Human Services Department, a federal appeals court ruled yesterday. The court upheld a lower court’s injunction prohibiting mass firings at the agency for the duration of litigation contesting the move and rejected the Trump administration’s claim that states who sued could not show they would be irreparably harmed by the injunction being lifted. Nate Raymond and Daniel Wiessner report for Reuters.

A federal judge yesterday temporarily prohibited the Trump administration from holding immigrants for prolonged periods of time in unsafe and unsanitary conditions at a Manhattan detention center. In his order, the judge said that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the conditions in the holding cells violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Luis Ferré-Sadurní reports for the New York Times; Beth Wang reports for Bloomberg Law.

An immigration judge ordered Mahmoud Khalil’s deportation to Algeria or Syria last Friday. The judge denied Khalil’s motion for a waiver preventing his deportation because of misrepresentations made in his application to register permanent residence. In a statement, Khalil remarked that the Trump administration’s “latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again.” Chloe Atkins and Marlene Lenthang report for NBC News.

“The defendant, who was a member of a Liberian rebel group, engaged in the extrajudicial killing of civilians and ordered a mortar attack which struck the U.S. Embassy compound in Monrovia, Liberia, before traveling to the United States and making false statements to obtain lawful permanent residence,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Human rights violators are not welcome in the United States, and the Criminal Division is committed to holding accountable those who attempt to conceal their crimes and live freely without consequence in the United States.”

“The defendant was a notorious LURD commander, brutal even by the standards of the Second Liberian Civil War, and he lied about his past to build a new life in the United States,” said U.S. Attorney David Metcalf for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. “Today’s sentence holds him responsible for his immigration fraud and officially ends his efforts to avoid accountability for his horrific crimes.”

According to court records, in 2010, Camara, also known as “general K-1” and “general Dragon Master,” entered the United States pursuant to an immigrant visa and later obtained Lawful Permanent Resident status and a green card by falsely stating on immigration forms that he had never participated in extrajudicial killings or other acts of violence; had never been involved with a paramilitary unit, rebel group, or guerilla group; and had never engaged in the recruitment or use of child soldiers.

At a preliminary sentencing hearing held on Jan. 23, nine Liberian witnesses described how Camara used his position of power in the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebel group to terrorize civilians, committing extrajudicial killings and other atrocities. One farmer in Lofa County, Liberia, described how “K-1 and his boys surrounded the town, . . . [and] . . . [t]hose who refused to be arrested, those who resisted, they were killed.” Another witness recounted how Camara used a handgun to kill at close range a pregnant woman and her 13-year-old son after the woman objected to LURD’s recruitment of her son. Other witnesses described how LURD rebels – and Camara specifically – fired on and killed civilians who were trying to obtain food. Camara also ordered a “mortar crew” under his command to attack central Monrovia, striking the U.S. Embassy compound, resulting in the death of a U.S. embassy employee – a Liberian guard – and other civilians. Other witnesses testified about Camara’s tactics to humiliate and terrorize civilians, including through mutilation of his victims. In one instance, a witness described how Camara tied a man’s hands behind his back and “cut off his right ear,” when the man continued to resist.

""I want to remind everybody that DHS is taking a zero tolerance approach to fraud,"" Gandhi said in her testimony.
Members of the committee had expected Grumdahl to attend the hearing so he could answer questions on reported fraud.

Ahead of Wednesday's hearing, members of the House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee learned that DHS Assistant Commissioner Eric Grumdahl, who oversaw HSS, had left his post, but they weren't given a clear answer about his departure.

Temporary DHS Commissioner Shireen Gandhi told the committee that she's only able to confirm that Grumdahl's appointment ended Tuesday. The Minnesota Data Practices Act prevents employers from sharing reasons behind an employee's separation, a department spokesperson said when asked by Bring Me The News for more details.

""I want to remind everybody that DHS is taking a zero tolerance approach to fraud,"" Gandhi said in her testimony.

Last month, the department moved to terminate HSS, a Medicaid-funded program that helps secure housing for Minnesotans with disabilities, mental illnesses, and substance abuse disorders, amid a federal investigation into fraud among providers.

DHS plans to redesign and relaunch the program with help from the Legislature, community partners, providers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

James Clark, the department’s inspector general since March, said during the hearing that DHS has become ""more aggressive"" in combating fraud and has proactively suspended payments to providers suspected of fraud since May.

A probe had been launched after payments rose from $2.5 million in 2020 – the year Minnesota became the first state to offer Medicaid funding for housing stabilization – to more than $100 million in 2024.

Walz announces new fraud crackdown

Also ahead of Wednesday's hearing, Gov. Tim Walz issued an anti-fraud executive order ""directing state agencies to intensify efforts to prevent, detect, and combat fraud across Minnesota government programs.""

He said in an announcement that the state has ""no tolerance for fraud,"" and anyone who commits fraud in Minnesota ""will be prosecuted and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

The executive order includes the creation of the Statewide Inspector General Coordinating Council, led by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, in an effort to ""unify agency inspectors general, enhance data sharing, (and) coordinate investigations.""

“Abuse of taxpayer dollars takes resources away from the people who need them most,"" Walz said in a statement. ""While we will continue to urge the legislature to take further action, this executive order gives our agencies additional tools to safeguard taxpayer dollars.”

But committee chair Rep. Kristin Robbins (R-Maple Grove) said an independent inspector general's office, outside of agency control, is needed ""to provide meaningful oversight, restore public trust, and strengthen program integrity.""

Robbins had earlier issued a statement calling Grumdahl's apparent termination ""yet another example of DHS and the Walz Administration dodging accountability for their failures.""

Members of the committee had expected Grumdahl to attend the hearing so he could answer questions on reported fraud.

""While I’m glad to see they are finally starting to hold individuals running these programs accountable for fraud, doing it the day before the public hearing just shows how DHS tries to hide what is going on from legislators and the public,"" Robbins said.

The Republican candidate for governor, who will face Walz as he seeks reelection, pledged to fight fraud when she announced her campaign in August.

During the hearing, Robbins was accused by a DFL legislator of a potential conflict of interest, as she is the chair of a committee investigating fraud, while simultaneously running for governor on an anti-fraud message. She rejected the concern, however, saying she doesn't see a conflict.

Rep. Dave Pinto (D-St. Paul) issued a statement after the hearing accusing Robbins of using the committee as ""an exercise in campaign politics"" to leverage her gubernatorial bid.

The DFL lawmaker, who works as a prosecutor outside of the Legislature, said: ""Since the start of the 2025 session, the House Fraud Committee has done next to nothing to prevent fraud. It has received not one bill and has acted on not one policy. This spring, as the Legislature passed a two-year budget, including funding and policy changes for the programs discussed at today’s hearing, the committee played little if any role. Instead, the committee has served almost entirely as a setting for questioning and criticism of the executive branch – again, without any tie to policy change.

What is the economic impact of Venezuelan TPS holders in the U.S.?
According to the immigration reform nonprofit FWD.us, Venezuelan TPS holders generate an estimated $11.5 billion annually in economic activity.","The Temporary Protected Status granted to Venezuelans in 2021 under the Biden administration — and extended through 2026 —has endured a tumultuous year amid aggressive efforts by President Donald Trump to end the program. While the Trump administration pushed to terminate the deportation protections for Venezuelans and other nationalities, federal courts have repeatedly upheld the Biden administration’s decisions to maintain the status.

On Sept. 5, federal Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco ruled that it was unlawful for the Trump administration and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to eliminate TPS from over half-a-million Venezuelans, effectively reinstating their deportation protections and extending TPS through October 2026.

“The Secretary’s actions in revoking TPS were not only unprecedented in the manner and speed in which they were taken but also violated the law,” the judge wrote.

This ruling underscores the ongoing legal uncertainties facing hundreds of thousands of beneficiaries living in the U.S. and highlighting the critical importance of re-registration, legal challenges and vigilant advocacy as their status remains under threat.

Here are the answers to some of the key questions about the status and what recent legal developments mean.

How does Venezuela’s Temporary Protected Status work?

Temporary Protected Status provides deportation protections and work permits to over half-a-million Venezuelans. The federal protections are granted to nationals from countries in turmoil who are living in the United States and cannot go back to their home countries because of war, natural disasters or other devastating circumstances.

There are two TPS designations for Venezuela. The Biden administration granted the first one in 2021, and it protects about 252,000 people. The second one was granted in 2023, and it protects about 350,000 people. The Biden administration granted the protections citing a severe humanitarian emergency, a collapse of basic services, political turbulence and economic problems.

Why did the Trump administration decide to end TPS for Venezuela?

Venezuela was the first country to have its TPS designation terminated under the current administration. The Department of Homeland Security said the designation went against American national interests despite what conditions in the country were. But it also said that certain conditions, like healthcare, public safety and the economy had improved enough for a safe return.

That’s despite Trump’s State Department warning Americans and green-card holders to not travel to Venezuela. The department issued a “Do not travel” advisory, raising alarm about the risk of “wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, and arbitrary enforcement of local laws,” as well as poor health infrastructure, civil unrest, and crime.”

In 2021, just one day before leaving office, the Trump administration issued a Memorandum of Deferred Enforced Departure for certain Venezuelans, directing that their removal be deferred for 18 months. The memo cited the “autocratic government of Nicolás Maduro,” stating that it had “consistently violated the sovereign freedoms possessed by the Venezuelan people.” The move acknowledged the severe conditions in Venezuela, despite broader attempts by the second Trump administration to limit humanitarian protections like TPS.

In August, the Trump administration designated the “Cartel of the Suns”—which U.S. prosecutors allege is led by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and other high-ranking members of his regime—as a “Specially Designated Global Terrorist” entity.

This designation raises the possibility that the cartel, and potentially Venezuelan government-linked actors, could become direct targets of U.S. military action if the administration chooses to escalate further. In September, several U.S. amphibious warships and destroyers were reportedly deployed near Venezuelan waters as part of an intensified crackdown on transnational drug cartels.

The move marked a sharp escalation in the political confrontation between Washington and Caracas. The developments underscore the growing instability and danger in Venezuela, further highlighting how unsafe it would be for Venezuelans living in the U.S. to return if their deportation protections under TPS were revoked.

What’s happened so far in the litigation about Venezuela’s TPS?

After Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced it would end a Biden-era TPS extension for Venezuelans protected under the 2023 designation in February, the National TPS Alliance and seven Venezuelans with TPS sued the Trump administration.

On March 31, Judge Chen issued a preliminary order blocking the Trump administration’s attempt to revoke deportation protections for about 252,000 Venezuelans, just days before their TPS was set to expire on April 7. Chen ruled that Venezuelan nationals with TPS could suffer “irreparable injury” without a stay preventing their deportations.

In April, a federal appeals court upheld Chen’s stay, rejecting the government’s request to lift the protection. However, on May 19, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration, allowing the termination of TPS to proceed while the legal case continues to be litigated.

The high court’s decision did not address the underlying merits of the lawsuit, which contests the Department of Homeland Security’s revocation policy. But it did give the Trump administration the green light to end the program while litigation was pending and left nearly all TPS holders under the 2023 designation without their protections. Only about 5,000 kept their status after another Chen ruling later/

Last month, the appeals court upheld Chen’s March ruling . On Sept. 5, days before the 2021 designation was set to expire, Chen ordered the Trump administration to keep TPS for all Venezuelans through October 2026.

The Trump administration asked Chen to overturn the order, but Chen denied the request.

Why is there litigation if TPS is meant to be temporary?

TPS is designed to provide temporary relief to nationals of countries experiencing unsafe conditions for return, lasting only until those conditions improve. However, in many cases, including Venezuela, the unsafe conditions persist for years. The federal government reviews country conditions every 6, 12, or 18 months and can decide whether to renew the protections depending on what’s happening in a certain country.

The ongoing Venezuelan humanitarian crisis continues. Last year’s presidential election, which let to Nicolás Maduro remaining in power, was widely criticized in the Western Hemisphere for lacking credibility and legitimacy.

Other countries also have years-long designations under TPS.

Honduras and Nicaragua have maintained TPS status for over 25 years due to prolonged crises like climate disasters. These long-standing TPS designations have also been the subject of litigation under the Trump administration, which sought to terminate or restrict the protections.

How many Venezuelans with TPS are protected under Chen’s most recent ruling?

About 605,000 Venezuelan beneficiaries currently hold TPS, regardless of when they initially received their protection, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Venezuelans represent the largest group of TPS holders in the United States, with the majority residing in Florida and Texas. It is important to note that not all TPS recipients have applied for or received work permits under this status, and the exact number with work authorization remains unclear.

How many Venezuelans have work authorization under TPS?

There is currently no official breakdown of how many Venezuelan TPS holders have received work authorization specifically through TPS. This is partly because individuals can have multiple immigration processes pending simultaneously—such as asylum claims, adjustment of status, or other forms of relief—which may also grant them work eligibility.

However, according to the Department of Homeland Security, Venezuelans who have been granted work authorization under TPS are authorized to work in the United States through April 2, 2026. Do Venezuelans have automatic TPS extension?

No. Venezuelan TPS holders were required to re-register between Jan. 17 — when the Biden administration extended TPS — and Sept. 10, despite ongoing litigation. Those who failed to re-register during this period lost their deportation protection.

Complicating matters further, on the final day of re-registration, Venezuela was no longer listed as a designated TPS country in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website, causing confusion and preventing some eligible individuals from completing the process.

In response, the National TPS Alliance filed a legal challenge, and Judge Chen ordered the government to provide additional time for Venezuelans to re-register for TPS, ensuring that those affected by the online omission would not lose their protection.

What documents prove a Venezuelan under TPS can legally work and remain in the U.S.?

Several official documents establish that Venezuelans under TPS can legally remain in the United States:

Notice of re-registration from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, confirming continued TPS eligibility.

Homeland Security’s Designation of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuela, including the recent federal ruling on Sept. 5 by Judge Chen.

A Federal Register notice on Jan. 17, 2025, detailing the extension of Venezuela’s TPS designation under the Biden administration, which explains the legal basis for the status and its continuation.

The decision by Judge Chen upholding the extension of TPS protections for Venezuelans granted under the Biden administration.

Together, the documents provide the legal foundation for Venezuelans to work and to remain in the U.S. under TPS protections amid ongoing legal challenges.

Is the Trump administration expected to appeal the most recent ruling?

While no appeal has been filed yet, Venezuelan advocates and attorneys anticipate the case could eventually reach the Supreme Court, potentially setting a precedent not only for Venezuelans under TPS but also for other nations receiving similar protections.

Lawyers in South Florida have warned that if the case reaches the Supreme Court again and the nation’s highest court side with the Trump administration, Venezuelans who have only TPS protections and no other immigration processes ongoing could find themselves undocumented and having accrued unlawful time in the United States — leaving them vulnerable to being banned for years from entering the country and making them ineligible for certain visas.

Do Venezuelans living in the U.S. hold another immigration status in addition to TPS?

There are no official statistics breaking down how many Venezuelans with TPS also hold another immigration status. However, between fiscal years 2021 and 2023, at least 331,000 Venezuelans applied for asylum, according to data from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. About one-third of the applications were filed during deportation proceedings, indicating that many Venezuelans in the U.S. are pursuing multiple forms of legal protection simultaneously.

How many Venezuelans live in the U.S.?

According to the U.S. Census data, about 900,000 Venezuelans live in the United States, though some estimates put the number closer to 1.3 million. Around 602,000 Venezuelans had been approved for TPS, according to the Congressional Research Service. Venezuelans now make up the largest TPS holder group in the country, representing more than half of the total TPS population, which exceeds 1 million.

What is the economic impact of Venezuelan TPS holders in the U.S.?

As the largest TPS migrant group in the country, Venezuelans contribute significantly to the U.S. economy. According to the immigration reform nonprofit FWD.us, Venezuelan TPS holders generate an estimated $11.5 billion annually in economic activity.

Now to the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and the case of a U.S. citizen who was caught in the middle.

Andrea Velez says she was wrongfully arrested this past summer in downtown Los Angeles, swept up in an immigration raid on her way to work. Velez says she froze, was knocked to the ground by an ICE officer, and despite declaring her citizenship was detained and led to a car. Fearing she was being kidnapped, she ran toward nearby LAPD officers, when ICE agents caught her and carried her back.

She spent two nights in jail before facing a felony charge for obstructing an officer, a charge the Justice Department dropped two weeks later.

I spoke earlier with Andrea Velez and her attorney, Luis Carrillo.

Thank you both for being with us.

Andrea, we will start with you.

Take us back to that morning. Your mother and sister had just dropped you off for work. What happened next?

Andrea Velez, Formerly Detained U.S. Citizen:

Suddenly, I saw these cars swarming in, and I just remembered that they got out their cars that abruptly, and then they just looked like they were just ready to attack and chase.

They never identified themselves as ICE agents. They just started chasing people. And I remember watching just people running. And one of them I think was a street vendor. And that's when I noticed one coming towards my direction. And I used my bag as a form of protection to shield myself.

Then I remember that he just got — and pushed me and slammed me to the floor, to the ground. He started proceeding to say that I was interfering and that he was going to arrest me. I asked him for his badge number and his identification and also if he had a warrant. And he said that I didn't need to know any of that because all I had to look was at his vest.

They were all wearing civilian clothing, sneakers and gaiter masks. And when he was trying to arrest me, I noticed that there was people filming. And I started saying my name. ""I'm a U.S. citizen."" And I started saying my mom's name and her number, because I wasn't sure if she was going to know where I was at.

I just remember thinking like, she's probably going to wait for me to come home and I'm never going to come home. So that's why I started saying my name.

And then, when he decided to take me inside the car, he took my belongings. The ICE agent took my belongings. They left me in the car by myself. And I remember there was belongings, a backpack, and I remember there was a phone. I remember there was — it just looked like a regular car.

And then, when they left me alone, I noticed a helicopter swerving in, and I started hearing the LAPD coming. And somehow I managed to open the door. The door unlocked by itself. And that's when I started running to LAPD, thinking that they could help me. And I knew that they were there, that they were going to protect me, because they have uniforms on.

And one of them said, it's OK. And he just told me to put my hands behind my back and to face — like, face the front. Out of nowhere, I noticed that one of the ICE agents was coming. And he said: ""She's mine.""

And then they let them take me. And that's when I felt like — I felt like — like there's nothing I can do. I wasn't resisting or anything. And the ICE agent decided to make a show out of the whole thing. And he picked me up from my body and then he just decided to put me down. And then they took me into the car again.

Geoff Bennett:

He said, ""She's mine,"" physically picked you up off the ground and took you back to the car?

Andrea Velez:

Yes. Yes, correct.

Geoff Bennett:

When you told that ICE agent that you were a U.S. citizen, what was the response?

Andrea Velez:

It didn't seem like they cared. I even, at one point in the car, I — they were talking about how many bodies they got that day. They then — the driver, he proceeded to say that I was an alleged U.S. citizen. So he didn't ever bother checking my identification, not until we were already inside there, inside the place, yes.

Geoff Bennett:

Mr. Carrillo, what is the status of Andrea's case today?

Luis Carrillo, Attorney for Andrea Velez: They dismissed the criminal charges against her in the federal courts. We have filed a claim, which is the precursor to a lawsuit against the federal government, because they had no basis to arrest her at all.

And so what we have seen — we represent nine U.S. citizens who were manhandled, beaten, thrown to the ground. And the ICE agents or Border Patrol agents never acknowledged their pleas when they were saying, I'm a U.S. citizen, I'm a U.S. citizen.

Geoff Bennett:

What does justice look like for Ms. Velez and the other people you represent?

Luis Carrillo:

Justice looks, for us, we're making a monetary claim. But the ideal is that they stop ICE and Border Patrol, they stop doing this damage to our people.

But they're rounding up everybody that has a brown skin in California. And it's happening in other places. We want that to stop.

Geoff Bennett:

Ms. Velez, how long were you held and what were the conditions like in the detention center?

Andrea Velez:

I was there on Tuesday evening towards Thursday morning. I remember there wasn't a bed for me. The ladies that were in there were nice enough to grab me a bed. They told me that if I wanted to drink water, I had to grab a cup, but the cup, I had to pay for.

And because I didn't have money on my commissary account, I couldn't get water. One of the nice people there let me borrow their cup for just to drink. And then, later that day, this lady, she was getting out that day and she was nice enough to give me her cup and her fork, her spork, so I could eat that day.

So they had given rice and chicken in the, like, dinner, so I was able to eat a little bit of that.

Geoff Bennett:

You have been working remotely because you're afraid to go downtown; is that right? What has this experience been like for you? How has it changed you?

Andrea Velez:

It's been challenging, just because you're not safe outside. And now that the — that they are still rounding up people, it's every day. It's a fear, like where are they going to be at? Like, you don't know what's going to happen, yes.

Geoff Bennett:

Andrea Velez, Luis Carrillo, we thank you both for your time.

Andrea Velez:

Thank you.

Luis Carrillo:

With the horrors of the Second World War fresh in their memory, European leaders, including Winston Churchill, created the European Convention on Human Rights to help guard against future human rights violations.
To uphold its promise, they also founded a regional court to step in when national courts were unable or unwilling to protect people’s rights.
For the most part, the Court has done its job of protecting Convention rights well.
But the main obstacle to removing migrants is not international human rights law.","The European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights are under attack again.

In May, nine European Union states including Poland, Italy and Denmark, suggested that the human rights court was constraining their ability to act for public safety, particularly over immigration, and had strayed beyond its original mandate.

The UK government has since joined the chorus, with the then-Lord Chancellor saying in June that the way courts interpret the convention is “out of step with common sense,” against a domestic backdrop of calls for the UK to leave it altogether. Even the Council of Europe’s Secretary General said the convention needed to “adapt” (though confusingly, he also said it did not need reform).

To understand why the Court and Convention are so important, it’s worth recalling their origins ad understanding the potential consequences of these attacks.

With the horrors of the Second World War fresh in their memory, European leaders, including Winston Churchill, created the European Convention on Human Rights to help guard against future human rights violations. To uphold its promise, they also founded a regional court to step in when national courts were unable or unwilling to protect people’s rights. (Despite sharing part of their name, they have no connection to the European Union).

For the most part, the Court has done its job of protecting Convention rights well. Many of the human rights protections we enjoy in Europe today arise from the work of the Court – including ending corporal punishment against children in schools, protecting press freedom, and protecting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.

The Court will only take a case if a person has already sought and been unable to find justice in national courts. It rejects most applications that are brought to it. And historically its judges have deferred significantly to governments on questions of how rights should be interpreted in national law and policy.

So why is it that the Court faces such opprobrium from democratic governments?

The first answer is obvious – the Court holds governments to account for their actions, including with fines and orders to address violations. And governments don’t like having their power constrained, whether by courts, the media or otherwise.

Beyond that there are two main criticisms: First, that the Court’s judges interpret the Convention to “find” rights that were never intended by its framers 70 some years ago. Second, that the Court’s interpretation of the right to family life has led to deportations being blocked in immigration cases.

The criticism about judges “finding” rights is misplaced. The Court does apply the Convention as a living instrument to factual situations that were not envisioned when the treaty was drafted. In doing so it applies the rights in the treaty rather than creating new ones. And its actions ensure that the convention continues to protect the rights of people as the framers intended.

On immigration, it is true that national courts apply the convention in ways that sometimes frustrate government efforts to deport foreign nationals. In some cases, those decisions draw on European Court rulings. But the main obstacle to removing migrants is not international human rights law. A key issue is that the states from which the migrants originate frequently decline to accept or cooperate with their return, frustrating deportation efforts. As governments in Europe blame human rights for tying their hands on migration, so the media has followed, stirring negative public sentiments.

While the right to family life is sometimes cited by domestic courts as a reason why foreign nationals convicted of crimes cannot be deported, there is a fundamental misunderstanding of the basis of those decisions. It is the impact on the rights of other family members (for example, children) who are lawful residents and often citizens rather than the person facing deportation that are often crucial to the decision. Their rights are often forgotten in the political debate around the issue.

While the European Court undoubtedly constrains state action at times, that is what it was designed to do: to protect people from overreach by the state, and ultimately to serve as a bulwark against tyranny and war. It protects 700 million people across the Council of Europe region.

While the Court is not without problems – a long backlog of cases means decisions can take years – genuine reform efforts have helped streamline its decision making. The main obstacle to its effective functioning remains the reluctance of some governments to fully implement its rulings and tackle the persistent abuses that lead to them.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media/images/photographs/2011_France_ECHR.jpg?itok=K9xfTSx-,N,,2025-09-18 05:56:26.808485

Cruz is an illegal alien from Honduras who was arrested by the New York City Police Department for murder, attempted murder, assault, vehicular manslaughter and several other felony crimes after he mowed down a 16-year-old, her mother, and her stepfather with his vehicle after the teenager refused his drunken, lewd advances on Sept. 13. The collision killed the young girl and injured her mother.

“Another young family is dealing with an unimaginable and all-too-preventable tragedy due to soft-on-crime sanctuary policies and prior open-border policies that let criminal aliens pour into our country with impunity,” said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “The days of criminal aliens being given carte blanche to harm innocent people are over. These violent offenders will face the full force of the law and then be expeditiously removed from the U.S.”

Cruz illegally entered the U.S. near Nogales, Arizona, Nov. 10, 2004. On April 20, 2005, an immigration judge denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal, granting him voluntary departure until June 20, 2005, with an alternate order of removal. On May 20, 2005, Cruz filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals, but it dismissed his appeal, vacated his voluntary departure, and remanded his case back to immigration court, where a judge ordered him removed from the U.S.

At some point thereafter, Cruz illegally reentered the U.S. ICE officers encountered him on April 29, 2013, after his arrest on Long Island for DUI. ICE officers took custody of him the same day pursuant to an immigration detainer and reinstatement of his deportation order. He was released from ICE detention on July 1, 2013, for enrollment into the Alternatives to Detention Program. Cruz subsequently absconded and all attempts to locate him were unsuccessful.

Cruz racked up additional arrests for possession of a forged instrument (October 2024); disorderly conduct: creating hazardous or physically offensive conditions; attempted driving while; and attempted operation of a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08% or more (January 2025).

Flurries of executive orders have become part of a strategy to circumvent accountability for unconstitutional measures taken against a so-called “immigration crisis.”

Despite research showing that “crime rates, offending rates and incarceration rates tend to be lower amongst foreign-born individuals,” endless promises to solve the immigration-as-crisis narrative permeated politics in 2024. Whether it was in hopes of winning the White House or a seat in the Senate, this desperate framing prevailed. Concessions to sensationalist right-wing talking points blaming immigrants for crime and unraveling social cohesion eventually set the stage for this hostile shift in our nation’s immigration policy.

The immigration crisis narrative has served its purpose in manufacturing consent for the administration to subject anyone deemed a target, regardless of their legal status, to unimaginable violence and cruelty. Meanwhile, media coverage of escalating immigration law enforcement reifies this narrative, holding a magnifying glass to the chaotic executive onslaught attempting to bring Trump’s mass deportation fantasy into reality.

Back in the Oval Office, Trump finds himself under virtually zero oversight as he guts public institutions to bankroll his agenda. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are seeing an influx of government spending like never before. Civilians emboldened by anti-immigrant rhetoric are among those benefitting from that investment, taking jobs enforcing these policies as unaccountable, unidentifiable footsoldiers.

This approach to handling immigration—relying on a barrage of dubious legal arguments that paralyze courts—is trickling its way into Wisconsin. Several counties are partnering with ICE for 287(g) and State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) agreements. These policies provide law enforcement agencies with financial incentives for incorporating Trumpian violations of constitutional protections into their activities. Tone Madison reported on the Dane County Sheriff’s Office’s (DCSO) participation in SCAAP in 2023. Two years later, DSCO announced its withdrawal from the program.

“Both programs are these ICE programs that incentivize the detention of people who are here— not just people with an unauthorized immigration status, but now it’s just anybody who they deem might be a criminal,” says political scientist and UW–Madison professor Armando Ibarra. (Full disclosure: Ibarra is my Latino History and Politics professor.)

Individuals trying to navigate the broken immigration system are being detained in courts, and the people in positions to stop it are being silenced. All the while, the threat of federal intervention still looms—because, for this administration, mere complacency doesn’t get the job done quite as fast as total subjugation.

Federal crackdowns are portrayed as a harsh but necessary response to the “invasion” narrative, which opens the door for the executive power to justify revoking constitutional rights and freedoms in the process. This illustration—the menacing authoritarian ripping down the foundations of justice and whipping everything into shape—hinges on the hope that we fall for that fantasy. If we start to believe that our rights are as good as gone anyway, why bother putting up a struggle?

But faltering in the face of authoritarian pressure is not an option. Wisconsin-based organizations—some operating right here in Madison—are showing how this is the case.

This month, the League of Women Voters of Dane County brought together community voices to share information about immigration issues and measures that people are taking in response to renewed fears. Dane County residents heard from Ibarra, Voces de la Frontera (VDLF) executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz, and Community Immigration Law Center (CILC) legal director and attorney Aissa Olivarez. The panelists discussed immigration statistics in Dane County, the possibility of federal intervention, and the necessity of community awareness and involvement.

“We need policies that build communities that are safe, collectively prosperous, and protect our rights at a time when the campaign of terror against immigrants is being waged as a tool to attack the judiciary, silence dissent, and violate human rights and due process,” Neumann-Ortiz says, during her panel.

Several organizations have been answering calls to action—stepping in to provide vital resources for the people being targeted by the federal overhaul in immigration policies. VDLF organizes a rapid response network and an emergency hotline for those at risk of being detained. The CILC administers pro bono legal services for individuals in need and hosts a legal clinic that provides counseling directly to individuals and families from all over the state.

“People in immigration court, who are at risk of deportation, have the right to an attorney, but not the right to a government-funded attorney, like we do in criminal proceedings. So we sort of created this public defender-type opportunity for immigrants at risk of deportation through our programming,” says Olivarez.

CILC partners with law students volunteering for the UW–Madison Immigrant Justice Center to connect people at the Dodge County Detention Facility, the only one in Wisconsin, which has now reached capacity. Individuals are now being sent out, often without notice, to facilities across the country, where their cases risk falling between the cracks of the system.

“I think what we’re seeing—along with an uptick in enforcement, detention, and deportation—is sort of this tactic of moving people quickly so that they don’t have access to the information that they would normally have in these facilities,” Olivarez says.

CILC’s operations, like many of the organizations providing these resources, largely rely on individual donations and volunteers. Olivarez describes their mission: “We’re a grassroots small organization, and we’re working to be able to invest to continue to grow. And part of that means, you know, us personally going and speaking at places and doing outreach about this work and educating the community about what universal [legal] representation is, right?”

Open Doors for Refugees (ODFR) emerged in 2016, built from the collective efforts of people attending an event meant to raise awareness for the Syrian refugee crisis.

“After one of the events somebody just said, ‘If you’re interested in doing something about all this, stay after,’ and a lot of people stayed after, and that just kind of started the conversation,” says Jason Mack, executive director of ODFR. Since then, the organization has developed a range of services for refugees settling in Madison, made possible through its partnerships with neighboring organizations. This includes assisting Jewish Social Services (JSS) with refugee resettlement by collecting furniture donations, providing volunteer transportation services, and procuring warm clothes for recent arrivals bracing for their first winter in Wisconsin.

Rather than breaking families apart and pushing people out, these services function to welcome people into the Madison community. “Now, with the Trump administration taking over, they have basically shut down all refugee resettlement,” says Mack. In response, ODFR has pivoted its services toward a broader portion of the community with language tutoring and an upcoming workforce development project for immigrants and refugees.

These are just a few of the many options organized by the Madison community as an organic response to uncertainty and hostility at the federal level. Spaces providing reliable information and resources, like the events that brought together ODFR, create a forum for uniting organizations with aligned goals. This ultimately casts a wider, stronger network that can focus on connecting those in need to resources.

“You have the service organizations that work alongside the city, the state that provide services of connecting people to more socially integrate into the greater community. Then you have the advocacy organizations, or the social movement organizations, that are building collective power from the bottom up and see that as mutual defense needed in this current context,” adds Ibarra.

The energy to show up and do something is there, and it takes sustained collective effort in order to prevent it from fizzling away. The Madison community’s capacity to preemptively act in response to crisis—that of federal violence enacted on our neighbors—shines when the community steps up and develops its own measures to support the most vulnerable. In times of uncertainty, we need a movement that doesn’t wait for a crisis to reach our streets, but instead takes on the job of bridging the deep gaps in our immigration system.

“This is a time for everybody to say, ‘I do have power. I do have things I can do. I can show up. I can volunteer. I can give. I can protest. I can write my legislator.’ You know, like, if we just all just fade under this kind of onslaught, then we let go of the power that we absolutely do have,” says Mack.",https://d3hccd6dowbbba.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16211534/ImmiHeader.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 02:56:44.736948

Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student who helped organize campus protests, was arrested at his Manhattan residence and put into deportation proceedings.
Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said.
In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds.
Days later, the judge ordered Khalil’s release after determining that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community.","An immigration judge in Louisiana has ordered pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the U.S., deported to Syria or Algeria for failing to disclose certain information on his green card application, according to documents filed in federal court Wednesday by his lawyers.

Khalil’s lawyers suggested in a filing that they intend to appeal the deportation order, but expressed concern that the appeal process will likely be swift and unfavorable.

The order from the immigration judge, Jamee Comans, came despite a separate order in Khalil’s federal case in New Jersey blocking his deportation while that court considers Khalil’s legal argument that his detention and deportation are unlawful retaliation for his Palestinian advocacy.

Khalil’s March 8 arrest and subsequent detention in Louisiana was part of the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics who were studying or working in the U.S. legally. Khalil, a former Columbia graduate student who helped organize campus protests, was arrested at his Manhattan residence and put into deportation proceedings. He has not been charged with a crime.

In a letter to the New Jersey federal judge, Michael Farbiarz, Khalil’s lawyers said they have 30 days from Sept. 12, the date of the immigration judge’s ruling, to appeal her decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals. The lawyers said they expect that process to be “swift” and that an appeal of the BIA decision, which would go to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, is unlikely to be successful, since, they wrote, the appeals court “almost never” grants stays of removal to noncitizens.

“As a result,” they wrote, “the only meaningful impediment to Petitioner’s physical removal from the United States would be this Court’s important order prohibiting removal during the pendency of his federal habeas case.” And, they wrote, “nothing would preserve his lawful permanent resident status.”

In a statement, Khalil, a Palestinian originally from Syria, accused the Trump administration of using “fascist tactics.”

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” Khalil said.

For more than three months earlier this year, Khalil was held in detention in Louisiana after the Trump administration arrested him, invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to deport any noncitizen — even a legal resident — if the secretary of State determines that the person’s continued presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests.

In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds. Days later, the judge ordered Khalil’s release after determining that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community.

That allowed him to return to New York, where he was reunited with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and his newborn son, who was born during his detention.

The Trump administration, however, has continued to seek Khalil’s deportation via another rationale it tacked on after his arrest in Manhattan: that when he applied for a green card, he failed to disclose all his past employment and membership in certain organizations.

Federal government records from a 10-month period show more than two dozen detention policy violations of the facility’s land use conditions of approval with the city, which does not allow detainees to be kept overnight or held for more than 12 hours. The notice also references a second violation related to boarded windows, which is not associated with the land use approval.

A conditional land use approval has been in place since 2011, shortly after the building owner for 4310 S. Macadam Ave. secured a long-term lease with the General Services Administration for two agencies associated with ICE. The site includes a processing center where federal officers detain and interview people to determine their legal status as U.S. residents.

Like ICE sites in many U.S. cities, Portland’s South Waterfront facility has attracted attention since the current presidential administration ramped up immigration enforcement.

In response to formal complaints, the city’s permitting bureau launched an investigation in late July. The City reviewed data released to the Deportation Data Project, a nonprofit that leveraged the Freedom of Information Act to request information about all ICE processing centers.

Records indicate that detainees were held beyond the facility’s 12-hour limit or kept overnight 25 times between October 1, 2024 and July 27, 2025. The most recent violation during that period took place on May 20.

“U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” said Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, who oversees the City’s administration. “I am proud of our team for conducting a thorough, thoughtful investigation, and referring the matter to the next steps in the land use violation process.”

Under land use permitting rules, a landowner or operator has 30 days after receiving a notice of violation to correct the issue. If there is substantial evidence of violation, a fine can be issued. Portland Permitting & Development can also initiate a “reconsideration” of a land use approval by scheduling a hearing at least 60 days after the notice. Once the hearings officer makes a decision, it can be appealed to the Portland City Council by any interested party.

While the matter progresses, ICE can continue to operate under its existing land use approval.

In recent years, the United States and Brazil have experienced comparable challenges to their democratic systems and the rule of law. Elected leaders in both nations, upon losing their reelection, challenged the electoral outcomes without substantiating evidence. They refused to accept the election results, inciting violence that, in the United States, culminated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, and, two years later, in the invasion of Brazil’s Congress, Supreme Court, and Presidential Palace on January 8, 2023.

On September 11, 2025, Brazil undertook a significant democratic stride as its judiciary held former President Jair Bolsonaro and other high-ranking officials accountable for their roles in various actions that laid the groundwork for the January 8 attempted coup d’état and assault on the rule of law. These actions are the result of months of extensive investigations; a similar effort had taken place regarding the assault on the U.S. Capitol before the re-election of President Trump in January 2025.

Despite the trial adhering to due process and serving as a robust institutional response to the assault on democratic norms and the rule of law in Brazil, since the beginning of Trump’s second term in office in January 2025, his administration has undertaken several troubling actions to infringe upon the independence of the Brazilian judiciary and its economy. This included the controversial imposition of Magnitsky Act sanctions on a member of the Supreme Federal Court and other associates, as well as their family members, and the implementation of unwarranted trade tariffs largely for political reasons. As with the Trump administration’s measures that threaten academic freedom, civil rights, and democratic norms in the United States, the administration’s actions towards Brazil are also alarming and represent an incorrect use of trade and U.S. sanctions policy to advance political interests.

The undersigned U.S. civil society organizations, dedicated to the promotion and defense of fundamental rights and freedoms in the U.S and internationally, express profound concern over the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine Brazilian democracy. Brazil’s judiciary has faced this situation by ensuring that those responsible face appropriate legal consequences.

Similar to other countries in Latin America, Brazil suffered a brutal dictatorship from 1964 to 1985 that resulted in the denial of civil liberties and human rights violations. Once the country returned to civilian rule, it developed strong democratic institutions with key checks and balances. This week’s ruling by the Brazilian judiciary should be welcomed as an indicator of the strength of the country’s democracy, not misconstrued as undermining it. We call on the Trump administration to refrain from any future attempts to interfere with judicial proceedings and decisions in Brazil and to respect free and fair elections in 2026.

The details are part of a lawsuit where the government is attempting to end protections for children. Declarations from families held at the facility in Dilley, Texas, which was reopened in March, described persistently cloudy water, delayed medical attention and long periods of time children are being detained.

Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, who presides over the case, heard arguments from the government, which wants to end the Flores Settlement agreement. The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

After Gee told the government last month to provide detention times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that the number of children in custody over 72 hours decreased from an average of six days to five days in June and July, respectively. The “vast majority” spent less than 72 hours in CBP custody, the report stated.

Attorneys representing the children reviewed the report and said some children are still being held for several weeks or months and often without justification.

About 65 families spoke to attorneys since Dilley opened.

“A huge percentage of families at Dilley are being apprehended from across the country as they dutifully appear for their immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights who spoke with families, told The Associated Press in a statement.

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys. The hand soap the facility provides for showers has been causing rashes, the families said. Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice and milk.

Detainees are allowed to buy staples like bottled water for $1.21 from the commissary.

""I have never heard until now of children having to buy water,” said Welch, who has been visiting children in custody of CBP and the Office of Refugee Resettlement for eight years.

Families face costs as high as $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, and $2.39 for toothpaste, Welch said in court documents. A single dose of Tylenol costs $1.30, she said.

A child with a stomachache waited six hours for a nurse and wasn't taken to a hospital with appendicitis until he vomited, court documents said. Another child fell on his arm and it wasn't until two hours later that the staff drove him to a hospital for an X-ray.

Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.

A woman's son told her that he ""doesn’t believe in God anymore because he prays to him but we still haven’t been able to get out of here,” according to her declaration, provided by Welch.

Some families are being released only to be detained again, Welch said. One family released after about 60 days in federal detention was asked to check in with ICE only to be detained at their appointment.

The federal district court found that ICE was stopping people without reasonable suspicion, with race being a primary factor in its actions.
The day after the Supreme Court’s ruling, I began the class by discussing the case.","The Supreme Court’s recent ruling upholding raids by ICE agents in Los Angeles and other cities, targeting people based on their skin color and accents, is inconsistent with fundamental constitutional principles. It legitimizes race-based policing and understandably will cause enormous fear in cities throughout the nation.

A federal district court in Los Angeles had found that ICE agents were stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion that they were unlawfully in the United States. The district court identified a number of instances of people, citizens and non-citizens, who were stopped based on their apparent ethnicity, the language they spoke, and where they worked.

The federal district court required that ICE agents comply with the Fourth Amendment and only stop individuals where there is reasonable suspicion that they are in the United States unlawfully. The court said that ICE agents could not rely on four factors in stopping an individual: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; presence at a particular location (e.g., bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.); or the type of work one does.

The United States government appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In a lengthy opinion, the appellate court upheld the district court’s order.

But the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, reversed and allowed ICE to resume its racial profiling, while the matter continues to be litigated in the lower courts.

A ruling without explanation

There is much that is deeply disturbing about the Supreme Court’s action. To begin with, the Court wrote no opinion, not a word of explanation. The lower courts wrote long, persuasive opinions in a very short period of time. But the Supreme Court did not feel the need to explain itself. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was in the majority, wrote an opinion just for himself, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the three dissenters.

Judicial opinions are important in providing explanations to the parties to the litigation and to the public. They provide guidance to lower courts and to the government officials who must implement the decisions. “Because I said so” is never persuasive and especially not when coming from the Supreme Court.

The Court’s ruling is at odds with the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion before anyone -- citizen or non-citizen, documented or undocumented -- is stopped by law enforcement officers. The Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection prevents people from being stopped based on their race.

No one disputes that this is the law. The federal district court found that ICE was stopping people without reasonable suspicion, with race being a primary factor in its actions. This should be sufficient to justify the district court’s order that ICE must comply with the Constitution.

Kavanaugh misapplies the Fourth Amendment

Justice Kavanaugh, in his opinion, says that because there are a large number of undocumented immigrants in Los Angeles, that justifies stopping individuals based on their apparent ethnicity, the language they speak, and where they work. But the core of the Fourth Amendment is that no one can be stopped by the police without individualized suspicion that he or she has committed a crime.

Justice Kavanaugh says that the “interests of individuals who are illegally in the country in avoiding being stopped by law enforcement for questioning is ultimately an interest in evading the law.” This profoundly misunderstands the Fourth Amendment: it protects the right of every person – citizen or non-citizen – to be free from being stopped by the police unless there is individualized reasonable suspicion.

It is sadly ironic that the conservative justices who have insisted that the Constitution requires that the government be color-blind ignored that here and allowed overtly race-based policing. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in a powerful dissent: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish and appears to work in a low wage job.”

I am teaching Criminal Procedure this semester. The day after the Supreme Court’s ruling, I began the class by discussing the case. A woman in the class spoke up and said, “My father is Latino. He is a citizen. He speaks English with a heavy accent. He is retired and likes to work around the home. He often goes to stores like Home Depot. I am petrified every day that he will be apprehended by ICE.” She then burst into tears.

And those who look and sound like him every reason to worry. It should not be that way under our Constitution.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/11m41z/picture311110405/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/COVER.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 00:56:39.249097

Speaker Welch and President Harmon claimed that the title of Senate Bill 328 was read three times before passage.
The circuit court then went further, separately holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Senate Bill 328.
In short, the circuit court dismissed the lawsuit on this separate ground because “Senate Bill 328 can never affect [the] plaintiffs.” After the circuit court’s ruling, Senate Bill 328 and its profound shift in Illinois jurisdiction law persist.
On September 11, however, the plaintiff lawmakers appealed the ruling, continuing their challenge to Senate Bill 328.","On May 31, 2025, the Illinois General Assembly passed Senate Bill 328, which significantly expands Illinois jurisdiction in toxic-tort litigation by conditioning foreign corporations’ ability to transact business in the state on their consent to the exercise of general jurisdiction by Illinois courts. Greenberg Traurig explained the far-reaching nature of this change in a June GT Alert.

Gov. Pritzker signed the bill into law on August 15. A circuit court recently dismissed one challenge to the law brought by various Illinois lawmakers.

Illinois Lawmakers Sued to Declare Senate Bill 328 Null and Void

On June 17, just over two weeks after Senate Bill 328 passed, a group of 47 Illinois lawmakers filed a lawsuit in Sangamon County against Representative Emanuel “Chris” Welch, the Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives, and Senator Don Harmon, President of the Illinois Senate. The plaintiffs claimed that the process of passing the Senate Bill—which Speaker Welch and President Harmon certified as complying with all procedural rules—violated the “Three Readings Rule” in the Illinois Constitution. Under this Rule, a bill must “be read by title on three different days in each house” of the General Assembly before passage. Ill. Const. Art. IV, § 8(d). According to court filings, the plaintiffs sought an injunction and a declaration that Senate Bill 328 is null and void because it failed to comply with the Three Readings Rule.

The plaintiffs alleged that, hours before Senate Bill 328’s passage, it purported to amend portions of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure concerning e-filing and pleadings. At the “eleventh hour” of the legislative session, however, the plaintiffs claimed that a floor amendment “completely replaced” the existing language with the toxic-tort jurisdiction law that ultimately passed. The plaintiffs asserted that this essentially new bill was not read three times and therefore violated the Three Readings Rule.

Speaker Welch and President Harmon claimed that the title of Senate Bill 328 was read three times before passage. The 47 lawmakers replied that the title (“An Act Concerning Civil Law”) was too vague to apprise lawmakers of the bill’s contents and that the bill was titled before the toxic-tort amendments.

The Circuit Court Dismissed the Lawsuit and Rejected the Lawmakers’ Constitutional Challenges

Speaker Welch and President Harmon moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Among other arguments, they contended that pursuant to the “enrolled-bill doctrine,” the court should not reach the issue of whether Senate Bill 328 complied with the Three Readings Rule. Under the enrolled-bill doctrine, “once the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate certify that the procedural requirements for passing a bill have been met, a bill is conclusively presumed to have met all procedural requirements for passage.” Accuracy Firearms, LLC v. Pritzker, 2023 IL App (5th) 230035, ¶ 36. Illinois courts “will not invalidate legislation on the basis of the three-readings requirement if the legislation has been certified.” Id. Separately, Speaker Welch and President Harmon also argued that because the lawmakers are not foreign corporations potentially subject to Senate Bill 328’s new jurisdictional requirements, they lacked standing to challenge its passage.

The lawmakers countered that though Senate Bill 328 was certified, the enrolled-bill doctrine “renders the Three Readings Rule utterly meaningless” because lawmakers may falsely certify that the bill complied, precluding judicial review. The plaintiffs sought a change in the law, stating that the “era of abuse of the Three Readings Rule and the Court’s blind adherence to the Enrolled Bill Doctrine must come to an end, and it should end with the invalidation of SB 328.” They also asserted they had standing to bring this lawsuit because each of them, “by virtue of being members of the General Assembly, have been directly affected by the [allegedly unconstitutional] procedure by which SB 328 was passed.”

On August 21, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss, agreeing both that the enrolled-bill doctrine barred the challenge and that the plaintiffs lacked standing. It explained that while the Illinois Supreme Court noted in 1992 that “ignoring the three-readings requirement has become a procedural regularity,” Geja’s Café v. Metro. Pier & Exposition Auth., 153 Ill. 2d 239, 260 (1992), the Illinois Supreme Court has since “addressed three readings challenges on several occasions and has, without exception, followed the enrolled bill rule.” Noting that the parties agreed that Speaker Welch and President Harmon certified Senate Bill 328 as complying with all procedural requirements, and concluding itself bound by Supreme Court precedent, the circuit court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice.

The circuit court then went further, separately holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Senate Bill 328. According to the court, Senate Bill 328 affects only “foreign corporations that will have to consent to the general jurisdiction of the Illinois Courts.” Thus, it continued, because the plaintiff lawmakers are not foreign corporations, they will never be subject to or injured by the law. Accordingly, the circuit court found that no actual controversy existed and that the plaintiffs had an insufficient interest in the lawsuit, as required to have standing to bring a declaratory-judgment action. In short, the circuit court dismissed the lawsuit on this separate ground because “Senate Bill 328 can never affect [the] plaintiffs.”

After the circuit court’s ruling, Senate Bill 328 and its profound shift in Illinois jurisdiction law persist. On September 11, however, the plaintiff lawmakers appealed the ruling, continuing their challenge to Senate Bill 328.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-09/Illinois%20IL%20State%20flag-57892205.jpg.webp?itok=y7Z0JskM,N,,2025-09-18 08:59:00.345431

Ahead of the Subcommittee hearing, Padilla and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested an oversight hearing on ORR’s mass child deportation efforts and apparent lies under oath.
Key quotes from Senator Padilla’s opening remarks are below: “Too often, their stories of unaccompanied children go unheard until a horrific story about their mistreatment shocks the conscience of our country.
Earlier this year, Senator Padilla led seven Senators in sounding the alarm on troubling reports that ORR unlawfully granted expanded access to sensitive data on unaccompanied children and their sponsors to ICE.
In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, criticized Senate Republicans’ hypocrisy in convening a hearing focused on the Biden Administration’s management of unaccompanied children as multiple recent reports emerge about the current Administration’s cruel mistreatment of unaccompanied children, ongoing family separations, and disregard for child safety and the rule of law. During his opening statement at the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing, Padilla called on his Republican colleagues to join him in pushing for oversight and accountability over this Administration’s flagrant violations of unaccompanied migrant children’s rights.

Padilla slammed the Trump Administration for attempting to unlawfully deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children in the middle of night over Labor Day weekend despite their ongoing immigration proceedings and fear of returning to Guatemala. Despite the Trump Administration’s claims to the contrary, a whistleblower disclosure yesterday alleged that at least 30 unaccompanied Guatemalan children the Administration attempted to deport without due process were flagged in the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s (ORR) database as having indicators of trafficking or child abuse if they were to be removed to Guatemala. Ahead of the Subcommittee hearing, Padilla and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) requested an oversight hearing on ORR’s mass child deportation efforts and apparent lies under oath.

He also highlighted reporting from the Washington Post uncovering that the Trump Administration’s mass deportation agenda has reignited forced family separations, including a recent incident in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ripped a 35-year-old Honduran mother from her twin 14-year-old daughters despite her maintaining a work permit, a pathway to a visa, and a pending asylum claim.

Key quotes from Senator Padilla’s opening remarks are below:

“Too often, their stories of unaccompanied children go unheard until a horrific story about their mistreatment shocks the conscience of our country. And it’s not just a matter of past tense. It is not just a matter of what happened during the Biden Administration or in prior years. One of these stories broke out just a few weeks ago.”

“On Sunday, August 31st — at about 1 or 2 in the morning — 76 children in Texas shelters were jolted awake. In the middle of the night, with no warning, they were instructed to pack their bags, and immigration officials led them to an airport to be deported. Without a hearing, without due process, and without proper vetting to see if they would be safe back in Guatemala, these kids, as you can imagine, were terrified.”

“Now it’s on us to do the right thing and bring ORR officials before this committee to demand the truth. Now, Mr. Chairman, we are the committee of jurisdiction with an obligation to conduct oversight over ORR. So I don’t just ask you, I urge you: let’s work together to schedule an oversight hearing with ORR to get to the truth.”

“Every single one of us here has a responsibility to stand up for the children in our immigration system, whether it’s because of trafficking, physical or sexual abuse, child labor, or violations of their due process. And this is a responsibility that I don’t take lightly, none of us should take lightly.”

“The reality is, the Trump Administration officials should be the ones in the seats in front of us to field our questions and to answer our questions about their, in many ways, cruel and unlawful policies, especially after this whistleblower disclosure.”

“If we truly want to improve our immigration system and protect unaccompanied children, we’d be exercising our oversight authority to ask about the real harm currently happening to children because of the indiscriminate mass deportation policies that this Administration is carrying out. There has to be real oversight of this Administration and their dangerous treatment of minors.”

“So don’t lecture me about kids, and then at the same time grab defenseless children in the middle of the night to haul them off to a country when we know they will be in danger. Don’t lecture me about kids, but then refuse to call out this Administration when they deprive them of representation. And don’t lecture me about kids and then refuse to speak out when we hear parents are being forced to decide whether to be deported with their children or let them be sent to ORR shelters, as we learned just this morning.”

“Not a single child benefits from political theater. So today, it’s my hope that this hearing doesn’t devolve into just a competition of who can praise Trump the most or who can bash Biden the best. Because regardless of which party is in the White House, or which party is in the majority in Congress, keeping children safe should be a bipartisan concern.”

“Everybody in this hearing room and everybody watching at home: Democrats demanded accountability from the Biden Administration on what happened to children under their watch. And I invite our Republican colleagues to join us in demanding the same accountability from the Trump Administration about what’s happening to children under theirs.”

Video of Senator Padilla’s opening statement is available here and be downloaded here.

On Monday, Padilla, Durbin, and Representatives Jamie Raskin (D-Md.-08) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.-07) demanded answers from senior Administration officials on this cruel effort, including information on their compliance with due process and confidentiality obligations under asylum law, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, and other statutory protections afforded to unaccompanied children by law.

Earlier this year, Senator Padilla led seven Senators in sounding the alarm on troubling reports that ORR unlawfully granted expanded access to sensitive data on unaccompanied children and their sponsors to ICE. The Senators raised serious concerns that ICE could misuse this confidential information to enact mass deportations and detain immigrant families and demanded DHS Secretary Noem and HHS Secretary Kennedy immediately cease this misguided practice. In March, Padilla blasted the Trump Administration’s stop work order to organizations that provide legal services for unaccompanied children and demanded they protect Congressionally mandated legal representation for these children in the immigration system.

Under the Biden Administration, Padilla co-chaired a hearing in which he condemned the labor exploitation of migrant children in the United States and called on the federal government to enforce the law and hold employers accountable for unlawfully exploiting migrant children.

The federal district court’s separate orders, prohibiting the government from deporting or detaining Mr. Khalil as his federal court case proceeds, remain in effect.
The letter to federal court explains that the immigration judge’s decision is further evidence of retaliation and that Mr. Khalil will be pressing ahead in federal court to prove these charges are pretextual and unlawful.
Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” said Mahmoud Khalil.
After this ruling, the government shifted its justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention to false, retaliatory charges about purported misrepresentations on his green card application.","NEWARK, N.J. – Following the Trump administration’s latest effort to weaponize the immigration system to silence Mahmoud Khalil for his advocacy in support of Palestinian human rights, Mr. Khalil’s legal team today submitted a letter to the federal court in New Jersey overseeing his civil rights case. The letter to Judge Michael Farbiarz explains that Mr. Khalil will challenge a Sept. 12 decision made by the immigration judge in Louisiana that denied Mr. Khalil a waiver of removability, bringing him one step closer to a final order of removal, because of baseless, pretextual “misrepresentation” charges the government added after his detention.

As the letter notes, the immigration judge rushed to a decision without providing a hearing on the evidence as due process requires, engaging in multiple procedural irregularities, and choosing to believe the false charges made after the fact by the government. The letter also states how rare it is for an immigration judge to deny a waiver against a lawful permanent resident with a U.S. spouse and child, and no criminal record.

The federal district court’s separate orders, prohibiting the government from deporting or detaining Mr. Khalil as his federal court case proceeds, remain in effect. The letter to federal court explains that the immigration judge’s decision is further evidence of retaliation and that Mr. Khalil will be pressing ahead in federal court to prove these charges are pretextual and unlawful.

“It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech. Their latest attempt, through a kangaroo immigration court, exposes their true colors once again,” said Mahmoud Khalil. “When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide. Such fascist tactics will never deter me from continuing to advocate for my people’s liberation.”

In June, the federal court ruled that the government’s original justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention based only on Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s say-so was likely unconstitutional and blocked his detention and deportation on that basis. After this ruling, the government shifted its justification for Mr. Khalil’s detention to false, retaliatory charges about purported misrepresentations on his green card application. As Mr. Khalil’s legal team thoroughly outlined in court filings, these after-the-fact charges are meritless and retaliatory.

“The Trump administration will stop at nothing to try to silence Mr. Khalil, including by denying him, his family, and his supporters the right to testify in immigration court, in complete contravention of the U.S. Constitution,” said Johnny Sinodis, partner at Van Der Hout LLP. “We have witnessed a constant lack of humanity and allegiance to the law throughout proceedings in this farcical Louisiana immigration court, and the immigration judge’s September 12 decision is just the most recent example of what occurs when the system requires an arbiter that is anything but neutral to do the administration’s bidding. As with other illegal efforts by the government, this too will be challenged and overcome.”

“When the immigration prosecutor, judge, and jailor all answer to Donald Trump, and that one man is eager to weaponize the system in a desperate bid to silence Mahmoud Khalil, a U.S. permanent resident whose only supposed sin is that he stands against an ongoing genocide in Palestine, this is the result,” said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR. “A plain-as-day First Amendment violation that also puts on sharp display the rapidly freefalling credibility of the entire U.S. immigration system.”

Mr. Khalil is represented by Dratel & Lewis, the Center for Constitutional Rights, CLEAR, Van Der Hout LLP, Washington Square Legal Services, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the ACLU of New Jersey, and the ACLU of Louisiana.

Marchers held photos of Silverio Villegas-Gonzáles — the 38-year-old man fatally shot by an immigration agent in nearby Franklin Park Friday — during an afternoon procession through Melrose Park Tuesday.

“[ICE] assassinated a hard-working man, a father that only wanted to drop off his kids, go to work and then come back … but he never came back home,” said Nancy Salgado, director of organizing for the Melrose Park-based immigrant rights nonprofit PASO West Suburban Action Project. “Today, we stand in solidarity with his family.”

Organizers of Tuesday’s march, attended by about 50 people and originally designed to protest the growing presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the Chicago area, dedicated the event to Villegas-Gonzáles’ family upon learning of Friday’s shooting Salgado said. The event unfolded as elected officials such as Gov. JB Pritzker continue to call for an investigation into the shooting and for ICE to provide more information about what led to the fatal shots being fired.

State Rep. Norma Hernandez, D-Melrose Park, who also attended the march, confirmed that Villegas-Gonzáles was the father of two young sons, a 7-year-old and a 3-year-old.

Villegas-Gonzáles was his family’s sole provider and worked long hours as a cook, she said. The Friday morning shooting in a suburb just south of O’Hare Airport occurred soon after Villegas-Gonzáles dropped his children off at school, Hernandez said.

Franklin Park School District 84 Superintendent David Katzin confirmed Villegas-Gonzáles’ 7-year-old son attended nearby Passow Elementary School.

A GoFundMe has been set up to raise money for Villegas-Gonzáles’ family, and more than $45,000 had been raised as of early Tuesday evening.

“Silverio passed away after ICE agents shot him fatally, leaving behind not only loving family and friends, but also a legacy of warmth, resilience and deep compassion. He was someone who always extended a helping hand, shared his smile freely, and showed up for those he loved — no matter the circumstances,” wrote Lily Rivera, the fundraising campaign’s organizer.

The Elgin-based group Vecinos Unidos is also holding a community drive this weekend to collect food and toiletry donations for Villegas-Gonzáles’ family. Learn more about the donation drive here.

A memorial featuring photos, cards, candles and flowers now marks the Franklin Park intersection where Villegas-Gonzáles was killed.

The Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago confirmed that Villegas-González was a Mexican national. Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, told the Sun Times that Villegas-González’s family has requested that his remains be sent back to Mexico.

ICE Has Released ‘Very Little’ Information On What Happened

According to a statement released by ICE, agents stopped Villegas-González in Franklin Park Friday while he was driving and he “refused to follow law enforcement commands” before driving his car at officers.

ICE wrote that one officer was hit and dragged and “fearing for his own life, the officer fired his weapon.”

Surveillance video from a nearby business, according to CBS2, shows two officers stop and approach a Subaru driven by Villegas-González. One officer walks to the passenger side and the other to the driver’s side. The officer on the passenger side appears to try to open the door before Villegas-González starts backing up and drives away. The officer at the driver’s side window — whom ICE said was dragged — cannot be seen in the footage as Villegas-González drives away. Two gunshots can be heard in footage from another business. Footage of the officer being dragged and later shooting Villegas-González has not been produced. ICE agents involved in the fatal shooting were not wearing body cameras during the incident, the Sun-Times reported Tuesday.

Hernandez said that as soon as she heard about the shooting on Friday, she reached out to local rapid response networks to try to gather more information.

“We had people on the ground going to businesses to try and get footage because we know that we cannot trust the federal government,” she said.

Pritzker said his office asked ICE for all the information around Villegas-González’ shooting but said the agency has “given very little” detail, according to the Sun Times

“This is the most unusual situation I’ve seen in my entire lifetime, where we have no transparency and the federal government is not policing itself. Even the offices of inspector generals are being dismantled under this administration. So we may never really know what the truth is,” the governor said.

The Franklin Park Police Department referred all questions about the shooting to the FBI. In a statement, the FBI confirmed the agency responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on-scene. The FBI would not confirm whether the agency was investigating the incident further. ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions.

“The Department of Justice’s media policy prohibits the FBI from confirming or denying investigations, but as a general matter, we examine the facts with consideration of federal criminal statutes. We then proceed as appropriate, whether by investigating or referring the matter to the relevant partners,” an FBI spokesperson wrote.

ICE has increased its presence in the Chicago area in recent days, announcing Operation Midway Blitz last week. On Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection officials — a sister agency — traveled to Chicago for a separate campaign dubbed Operating At Large.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to CBS2. Noem posted a video on X of immigration arrests that appeared to show an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid Tuesday in Elgin, CBS reported.

Claudia Galvàn, who is originally from Mexico but has been living in Melrose Park for more than 30 years, said she usually celebrates Mexican Independence Day but “can’t this year because of all the things happening.”

She and her son joined the march as they were headed to the store Tuesday. She said hearing about Villegas-González’ death last week was particularly unsettling because she often goes to Franklin Park.

“It’s scary,” she said. “It could happen to anyone.”

Grace Clear, 75, traveled from Elmhurst to join the march. She’s part of a group of residents called Progressives for Change that has been protesting President Donald Trump’s administration by rallying outside the Elmhurst City Hall every Saturday since February.

“It’s just so senseless,” Clear said of Villegas-González’ death. “ICE feels they have the right to murder someone over a traffic stop.”

Salgado said PASO, the Melrose Park immigrants’ rights group, will be organizing more marches in the coming weeks, including one in Franklin Park. March updates will be posted on Facebook.

Tuesday’s march was about showing power and unity in the face of intimidation, Hernandez said.

“This is our way to fight back, to be joyful, to celebrate our culture and to highlight the wrongful death of Silverio,” she said. “Because we can’t let this one go, we have to make sure this doesn’t happen again, that there isn’t another murder by this agency.”

Hernandez said she will be meeting with Villegas-González’ family later this week to offer support and discuss next steps, including potential legal action.",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5117-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:57:37.013640

The Trump administration has faced some legal roadblocks in its funding freeze attempts.","WASHINGTON — Labor unions, faculty and students in the University of California education system sued President Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesday over the freezing of federal funds and other actions that they say aim to stifle academic freedom.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeks to forbid the government from using financial threats against the system that it said were harmful and unlawful. It also aims to restore funding already suspended.

“(The administration) has attempted to implement a playbook to threaten colleges and universities,” the coalition that filed the lawsuit said. It added that those threats were based on disdain for the institutions’ curriculum, expressive activity on campuses, and initiatives for diversity, equity and inclusion.

The University of California system and the White House had no immediate comment on the lawsuit.

The government has launched probes into universities’ handling of alleged antisemitism during student protests against Israel’s assault on Gaza, and has frozen funds over that and other issues, including climate initiatives and DEI programs.

Civil rights advocates say the Trump administration is attempting to make universities more aligned with his political agenda, while critics also see such attempts as threatening free speech and academic freedom.

University of California Operates One of the Largest Higher-Education Systems

The University of California operates one of the largest higher-education systems in the country, with 10 main campuses and nearly 300,000 students, as well as 265,000 faculty and staff.

The Trump administration had proposed to settle its probe into the University of California, Los Angeles – part of the university system – through a $1 billion payment from the institution. Democratic California Governor Gavin Newsom called that an extortion attempt.

UCLA said in August the government froze $584 million in funding before a judge ordered the Trump administration to restore some of that money. The University of California, Berkeley, another campus in the system, said on Friday it provided information on 160 faculty members and students to the government as part of an investigation.

University of California President James Milliken said on Monday the institution was facing one of the gravest threats in its history due to the federal government’s actions, noting that it receives more than $17 billion each year in federal support.

The Trump administration has faced some legal roadblocks in its funding freeze attempts. A federal judge ruled earlier this month that it had unlawfully terminated more than $2 billion in grants for Harvard University.

The government alleges universities allowed antisemitism during campus protests. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, have said the government is wrongly equating their criticism of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories with antisemitism, and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.

Human rights advocates have noted a rise in antisemitism, anti-Arab bias and Islamophobia due to conflict in the Middle East, although the Trump administration has not announced probes into Islamophobia.

The administration has settled its investigations with Columbia and Brown universities.

This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.
There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.
The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies.
Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it.","In 1952, seven years after the end of the Second World War, Congress established Constitution Day to celebrate our country’s sacred foundational document. In the more than 70 years since, most Americans have taken for granted the fundamental freedoms this day honors. There are no parades, no barbecues, and no mattress sales for Constitution Day. In many ways, this low profile is a sign of strength.

But this year, that complacency feels perilous. Fundamental pillars of our democracy are under assault, and the situation is more dire than many realize. That’s why we can no longer assume the Constitution will simply survive through benign neglect.We must fight to protect and strengthen it.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought.

Established 238 years ago, our constitutional system has been so stable and reliable that many don’t have to give it a second thought. As our country has evolved and expanded rights and advanced democratic reforms, this framework – through its many iterations and amendments – has remained true to its core throughout. Through civil war and depression, world wars and social upheavals, through the peaceful transfer of power across generations and parties, Americans have been able to count on the Constitution being there.

Today we are facing a new type of threat. There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy. This assault should alarm anyone who values constitutional governance and the personal freedoms we so often take for granted.

Alarmingly, we’re witnessing the intrusion of military force into civilian life. Earlier this summer the president deployed Marines and National Guard units to crack down on protests in Los Angeles and has thousands of Guard members patrolling the streets of Washington D.C. The administration has signaled that this is just the start, with plans to deploy more troops onto American streets in Chicago and possibly elsewhere.

There is now a coordinated assault on the constitutional architecture that has sustained American democracy.

This violates a founding principle of American governance, enshrined in the Posse Comitatus Act, that military forces should not police civilians. The Constitution establishes a clear civil-military divide because the founders understood that when the military becomes a tool of domestic control, constitutional democracy dies. Immigration detention centers under construction on military bases echo some of the darkest chapters in our history and represent a dangerous conflation of military and civilian authority.

As we saw in Los Angeles, the deployment of troops is a fear tactic meant to silence opposition and criminalize dissent. But the attacks on the First Amendment are not isolated to targeting peaceful protest. The Trump administration has ushered in a new McCarthy era, sending a clear message that if someone disagrees with our government, they will be punished.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened.

Just look at this administration’s actions. Federal agents have repeatedly detained or arrested public officials conducting legitimate oversight, including Newark, New Jersey Mayor Ras Baraka,Congresswoman LaMonica McIver, andSenator Alex Padilla, who was tackled and detained for asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem questions. Students, including green card holders, have been detained and threatened with deportation for writing op-eds or expressing views that deviate from what the administration deems acceptable.

The administration is not content with silencing critics — it rejects the very concept of legitimate political opposition. Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller recently declared ""The Democrat party is not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization."" Coming from an administration that’s literally prosecuting a democratic congresswoman on invented felony charges stemming from her oversight of an ICE facility, this explicit rejection of political pluralism is chilling.

Perhaps most dangerously, the Trump administration is ignoring the rule of law and corrupting justice itself. The president has targeted law firms whose attorneys investigated him, stripping their security clearances, barring attorneys from federal buildings, and terminating government contracts unless firms agree to coercive demands for ""pro bono"" services. He excoriates judges who issue unfavorable rulings, calling them ""radical left lunatics"" and ""deranged,"" while encouraging calls for impeachment or worse. Ominously, the Justice Department is now seeking financial sanctions against immigration attorney Joshua Schroeder for filing emergency motions to halt his client's deportation — the first case under a new Trump directive to personally target lawyers who challenge administration policies.

Military forces now police civilians. Members of Congress are arrested for doing their jobs. The president's top adviser declares the opposition party illegitimate. Judges and lawyers face threats for upholding the law. This is the systematic dismantling of constitutional governance.

The Constitution has survived 238 years because we, the people, have fought for it when it was threatened. Today, the danger is not from foreign invasion or civil war, but instead the methodical dismantling of constitutional governance by a president sworn to uphold it. At a moment when we are seeing political violence escalating — claiming lives and threatening the very free discourse our Constitution protects — we must choose peaceful democratic engagement over dehumanization and violence. The power ultimately lies with the people, and as a country we must decide whether we will defend our Constitution or let it fall.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/defend-the-constitution-s.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:57:34.213067

The family says their son, who attends Milford High School, was later released by ICE and very shaken up over the incident.

“What’s particularly jarring about these cases is that these clients screamed for help,” said Decker, who filed the complaints with DHS and ICE.
Decker said that while Reyes is central to the complaints, she believes the problems at detention facilities like the one in Basile go much deeper.
The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is, like many ICE facilities, run by an outside contractor — the GEO Group, a multinational private prison corporation and ICE’s largest detention contractor.
“I filed complaints and grievances.","Current and former detainees at the South Louisiana ICE Detention Center in Basile, Louisiana have filed multiple complaints through immigration rights groups on Monday (Sept. 15) against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, alleging repeated sexual harassment, sexual abuse, physical abuse, coerced labor and neglect of urgent medical and mental health care at the facility.

Three organizations, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the ACLU of Louisiana and the National Immigration Project filed the complaints on behalf of four people — two who have been deported and two individuals who remain in custody at the facility, but who are in imminent risk of deportation, according to Sarah Decker, a staff attorney with RFK Human Rights. One of the deported individuals has since reentered the country and is now in criminal custody, Decker said.

The complaints allege that a former assistant warden, Manuel Reyes, at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center repeatedly sexually abused, threatened and punished one of the complainants, who is referred to as “Jane Doe” by her attorneys. The complaints further allege that Reyes ran an off-the-books late-night work scheme that coerced transgender detainees into physically and psychologically painful labor. Reyes could not be reached for comment.

“What’s particularly jarring about these cases is that these clients screamed for help,” said Decker, who filed the complaints with DHS and ICE. “They filed grievances. They filed [Prison Rape Elimination Act] complaints. They called the [Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General] hotline. They spoke to ICE officers face-to-face and told them what was happening. So this was an open secret in the facility, and ICE definitely knew about this.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs filed claims of personal injury against DHS and ICE, seeking financial compensation, on behalf of their clients. Separately they filed a civil rights complaint with offices at DHS. The Southeast Dignity Not Detention Coalition joined the other legal groups in filing the civil complaint.

Decker said that while Reyes is central to the complaints, she believes the problems at detention facilities like the one in Basile go much deeper.

“There’s much more going on than even we as advocates who represent people know about. There’s a deep underbelly of abuse that we haven’t fully uncovered yet,” she said.

The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is, like many ICE facilities, run by an outside contractor — the GEO Group, a multinational private prison corporation and ICE’s largest detention contractor. The GEO Group has repeatedly faced allegations of negligence and abuse at the immigration facilities it oversees. The company did not respond to requests for comment on the newest complaints.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, responded on behalf of DHS and ICE, calling the accusations false, characterizing them as a “hoax.” McLaughlin said the assistant warden did not perpetrate or enable sexual harassment or assault and that no one was forced into coerced labor or physically abused.

“The media is clearly desperate for these allegations of inhumane conditions at this facility to be true,” McLaughlin wrote. “All of these allegations are investigated by (the) ICE Office of Professional Responsibility, and none were found to be true.”

Decker disagreed with McLaughlin’s categorization of the incidents in the complaints.

“The documentation that we’ve done for years at these facilities and the stories of these clients prove otherwise, and it’s not surprising that DHS is once again failing to take accountability for the mistreatment and abuse of those entrusted to their care,” she said.

McLaughlin also said that ICE detainees receive proper meals and medical treatment.

“This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she said.

Decker pointed to the results of a 2024 ACLU study, in which medical experts reviewed records for 52 of 53 reported deaths in ICE custody from 2017 to 2021. They found that of those 52 people, roughly 95% were “preventable or possibly preventable,” had appropriate medical care been provided.

“The assertion that people in ICE custody are receiving high quality medical care is simply false,” Decker said. “What we’ve found is the exact opposite, that the medical care at these facilities is so poor and so abusive that people are dying in government custody and are suffering from life threatening and potentially permanent medical consequences as a result of this mistreatment.”

The woman identified as Jane Doe is from the Dominican Republic and lived in Maryland for 10 years, according to the complaint. She landed in the Basile ICE center by way of the women’s Federal Correctional Institution in Aliceville, Alabama, according to her lawyer.

The woman’s complaint says that she suffers from epilepsy, and it alleges that she was first sexually harassed and then finally repeatedly sexually abused at the detention center. It also states that she was denied medical attention and put in solitary confinement and threatened. Decker said those threats are central to why the woman identified as Jane Doe wants to remain anonymous. As her abuse in the facility continued, Doe’s physical health deteriorated, the complaint states.

“I begged the U.S. government to help me,” the woman identified as Jane Doe said in a press statement. “I filed complaints and grievances. I told ICE officers and medical staff. But they did nothing. I want people to know what happened to me and what continues to happen to people detained in these facilities.”

Three transgender detainees were also subject to physical and psychological abuse, according to their individual complaints.

One complainant, Mexican national Monica Renteria-Gonzalez, who was still in ICE custody as of this week, is a transgender man. The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is used primarily to hold women, but ICE assigns people to detention centers based upon their sex assigned at birth instead of their gender identity. Renteria-Gonzalez has been detained since roughly May 2023 at the facility, according to his complaint. Renteria-Gonzalez began working during the late-night hours alongside other transgender people for as little as $1 per day, the complaint states.

Renteria-Gonzalez’ complaint details difficult manual labor, allegedly without protective equipment, resulting in physical injury.

“Our rights are being violated everyday. This is a privately run facility that profits from our suffering. They are using us to make a profit but denying us medical care, food, even the most basic things like proper clothes and mattresses,” Renteria-Gonzalez said in a press release.

Two other transgender people detained at the facility — Mario Luisa Garcia-Valenzuela, a transgender man who is still in custody, and Kenia Campos-Flores, a nonbinary/transgender person who is no longer at the facility — had similar allegations in their complaints.

The complaints also allege that solitary confinement was used against the detainees as a means of punishment for complaints they issued about the behavior of the people running the facility.

The civil rights complaint filed with DHS is calling for the release of the detainees mentioned in the complaint, a full investigation of the allegations and financial penalties for GEO Group, should wrongdoing and mismanagement be found, as well as the termination of the contract with GEO to run the facility.

“These facilities are incapable of housing people humanely, and there’s no solution outside of shutting down these facilities and ending the use of immigration detention,” Decker said.

Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled Monica Renteria-Gonzalez’ name. That’s been corrected.

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn't be right to ""hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts."" ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE's presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0"" on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,"" she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some willing to risk being detained because they are the primary breadwinners for their families.

""Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE's latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

""We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,"" she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is ""trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.

“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained.
“But they have a president now who in addition to being erratic has not been a very good partner when it comes to taking on drug cartels.” ____","BOGOTA, Colombia -- BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian president Gustavo Petro on Tuesday lashed out at the U.S. government after it added Colombia to a list of nations failing to cooperate in the drug war for the first time in three decades.

In a message on his X account, the leftist leader accused the United States of seeking to “participate” in Colombian politics and looking for a “puppet president” as the country prepares for presidential elections next year.

“The Colombian people will reply if they want a puppet president…or a free and sovereign nation” Petro wrote, adding in another message that he would not let his nation “kneel” to U.S. interests and allow peasants who grow coca to get “beaten up.”

On Monday, the Trump administration designated Colombia as a country that is failing to meet its international commitments to fight drug trafficking and blamed the Colombian government for a lack of progress in the fight against the cocaine trade.

The designation, known as decertification, is a stunning rebuke for a traditional U.S. ally. It comes amid a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and Colombia’s first leftist president.

Even as the U.S determined that Colombia has failed to comply with international anti-narcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts.

On Tuesday, the charge d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Bogota, John McNamara, said that consular services, humanitarian projects and defense cooperation would not be affected by Colombia’s decertification.

“We are going to do everything we can to fight with the Colombian people against the global threat” of drugs, McNamara told Colombian radio station Blu.

Colombia’s decertification comes as cocaine production skyrockets in the South American country.

The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.

The Colombian president has also said that whisky kills more people than cocaine, and claimed that the reason wealthy countries like the United States want to crack down on cocaine is because its produced in Latin America.

Sandra Borda, an international relations professor at Bogota's Los Andes University said that Colombia's decertification is unlikely to affect efforts to take on drug traffickers in Colombia, because military cooperation is expected to continue.

However she expects tensions between the governments of the U.S. and Colombia to increase, as Petro uses Colombia's decertification to tap into anti-American sentiment and rally his supporters ahead of next year's elections.

“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained. “You have statements and declarations that are not friendly and I think what you are going to see is an escalation of that.”

In the Presidential Determination submitted to Congress on Monday, the Trump administration mostly blamed Petro for the rise of cocaine production in Colombia, describing his efforts to negotiate peace deals with ""narco terrorist groups” as a failure.

The report said that Colombia’s security institutions and municipal authorities have shown “skill and courage” in confronting drug traffickers, but said that “the failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also commented on Colombia's decertification on Tuesday.

""Colombia has been a great partner historically,"" Rubio told reporters. “But they have a president now who in addition to being erratic has not been a very good partner when it comes to taking on drug cartels.”

SOUTH KOREA WANTS CHANGES TO US VISA SYSTEM South Korea is pressing Washington to ease visa rules after the immigration raid.","The South Korean government has launched an investigation into potential human-rights violations after more than 300 of its citizens were detained in a US immigration raid earlier this month at a Hyundai Motor construction site in Georgia.

The raid took place at an electric-vehicle battery plant under construction near Savannah, Georgia. The facility is a joint project between Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution, both major South Korean firms.

A spokesperson for South Korea’s presidential office said that Seoul has conveyed its ""strong regret"" to Washington, stressing that the rights and interests of South Koreans must not be infringed during the US immigration raid.

The raid, carried out on September 4 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), has provoked outrage in South Korea. Officials in Seoul say they received no prior notice of the operation, despite South Korea’s commitments to the US in trade and investment. The country has pledged close to half a trillion dollars in US energy purchases and manufacturing investments, particularly in the electric-vehicle sector.

REPORTS OF MISTREATMENT

The repatriation of 316 South Koreans on Friday heightened the controversy. A number of them claimed to have been mistreated while in the US custody. During the raid, detainees claimed they were shackled, made to sleep on mouldy beds, kept in temporary detention cells with as many as 70 people, and refused access to interpreters.

According to South Korean media, workers alleged that they had not been informed of his Miranda rights. These testimonies have sparked anger that US authorities mishandled the raid and violated basic legal protections.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry and Justice Ministry, working with employers of the former detainees, are now investigating whether human-rights violations occurred in the detention centre and whether South Koreans were unfairly targeted because of their jobs at the site.

""If the probe confirms that violations occurred, the government will submit a formal complaint to the United States,"" a South Korean official said as per the Wall Street Journal. The official added that the enquiry is expected to conclude within weeks.

US OFFICIALS RESPOND

During a visit to Seoul on Sunday, Christopher Landau, the US Deputy Secretary of State, expressed regret over the detention of South Korean nationals.

According to a local poll, nearly 60 percent of South Koreans believe the raid was excessive and voiced disappointment with Washington’s handling of the incident.

ICE confirmed that around 475 workers were detained in what has become the largest single-site immigration raid ever carried out in the US. According to the search warrant, the operation initially targeted four Hispanic workers suspected of entering the country illegally or violating visa terms.

SOUTH KOREA WANTS CHANGES TO US VISA SYSTEM

South Korea is pressing Washington to ease visa rules after the immigration raid. Businesses say restrictive US visas make it difficult to send skilled staff, forcing some workers to operate in legal grey areas.

Foreign Minister’s talks in Washington this week included plans for a joint working group to explore a new visa category for Korean nationals.

Presidential Chief of Staff Kang Hoon-sik said the raid had harmed ""innocent people of Korea,”"" stressing that Seoul expects fair treatment. ""The standard changes every time, and there constantly has to be deal-making,"" he told reporters.

The dispute comes as both countries negotiate a trade pact tied to a $350 billion investment fund for US strategic industries.

The details are part of a lawsuit where the government is attempting to end protections for children. Declarations from families held at the facility in Dilley, Texas, which was reopened in March, described persistently cloudy water, delayed medical attention and long periods of time children are being detained.

Allegations of children fighting adults for clean water, distraught children and a protracted medical response first surfaced during the summer while the federal government asked a federal judge to end a policy protecting immigrant children.

U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, who presides over the case, heard arguments from the government, which wants to end the Flores Settlement agreement. The policy limits how long Customs and Border Protection can hold immigrant children and requires safe and sanitary conditions.

After Gee told the government last month to provide detention times, Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that the number of children in custody over 72 hours decreased from an average of six days to five days in June and July, respectively. The “vast majority” spent less than 72 hours in CBP custody, the report stated.

Attorneys representing the children reviewed the report and said some children are still being held for several weeks or months and often without justification.

About 65 families spoke to attorneys since Dilley opened.

U.S. & World

“A huge percentage of families at Dilley are being apprehended from across the country as they dutifully appear for their immigration court hearings and ICE check-ins,” Leecia Welch, the deputy legal director at Children’s Rights who spoke with families, told The Associated Press in a statement.

The tap water is cloudy, smells strange and upsets stomachs, the families told their attorneys. The hand soap the facility provides for showers has been causing rashes, the families said. Children also struggle eating the food, like the snacks of graham crackers, apples, juice and milk.

Detainees are allowed to buy staples like bottled water for $1.21 from the commissary.

""I have never heard until now of children having to buy water,” said Welch, who has been visiting children in custody of CBP and the Office of Refugee Resettlement for eight years.

Families face costs as high as $5.73 for deodorant, $1.44 for soap, and $2.39 for toothpaste, Welch said in court documents. A single dose of Tylenol costs $1.30, she said.

A child with a stomachache waited six hours for a nurse and wasn't taken to a hospital with appendicitis until he vomited, court documents said. Another child fell on his arm and it wasn't until two hours later that the staff drove him to a hospital for an X-ray.

Parents said there are no organized activities for the children and only an hour of instruction from workbooks.

A woman's son told her that he ""doesn’t believe in God anymore because he prays to him but we still haven’t been able to get out of here,” according to her declaration, provided by Welch.

Some families are being released only to be detained again, Welch said.

“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail.

Chellie Pingree is seeking answers after a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school last week.

“It is difficult to imagine any circumstance that could justify staging enforcement activity when children are arriving to learn,” Pingree wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons Tuesday. “Beyond the harm it causes the community at-large, these actions have caused irreparable damage to the family, who is already dealing with difficult circumstances.”

According to a letter sent to parents from Portland Superintendent Ryan Scallon, on the morning of Sept. 11, unidentified agents in unmarked vehicles wearing vests marked “police” detained a parent on a Gerald E. Talbot Community School access road after dropping off their child.

“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.

She went on to cite research that found such actions trigger “measurable harm: lower attendance, diminished academic performance, increased anxiety and depression, and lasting trauma for students and families – including those not directly targeted,” adding that district officials have already reported a drop in attendance since the incident.

Pingree also raised concerns about the fact that the arresting officers were unidentifiable and said the action caused confusion among local law enforcement who were not informed of the activity.

According to the district, an administrator “approached the officers to inquire about their presence” and the officers “did not state what agency they represented.” The district later confirmed with the Portland Police Department that they were not local officers. The police department also assured the district “that if they learn of any proposed enforcement action planned at a school, they will work to ensure that it does not occur there,” Scallon wrote.

Portland police later told the Portland Press Herald that the parent, a Honduran immigrant, had earlier been arrested by local officers on an accusation of a Class D domestic violence assault and was released on bail one day before he was detained by ICE outside the school. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail.

“ICE had to make this arrest at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.

Pingree’s letter concluded with a demand for “a full accounting of this operation, including which agencies were involved, what coordination occurred between those agencies, and the justification for selecting the school as a location for enforcement activity.”

She also asked for “a written explanation of any review or retraining that occurs from this incident; a description of the guidance used to determine whether enforcement activity at schools is absolutely necessary; and a list of protocols adapted to minimize harm done to the community while practicing said enforcement activity.”

I was 16 when Governor Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1070 in 2010. I remember the fear in our communities. I remember the silence in neighborhoods, the way people stopped gathering at the park, the way families disappeared overnight. I remember the protests, the heartbreak, and the resilience. Arizona became a national symbol of racial profiling and anti-immigrant policy.

Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration (Published 2010)

Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill aimed at identifying, prosecuting and deporting illegal immigrants.

www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html

Now, 15 years later, the Supreme Court has reopened that wound.

Last week, the Court lifted restrictions on federal immigration agents, allowing them to resume “roving patrols” — sweeping operations that permit stops based on appearance, language, or location. The ruling, which temporarily overturns a lower court’s decision, echoes the darkest chapters of Arizona’s immigration history. It’s déjà vu for those of us who lived through SB 1070.

Supreme Court said ICE can stop you based on race, accent, job and location. What we know.

A group of Latino California residents and related organizations sued the government, saying they were being subject to illegal stops.

www.usatoday.com

The decision permits agents to detain individuals outside places like Home Depot, car washes, and bus stops — simply for speaking Spanish or appearing to seek day labor. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in her powerful dissent, warned that this ruling “poses a threat not just to undocumented foreigners but to Americans of Hispanic descent.” She’s right. That threat is not theoretical. It’s personal. It’s the fear of being stopped while buying groceries. It’s the anxiety of walking your child to school. It’s the trauma of being treated like a suspect in your own home.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes has rightly stated that the 9th Circuit’s ruling, which blocked these tactics, remains binding in our state. But legal nuance doesn’t always translate to lived experience. When federal agents are empowered to act on stereotypes, immigrants and people of color suffer — regardless of citizenship status. We’ve lived it.

SB 1070 left scars on everyone. It led to widespread fear, family separations, and a chilling effect on civic participation. It took years of organizing, litigation, and advocacy to push back against these efforts. And now, we must do it again.

This ruling is a test — not just of our legal system, but also of our moral compass. Will Arizona repeat its mistakes, or will we lead with compassion and courage?

If this ruling unsettles you, don’t stay silent. Call your representatives. Demand that Arizona uphold protections against racial profiling. Support local immigrant rights organizations. Show up at city council meetings. Share your story. Speak out when you see injustice.

Arizona is more than its past. We are a place of resilience, of diversity, of people who refuse to be silenced. We know this story too well. And this time, we won’t just fight back. We’ll lead forward.

Migrants soon began complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks.
Judge Kaplan’s order on Aug. 12 directed ICE to hold fewer people in the cells, allow migrants to call their lawyers, and provide medical and hygienic care.","A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Wednesday to continue improving conditions for migrants being held in a Manhattan federal building, writing that he was intervening to protect detainees from potentially “unconstitutional and inhumane treatment.”

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, had already ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Aug. 12 to improve conditions at the building, 26 Federal Plaza, where migrants were being held in squalid and cramped conditions, according to a lawsuit filed by a migrant detained there.

On Wednesday, Judge Kaplan issued a longer-lasting order known as a preliminary injunction, requiring ICE to continue addressing the poor conditions, such as overcrowding and a lack of basic hygiene. While the injunction is not the final decision in the case, the judge said that the evidence was strong enough to merit a temporary order while the lawsuit moves toward a conclusion.

In his 84-page decision, Judge Kaplan provisionally certified the lawsuit, originally filed on Aug. 8 by a Peruvian immigrant, as a class action, expanding its scope to include any ICE detainee held at 26 Federal Plaza for 12 hours or longer.

He also said that the plaintiffs were “very likely to succeed on the merits of the claims” that the conditions in the holding cells violated the First and Fifth Amendments.

“We aspire to treat all Americans — and those among us — with humanity,” he wrote. “We are legally and morally bound to adhere to the Constitution and laws of the United States with respect to everyone within our borders.”

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency has previously cast the allegations in the lawsuit as false.

The 10th-floor holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza have emerged as a defining flashpoint of President Trump’s immigration crackdown in New York City. The cells, typically meant to hold a small number of people for just a few hours, became crowded this year as ICE accelerated arrests at nearby immigration courts, detaining dozens of people a day.

Migrants soon began complaining about being held in the cells for days, and even up to three weeks. They said they were forced to sleep on the floor or sitting upright, and were deprived of showers, sufficient medical care and legal representation. Video recorded by a migrant who sneaked a cellphone into the cells in July prompted Democratic lawmakers to escalate their demands to inspect the facilities, only to be denied access by ICE.

Judge Kaplan’s order on Aug. 12 directed ICE to hold fewer people in the cells, allow migrants to call their lawyers, and provide medical and hygienic care.

The agency has argued that the cells are used only for short-term confinement and that most detainees are transferred to other detention facilities within 72 hours, offering some data to that effect in legal filings.

But Judge Kaplan wrote on Wednesday that the arguments and statistics the agency had provided were “unpersuasive” and that they “obscure more than they illuminate.”

The judge concluded that the improvements made by ICE had resulted from his previous order in August, and that there were no assurances that those improvements would continue without the preliminary injunction he issued on Wednesday.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/22/multimedia/22met-migrant-video-bztg/22met-migrant-video-bztg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:18.927135

In the wake of media coverage of conditions at the field office, the Burlington Select Board and Building Department sought entry to the building.
""It got to the point where sometimes you couldn't even sit down.” Pineda spent two days at the Burlington field office, uncomfortable and hungry.","Hundreds of people detained at ICE's New England Regional Headquarters in Burlington were held there for multiple days over the spring and summer, despite the agency's admission that the facility is not designed to house detainees for extended periods.

Between Jan. 20, when President Trump returned to office, and the end of July, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement booked in more than 2,700 people, according to a WBUR analysis of information from the Deportation Data Project.

Of those, nearly half, or 1,338 people, were transferred out of Burlington within 12 hours. Another 353 were moved within a day. But 1,005 were held for multiple days, and in several cases, for more than a week.

Through July, at least 176 people were held in the Burlington field office for three days or more. In one case, a Brazilian man was held for 20 days.

These long stays appear to exceed even ICE's new detainment standards. According to a July 24 letter from ICE to U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the agency issued a temporary waiver in June so that ""aliens may be housed in a holding facility for up to, but not exceeding, 72 hours, absent exceptional circumstances.""

ICE did not respond to WBUR's questions about the longer Burlington detentions.

In a statement, Warren said, ""ICE’s responses are insufficient and don’t match the reality on the ground.""

""The reports coming out of ICE field offices continue to be deeply concerning,"" she said.

The ICE letter said the agency inspects conditions at its holding room facilities ""through a formal self-inspection program, and that it's committed to ""safe, secure, and humane environments"" for those in its custody.

But people detained in Burlington have told a very different story, from a Milford High School volleyball player held for six days in a crowd of men to women held for days without sanitary products.

""Immigrants are imprisoned here in overcrowded cells,"" said Rev. Andrew Harris, a minister at the nearby Burlington United Church of Christ, during a recent protest outside the ICE facility. Harris, who helps organize a weekly demonstration there, pointed to the squat, two-story building, recounting what former detainees have said publicly about the conditions inside.

""There are no beds, so people sleep on concrete floors,"" Harris told a crowd of about 500 people. ""There are no clocks, no showers, no soap, no medicine,"" he said; people held there also have complained about sharing a toilet with large numbers of people and no privacy.

ICE has refuted some of these claims and said detainees are given ""ample food, regular access to phones, showers and legal representation as well as medical care when needed.”

The field office is a 42,000-square-foot building in a busy office park near the Burlington Mall. The facility is primarily an administrative site, where people go for routine check-ins with immigration officials. It also serves as a regional intake center, where ICE takes people after arresting them.

Most people are transferred quickly to detention centers like the Plymouth County jail or facilities out of state. But as ICE launched ""Operation Patriot"" in the spring, a highly publicized increase in immigration enforcement and patrols in Massachusetts, hundreds of arrestees got stuck waiting in Burlington.

The number of people held at the Burlington office fluctuates day to day, but during the weeks around the May surge, agents booked about 40-50 people per day. In one day, they brought 101 people in; on another, 107.

And now with the launch of ""Patriot 2.0"" — a new immigration enforcement operation in Massachusetts — many more people are likely to spend time inside Burlington in the coming weeks.

""This latest enforcement 'surge' will inevitably cause overcrowding, denial of due process, and any number of other violations of the legal and human rights of detainees,"" said Matt Cameron, a Boston immigration attorney.

Very few outsiders have been allowed into the ICE field office in recent months, but in early June, U.S. Reps. Seth Moulton and Jake Auchincloss got a rare look inside.

""This is supposed to be a processing facility where people stay for six to 12 hours,"" Moulton told reporters at the time. ""It's obviously completely inappropriate — I would say, inhumane — for long-term detention.""

The two congressmen had gone to the facility to meet Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, the 18-year-old volleyball player from Milford who had just been released after six days in detention. Da Silva had not been the intended target of immigration agents; they’d been looking for his father. But they picked him up anyway, in what immigration enforcement officials refer to as a ""collateral"" arrest.

ICE had claimed Marcelo was ""an exceptional case,"" Auchincloss said, and that most people were booked in and out of the field office in a matter of hours.

Until now, that's been difficult to verify. Neither reporters nor members of the public have been permitted inside, and immigration lawyers haven't been allowed into the secure holding area in the back of the building. The agency also has denied Burlington town officials access to inspect the building.

In the wake of media coverage of conditions at the field office, the Burlington Select Board and Building Department sought entry to the building. When ICE refused, the town petitioned the decision in district court. But that request also was recently denied, leaving the town with no option to appeal, according to Select Board Chairman Mike Espejo.

""I’ve probably put more time and thought into this issue than any other during my seven years in town government,"" Espejo wrote on Facebook last week. ""This is all about ensuring that all of our buildings in town are used in the manner in which they are designed and permitted and ensuring that anyone that enters the Town of Burlington is treated ethically and fairly.""

An ICE spokesperson told WBUR in an email, ""We never intend for anyone’s stay at Burlington to be an extended one."" There are occasions when it happens, the statement continued, and ""these instances are a rarity.""

Yet that's not what the data shows.

While ICE wrote in its letter to Warren that a March 31 ""self-inspection"" found no detainees in custody at that time had been held for more than 12 hours, the Deportation Data Project reveals that at least 50 people were held for longer than that in the preceding ten days.

Most of the extended stays in Burlington coincided with the May arrest surge, but at least 38 more occurred in June and July, according to the data analyzed by WBUR.

The data also shows that while ICE has said it's pursuing the ""worst of the worst"" in its immigration arrests, about half of those detained in Burlington had no criminal history, just civil immigration violations. According to the data, 508 people booked into Burlington had some criminal conviction; another 937 had pending charges.

""ICE facilities like Burlington’s are being forced into roles they were never meant to play, because of the Trump Administration’s chaotic and inhumane decisions,"" Moulton said in an email after WBUR shared the results of the new data analysis.

""If the data being reported is accurate, it is unacceptable that people are being held there for days — or even weeks — without adequate medical care, access to showers, or beds,"" he said, noting that the latest ICE surge in the station “will only make these problems worse.""

The dataset includes a hold that lasted 34 days, and another that lasted 55 days. ICE did not respond to questions about whether these extreme outliers are accurate or the result of a data entry error.

José Pineda, an East Boston resident, was stopped by five ICE agents on May 27 while driving to work. Pineda was born in El Salvador but has temporary protected status, which gives him the right to live and work in the U.S. He's lived in the country for 30 years and has a 12-year-old daughter who was born here.

Pineda said he gave the agents his driver's license and explained his legal status, but they arrested him anyway.

""They said, 'Those who aren't born here don't have rights,' "" he recounted in Spanish.

Pineda was brought to Burlington, where he said he was placed in a crowded room with 40 to 50 other men.

""After a couple of hours, they moved me to another room that was a bit emptier,"" he said. But soon, many more men arrived. ""It got to the point where sometimes you couldn't even sit down.”

Pineda spent two days at the Burlington field office, uncomfortable and hungry. He slept on a concrete floor with only a mylar blanket, and was fed ""a sour and inedible pudding"" on the first day and a ""cup of oats and a small burrito"" on the second, according to a complaint his lawyers filed with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

Pineda said he'd never been detained or spent time in jail before. Other men held there at the time told him a jail cell was ""more comfortable than these little rooms packed with people.""

After two days, Pineda was released. He said he's still having nightmares about the experience, but his detainment has taken an especially hard toll on his daughter, Michelle Valentina Pineda, according to the complaint.

""I don't want any more separations of families,"" Michelle said at a community listening event hosted by Rep. Ayanna Pressley earlier this summer. ""Family belongs together and I don't want any kid to know what I've been through and what happened to me.""

Mirian Albert, a senior attorney with Lawyers for Civil Rights and one of Pineda's lawyers, said ICE's new surge is hitting immigrant communities like New Bedford and Chelsea hard.

""Families and communities are living in fear again,"" she said. ""Many of them are paralyzed in many of their daily activities.""

And as happened during the spring surge, she expects Burlington will soon be crowded with people stuck there for days at a time.

The new operation differs from Midway Blitz in that it will look more like the LA effort, with more indiscriminate raids, sources said.
While neither immigration enforcement operation in Illinois is relying on National Guard troops, President Trump on Tuesday renewed his threat to send troops to Chicago to fight crime.","The Trump administration has launched a second immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area, with a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection sweep that began on Tuesday.

The dual operations are similar, but each with their own mission and their own personnel, neither of which includes local police agencies or federal troops.

Both efforts involve federal agents arresting criminal and non-criminal immigrants in deportation sweeps.

The immigration sweeps are both statewide efforts, not merely focused on Chicago and the suburbs.

The first, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement initiative dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" began earlier this month.

The new initiative, dubbed ""Operation At Large"" was announced Tuesday on social media by Gregory Bovino, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer.

U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-IL) – whose 14th Congressional District includes several western and southwestern suburbs, including Aurora, Joliet, Naperville, and DeKalb – was briefed about ""Operation Midway Blitz"" on Monday by ICE leaders who shared precisely who they are looking for.

""Anyone who has been arrested and booked, charged, or convicted, and then released by local law enforcement and is not a lawfully present U.S. person is eligible for their enforcement operation,"" she said. ""So far they have told me that 250 people have been arrested.""

Anyone found in the U.S. illegally – even non-criminals – can be taken in.

Newly deputized agents on loan from other federal agencies are being used for Midway Blitz.

""Officials from the Department of Justice; to include U.S. Marshals, DEA agents – Drug Enforcement Agency agents – and ATF,"" Underwood said.

Midway Blitz will not include raids of Home Depots and car washes. When will it end?

""They would not give me a termination date, and said that the director of ICE would be notified by the Trump administration,"" Underwood said.

The second immigration sweep, ""Operation At Large,"" started on Tuesday, according to CBS News sources, and is being led by Bovino, who headed the border patrol's effort to target immigration in Los Angeles this summer.

The new operation differs from Midway Blitz in that it will look more like the LA effort, with more indiscriminate raids, sources said. Bovino's team has a history of targeting Home Depots and car washes.

Notably, neither effort is using the National Guard, as they have not been mobilized in Illinois.

Nonetheless, it leaves Underwood's constituents unsettled.

""They're scared that this is going to come to their block, their cul-de-sac, then a knock on their door,"" Underwood said.

Underwood says those being arrested are being taken to Wisconsin and Indiana for holding as their cases get sorted out.

ICE officials insisted to Underwood that they don't pursue people – meaning, if the target does not make themselves immediately available to detainment, ICE won't engage in a high-speed chase.

She said that flies in the face of what's actually happened on the ground, pointing to the fatal shooting in Franklin Park last week, when an ICE agent shot a man during an arrest, after he allegedly drove at agents, and dragged one of them with his car.

While neither immigration enforcement operation in Illinois is relying on National Guard troops, President Trump on Tuesday renewed his threat to send troops to Chicago to fight crime.

""If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion. Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with D.C., just like I'll do with Memphis,"" he said.

Gov. Pritzker responded to the president on Tuesday morning, saying, ""you can't take anything that he says seriously,"" noting Mr. Trump has repeatedly reversed course on possible plans to deploy the National Guard in Chicago.

""When he said that he wasn't coming to Chicago, I didn't trust that. When he says he is coming to Chicago, it's hard to believe anything he says,"" Pritzker said.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/09/17d35935-e033-4212-bce8-a340544a389b/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e33e2ba56d459d64f8a1540824335eec/gettyimages-2223407537.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 15:57:08.823877

NEW YORK – A U.S. District Court granted a preliminary injunction today that would improve conditions for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 26 Federal Plaza. Notably, the order grants class certification and prohibits ICE from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order also requires ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats and access to adequate soap and other hygiene products, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

In August, the court granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from holding people in abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza after the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP filed a class action lawsuit.

The temporary holding facility has come under fire in recent months, after ICE held more than 100 people, sometimes for weeks, in inhumane and unsanitary conditions without beds, showers, or adequate medical support. The government also banned in-person legal visitation, any confidential phone or video communication, and confidential exchange of written documents, in violation of people’s First and Fifth Amendment rights.

Quotes from co-counsel are as follows:

“Today’s ruling is an important win for immigrants’ rights and affirms what we’ve known all along: ICE’s conduct at 26 Federal Plaza is inhumane, illegal and a direct violation of the Constitution,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel with the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “No person should be denied medical care, access to a lawyer, or basic dignity when they are held in government custody – and we’ll continue to fight to hold ICE accountable.”

“The cruel policy of subjecting individuals to degrading treatment and inhumane conditions is deeply disturbing. And now, the court has made it abundantly clear that it is also illegal,” said Harold Solis, Co-Legal Director of Make the Road New York. “As always, we’ll remain vigilant to ensure the government complies with today’s decision.”

“Today’s order rightly affirms that ICE cannot hold people in the dehumanizing, abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza,” said Bobby Hodgson, Assistant Legal Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “We’ll continue to fight to hold the Trump administration accountable and end ICE’s unconstitutional detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza for good.”

“The Court today sent a clear and much-needed message: ICE cannot flagrantly disregard the constitutional rights and basic human needs of the immigrants it detains at 26 Federal Plaza,” said Heather Gregorio of Wang Hecker LLP. “This order is an important step in the ongoing fight to hold the government accountable.”

County supervisors voted Tuesday to approve a motion, introduced by Supervisor Hilda Solis, to beef up oversight of data gathered by law enforcement devices known as automated license plate readers.

It’s already illegal in California for local law enforcement agencies to share information gleaned from license plate readers with federal agencies such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without a warrant.

But after a summer of ramped-up deportations, the county supervisors decided to impose more transparency on who’s requesting license plate data from the Sheriff’s Department — and when the agency provides it.

The change will create a clear policy that the data cannot be “disclosed, transferred, or otherwise made available” to immigration officials except when “expressly required” by law or if they have a warrant.

“In a place like Los Angeles County, where residents depend on cars for nearly every aspect of daily life, people must feel safe traveling from place to place without fear that their movements are being tracked, stored, and shared in ways that violate their privacy,” the motion states.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger cast the sole no vote. Helen Chavez, a spokesperson for Barger, said the supervisor voted against the motion because it calls for the county to support a bill that would limit the amount of time law enforcement can keep most license plate data to 60 days. Law enforcement has opposed that bill, she said.

Across the country, law enforcement agencies use cameras to collect data on millions of vehicles, poring over the records for clues to help find stolen vehicles, crime suspects or missing persons.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement it has roughly 366 fixed licensed plate readers from Motorola Vigilant and 476 from Flock Safety in contract cities and unincorporated areas. An additional 89 mobile systems from Motorola are mounted on vehicles that patrol these areas.

The department said its policy already prohibits it from sharing data from plate readers, known as ALPR, with any entity that “does not have a lawful purpose for receiving it.”

“LASD shares ALPR data with other law enforcement agencies only under an executed inter-agency agreement, which requires all parties to collect, access, use, and disclose the data in compliance with applicable law,” the statement read. “LASD has no current agreements for ALPR data sharing with any federal agency.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that the agency has multiple resources at its “fingertips to ensure federal law is enforced in Los Angeles, and throughout the entire country.”

“These sanctuary politicians’ efforts to stop the Sheriff’s Department from cooperating with ICE are reckless and will not deter ICE from enforcing the law,” McLaughlin said.

Southern California law enforcement departments — including LAPD and authorities in San Diego, Orange and Riverside counties — have been accused of routinely flouting state law by sharing license plate data with federal agents. A recent report from CalMatters cited records obtained by the anti-surveillance group Oakland Privacy that showed more than 100 instances in a single month when local police queried databases for federal agencies.

“When you collect this data, it’s really hard to control,” said Catherine Crump, director of UC Berkeley’s Technology & Public Policy Clinic. “It’s no different from once you share your data with Meta or Google, they’re going to repackage your data and sell it to advertisers and you don’t have any idea which of the advertising companies have your data.”

Even with the board cracking down on data sharing, advocates say it’s nearly impossible to ensure federal agents are barred from license plate data in L.A. County.

Dave Maass, the director of investigations for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said private companies that operate in California still collect and sell data that ICE can use.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection also has its own license plate readers around Southern California, he said.

Maass said even if a county bars its local sheriff’s department from sharing data with ICE, it’s difficult to guarantee the rule is followed by the rank-and-file. Immigration officers could informally pass on a plate number to a deputy with access to the system.

“Maybe they run the plate,” Maass says. “Unless there’s some public records release from the Los Angeles side of things, we just really don’t know who accessed the system.”

Under the motion passed Tuesday, the sheriff department would need to regularly report what agencies asked for license plate data to two county watchdogs groups — the Office of Inspector General and the Civilian Oversight Commission.

“Having somebody who is somewhat independent and whose role is more aggressively overseeing reviewing these searches is actually quite a big deal,” Maass said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9800f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3800x1995+0+269/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fzbk%2Fdamlat_images%2FLA%2FLA_PHOTO_SELECTS%2F2014_05%2F1862760_FI_0506_lawenforce_RL_003.JPG,N,,2025-09-17 13:56:58.965916

Firouzeh Firouzabadi was able to hug her son, Reza Zavvar, in their driveway on Saturday, just feet from where he was arrested by federal agents while walking his dog this summer.

“It’s amazing,” Zavvar said. “I’m glad it’s over.”

He also had an emotional reunion with his beloved dog, Duke.

Days after his happy homecoming, the 52-year-old recounted the morning of June 28.

“When I saw the first ICE agent exit his car and walk towards me with his hand on his weapon and asking if my dog is friendly, I said ‘Yes he is friendly,’"" he said. ""My heart kind of, like, sank — like, I can't believe this is happening.”

Zavvar sat down with News4 on Tuesday to reflect on the 77 days he spent in federal detention.

“Unnecessary, inhumane, corrupt,” he said.

Zavvar said he came to the U.S. from Iran legally as a student when he was 12 and eventually got his green card.

Years after a misdemeanor for marijuana possession in the late 1990s, he was stopped while reentering the country in 2004, which started the deportation process, according to his attorney.

His attorney said that case was resolved in 2007 when he was granted a ""withholding of removal order"" to Iran.

“Saying that you can stay here as long as you don’t get in trouble, that you stay clean and just stay here, work, pay taxes, and that’s what I was doing,” Zavvar said.

But nearly two decades later, ICE agents surrounded him in his quiet Gaithersburg neighborhood.

Zavvar said after he was picked up in June, he was first taken to a facility in Baltimore, where he spent five days in a holding cell. The cell had 30 to 40 people sleeping on a concrete floor, he said.

He was then transported to a detention center in Texas, according to online ICE detention records.

He said he was next sent to Ohio, back to Baltimore and eventually landed in Louisiana.

In July, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement, ""Zavvar had almost 20 years to self-deport and leave the U.S. The Trump administration will not ignore the rule of law […] criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.”

“I really didn't think that it would be to this extent and the types of people that they’re apprehending and the way that they’re going about doing it,” Zavvar said.

Loved ones said the government gave orders to deport him to Romania or Australia. However, with the help of family, friends and coworkers rallying around him and raising more than $50,000 for his legal fees, a judge ordered his release last week.

“I’m getting to that point that I’m believing right now because I can touch him, you know,” Zavvar's mother, said.

Now that he’s getting back to his routine, Zavaar said he isn't out of the woods. He's waiting for an immigration judge to be assigned to his case.

“We’re going to argue that the laws that were used to initially deport me based on my marijuana conviction in 1998, that those laws no longer exist, and to get my green card back and apply for citizenship, which I partly blame myself for that because I should have done that a little while ago,” he said.

And while he waits for his next day in court, his mother said this ordeal has taught her a valuable lesson:

In the lawsuit — filed against Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, United States Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons — the county argues that Oregon’s sanctuary law conflicts with state public records law and federal immigration law.

Now, a handful of Oregon counties are supporting the lawsuit, as reported by OPB.

In a draft letter to Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Marion County Board wrote, “Legal uncertainty harms everyone and benefits no one. It is currently unclear how Oregon’s Sanctuary Promise Act, Oregon’s Public Records Act, and federal laws interact and apply due to apparent conflicts, including in situations where a local government is served with an administrative subpoena.”

According to the draft, the counties that have signed the letter in support of the lawsuit include Baker, Clackamas, Columbia, Crook, Deschutes, Jefferson, Klamath, Linn, Malheur, Marion, Polk, Tillamook and Union counties.

The letter — which was shared with KOIN 6 News — goes on to say that the counties are encouraging the state to ask the federal court for a detailed opinion that will help local governments comply with local, state and federal laws.

A spokesperson for the Marion County Board told KOIN 6 that other Oregon counties are considering signing the letter and expect more signatures in the coming weeks.

In response to Oregon counties showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said, “Oregon’s sanctuary law has already been upheld by the courts, including the Ninth Circuit, which made clear it does not conflict with federal law. My office has also been clear with Marion County and others, Oregon sanctuary law allows officials to produce information in response to a judicial warrant, but an administrative subpoena from ICE is not a judicial warrant.”

Rayfield continued, “For immigrant communities, these legal battles can create fear and confusion. My office will vigorously defend Oregon’s sanctuary law, so families feel safe reporting crimes, sending their kids to school, and living their lives without fear of being targeted unfairly.”

Spokespeople for Gov. Kotek and U.S. Attorney General Bondi declined to comment on the pending litigation.

Oregon counties are not the only group showing support for Marion County’s lawsuit.

In late August, 34 out of 36 Oregon sheriffs came out in support of the lawsuit — also seeking clarity on ICE enforcement.

The two sheriffs who did not join that letter were Washington County Sheriff Caprice Massey and Multnomah County Sheriff Nicole Morrisey O’Donnell.

In a statement shared with KOIN 6, Sheriff Massey explained her reason for not signing the letter in support of Marion County’s lawsuit.

“The Washington County Sheriff’s Office appreciates Marion County and OSSA’s efforts to seek

clarification and guidance from federal courts regarding any conflicts between federal

immigration and Oregon sanctuary laws. Of note, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office has

not recently received administrative subpoenas like those described in the Marion County

lawsuit. Those subpoenas were directed to individuals on parole or probation. In Washington

County, the Department of Community Corrections is a separate county department and not

under the Sheriff’s authority,” Washington County Sheriff Massey wrote.

Meanwhile, Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Deputy John Plock told KOIN 6, “Sheriff Morrisey O’Donnell supports efforts to seek legal clarity from the courts regarding the intersection of Oregon’s sanctuary laws and federal requests for information. However, she did not sign the OSSA letter because the administrative subpoenas at the center of the Declaratory Judgement Complaint filed by Marion County were not directed to the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office. Instead, they were sent to the Multnomah County Department of Community Justice (DCJ), which is a separate county department.”

Deputy Plock continued, “Out of respect for that separation and in recognition that DCJ—not the Sheriff’s Office—is the entity directly involved, Sheriff Morrisey O’Donnell chose not to speak or act on behalf of another department.”

Since 1987, Oregon has been a sanctuary state and was the first state in the nation to pass a statewide law stopping state and local police from aiding federal authorities with immigration enforcement.

Marion County’s lawsuit points to the Federal Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which gives federal immigration officers broad authority to enforce immigration laws, including the use of subpoenas to request records.

“Federal Immigration Law authorizes states and localities to cooperate with the federal government in the identifications, apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens not lawfully present in the United States,” the lawsuit explains.

The complaint also points to conflicts with Oregon law, explaining that under state law, a public body cannot disclose certain information, such as an individual’s address, work or school schedules, or social media information for the purpose of federal immigration enforcement.",https://www.koin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/08/immigration_ice_12062025_AP25157540699407_04dfc5-e1755451111380.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:28.288268

Cambriae W. Lee, media@aclupa.org, 215-671-6832

Bucks County, Pa. — Community advocates rallied today outside the Bucks County courthouse preceding a preliminary injunction hearing challenging Sheriff Fred Harran's illegal decision to enter a 287(g) agreement with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The lawsuit, Make the Road Pennsylvania, et al. v. Harran, brought by the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the Community Justice Project, argues the sheriff acted unilaterally by entering the agreement without county approval, which is against the law.

Advocate leaders at the morning rally expressed their concerns:

""Every single person has a right to live safely, but 287(g) agreements like this one do the opposite. They spread fear, erode trust between communities and their government, and drive people into the shadows. So let’s talk about what this is really about: It’s about expanding the tentacles of Washington, D.C., into every corner of our country and our communities. It’s about giving some people free rein to target, profile, and arrest anyone they deem a threat. If today it’s immigrants, tomorrow it’s you,"" stated Diana Robinson, co-executive director of Make the Road Pennsylvania.

""The Welcome Project PA stands in solidarity with immigrant communities in Bucks County and beyond, affirming that our communities are safer and better when immigrant communities have access to safe due process and legal assistance,” said Josh Blakesley, executive director of The Welcome Project PA. “This program divides our communities and causes more fear and uncertainty. Residents of Bucks County do not want this, and neither do we!”

""The brunt of these 287(g) agreements is always felt by Black and brown communities, who become the targets of the unlawful racial profiling and harassment they manufacture. Families are in fear, worrying that their loved ones may not return home when they leave — no one should live like that. All Bucks County residents deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity. And, their taxpayer dollars should be spent on vital services, not tearing families apart in order to carry out the federal administration's destructive deportation plan against our immigrant neighbors,” said Danitra Sherman, deputy advocacy and policy director for the ACLU of Pennsylvania.

“It would have put cameras on all 6,200 deportation officers,” Houser said.
Although ICE’s budget has skyrocketed during Trump’s second term, the official confirmed body cameras haven’t been distributed to officials across the agency carrying out the president’s immigration enforcement agenda.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration discontinued its four-year body camera program.
Despite the lack of ICE body camera footage from the Franklin Park shooting, Houser said he believes there will still be a “robust” investigation into whether it was proper.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting of a Mexican immigrant last week in the suburbs because a program requiring them was scrapped by the Trump administration.

In late 2021, ICE launched a $25 million body camera pilot program that was discontinued soon after President Donald Trump took office, Jason Houser, chief of staff for ICE from 2021 to 2023, said in an interview Tuesday.

“It would have put cameras on all 6,200 deportation officers,” Houser said. “So if they would have carried through with the timeline we had in place, they would all be wearing them.”

Two ICE agents weren’t wearing body-worn cameras when one of them fatally shot Silverio Villegas González in a traffic stop Friday in Franklin Park, according to a federal official who asked not to be identified.

Although ICE’s budget has skyrocketed during Trump’s second term, the official confirmed body cameras haven’t been distributed to officials across the agency carrying out the president’s immigration enforcement agenda.

Chicago cops and suburban officers have long been required to wear the devices. Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration discontinued its four-year body camera program. The status of other federal agencies’ programs is unclear. A Trump executive order ended a mandate for federal agents to wear the devices.

Although ICE agents aren’t now required to wear body cameras, Houser pointed out they’ve been used in isolated situations this year, including a protest at an ICE facility in May in New Jersey where Newark’s mayor was arrested and ICE body cam video was used in a trespassing case against him.

Despite the lack of ICE body camera footage from the Franklin Park shooting, Houser said he believes there will still be a “robust” investigation into whether it was proper.

Under ICE policies, agents are instructed not to shoot at cars unless they’re in fear for their lives and have taken the safety of bystanders and other officers into account.

“There’s discretion in those tactical moments,” Houser said.

Houser questioned why the officers were assigned to that particular mission in the first place.

“When you have an administration that’s seeking quotas and media hits,” he said, “that puts officers at risk.”

Houser also said the Trump administration’s surge of immigration agents in Democrat-run cities like Chicago is leaving cities where the agents came from understaffed and unable to keep up with their work there.

The FBI, DEA, ATF and IRS have more agents working on immigration enforcement than ICE — depleting their core missions of fighting other types of crime, Houser said.

“Standing on a street corner in Franklin Park, stopping every other car, the percentage of you’re going to find somebody that then leads to a removal is extremely low,” he said. “None of this has to do with going after that 2% of people that have taken advantage of the immigration system that are convicted criminals — rapists, murderers — or the 1.5 million that have final orders of removal.”

Houser said the U.S. immigration system has been broken for decades and both parties are to blame.

“We can also question what went on in the Biden administration, right?” Houser said, referring to policies that “created surges and incentivized recidivism at the border.”

“We need to wake up and understand that we need [immigration] pathways for our economy to grow and for our communities to grow, and that has always been foundational to the American experience,” he said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which operates ICE, has said Villegas González, a Mexican national described as a devout family man, fled a traffic stop and dragged an ICE agent “a significant distance with his car.” The agent “sustained multiple injuries,” DHS said.

A witness, Sergio, has told the Sun-Times he witnessed part of the deadly encounter and didn’t see an ICE agent being dragged by Villegas González’s car, adding that videos posted online appear to disprove the official narrative.

“If things don’t stop, it’s only going to be a few more days before people start fighting back,” said Sergio, who said he legally immigrated from Mexico and only wanted to be identified by his first name.

On Monday, Gov. JB Pritzker said he was frustrated at what he believes is a lack of transparency about how Villegas González’s death is being investigated. And it’s still unclear who exactly is handling it.

In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tracy McLaughlin said, “All shootings are initially reviewed by the appropriate federal, state, local, or tribal law enforcement agency principally charged with first response to the incident. Following a review of the incident by the appropriate investigative agency, ICE will conduct an independent review of the critical incident.”

McLaughlin said assaults on ICE agents are up “1,000%.”

According to a 2021 ICE firearms and use-of-force handbook obtained by the Sun-Times, an ICE firearms committee reviews shootings to see if they complied with the agency’s guidelines, and if any policies need to be changed. If necessary, the committee can refer the case to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility for an additional review.

The bulletin noted: “ICE employees involved in a critical incident should anticipate an investigation by local authorities. They may be interviewed by local police or subpoenaed to a local grand jury or court proceeding.”

Dawn Catanzaro, a spokesperson for the village of Franklin Park, said, “the FBI Chicago field office is in charge of the investigation,” referring questions to that agency. An FBI spokesperson said the FBI responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on the scene, but wouldn’t comment on involvement in an ongoing investigation.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff85821/2147483647/strip/true/crop/969x553+15+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0d%2F5bcfcd5159b68d7e7030d036aac6%2Fpolicebodycamera-1.png,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:23.286867

Johnson said he taking proactive steps to protect the rights of people to publicly demonstrate in light of the recent ICE operations in and around Chicago.

The mayor kept his cool as he responded to reporter's questions on Tuesday. However, when he was asked about whether federal troops could help make Chicago's streets safer, it touched a nerve.

""The fact of the matter is, no one has asked me to send federal troops into this city to make it safe. It has never come up. It never came up during the campaign. It's never come up in the first two years,"" Johnson said.

The mayor's fiery comments comes as President Donald Trump once again flip flopped on sending the National Guard to Chicago.

""If they lose less than six or seven people a week with murder, they're doing a great job in their opinion,"" Trump said. ""Chicago is a death trap, and I'm going to make it just like I did with DC just like I'll do with Memphis.""

Mayor Johnson bristled at that plan, noting the city's reduction in violent crime this year.

Johnson signed an executive order to reaffirm protections for people who want to demonstrate against any federal action in Chicago.

He cited a recent clash at the ICE processing facility in Broadview as an example of why the order was important.

29 “Warren Questions ICE About Reports of Misuse of Solitary Confinement at Immigration Detention Facilities,” U.S.","Executive Summary

The Crisis

The United States maintains the world’s largest immigration detention system, detaining an average daily population of nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention.¹ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detains people in a network of facilities across the country where they often endure inhuman conditions, including solitary confinement.² Solitary confinement is the practice of isolating people in small cells without meaningful human contact for 22 hours or more per day.³

Over the past decade, the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention has risen at an alarming rate, with unprecedented numbers of immigrants held in isolation.⁴ Congress recently authorized a significant increase in funding to expand immigration detention, which will likely exacerbate this widespread, prolonged use of solitary confinement as detention capacity increases.⁵

The effects of prolonged solitary confinement can be lethal, as in the case of Charles Leo Daniel, who died after spending more than 13 years of his life in solitary confinement in various detention settings, including almost four years in solitary confinement in ICE detention.⁶ The adverse health effects of solitary confinement are well-established, extensively researched, and thoroughly documented across decades of literature,⁷ including post-traumatic stress disorder, self-harm, elevated suicide risks, lasting brain damage, and hallucinations.⁸ These effects often persist beyond the confinement period, resulting in enduring physical and psychological disabilities, especially among people with preexisting medical and mental health conditions.⁹ Vulnerable populations, including those with medical and mental health conditions, are often subjected to solitary confinement at high rates despite ICE’s own directives mandating its use as a last resort.¹⁰

Key Findings

This report, “Cruelty Campaign: Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention,” authored by faculty and students from Harvard Law School’s Empirical Research Services and the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program (HIRCP), the Peeler Immigration Lab, and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), provides an updated analysis of solitary confinement in U.S. immigration detention with an additional regional focus on facilities in New England. It builds on the February 2024 report, “‘Endless Nightmare’: Torture and Inhuman Treatment in Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention,” by the same authors.¹¹

Based on publicly available ICE data and records obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, “Cruelty Campaign” reveals alarming trends in the use of solitary confinement:

Over a span of just 14 months, from April 2024 to May 2025, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigration detention centers across the United States.

In the first four months of the second Trump presidency, the monthly increase in the use of solitary confinement was twice the rate observed between 2018 and 2023, and more than six times higher than during the end of the previous administration.¹²

On average, during the first three months of 2025, solitary confinement placements involving people with vulnerabilities lasted more than twice as long as they did in the first fiscal quarter of 2022, when ICE began reporting statistics on the solitary confinement of vulnerable populations.¹³ This increase is evident in both the average consecutive days per placement (38 days in early 2025 compared to 14 days in late 2021) and the average cumulative days per person (44 days in early 2025 compared to 20 days in late 2021).¹⁴

Detailed analysis of facilities in New England shows that between 2018 and 2023, nearly three out of four solitary confinement placements lasted 15 days or longer, the threshold that UN human rights experts consider to be torture.¹⁵ On average, people spent about a month in solitary confinement, and some were isolated for more than a year.¹⁶

Where mental health status was reported, almost half of the solitary confinement placements in immigration detention in New England involved individuals with reported mental health conditions,¹⁷ contrary to ICE directives requiring its use only as a last resort for vulnerable populations.¹⁸

Notably, the average number of vulnerable individuals subjected to solitary confinement nationally increased by approximately 56 percent per quarter in fiscal year 2025 compared to 2022, with increasing numbers of individuals experiencing multiple placements.¹⁹

Individual case analysis in New England reveals systemic use of solitary confinement for arbitrary and retaliatory purposes, including punishing people for filing grievances; requesting basic needs like showers; sharing food; or reporting sexual assault, practices that violate international prohibitions on arbitrary detention independent of duration.²⁰

Data Shortcomings

This analysis is constrained by fundamental flaws in ICE’s data collection and reporting systems.²¹ Recent independent analysis has found significant mathematical discrepancies in ICE detention data, and unexplained facility count changes.²² These systematic reporting failures mean that the findings in this report, while based on the best available data, may still underestimate the true scope of solitary confinement abuses, adding another layer to the transparency and accountability failures that advocates have documented for over a decade.

Sounding the Alarm for Years

This report adds to over a decade of persistent advocacy and research by PHR,²³ the National Immigrant Justice Center,²⁴ Solitary Watch,²⁵ whistleblowers,²⁶ and others; investigations, inquiries, and reports by government oversight bodies,²⁷ independent journalists,²⁸ and members of Congress;²⁹ briefings to high-level government officials;³⁰ and multiple congressional hearings focused on solitary confinement.³¹ The 2024 findings presented in “‘Endless Nightmare’: Torture and Inhuman Treatment in Solitary Confinement in U.S. Immigration Detention” revived congressional inquiries, media investigations, and urgency about ICE’s use of solitary confinement.³²

Leaders at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE faced pressure to end solitary confinement altogether or, at the very least, make major changes to reduce its use, particularly among the most vulnerable people in ICE detention.³³ In December 2024, ICE introduced new reporting requirements,³⁴ representing a modest transparency improvement.

Trump Administration Escalation

Rather than implementing recommendations to protect vulnerable people and end solitary confinement, the Trump administration has doubled down on the use of detention. The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” signed on July 4, 2025, more than quadruples ICE’s detention budget, which amounts to $45 billion through 2029.³⁵ This massive expansion of resources for a system already characterized by torturous conditions,³⁶ combined with little to no oversight, creates the conditions for catastrophic human rights violations on an unprecedented scale.

ICE’s continued lack of transparency hinders a comprehensive assessment of solitary confinement practices in immigration detention because granular data specific to each placement is not publicly reported.³⁷ While the new reporting requirements shed additional light on the use of solitary confinement in immigration detention, publicly released national data from April 2024 to May 2025 still omit key details, including circumstances and duration of each solitary placement.³⁸

Abuse in New England Facilities

Furthermore, the analysis of New England facilities demonstrates that county and state-run facilities are critical sites for intervention by state policymakers and advocates.³⁹

This regional focus exposes harmful practices and equips policymakers and advocates with actionable insights to dismantle systems of abuse.

Immediate Action Required

ICE’s use of detention has only increased under the current administration.⁴⁰ Given ICE’s planned continued expansion of detention and escalating use of solitary confinement, immediate action is required at all levels of government.

This report presents comprehensive recommendations across multiple levels of government to end solitary confinement in immigration detention. Given significant obstacles to federal reform, state and local action has become essential. The authors make the following recommendations:

State and local governments should renegotiate contracts with ICE to assert stronger control over detention standards and accountability measures.

Federal Government:

ICE must publicly commit to ending solitary confinement entirely through a binding directive that includes presumptive release for vulnerable populations.

The president should immediately halt immigration detention expansion at a minimum and eliminate solitary confinement in all immigration facilities.

Sign the UN Optional Protocol Against Torture to enable international oversight.

Congress must defend its constitutional oversight authority against ICE’s unprecedented obstruction by passing emergency legislation to restore unannounced inspection rights, strengthen civil rights oversight mechanisms, and ratify international monitoring protocols.

State and Local Government:

States should pass legislation eliminating or reducing solitary confinement in facilities within their borders.

States should increase procedural protections for those placed in isolation.

State Attorneys General should conduct regular unannounced inspections.

The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the ""one in, one out"" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.
Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was ""an interim judgement on one individual"" which would not halt the deal.
The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.
Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France.","An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK by small boat has won a last-minute legal claim to temporarily block his removal to France.

The 25-year-old was due to be returned on Wednesday under the ""one in, one out"" returns pilot scheme agreed in July between the UK and France.

In the first legal challenge against the deal, in the High Court in London, his lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he might have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and the decision to remove him had been rushed.

Science Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the ruling was ""an interim judgement on one individual"" which would not halt the deal.

""It will not stop this really important deal from going ahead, a deal that says if you come to this country illegally, you can and you will be deported,"" Kendall said.

She said ministers never claimed the deal would be ""a silver bullet to tackle all of the problems"" but insisted the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood was determined to make sure it worked.

The injunction raises serious questions about whether other migrants allocated to flights will use the same grounds to delay or block their removal.

Lawyers for the Home Office had argued that he could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims, and undermine the public interest in deterring lethal small boat crossings.

But during the hearing, it emerged that while the home secretary's own officials had rejected his claim that he was a victim of slavery, they had also said in a letter today that he had a right to make further representations – and they would not expect him to do that from France.

Mr Justice Sheldon, who rejected the man's claim that he would be left homeless and destitute in France, said that he would nevertheless have to temporarily block the man's departure in light of that development.

""There is a serious issue to be tried in relation to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner,"" he said.

""If there was a reasonable suspicion that he was trafficked - and that does not mean trafficked in or from France - that would amount to a statutory bar to removal for at least a short period of time.""

The judge said the man's lawyers must do all that is possible to make further representations within 14 days, so that his case can be finalised at a future hearing.

A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC that the government expected the first returns to take place imminently and that the interim ruling would not prevent delivery of the wider policy.

But Danny Shaw, a former Home Office adviser, said the government appeared to have selected people for removal who had ""very recently arrived on small boats in the UK and because of that, there hasn't been a lot of time to investigate the background of those individuals"".

Shaw said that was what had happened in the case of the Eritrean man, in which the judge ruled he needed 14 days to investigate whether he had been trafficked.

Imogen Townley, a solicitor at Wilson LLP who has represented asylum seekers, said there seemed to be ""quite an arbitrary and chaotic approach to selecting people arriving on small boats"".

She said while she accepted legal claims holding up removals would be frustrating for the government, it was ""worth it to have due process and a fair system"".

""It's not realistic to think that individuals caught up in the scheme do not have individual circumstances [preventing their removal],"" Townley said.

She said she did not think the UK-France deal had been scuppered because there was not an ""overarching problem"" with the scheme's design.

Kemi Badenoch responded to news of the injunction with ""we told you so"".

Speaking to LBC, the Conservative leader called for ""some tough laws"" and said ""we are basically turning our country into a refuge for anyone who may have even the slightest bit of unhappiness in any other country"".

Reform leader Nigel Farage said that even if the policy worked, it would not lead to lower migration numbers as ""one in, one out, and with another one in, still means plus one for everyone that crosses the Channel"".

Papers logged at the High Court show that the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, left Ethiopia for Europe two years ago, arriving in Italy in April 2025.

A month later, he left for France where he was assisted by charities including the Red Cross, before his mother paid $1,400 (£1,024) to smugglers for his Channel crossing to the UK.

More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.

It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/dd92/live/93f892f0-930b-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:09.228393

CBS News Chicago reached out to Homeland Security officials about what happened in Des Plaines, but have yet to hear back.","Video captured the moment ICE agents tried to take a father and his two sons into custody—leaving one man in the hospital, even though he's not in the country illegally.

Family members said that the man was released from the hospital after he said he was tased in the face while being taken into federal custody.

The only problem—he was born in Chicago.

Although his father is undocumented, they all ended up in ICE custody.

Federal agents pulled out weapons around 9:30 Tuesday morning. They boxed in a landscaping truck just as a father and his two sons exited the 7-Eleven store at Ballard and Potter Roads in Des Plaines.

Edgar Ruiz said he came out first and jumped in the passenger seat. His brother, Adrian, was second—yet when his father, Rigoberto Ruiz, left the store, surveillance showed ICE agents moved in.

One agent was seen coming from the front of the truck and went to the passenger side, where Edgar sat.

The truck was shown reversing as more agents moved in. That's when Edgar could be seen running across the busy road—ICE agents followed.

The second brother, Adrian, ran down the block. Their father, who is undocumented and has lived in the United States for 30 years, did not run.

""In the past couple of weeks and months, we've seen the Latino community as a whole under attack, that means even if you're a U.S. citizen, you've got to carry your passport,"" said Berto Aguayo, policy co-chair of the Latino Leadership Council.

The two brothers are U.S. citizens.

Edgar said that when the agent originally came to the passenger door, he tried holding the door closed, preventing him from opening it. He said at that time he and his family had no idea who was at the vehicle, and everyone was scared.

When the agent tried opening the door, Edgar said he was tased in the face. That's when he told everyone in the truck to run for their lives. Despite being a U.S. citizen, he said they ran out of fear.

Those are the concerns the Latino Leadership Council is worried about as ""Operation Midway Blitz"" continues.

""The death xxx last week at the hands of ICE and the situation in Des Plaines, we must demand full accounts of what's happening in these incidents because they are too common and too frequent, and no one is above the law here in the U.S.,"" Aguayo said.

This is not about safety. This is an engineered crisis

Edgar said he was detained for about two hours in a facility in Lombard, Illinois. Once released, his family took him to get medical attention. The father remains in ICE custody.

And despite the administration’s apparent indifference to public opinion, public sentiment is not irrelevant in the broader political and legal ecosphere.
Moreover, there’s a reason courtroom dramas continue to find their place on your favorite streaming service: Legal cases are rich with characters, narratives, and conflict.
A strong litigation communications strategy also opens the door to a win-by-losing approach, something many organizations should consider or even plan for.
Whether you win or lose in the near-term, couple your legal strategy with a communications strategy so that you make the “what’s at stake” and “who is impacted” of your work better known.","In the first year of the second Trump administration, more than 350 cases have been filed to date in response to its actions, a record for any president over such a short period of time. There’s no reason to expect this deluge to stop. But because it remains an open question how much the administration actually intends to comply with the many court orders issued in response to its actions, litigation can only be part of a larger strategy to respond to what the administration is doing.

Take, for example, a recent court order restricting immigration stops, stemming from a case filed jointly by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Public Counsel, which barred authorities from stopping or arresting people based solely on racial profile (and then from detaining them without legal representation or due process). Last Monday, the Supreme Court lifted the lower court’s restrictions. But while the administration was appealing the order, it had not ceased the immigration raids, as the court had ordered. A purely legal strategy, in such a situation, is clearly inadequate for the work we are doing.

Pressure must be applied outside the courtroom as well as inside it. And despite the administration’s apparent indifference to public opinion, public sentiment is not irrelevant in the broader political and legal ecosphere. Even in the president’s case, there is evidence that he cares what certain people think, as exemplified by the now infamous TACO trade on Wall Street, and a stated openness to finding ways to legally employ migrant farm workers, to list two examples.

Moving the needle on public opinion can ultimately build a base of support for cultural and policy change that can stand the test of time. For this reason, litigation in an information vacuum not only represents a missed opportunity for advocates, but seeing litigation as one part of a larger storytelling campaign can change hearts and minds for the long term, across social groups and identities.

A central challenge is that while many public interest cases have significant, direct impacts on millions of Americans, the legal process is designed to be inaccessible, using its own language, having its own processes and rules, and operating in very insular ways. Especially for those who believe in accessible and transparent justice, pairing litigation with communications is therefore not only the best way to address the problem of the moment, but an opportunity to engage, educate, and mobilize citizenry.

So much of the communication around major cases starts with the law and then goes to the facts, but it should be the other way around. After all, legal principles gain their meaning from what happens to real people, with whom the public can empathize. By translating what is happening in a case and why it matters, you create pathways for folks to engage, learn, and ideally mobilize in your or your issues’ favor.

Moreover, there’s a reason courtroom dramas continue to find their place on your favorite streaming service: Legal cases are rich with characters, narratives, and conflict. At its best, litigation communications is about augmenting often-arcane legal arguments with messaging centered on the shared values at play, the lives impacted, and the personal stakes for those who may otherwise feel distant from the case (or where the impacts may not be immediately clear).

Take, for example, the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, a DACA recipient who was unlawfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) just weeks into President Trump’s first term, and represented by Public Counsel. ICE’s actions were based in falsely claiming Mr. Medina was a gang member, among other things, and held him without regard for his legal rights. As the first DACA recipient to be arrested and held, Mr. Medina’s case became the blueprint for how to respond to the Trump administration’s overreach, providing a playbook of sorts for lawyers and advocates alike. Along with countering the administration’s legal arguments, this included executing a relentless communications effort to counter the government’s aggressive portrayal of Mr. Medina as a criminal, by showing Daniel for who he was (and is): A longtime, law-abiding resident, a committed father and partner, and a hard-working individual who was no different from the more than 500,000 DACA recipients living lawfully across the country.

At Public Counsel, we framed Daniel’s story as a cautionary tale of the harm that broad, unchecked agency power can have on protected families and American citizens living in the United States. We shared that story across broadcast and local television, radio, print, and social media platforms, with members of Congress and other officials, and with the immigration advocacy community broadly. In 2018, a federal judge barred the government from revoking Medina’s DACA status, reinforcing the legitimacy of his legal right to remain. Public opinion also shifted as other components of the administration’s approach to immigration prompted public outcry, with more Americans in 2020 viewing immigration positively.

We are using a similar approach to counter the ongoing immigration raids now randomly sweeping up health and childcare workers, food service and construction teams, field hands and contributors to the American economy. Here we have focused on the connection between the folks being apprehended and the increased cost of goods and services, which are costs the American electorate shares a deep concern about. Moreover, as was true in the Medina case, there is a clear distinction to be drawn between hard working folks contributing positively to their community and the murderers, drug dealers, and rapists (real or imagined) the administration promised to focus on. The former enjoy broad public support, and connecting their fate to the administration’s disregard for any reasonable legal boundaries has fueled growing opposition to its hardline approach, with the potential power to influence future policy.

Why do so many organizations litigate but don’t communicate? With most resources being dedicated to the cost and time associated with a lawsuit, communicating about an active case can be tricky. And yet litigation under the cover of darkness and away from the public spotlight is only a half measure when fundamental rights are at stake. Even if a litigation-only approach may result in a legal victory, moving public opinion and the politics of the moment may be what is actually needed for the illegal activity to cease (or for a legal outcome to be durable).

This has been most evidently the case where it relates to marriage equality, where a broad and persistent communications campaign helped move public opinion. The campaign certainly benefited from the positive portrayal of same-sex couples on television, and Harvey Milk’s legacy in bringing the gay and lesbian community out of the shadows, but everything about the advocacy campaign was precise and intentional: We leveraged every filing and hearing to engage the media, every plaintiffs’ anniversary, birthday, or personal milestone to build community on social media, and every piece of testimony to build a narrative that showed how baseless the opposition to marriage equality really was. Between 2010 and 2015, public opinion on marriage equality shifted 25 percent, and even now, public support remains strong despite some pullback from Republican voters.

A strong litigation communications strategy also opens the door to a win-by-losing approach, something many organizations should consider or even plan for. Especially when courts are not reliable, a near-term legal defeat can still be offset by an evolution in public perception. This has certainly been true of recent environmental cases, where not all cases have been won but where 61 percent oppose the president’s actions on this issue. Between 2017 and 2020, a period of extreme environmental litigation, public sentiment around climate change shifted by 11 percent.

For foundations that litigate, or that might themselves be forced to litigate, the takeaway here is both-and: Fund the best legal teams to develop the best legal theories and pursue litigation where necessary. But don’t only do that part of the puzzle. Whether you win or lose in the near-term, couple your legal strategy with a communications strategy so that you make the “what’s at stake” and “who is impacted” of your work better known. Doing so builds a more durable base of support.

The judicial branch of government provides a unique and valuable platform to tell a critical and compelling story. But it is a platform you have to seize and take advantage of. The story won’t write itself.",https://ssir.org/images/blog/legal-advocacy-storytelling-737x737.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 09:56:23.966114

Particularly, Latinx residents near the border are disproportionately targeted, as the U.S. border enforcement turns its dehumanizing practices onto its own people.
As such, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned U.S. and Mexican border militarization as incompatible with basic human rights norms.
Moving forward, migration policy must center human rights by upholding due process, expanding legal pathways, and decreasing harmful border militarization.
In the United States, regardless of citizenship, people are entitled to dignity, justice, and protection of human rights.","Alexandra Wagner is a graduate student at American University, where she studies International Development with a specialization in global justice in Latin America. She currently works at the Latin American Youth Center, where she oversees compliance for programs that support homeless and unstably housed youth. This program facilitates access to education, employment, and housing services as part of a holistic approach to long-term stability and self-sufficiency.

The United States government continues to undermine migrants’ constitutional rights in the name of immigration enforcement. This disturbing truth has been brought to light after the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia on March 15, 2025. Abrego Garcia is a Salvadorian man who had legal protection from deportation under U.S. immigration law. Under a legal system that claims due process for all, including non-citizens, Abrego Garcia was deported without a hearing, warning, or regard for court orders. While his story has gained headlines, sadly he represents countless immigrants who are routinely denied their right to due process via detainment or deportation. His case reveals a growing reliance on militarized policies that erode fundamental rights and endanger human dignity for noncitizens within the United States.

A Legal and Moral Failure

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that no person, citizen or non-citizen, can be deprived of life, liberty, or property without fair legal procedures (due process). Due to life-threatening gang violence in El Salvador, Abrego Garcia exercised this right in 2019 when he was granted legal protection against deportation. Despite this protection though, in March 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported Abrego Garcia disregarding federal court orders. In fact, a lawyer for the federal government admitted that Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a mistake, acknowledging that he had been wrongfully removed despite having legal protection. Only with Supreme Court intervention was Abrego Garcia safely returned to the United States.

With the U.S. federal government’s blatant disregard for legal safeguards in immigration enforcement, a clear corrosion of due process exists. Policies like ""Remain in Mexico"" and ""expedited removal"" have normalized immigration procedures that disregard basic due process protections by denying individuals the opportunity to be heard in court. While immigrants do not have a constitutional right to government-funded legal representation, they are permitted to bring legal counsel when hearings occur. However, in cases like Abrego Garcia’s, no hearing was granted at all, stripping him of even the chance to defend himself.

These practices undermine the basic right of due process by denying individuals the opportunity to present their asylum cases or challenge government mistakes. Even those with a court order barring removal, like Abrego Garcia, are regularly denied legal protections as immigration enforcement chooses efficiency over true justice. This is dangerous to all people in the United States, regardless of citizenship, because once one group of people’s rights are violated, everyone’s rights are at risk.

Militarizing the Border, Dismantling Rights

The degradation of immigrant rights is fundamentally tied to the militarization of the U.S.-Mexico border. Over the last two decades, administrations on both sides of the aisle have transformed the Southern border into a pseudo-warzone with policies such as “prevention through deterrence”. As the Brennan Center notes, this militarization has become an “opaque and extralegal security apparatus” that avoids congressional oversight and threatens constitutional protections.

This strategy, intended to close off border entry, actually funnels migrants onto more dangerous routes, increasing their need for smugglers and risk of death. Migrants are simultaneously criminalized for using illicit channels while being denied access to legal ones. This manufactured danger not only justifies further enforcement spending but also shifts public perception by framing migration as a threat rather than a humanitarian issue rooted in global inequality and displacement.

Under pressure from the U.S. government, Mexico has also engaged in militarization by deploying their National Guard to the Southern border. The Oxford-published study The Militarization of Mexico’s Border and Its Impacts on Human Rights details how the “use of military tactics, strategy, technology, equipment and forces” to control migration undermines human rights protections and pushes migrants toward more dangerous, life-threatening paths.

Militarized Borders, Civilian Consequences

Border militarization has created a dangerous environment that blurs the lines between immigration enforcement and military policing. Under these policies, everyone, including U.S. citizens, is at risk of racial profiling, unwarranted stops, and unconstitutional surveillance. Particularly, Latinx residents near the border are disproportionately targeted, as the U.S. border enforcement turns its dehumanizing practices onto its own people.

These practices not only violate domestic law, but also disregard binding international agreements. The principle of non-refoulement under the 1951 Refugee Convention prohibits returning individuals to countries where they face serious harm. As such, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has repeatedly condemned U.S. and Mexican border militarization as incompatible with basic human rights norms. In doing so, the U.S. and its partners have built a border regime that treats human rights as optional, a dangerous model with consequences that extend far beyond immigration policy.

A Path Forward through a Broken System

While Americans may wish to classify Abrego Garcia’s case as unique, doing so misses the deep systemic failures and institutional compromises of human rights happening within our borders. The U.S. government has incrementally legitimized a border regime which diminishes migration to criminality and prioritizes deterrence over justice. The Trump policies accelerated this trajectory, but the Biden administration has also not been able to fully reverse it. As the highest court in the country, the most recent decision by the Supreme Court affirming that deportations without hearings violate constitutional rights should be irrefutable. However, as the treatment of immigrants in the U.S. shows, having rights on paper means little without real enforcement and accountability.

Moving forward, migration policy must center human rights by upholding due process, expanding legal pathways, and decreasing harmful border militarization. This involves investing in immigration courts, ceasing expedited deportations, and ensuring that the principle of non-refoulement is not a mere formality but an effective legal protection. It also demands holding the highest-level officials responsible for unauthorized removals, regardless of whether there is Democratic or Republican leadership.

Conclusion

Legal protections do not stop at the border. In the United States, regardless of citizenship, people are entitled to dignity, justice, and protection of human rights. The unconstitutional deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a human rights failure. While due process is being reaffirmed by the courts, policymakers must confront the larger system that perpetuated this violation of basic human rights. Constitutional rights cannot coexist with militarized borders. So, to honor its legal and moral obligations, the United States will have to choose principle over fear by dismantling a border regime that treats human dignity as negotiable.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/meta_open_graph/public/2025-09/viber_image_2025-06-11_07-02-36-478.jpg?itok=ZrZq9yZl,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:13.990135

""On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic.","U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joined federal immigration agents during an early morning operation in Elgin, Illinois, on Tuesday that resulted in multiple people being led away in handcuffs, and two U.S. citizens being briefly detained.

A CBS report said that five people had been arrested during the raid, including two U.S. citizens, before being released after showing their official documentation. But when asked by Newsweek, DHS denied that two U.S. citizens were arrested and said they were held briefly and subsequently released.

""No U.S. citizen was arrested, they were briefly held for their and officers' safety while the operation in the house was under way. This is standard protocol,"" a DHS spokesperson told Newsweek.

DHS said that five people were arrested as part of the raid, all of whom were illegal immigrants.

The raid—which Noem posted footage of on X—was part of a broader Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforcement effort called ""Operation Midway Blitz"" that targeted criminal noncitizens in the Chicago area, according to officials.

Why It Matters

Noem's presence on an early morning enforcement action underscores the heightened federal focus on immigration enforcement in the Chicago metropolitan area and the political salience of those operations. The homeland security secretary has become the face of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, making numerous public appearances and frequently attending ICE raids around the country.

The White House has floated a goal of 3,000 daily ICE arrests, raising concerns among advocates who say such quotas encourage indiscriminate enforcement practices and undermine due process protections.

What To Know

DHS said that five illegal immigrants were arrested in the Chicago area, including an individual convicted of a DUI with a child passenger, an individual convicted of violent assault, and an individual arrested for domestic violence, harassment, obstruction, and felony stalking.

""President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. ""Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI, and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.""

Video posted by Noem on X shows agents in tactical gear leading people away in handcuffs. It is unclear if those handcuffed included the two U.S. citizens.

DHS said the operation was part of a multi-week enforcement push targeting what the department described as ""criminal illegal aliens"" who have come to Illinois, particularly Chicago.

Local witnesses described helicopters, bright spotlights, tactical vehicles and what one neighbor called the ""drone of a helicopter"" overhead.

The Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and has conducted numerous ICE raids since taking office in January.

ICE reported more than 66,000 arrests and 65,000 removals in the administration's first 100 days, with the daily detention population swelling to 55,000 people, well above pre-inauguration levels.

While officials have stressed that dangerous criminals are being targeted, federal data show that many detainees have no criminal record at all.

Last month, ICE agents detained the boyfriend of a New York City official though he had legal status.

""On August 28, ICE arrested Nathaniel Rojas, a criminal alien from the Dominican Republic. His criminal history includes convictions for felony grand larceny, felony aggravated DUI with a child passenger less than 16 years old, identify theft, and retail theft. This criminal alien is in ICE custody pending removal proceedings,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsweek.

What People Are Saying

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X alongside footage of the operation: ""This week, a brave ICE officer was dragged many yards by a car after a criminal illegal alien resisted arrest. His life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries. President Trump has been clear: if politicians will not put the safety of their citizens first, this administration will. I was on the ground in Chicago today to make clear we are not backing down. Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrests for assault, DUI, and felony stalking. Our work is only beginning.""

Joe Botello, a U.S. citizen from Texas detained in the raid, told the Chicago Sun-Times: ""I told them I was a U.S. citizen, that my ID was in my wallet.""

Illinois state Senator Cristina Castro, addressing Noem directly, told CBS Chicago: ""She can go to hell. Don't come into my community.""

What Happens Next

DHS has signaled that the operation will continue for several weeks across the Chicago area, with federal agencies participating in enforcement actions. CBS reported that the broader federal presence included ICE, U.S. Marshals, the FBI and Customs and Border Protection.

The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration fined the University of California, Los Angeles $1.2 billion and froze research funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus and other civil rights violations. It was the first public university to be targeted with a widespread funding freeze. The administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges, including Harvard, Brown and Columbia.

According to the lawsuit, the Trump administration has made several demands in its proposed settlement offer to UCLA, including giving government access to faculty, student, and staff data, releasing admissions and hiring data, ending diversity scholarships, banning overnight demonstrations on university property and cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the UC system's president.

Stett Holbrook, a spokesman for the University of California system, said that while the university is not involved in the lawsuit, it is part of numerous legal and advocacy efforts to restore and maintain funding.

“Federal cuts to research funding threaten lifesaving biomedical research, hamper U.S. economic competitiveness and jeopardize the health of Americans who depend on the University’s cutting-edge medical science and innovation,” he said in a statement.

The coalition that sued is led by the American Association of University Professors union, or AAUP, and represented by Democracy Forward, a legal group that has brought other lawsuits against the Trump administration over frozen federal funds.

“The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely,” the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said.

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched dozens of federal investigations also targeting K-12 school districts.

University of California President James Milliken said on Monday that the federal government has also launched investigations and other actions against all of the UC’s 10 campuses, but he offered no details in a statement.

“This represents one of the gravest threats to the University of California in our 157-year history,” he said, adding that the university system receives more than $17 billion each year in federal support, including nearly $10 billion in Medicare and Medicaid funding, and funding that goes toward research and student financial aid.

The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.

Among those arrested by ICE on Tuesday was a 37-year-old alleged gang member, according to ICE spokespeople.

Aldo Salazar Bahena was also arrested Monday in Elgin and was convicted of murder in 2005, according to Homeland Security spokespeople. Illinois law prohibits prison officials from honoring ICE detainer requests and Bahena was released from Stateville Prison in Crest Hill on Friday, only to be arrested again Monday.

ICE also released details on the arrest of another man, whose criminal history is said to include arrest for DUI, resisting a police officer and vehicular burglary.

The news follows Tuesday’s formidable show of strength by federal agents near 87th Street and the Dan Ryan Expressway in Chatham.

“The way they rolled up on them like they were looking for straight up criminals, jumping out of Range Rovers, jumping out of pickup trucks,” general contractor Lorenzo Stacy, who saw the ICE operation in Chatham, said.

“Operation Midway Blitz,” as it’s described by the federal government, converged on a group of day laborers at around 9 a.m. in the parking lot of the Home Depot located on 87th Street near the expressway.

Stacy said it was a heart-wrenching scene with day laborers trying to evade capture. At least one injury was reported and required an ambulance, according to paramedics with the Chicago Fire Department.

According to Stacy, federal agents even made a military helicopter helping them.

“Targeting these people like they’re animals. Go after the bad guys, go after the gang bangers, go after the killers. These guys are just trying to work, that’s all,” Stacy said.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted videos of ICE arrests in Elgin Tuesday morning, saying she’s on the ground to make it clear the department isn’t backing down.

“Just this morning, DHS took violent offenders off the streets with arrest for assault, DUI, and felony stalking,” Noem wrote on social media.

The scene woke some neighbors up at around 5 a.m. Tuesday.

“It was a military helicopter and I woke him up and I said, ‘Something’s going on,’ and the search light was going. Drones were up in the air. I saw a second helicopter kind of duck off to the side, so they were working in tandem,” Elgin resident Angie Hurst said.

Some emotional video from Little Village recorded Monday shows ICE arresting a man despite pleas from his wife that he’s in the United States legally.

“The people they are targeting are our mothers, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors. Every day working class people whose only fault is to believe the American Dream,” Berto Aguayo of the Latino Leadership Council said.

The Latino Leadership Council spoke out as deportation efforts expand. The Border Patrol’s head of Operation at Large announced that operation, which began in Los Angeles, has officially arrived in Chicago. That’s in addition to the ongoing “Operation Midway Blitz.”

“Let me be clear, this is not about safety. This is an engineered crisis, a spectacle for headlines, not safety,” Illinois Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said.

In a message on his X account, the leftist leader accused the United States of seeking to “participate” in Colombian politics and looking for a “puppet president” as the country prepares for presidential elections next year.

“The Colombian people will reply if they want a puppet president…or a free and sovereign nation” Petro wrote, adding in another message that he would not let his nation “kneel” to U.S. interests and allow peasants who grow coca to get “beaten up.”

On Monday, the Trump administration designated Colombia as a country that is failing to meet its international commitments to fight drug trafficking and blamed the Colombian government for a lack of progress in the fight against the cocaine trade.

The designation, known as decertification, is a stunning rebuke for a traditional U.S. ally. It comes amid a recent surge in cocaine production and fraying ties between the White House and Colombia’s first leftist president.

Even as the U.S determined that Colombia has failed to comply with international anti-narcotics obligations, the Trump administration issued a waiver of sanctions that would have triggered major aid cuts.

On Tuesday, the charge d’affaires at the U.S. embassy in Bogota, John McNamara, said that consular services, humanitarian projects and defense cooperation would not be affected by Colombia’s decertification.

“We are going to do everything we can to fight with the Colombian people against the global threat” of drugs, McNamara told Colombian radio station Blu.

Colombia’s decertification comes as cocaine production skyrockets in the South American country.

The amount of land dedicated to cultivating coca, the base ingredient of cocaine, has almost tripled in the past decade to a record 253,000 hectares in 2023, according to the latest report available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.

Petro, a former rebel himself, also has angered senior U.S. officials by denying American extradition requests as well as criticizing the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and its efforts to combat drug trafficking in neighboring Venezuela.

The Colombian president has also said that whisky kills more people than cocaine, and claimed that the reason wealthy countries like the United States want to crack down on cocaine is because its produced in Latin America.

Sandra Borda, an international relations professor at Bogota’s Los Andes University said that Colombia’s decertification is unlikely to affect efforts to take on drug traffickers in Colombia, because military cooperation is expected to continue.

However she expects tensions between the governments of the U.S. and Colombia to increase, as Petro uses Colombia’s decertification to tap into anti-American sentiment and rally his supporters ahead of next year’s elections.

“There has been a difficult relationship” between the Petro and Trump administrations, she explained. “You have statements and declarations that are not friendly and I think what you are going to see is an escalation of that.”

In the Presidential Determination submitted to Congress on Monday, the Trump administration mostly blamed Petro for the rise of cocaine production in Colombia, describing his efforts to negotiate peace deals with “narco terrorist groups” as a failure.

The report said that Colombia’s security institutions and municipal authorities have shown “skill and courage” in confronting drug traffickers, but said that “the failure of Colombia to meet its drug control obligations over the past year rests solely with its political leadership.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also commented on Colombia’s decertification on Tuesday.

“Colombia has been a great partner historically,” Rubio told reporters. “But they have a president now who in addition to being erratic has not been a very good partner when it comes to taking on drug cartels.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250916-Bogota-colombia-Gustavo-Petro-ac-946p-2c392d.jpg",N,,2025-09-17 08:56:57.167375

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is part of the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

“We remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,” the letter says.

The nation’s immigration courts — with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases — have become a key focus of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.

The senators' letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.

A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.

The Democratic senators said they were “deeply concerned” that pulling those lawyers away would have an impact on service members who are going through the military’s judicial system.

“These reassignments come at a time only shortly after Congress completely overhauled how the military investigates and prosecutes serious ‘covered’ criminal offenses … by establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTCs) in each of the Services,” the letter read.

Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims’ commanders.

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is part of the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

“We remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,” the letter says.

The nation’s immigration courts — with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases — have become a key focus of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.

The senators' letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.

A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.

The Democratic senators said they were “deeply concerned” that pulling those lawyers away would have an impact on service members who are going through the military’s judicial system.

“These reassignments come at a time only shortly after Congress completely overhauled how the military investigates and prosecutes serious ‘covered’ criminal offenses … by establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTCs) in each of the Services,” the letter read.

Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims’ commanders.

The offices began taking cases at the end of last year.

The letter asks the Pentagon what it will do to “preserve the OSTC’s progress in building specialized trial capacity” and what the services will do to “ensure that diversion of OSTCs, trial counsels, and defense counsels does not create delays or diminish quality in court-martials.” The senators say that the plan is a demonstration of how “the Trump administration views skilled personnel as pawns to be traded between agencies, rather than as professionals essential to their core missions, in order to advance misguided immigration policies.""",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/21d46521-a56d-4e3f-bc2e-23555d51960c/wirestory_a34c89929ff098e423d49a3a5460a2aa_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-09-17 06:56:40.402911

Connecticut is banning ICE from making arrests in state courthouses without a judicial warrant or order issued or signed by a judicial officer.","This story has been updated.

Connecticut officials announced a new rule on Tuesday that seeks to ban federal agents from making immigration-related arrests inside the state’s courthouses without a judicial warrant or signed order. But the state leaders acknowledged there will be little to no way to enforce that policy if officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement continue apprehending people at the state properties.

Raheem Mullins, chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, announced the new policy at a press conference on Tuesday where he was joined by Gov. Ned Lamont and Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee.

The issuance of the new policy is a response to the aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that have been employed by President Donald Trump’s administration and several high-profile arrests that were made by federal immigration officials inside Connecticut courthouses, including an instance at Stamford Superior Court where masked agents broke a bathroom door in order to take two men into custody.

More than 20 Democratic state senators cited that episode in a letter they sent to Mullins earlier this month, and they implored the chief justice to take steps to prevent ICE agents from using the public spaces inside courthouses to make arrests.

Mullins, who leads the state’s judicial branch as the chief justice, said the new policy was not arrived at “haphazardly.”

“Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public — they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,” Mullins said. “The due administration of justice requires that courthouse security be protected.”

The written policy, which went into effect Tuesday, specifically prohibits any arrest from taking place “inside the public areas of a courthouse,” unless the officers have a “judicial warrant.”

That’s an important distinction because most ICE arrests are made based on an administrative warrant, which doesn’t have the same legal force as a warrant issued by a judge.

At the same time, the new policy seeks to ban federal ICE agents from wearing masks inside Connecticut courthouses, unless the mask is “medically necessary.”

Lamont, who is in his second term as governor, called the new judicial policy a “modest step” and said he hopes it can withstand potential court challenges.

Mullins, who was confirmed as chief justice at the beginning of this year, said he was hopeful ICE would honor the court’s policy. But Mullins and Stafstrom both recognized that court employees and the judicial marshals, who maintain security at Connecticut’s courts, would be unable to stop federal agents from conducting arrests if they forced the issue.

“Court employees are not to interfere or assist,” Mullins said. “So that is the guidance that they get.”

“I think we need to be realistic,” Stafstrom added. “What we are enacting here is a policy change. It is a policy that says that we would appreciate if ICE would honor our request for them to conduct their activities — their lawful activities that they are charged to do under federal law — outside the presence of the courthouse.”

Stafstrom, a Bridgeport Democrat who was first elected to the legislature in 2015, said the new policy is necessary in order to keep Connecticut’s courts accessible to people.

He pointed out that people need to access the courts for more than just criminal cases, and he said some people including victims and witnesses of crimes could become hesitant to visit courthouses if masked ICE agents continue to apprehend people inside the state properties.

“Justice should not depend on one’s immigration status,” Stafstrom said. “If you are a victim of a crime, if you are someone who believes you’ve been taken advantage of by an unscrupulous creditor, if you believe you are someone who is wrongly being evicted from their house, if you are someone who seeks a divorce from an abusive spouse, you should be able to enter a courthouse in this state free of fear that when you try to achieve justice an masked, unmarked individual is going to grab you and pull you out of the courthouse.”

In a statement, Stephen Harding, Connecticut’s Senate Minority Leader, did not take issue specifically with the new policy implemented by the courts. But he used Tuesday’s press conference to criticize Connecticut’s Democratic majority for being too soft on crime and undocumented immigration.

Harding, R-Brookfield, specifically criticized the state’s Trust Act, which has been amended in recent years to prohibit police, correctional officers and other state employees from turning over people to ICE unless they’ve been convicted of more serious crimes in the state.

“The Judicial Branch made this decision in consultation with ICE in an attempt to ensure the safety and security of courthouses and those that visit them,” Harding said. “That’s their right to do, but this action highlights multiple glaring issues here in Connecticut.”

Maintaining order and open access to the courts is something that federal judges in Connecticut are also worried about as the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration arrests nationwide.

In August, Michael Shea, the chief judge for the U.S. District Court of Connecticut, issued an order limiting where and when ICE agents could make arrests inside the three federal courthouses in the state.

Connecticut is not the first state that has sought to regulate ICE activity in local courthouses, either through new rules or legislation.

Court officials in Oregon and New Jersey previously issued directives and orders seeking to limit ICE arrests in state courthouses during Trump’s first term in 2019.

Meanwhile, other Democratic-led states like Colorado and New York have also passed laws seeking to ban ICE arrests in state courthouses — though Trump’s Justice Department is now challenging some of those laws in federal court.

Stafstrom said Tuesday that the General Assembly should consider enacting similar legislation in Connecticut.

The Constitution and its core citizenship concepts will need to be defended by Congress and the American public, too.","Constitution Day, observed each year on September 17th, commemorates the day in 1787 when the delegates to the Constitutional Convention gathered in Philadelphia to sign what would become the original articles of our national charter. Of course, when we celebrate the Constitution today, we celebrate not only the document signed centuries ago, but the whole Constitution, which has been amended numerous times by We the People, making our nation incrementally freer, fairer, and more inclusive. Constitution Day’s full name, according to statute, is “Constitution Day and Citizenship Day.” This year, both the Constitution and core concepts of citizenship are under attack, and they deserve our attention and protection more than ever.

Beginning in the first Trump administration, President Trump mused about limiting the Constitution’s birthright citizenship provision through executive order. Then, as now, legal experts have described why such an attempt would be at odds with the Constitution’s text and history. Nonetheless, in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order purporting to limit birthright citizenship to children who have at least one parent who is a citizen or is lawfully admitted for permanent residence. This ignores the Fourteenth Amendment text, which states “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” As the Constitutional Accountability Center, for which I work, explained in an amicus brief we filed on behalf of an ideologically diverse group of constitutional law and immigration scholars in litigation challenging the Trump executive order, the Fourteenth Amendment’s enactment history makes clear that the Amendment means exactly what it says. Indeed, its Framers were well aware that the provision would grant citizenship to children whose parents were not citizens, including parents who were either in the country unlawfully or who did not intend to stay permanently.

While the Trump administration has attempted to whittle away citizenship in one context, it has fallen over itself to deploy citizenship to try to limit other constitutional rights. For instance, in the context of mass deportation plans, multiple Trump administration officials have opined that unlike citizens, noncitizen immigrants are not entitled to constitutional due process. The Constitution says no such thing. The Due Process Clause of both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments does not limit its protections to citizens, saying that “no person” shall “be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Even one of the most widely criticized shadow docket rulings from the Supreme Court—issued in the context of removals pursuant to President Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act—took care to note that every detainee has a right to meaningful notice and the chance to challenge one’s detention and removal before a judge.

President Trump has also tried to graft citizenship onto unrelated constitutional provisions, such as those relating to the Census. The first Trump Administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census was halted in 2019 by the Supreme Court. Now Trump has announced that he has instructed the Commerce Department to work on a new Census, and has reportedly suggested in social media posts that the new Census would exclude undocumented immigrants. It’s unclear whether this would be for the 2030 Census or some unprecedented, irregularly timed Census to take place before 2030. What is clear is that any such alteration would fly in the face the Fourteenth Amendment requirement that the Census count the “whole number of persons in each state.” Equally clear is the Constitution’s assignment of significant Census decisions to Congress, not the President, something that even some high-ranking Trump administration officials have conceded.

And of course, these are only a few examples. Needless to say, if you care about the Constitution and citizenship, you should be concerned. Constitutional concepts of citizenship lie at the heart of who is considered part of the American family and how they participate in our democracy. When the Constitution’s text and its embedded concepts of citizenship aren’t protected, all Americans—irrespective of immigration status, citizenship, or political party affiliation—are harmed. The lower courts have had a strong record of halting some of the most egregious examples of unconstitutional Trump administration policies. This effort in the courts is essential, but it might not be sufficient. The Constitution and its core citizenship concepts will need to be defended by Congress and the American public, too. Our future depends on it.",https://www.acslaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Birthright-.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 13:57:31.885387
,Policy,2025-09-17 04:51:11+00:00,www.nytimes.com,"Trump Administration Live Updates: Democrats Oppose Stopgap Bill, Raising Odds of a Shutdown","Tony Romm, Glenn Thrush, Alan Feuer, Zach Montague, Christina Jewett, Benjamin Mueller, Campbell Robertson, Michael Gold, Mattathias Schwartz, Robert Jimison",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/16/us/trump-news,"To carry out that agenda, Mr. Trump last month nominated E.J.
That would make them eligible for harsher sentences and adult prisons — a policy change Mr. Trump has called for.
The move blindsided and infuriated House Democrats, who had voted unanimously against the bill.
When Jonathan Karl of ABC News asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Bondi’s hate speech comments, he went after Mr. Karl.
“We’ll probably go after people like you,” Mr. Trump said, “because you treat me so unfairly — it’s hate.”","“Economic data must be free from partisan influence,” she said.

Ms. McEntarfer voiced her fears during a speech at Bard College in New York, her alma mater, more than one month after Mr. Trump dismissed her over his widely condemned claims that federal hiring data had been “rigged.” The report that month showed the economy had added about 250,000 fewer jobs this summer than the government first estimated, a revision that the president claimed — without evidence — had been manipulated to hurt him politically.

Ms. McEntarfer on Tuesday steered clear of addressing Mr. Trump directly, saying at one point she generally did not want to “speculate on what the plan is or the intentions of the administration are.”

But she repeatedly emphasized the risk in allowing politics to infect the work of B.L.S., whose reports inform policymakers, investors, businesses and others that require dependable economic data to make decisions. And she called attention to what she described as steep and persistent shortfalls in the agency’s staff and budget. Those gaps, she said, further complicated Washington’s task to reliably track the labor market, the ebb and flow of prices, and the nation’s overall growth.

“Markets have to trust the data are not manipulated,” Ms. McEntarfer added. “Firing your chief statisticians for releasing data you do not like, it has serious economic consequences. The list of countries that have gone down this route, it’s not a good list.”

Ms. McEntarfer drew a parallel between her work at B.L.S. and “live traffic updates,” the absence of which could make it harder for policymakers to address strains on workers, businesses and consumers.

“The reason my firing was big news is because nobody thinks it’s going be good for our economy if we start messing with those traffic lights,” she said.

Ms. McEntarfer’s comments essentially served as a counterpoint to the steady stream of attacks from the White House. At a moment when the economy is starting to show real signs of strain under Mr. Trump, the president and his top aides have continued to discredit the government’s top labor statistics agency as unreliable, arguing it is in need of a substantial shake-up.

To carry out that agenda, Mr. Trump last month nominated E.J. Antoni, a conservative economist at the Heritage Foundation, to serve as the next B.L.S. commissioner. Mr. Antoni, whose appointment requires Senate confirmation, previously criticized the bureau, its methods and reports, which led some economists to question whether he could be politically neutral in the role.

Ms. McEntarfer, who was confirmed by the Senate in 2024 on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, did not address her replacement in the speech, even as she unfurled new details about her sudden ouster in early August.

She said that the day before the jobs report was made public, the labor statistics office had briefed administration officials about the substantial jobs revision. That briefing is a customary practice. She said that she did not get a sense at the time that the White House might fire her.

Later, in a briefing with top officials at the Labor Department, Ms. McEntarfer said she described the steep revision as an “unusual event,” but not “an unprecedented one.” She said it “typically occurs when the labor market slows suddenly,” citing downward pressure on hiring, given the uncertainty around the president’s tariffs and immigration policies.

Hours after the revisions were made public, Mr. Trump said he was firing Ms. McEntarfer. She said she first learned of her firing after receiving an email about it from a reporter, and initially did not believe it, given the president’s attacks on other government officials. But she soon noticed a “short note” had arrived in her email inbox from the presidential personnel office, which informed her of the dismissal.

Ms. McEntarfer said that she had left behind a statistics office that had struggled mightily at times in the face of chronic underfunding and, more recently, the cuts demanded by the Department of Government Efficiency, the team of young aides led at the time by tech mogul Elon Musk. She said that the push by D.O.G.E. to reduce the federal work force resulted in a 20 percent reduction in staff at B.L.S., compared to the start of the year.

“We were scrambling, trying to figure out operationally how we were going to get through the next week,” she said, as she described a period earlier this year when she was “praying nothing terrible was going to happen” to the agency’s data.

In doing so, Ms. McEntarfer sketched out her view of the office and its role, describing its ability to produce reliable data as essential to helping policymakers avert recessions, control inflation and stimulate growth.

She later said of the political dynamic: “The best hope is that interference stops with firing me.”

Mr. Patel, who has embraced President Trump’s attack-the-attacker style with bellowing brio, had no intention of being lured into traps set by Democrats, or conceding major error, or sometimes even furnishing answers to their informational queries.

He was there to brawl, perhaps to convince Mr. Trump he still had the attributes that endeared him to the president’s inner circle in the first place — that unique hybrid of public defiance and personal compliance demanded of those placed in positions of power.

“I’m not going anywhere!” Mr. Patel declared near the start of the periodic F.B.I. oversight hearing before the committee, presaging more than four hours of attack and counterattack in a half-full marble-lined committee room.

The Republicans on the panel rallied to his side, offering at most only faint chiding that masked the serious grievances against Mr. Patel of some Trump allies since Mr. Kirk’s death. They defused questions for now over whether a larger rebellion against Mr. Patel might be brewing, allowing the proceedings to fall into a familiar partisan groove that played to the F.B.I. director’s pugilistic instincts.

As much as Democratic senators like Cory Booker of New Jersey and Adam B. Schiff of California tried to match his tone and volume, Mr. Patel refused to cede much ground. He has never been a decorous congressional guest, but on Tuesday, he abandoned any pretense of courtesy beyond calling his targets “senator.”

His targets were not much more polite.

“Here’s the thing, Mr. Patel: I think you’re not going to be around long,” Mr. Booker said, taunting the director about reports that senior White House officials were unsatisfied with his job performance. “Because as much as you supplicate yourself to the will of Donald Trump and not the Constitution of the United States of America, Donald Trump has shown us in his first term and in this term, he is not loyal to people like you.”

Mr. Patel glared at Mr. Booker and barked that the senator was an “embarrassment,” and the two began shouting over each other.

Mr. Schiff called Mr. Patel an “internet troll” during a scrap over the Epstein files.

The witness quickly responded by calling the senator “an utter coward,” a “political buffoon” and “the biggest fraud to ever sit in the United States Senate.”

In a lawsuit filed last week, former top bureau officials described Mr. Patel as an out-of-his-depth neophyte, a cartoonish figure who cared more about handing out oversized challenge coins and hyping everything he did on social media than digging into investigations.

But he seemed to gain his footing in the committee room, with Republicans remaining in line and Democrats lining up to wrestle. He has a second chance to spar on Wednesday, when he is set to appear before the House Judiciary Committee.

Whether his performance before Congress matters is another story.

Even if Mr. Patel’s job is safe, as Mr. Trump has said, the White House recently installed Andrew Bailey, the former Missouri attorney general and a more experienced law enforcement official, to help run the day-to-day operations of the bureau.

All of the conflict on Tuesday obscured the fact that Mr. Patel either flatly refused, or evaded, tough questions about the state of the bureau’s work force, particularly the loss of up to 5,000 experienced field agents driven out through purges or retirements.

He forcefully denied that those losses had affected the F.B.I.’s effectiveness, and also pushed back on claims, made in the lawsuit, that he had fired agents under orders from the White House as part of a retribution campaign against the teams that investigated Mr. Trump, his allies and Jan. 6 rioters.

Mr. Patel’s fluent, albeit unabashedly combative, appearance on Capitol Hill was a stark reminder that he has always been relatively comfortable in the arena of political warfare, a role he played in his guise as a congressional staff member and as a podcaster after he left government service.

But his agility in front of the committee stood in contrast to his halting performance during the recent manhunt for Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man arrested in the Kirk shooting. Hours after the killing last week, Mr. Patel suggested that the F.B.I. had taken a main suspect into custody, only to admit that the person had been released a few hours later.

When Mr. Robinson finally turned himself in to local law enforcement, Mr. Patel spoke at a news conference in Utah. He opened by thanking Mr. Trump — which struck current and former law enforcement officials as inappropriate — and finished with a bizarre vow to see Mr. Kirk, a Christian and charismatic Trump ally Mr. Patel considered a friend, in the pagan afterlife of Valhalla.

At Tuesday’s hearing, Mr. Patel defended his actions during the Kirk investigation, reiterating claims that he had personally instructed agents to conduct operations often regarded as routine, including the distribution of photos of the gunman and the gathering of evidence.

That did not stop Democrats from attacking his handling of the investigation.

In perhaps the sharpest blow, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the committee, said Mr. Patel had violated a cardinal rule of criminal inquiries: Do not upstage your subordinates on the ground.

“Shut up and let the professionals do their job,” Mr. Durbin said.

A close adviser to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Dr. Means rose to prominence with a biography that included a successful academic career toward becoming a surgeon. She has said she left the medical profession out of frustration, asserting in public appearances and in her book that the health care system puts patients on a treadmill of surgeries and treatments without addressing the root cause of their illnesses.

In a newsletter and in social media channels, the financial documents show, she has monetized her worldview through payments from companies that sell supplements, home-delivered meals and other products. Dr. Means shares Mr. Kennedy’s critical stance toward the medical establishment and appreciation for supplements and other wellness items, even though they tend to undergo little federal scrutiny for effectiveness.

Dr. Means reported newsletter sponsorship payments over an 18-month period of $46,000 from Pique, a maker of tea, supplements and elixirs; $27,000 from Pendulum Therapeutics, Inc., which makes probiotic products; about $27,000 from Energybits, an algae supplement company; and about $16,000 from Florasophy, a fiber supplement company. In several such deals, Dr. Means also was paid fees for sales of products promoted in her newsletter.

Dr. Means reported more than $100,000 and less than $1 million in royalties for her book, “Good Energy: The Surprising Connection Between Metabolism and Limitless Health.” The government forms generally require people to disclose fees or income within a range, which can be broad.

She also received about $79,000 in newsletter sponsorship and $55,000 in book tour fees from Amazentis, a Swiss company that said it was working on therapies aimed at “modulating mitochondrial function.”

Though a date has not yet been set for her confirmation hearing before the Senate health committee, Dr. Means may face heated questioning, given the increasing bipartisan criticism of Mr. Kennedy’s actions undercutting vaccine policy.

In a newsletter outlining her “wish list” just before the election, Dr. Means called for reforming the 1986 law that protects vaccine makers from civil liability. The law enacted the provisions for a special court system that was meant to quickly compensate families after a vaccine injury. In that post, she criticized the current list of vaccines that tend to be given to young children.

“There is growing evidence that the total burden of the current extreme and growing vaccine schedule is causing health declines in vulnerable children,” she wrote. “This needs to be investigated.”

Child health experts say that the recommended immunizations have copious safety data and that curtailing the vaccine schedule could trigger outbreaks of deadly infectious diseases.

In her disclosure records, Dr. Means said she would divest of stock valued at between $15,000 and $50,000 in Altria Group, which owns the Marlboro cigarette brand, and of stock in the same value range in Philip Morris International, which markets the IQOS heated tobacco products and Zyn nicotine pouches. A spokesman from the Department of Health and Human Services said the tobacco stocks were purchased by her husband before they were married.

The surgeon general’s office plays a prominent role in tobacco policy through its annual reports on smoking and tobacco use. On the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast last year, Dr. Means and her brother, Calley Means, called out the tobacco company Philip Morris, saying that its tactics were adopted for food formulations that led people to become addicted to ultraprocessed snacks.

Dr. Means’s ethics agreement said that she would also resign her position and sell her stock in Levels Health, a company that she has said she co-founded. Levels provides continuous glucose monitors to people so they can track how their diet affects blood sugar levels. The monitors link to a company app that gives people information about their health.

The program is not aimed at the monitor’s traditional customers who have diabetes. Rather, the company suggests that the service will help people eat nutritious food and maintain steady levels of blood sugar. The company charges about $184 per month for a glucose monitor that can link to the app.

Dr. Means also pledged to divest her financial interest of $15,000 to $50,000 in True Medicine, a wellness company co-founded by her brother, a close adviser to Mr. Kennedy and an influential figure in the Make America Healthy Again movement.

A special government employee, Mr. Means has not had to disclose the details of his own financial holdings or how they touch on government health policies. True Medicine helps people buy items like red-light masks, Peloton bikes and $8,000 saunas with money not subject to federal income taxes. The company could benefit from Trump administration plans to make more people eligible for such spending.

Dr. Means also said she would divest her interest in Function Health, a company owned by Dr. Mark Hyman, a wellness influencer who is also close to Mr. Kennedy. Dr. Means reported drawing nearly $60,000 in income from the company for newsletter sponsorship and partnership fees. Function sells subscriptions for blood tests that inform users about a range of health measures, including lead levels and sexually transmitted diseases.

According to the filings, her spouse is the founder and chief executive of MagicLinks, an influencer marketing firm that connects people to companies that will pay them for endorsing products. In her ethics filing, she said she would not participate in any matter that could have an effect on the company’s finances.

The surgeon general’s role has been empty since the departure of Dr. Vivek Murthy, who held the post under former President Joseph Biden. Dr. Murthy had previously been paid millions of dollars as a consultant to major companies, including Carnival Corporation’s cruise lines, on Covid policy.

Dr. Means was chosen after Mr. Trump withdrew the nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, a New York medical director and a former Fox News contributor who also sold vitamins online.

Dr. Means received her medical degree from Stanford University and then trained as an otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeon. She dropped out of her surgical residency in 2018, turning to entrepreneurial work, founding Levels and promoting dozens of health and wellness products.

One measure would lower the age at which children accused of certain violent crimes can be charged as adults, from 16 years old to 14 years old. That would make them eligible for harsher sentences and adult prisons — a policy change Mr. Trump has called for. Several states have similar provisions, and eight Democrats joined Republicans to pass the measure by a 225-to-203 vote.

The other would roll back a local law that allows judges to give more lenient sentences to people younger than 25, by lowering the limit on that law to 18 years old and requiring judges to adhere to mandatory minimums for youth offenders. Dozens of Democrats joined Republicans to pass the bill, 240 to 179.

Later this week, the House is expected to vote on two other measures that would remove restrictions on vehicular police chases and give the White House a freer hand when choosing judicial picks for D.C. courts, by abolishing a local commission to recommend them.

All four bills may face challenges in the Senate, where they will require the support of Democrats in order to bypass a filibuster and be considered for a vote. But Republicans have long turned to crime as a wedge issue, particularly during campaign season, and Democrats have at times joined them in imposing the federal government’s will on D.C.

The House’s package of bills also comes as Mr. Trump undertakes a federal crackdown on crime in Washington that appears to be the largest infringement on the city’s autonomy since the 1973 law that gave the District’s residents limited authority over their own affairs.

Even as violent crime in Washington has steadily declined over the last year, Mr. Trump last month deployed thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of federal law enforcement officers to the city. On Monday, he signed an order to authorize sending the National Guard to Memphis, and he has suggested similar surges in Chicago and New Orleans.

But unlike other cities, the District of Columbia is subject to significant federal oversight that allows Congress to review its legislation and rewrite its laws. The roughly 700,000 residents of the District, many of whom are Black, do not have a vote in Congress but are represented by a nonvoting House delegate, Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, who can serve on committees but cannot vote on bills.

Republicans have proven eager to exercise their authority in recent years. On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee, the panel that oversees Washington, will question D.C.’s mayor, attorney general and city council chairman over the city’s crime policies.

The panel’s Republican chairman, Representative James R. Comer of Kentucky, framed the bills passed on Tuesday as a necessary corrective to “D.C.’s soft-on-crime policies” that he said had “failed to keep D.C. residents and visitors safe.”

But Democrats framed the legislation as aggressive interference by lawmakers who did not represent the city.

“Local leaders should be empowered to solve local problems without Congress interfering,” Representative Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said on the House floor. “I have said this many times: If Donald Trump wants to run D.C., he should resign as president and run for mayor.”

The measures that the House passed on Tuesday both target youth crime, a frequent focus of Mr. Trump and his allies as they deliver broadsides against Democrats in Washington and elsewhere for policies that they describe as overly lax. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney in D.C., has frequently complained about laws that limit the prosecution of young offenders.

Local officials in Washington have long been focused on crimes committed by teenagers, and the issue became particularly resonant amid a spate of carjackings during the coronavirus pandemic.

But lawmakers in the city have also tried to balance calls for a tougher stance on juvenile crime with an effort to address the socioeconomic problems that many experts say are the root causes of youth crime.

It came after Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, tried to surprise Republicans with a bid to block the president’s tariffs on Brazil. His measure was swiftly defeated, and within hours, G.O.P. leaders moved to head off a similar vote. That effort, tucked into a routine procedural measure, passed on Tuesday afternoon almost entirely along party lines.

It was the latest instance in which House Republicans, many of whom have spent much of their career opposing tariffs as a matter of principle, have given up their power over trade. In March, Republicans pushed through a similar procedural measure that made it impossible for lawmakers to use a law governing presidential emergencies to challenge Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. The next month, they did so again. On Tuesday, they attached one to a measure needed to debate a series of bills to impose stricter criminal penalties in the District of Columbia.

In all three cases, Republicans have used an arcane legislative maneuver to avoid tariff votes. It involves declaring the calendar frozen until a given date, which effectively renders useless a law that allows any lawmaker to insist on a quick floor vote on a proposal to end an emergency declared by the president.

Republicans defended their strategy to short-circuit any such vote, making the case that Mr. Trump’s trade policies were working.

“Access to the American economy is a privilege, not a right,” said Representative Nick Langworthy, Republican of New York. “President Trump is using tariffs as leverage to reduce reciprocal barriers, safeguard our national security and level the global playing field for American producers and manufacturers. And it’s working.”

But some Republicans clearly were uncomfortable with the move. A handful of them briefly revolted over the measure and voted no, bringing the chamber to a standstill as leaders rushed to corral the votes necessary to pass it.

Among those who initially opposed the measure but were persuaded to change their votes was Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, who said he initially did so “because Article One of the Constitution grants Congress authority over tariffs, and tariffs are a tax on American consumers.”

But he said his decision to change his vote came after receiving commitments from Republican leaders over how the chamber would handle tariff policy going forward, including a new working group on tariffs and changes to an upcoming vote on the matter.

Democrats have repeatedly denounced the drive by Republicans to avoid tariff votes, pointing to it as another instance in which they are willingly ceding authority to the White House.

“I’m continually disappointed in some of my colleagues who so often talk about the importance of Congress reasserting its role in trade, but when the cards are down, give Trump unchecked power to impose tariffs for whatever reason he wants without so much as a vote in Congress,” said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee.

Representative Kevin Kiley of California, one of the three Republicans who joined all Democrats in opposing the measure, criticized the move as an abdication of congressional authority.

“If we’re saying that Congress is not going to be able to assert itself on this issue, that in my view is a problem,” Mr. Kiley said after the vote. Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana also voted no.

Representatives Jay Obernolte and Tom McClintock, both California Republicans, initially voted no but flipped to support the measure.

Democrats in the Senate, where the minority has more tools at its disposal, have made more headway in forcing tariff votes through the national emergencies statute. Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, intends to bring forward two resolutions in the coming days to terminate the emergencies Mr. Trump declared to justify tariffs on Canada and Brazil.

He is joined by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, one of a handful of Republicans who have broken with their party to support previous Democratic-led attempts to challenge Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

“I have been opposed to rule by emergency, no matter who the president is, Republican or Democrat,” Mr. Paul said in an interview.

Mr. Paul says his Republican colleagues had “faded into the woodwork” on trade, and that they may feel differently under a Democratic administration. “I think it’s good to be consistent no matter who the president is,” he added.

“It is time to end President Trump’s senseless trade war with Canada, one of our closest allies and top trading partners,” Mr. Kaine said. “It is our responsibility as Congress to step in when the president abuses their authority.”

Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, another backer of the resolutions, warned that Mr. Trump’s tariffs were having an outsize influence on her home state’s economy.

“The president cannot abuse his power to continue an unjustified trade war with one of our strongest allies,” she said. “Canada is Minnesota’s top trading partner, but the president’s tariffs are jeopardizing that relationship, and adding costs for Minnesota families.”

In April, four Republicans — Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Mr. Paul — joined Democrats in voting to terminate the emergency declaration underpinning Canadian tariffs.

That measure passed the Senate but stalled in the House, where Republican leaders have declined to bring it up and changes like the one made on Tuesday give rank-and-file lawmakers no ability to force the matter to the floor.

Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday released a temporary spending bill that would keep funding flowing largely at current levels until just before Thanksgiving, while boosting spending on security for federal officials. He is aiming for a vote on the House floor by Friday.

That set up a replay of a scuffle over government funding that played out in March. Senate Democrats at the time allowed Republicans’ stopgap measure to move forward, arguing that blocking it would only cede more power to Mr. Trump to steer federal funding however he saw fit during a shutdown.

The move blindsided and infuriated House Democrats, who had voted unanimously against the bill. It also drew a fierce backlash from the party base, which had demanded lawmakers shut down Mr. Trump’s government.

Increasingly angry at the Trump administration’s efforts to trample congressional spending power and facing a base that is spoiling for a spending fight, top Democrats appear determined not to go down the same road again.

Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, both minority leaders, said their members would not support a spending bill that extends current funding levels unless it also includes concessions from Republicans on health care. They have not yet specified what those might be.

In a joint statement on Tuesday, they suggested that they were demanding that Republicans add to the package an extension of Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.

“The House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming health care crisis,” Mr. Schumer and Mr. Jeffries said. “At a time when families are already being squeezed by higher costs, Republicans refuse to stop Americans from facing double-digit hikes in their health insurance premiums.”

While Republicans have signaled a growing openness to extending the subsidies, Mr. Johnson said on Tuesday that there was “zero chance” he would do so as part of the temporary spending legislation.

“Predictably and unfortunately, there are some Democrats who are openly pining for a government shutdown,” Mr. Johnson said.

Democrats are facing a dilemma in the spending showdown, still stung by their voters’ fury earlier this year at the decision to go along with Mr. Trump’s funding package. At the same time, some are wary of wading into a politically unpopular shutdown that would be difficult to reverse, and for which they could shoulder considerable blame.

As early as last month, as he held town halls in his San Diego district, Representative Mike Levin was already fielding questions from constituents about how his party planned to approach the looming government funding deadline.

The message, he said, was that his constituents were looking for an acknowledgment that “what we’re seeing from the administration is fundamentally different.”

Mr. Levin, who sits on the Appropriations Committee tasked with doling out federal dollars, had himself been frustrated for months over Mr. Trump’s efforts to unilaterally dictate government spending in defiance of Congress. He voted against the stopgap bill in March and believed Senate Democrats should have done the same.

“I was advocating for us to stand up for our values,” he recalled. “I thought that there’s a time for us to stand and fight against what we know to be wrong. A lot has happened since then, but the pattern of behavior has only gotten worse.”

Top of mind for Democrats is the White House’s use of a rare maneuver to skirt a vote and cancel nearly $5 billion in foreign aid funding that lawmakers had already approved. Weeks before that, Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, had infuriated Democrats when he said that the appropriations process “has to be less bipartisan.”

“How are we Democrats supposed to trust any funding deal going forward?” Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, wrote in an op-ed in The Bulwark. “Why would anyone bother negotiating a deal that could be undone in a fit of political convenience?”

Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, acidly noted Mr. Trump’s comments suggesting Republicans did not need to negotiate with Democrats.

“Shutdowns are terrible and they should be avoided,” said Mr. Schatz, one of the Democrats who in March joined Mr. Schumer in helping Republicans bring their stopgap spending bill to a vote. “Donald Trump may or may not know that the only way to avoid a shutdown is to work with both parties. And yesterday morning, he said, ‘I don’t need to deal with the Democrats.’ And so, godspeed.”

Mr. Schumer, who bore the brunt of the backlash in March when he corralled enough Democrats to let the government stay open, has experienced firsthand the perils of either choice currently before members of his party.

In recent days, Senate Republican leaders have resurrected the term “Schumer Shutdown,” referencing a three-day lapse in funding in January 2018, after Mr. Schumer led Democrats in blocking a spending bill. They did so after Republicans refused to cut a deal to provide permanent protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.

But with Republicans hammering him by name for the shutdown, Mr. Schumer quickly retreated, cutting a swift deal to reopen the government after winning a commitment from the G.O.P. to hold a vote on protecting those immigrants, known as Dreamers. Ultimately, votes on three immigration-related proposals were scheduled, and the Senate rejected all three.

This year, Mr. Schumer took a different tack, arguing in March that Republicans’ stopgap spending bill was “a terrible option,” but that “allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

“There is no off-ramp,” for a government shutdown, Mr. Schumer said at the time. “The off-ramp is in the hands of Donald Trump and Elon Musk and DOGE. We could be in a shutdown for six months or nine months.”

The backlash was swift and furious.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, declined to rule out challenging Mr. Schumer in a primary, saying there was “a deep sense of outrage and betrayal” about his decision. Protesters gathered outside his Brooklyn home. Indivisible, the progressive activist group, called on him to step down.

This time, Mr. Schumer said on Tuesday, “the situation is much different.”

“Republicans are in a much weaker position now than they were then; the B.B.B. bill, which they have passed, is highly unpopular with the American people,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump’s domestic policy legislation that was signed into law in July. “Democrats are unified. We have been strong on the same message for a very long time, which is: We need to help the American people lower their costs, particularly on health care.”

Megan Mineiro contributed reporting.

Filed to Congress by the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, the report said at least 30 of the 327 children the government cleared for imminent removal had “indicators of being a victim of child abuse” in Guatemala, based on the government’s own findings.

The children, who came to the United States as unaccompanied minors in recent years and have been living in shelters or foster care under government supervision, were hastily targeted by the Trump administration over the Labor Day weekend. Upon learning that the children were being loaded onto flights to be sent back, lawyers from the National Immigration Law Center sued to block the removals and a federal judge ordered the government to halt until the case could be argued.

The Trump administration has said it was exercising an authority to reunify unaccompanied children with their parents abroad, claiming that it was acting at the behest of the children’s families and with the children's well-being in mind.

But the report on Tuesday was the second time that notion had been called into question.

Ms. Salazar filed the declaration in her capacity as the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that maintains custody over minors who enter the United States alone.

It stated that her office had reviewed the cases of all 327 children using a “best interests framework” that included considerations such as whether her office was “assured the child will not be trafficked upon their return” or whether the children had been known to have faced abuse in the past. It added that the government had completed the review and deemed all the children eligible to be sent back to Guatemala, where most or all have parents residing.

But the whistle-blower report countered that the available data about the children made it clear that around 10 percent of them, and possibly more, should not have been eligible under the government’s criteria.

The report stated that as recently as Sept. 5 — the day before the government filed Ms. Salazar’s declaration in federal court — analyses run by her office had returned results showing that many of the children faced dangers in Guatemala or had expressed fear of being sent there. It added that Ms. Salazar “knew or should have known of the inaccuracies in her declaration,” based on the data on hand.

“These whistle-blowers’ disclosures evidence violations of law, rules and regulations, abuse of authority and substantial and specific danger to public health and safety on a matter of urgent, and potentially life and death, importance,” it said.

Lawyers for the Government Accountability Project sent the report on Tuesday to Senators John Cornyn of Texas and Alex Padilla of California, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Border Security and Immigration subcommittee.

“The allegations in the whistle-blower complaint are shocking,” Mr. Padilla said in a statement.

“Sending children back into danger is a betrayal of our moral and legal obligations,” Mr. Padilla’s statement said. “And we’re going to hold them accountable for endangering children.”

A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

After the children were nearly flown out over the Labor Day weekend, a judge intervened on an emergency basis, halting the government’s effort. The case was then transferred to Judge Kelly to manage the rest of the proceedings, and he extended the order blocking the government from making further attempts to remove the children until 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.

During a hearing last week to determine how to proceed, Judge Kelly grew skeptical about the government’s position, pressing for details about its claim that the children’s parents had asked for their return.

He homed in on a memo prepared by the Guatemalan government, which was filed as evidence in the case, in which officials tried to contact and survey the children’s parents. Of those they were able to track down, none had asked for their children’s return, with more than half explicitly refusing to authorize any attempt to have their children forced out of the United States.

Asked by Judge Kelly to reconcile the competing claims, a lawyer from the Justice Department conceded that the government had no reason to believe that the parents had asked to have their children returned.

It is not clear under what authority Ms. Bondi planned to bring “hate speech” cases when the First Amendment provides sweeping protections for free speech that does not directly incite violence. She seemed to back away from a broad interpretation of her remarks on Tuesday morning, writing on social media that “hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected by the First Amendment. It’s a crime.”

Ms. Bondi was roundly pilloried for her initial remarks by a slew of conservative pundits, authors and lawmakers on social media within minutes of delivering them on two right-wing media outlets, after avoiding expansive public discussion beyond expressing outrage over the killing and support for Mr. Kirk’s young family.

Many of her critics pointed to a May 2024 social media post by Mr. Kirk himself, laying out clearly that while “ugly speech,” “gross speech” and “evil speech” existed, there was no such thing as hate speech under the Constitution.

“Someone needs to explain to Ms. Bondi that so-called ‘hate speech,’ repulsive though it may be, is protected by the First Amendment,” Brit Hume, the longtime Fox News host, wrote on social media.

“She should know this,” he added.

Ms. Bondi’s comments came as other top Trump administration officials — among them Vice President JD Vance — have called on ordinary people across the country to seek vengeance against those who have criticized Mr. Kirk by calling their employers in an effort to get them fired.

The naming-and-shaming campaign has led to countless people from various walks of life — teachers, medical personnel and members of the armed forces — being dismissed from their jobs or placed on suspension.

While some Republicans have called out violence committed by people on both sides of the nation’s left-right binary, the president and many in his administration have blamed the violence solely on their opponents.

In an interview on Fox News’s “Hannity” late Monday, Ms. Bondi suggested that she might direct the Justice Department’s civil rights division to “prosecute” businesses if they turned away customers who wanted to print pictures of Mr. Kirk for memorial vigils, citing the case of an Office Depot employee in Michigan who was fired for rejecting such an order.

“Businesses cannot discriminate,” she told Mr. Hannity, saying she had referred the Office Depot case to Harmeet K. Dhillon, the head of the civil rights division.

“We can prosecute you for that,” she added.

Ms. Bondi’s assertion that the Justice Department might seek charges against a business for refusing to serve customers for political reasons could run afoul of a Supreme Court decision that barred state authorities from punishing a Colorado baker for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.

A senior Justice Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to relay internal discussions, said Ms. Bondi’s comments, while expansive, were intended to address only the Office Depot incident and did not signal a broader effort to go after noncompliant businesses.

Earlier on Monday, in a podcast interview with Katie Miller, the wife of the top Trump adviser Stephen Miller, Ms. Bondi suggested there might be limits on anti-Kirk speech after his killing during an informal debate with supporters, and critics, at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.

“There’s free speech and then there’s hate speech, and there is no place, especially now, especially after what happened to Charlie, in our society” for hate speech, Ms. Bondi said.

Ms. Miller followed up by asking if Ms. Bondi would like to see “more law enforcement going after these groups who are using hate speech and putting cuffs on people.”

The attorney general responded by saying, “We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech — and that’s across the aisle.”

“Get rid of her. Today. This is insane,” wrote Matt Walsh, a right-wing influencer with nearly four million followers on X. “Conservatives have fought for decades for the right to refuse service to anyone. We won that fight. Now Pam Bondi wants to roll it all back for no reason.”

Despite the cascade of criticism, President Trump seemed to defend Ms. Bondi’s remarks in comments to reporters, twisting and personalizing them into a self-serving attack on the media.

When Jonathan Karl of ABC News asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Bondi’s hate speech comments, he went after Mr. Karl.

“We’ll probably go after people like you,” Mr. Trump said, “because you treat me so unfairly — it’s hate.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/16/multimedia/16trump-news-promo830p-fcbg/16trump-news-promo830p-fcbg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 02:59:16.736531

But on Tuesday, London’s High Court granted him an interim injunction preventing his removal, pending a full hearing of his trafficking claim.

Judge Clive Sheldon ruled: “I am going to grant a short period of interim relief. The status quo is that the claimant is currently in this country and has not been removed.

“So, I make an order that the claimant should not be removed tomorrow at 9am, but that this matter should come back to this court as soon as is reasonably practical in light of the further representations that the claimant … will make on his trafficking decision.”

“The removal takes place against the backdrop of the recently signed agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the French Republic.

“It seems to me there is a serious issue to be tried with respect to the trafficking claim and whether or not the Secretary of State has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner.”

The case follows a decision by the UK’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM) – which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking – asking the man to submit further evidence in relation to his claim.

The ruling is a setback for Prime Minister Starmer, who has made stopping small boat crossings central to his government’s agenda.

His approach has drawn criticism from rights groups, who accuse him of bowing to pressure from the far right following attacks on asylum-seeker accommodation.

The UK-France scheme is also seen by analysts as part of the government’s attempt to blunt the growing support of the anti-immigrant Reform UK party, which has been climbing in opinion polls.

Under the plan, people arriving in Britain would be returned to France, while the UK would accept an equal number of recognised asylum seekers with family ties in Britain.

Downing Street has defended the plan, calling it a “fair and balanced” system designed to reduce irregular migration.

It insisted it expects deportations to begin “imminently”, with the prime minister’s official spokesman saying “for obvious reasons we’re not going to get into a running commentary on operational details before that”.

“We live here, but we’re Mexican,” he said.
“Long live the immigrant community!” Yescas shouted, to raucous cheering from the crowd.
“Long live the sons and daughters of immigrants!
Long live Arizona!”","While Mexican Independence Day events were cancelled in some cities for fear of federal immigration officials targeting participants, the Arizona Capitol was alive with music and cheering on Monday night in a celebration that emphasized the presence and belonging of immigrants in the country.

The annual celebration occurred against a backdrop of aggressive immigration enforcement. President Donald Trump, who ran on a promise to oversee the largest deportation effort in history, has sought to weaponize multiple federal agencies, including the IRS, the postal service and even the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to identify and expel undocumented Americans. The focus on ramping up deportations has led to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents being swept up in raids.

The majority of immigrants in Arizona are from Mexico. In 2021, there were approximately 481,500 people who were born in Mexico but called Arizona home. And despite a spate of immigration enforcement activity across the Valley, hundreds of people with Mexican heritage refused to miss out on the city’s celebration.

Magdalena Marín, who is from Michoacán, Mexico, has lived in Phoenix for 27 years. Marín said the crowd was smaller than in past years, and while she said she empathized with people who were afraid to attend, she wasn’t nervous — rather, she was determined to celebrate in spite of the ongoing hostility from the federal government.

“We have to raise our voices and show that we aren’t afraid,” she said. “We’re an important resource for this country — they stand to lose without us. We need to show that we’re here and we’re not leaving.”

Nearly 400 people filled the plaza in front of the Capitol building, flanked by the two legislative chambers, many waving Mexican flags or donning them as capes. Others wore Mexican soccer jerseys or traditional guayabera shirts with colorful embroidered flowers. The historic state Capitol building was illuminated in green, white and red lights to represent the Mexican flag.

Some attendees made an effort to honor both their cultural heritage and U.S. residency. Veracruz native Guillermo carried a large flag that combined both countries’ flags into one and swung it in long, back-and-forth arcs, even when he sat down to rest from the 95-degree heat. The 50-year-old, who was uncomfortable sharing his last name, said that he wanted to acknowledge all that the U.S. has given him since he moved to the country 30 years ago. The two countries are a part of him, he said.

“We live here, but we’re Mexican,” he said. “And the United States has given us many opportunities that we’re grateful for.”

Claudia, who similarly declined to share her last name, also carried a half Mexican, half U.S. flag.

“It represents my heart, which is divided in two,” she explained. “It’s the love and respect I have for both countries.”

Local elected officials and advocates expressed support for the state’s immigrants amid the Trump administration’s crackdown. Rep. Mariana Sandoval, D-Goodyear, reflected on the legacies of U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva and former state senator Alfredo Gutierrez, both of whom died this year. In addition to being the sons of immigrants, both championed immigrant rights. Sandoval urged the crowd to look to Grijalva and Gutierrez for proof that it is possible to make a positive difference.

“Hope is stronger than fear,” she said. “And the strength of our community is based on solidarity, perseverance and resilience.”

Karina Ruiz, a longtime advocate for immigrant rights in Arizona who now serves as the first Dreamer in the Mexican Senate, praised the attendees for keeping their culture alive, and called on them to remain optimistic about the future.

“Tonight, as we shout ‘Viva Mexico!’ let’s do so with pride for being the heirs of a history of struggle and with hope for a future in which every Mexican man and woman, regardless of where they live, can be respected,” she said. “That’s important now, because we’re going through a really difficult time. I know, I can see it. I see that my people are afraid, but I also see that we are a community which is brave, dignified and humanist and in the end, that will be recognized.”

Known as El Grito, Mexico’s Independence Day festivities are marked by a series of shouts that emulate the call to arms made during the start of the country’s war for independence. In Phoenix, those shouts are performed by the city’s Mexican consul general, Jorge Mendoza Yescas, who, along with mentioning the leaders of Mexico’s independence movement, also celebrated Arizona’s immigrant community.

“Long live the immigrant community!” Yescas shouted, to raucous cheering from the crowd. “Long live the sons and daughters of immigrants! Long live Arizona!”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-79/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mexican-independence-day-double-flag-1024x6821758065914.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=jmgQoc7A,N,,2025-09-17 11:57:18.299777

“Particularly if the court is not prepared to provide a reasoning on such a fundamental constitutional right in their emergency decision.”","The U.S. Supreme Court last week allowed federal agents to continue stopping people based on race, language and other factors in California amid the same immigration campaign that expanded Tuesday into Chicago — but it did so in an “entirely unexplained” order.

So while the high court seemed to be sending a signal about its position on racial profiling, it’s not clear that the law actually changed with the Sept. 8 order that revolved around “Operation At Large” and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

A National Immigrant Justice Center official told the Chicago Sun-Times his organization is “working from the position that the law is what it is … unless and until the Supreme Court majority provides better guidance.”

For now, the public only has access to writings from Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative who cited “common sense,” and from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal who found the majority’s decision “unconscionably irreconcilable with our Nation’s constitutional guarantees.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote.

The expanded deportation campaign in Chicago was announced Tuesday with a social media post from Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino. U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also appeared to have joined agents in Tuesday’s local operation.

The Supreme Court’s order last week officially blocked an earlier ruling from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong in Los Angeles. She wrote in July that federal authorities could “not rely solely” on four factors, “alone or in combination,” to form reasonable suspicion for an investigative stop during “Operation At Large” in California.

The factors included a person’s “apparent race or ethnicity,” whether they spoke Spanish or English with an accent, the type of work they do, or their presence at a location like a car wash, tow yard or “day laborer pick up site.”

But the Supreme Court stayed the order, pending the outcome of an appeal. The majority gave no explanation. Instead, Kavanaugh issued a 10-page concurring opinion, and Sotomayor offered a 21-page dissent.

Sotomayor was joined by liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Kavanaugh cited multiple reasons he thought the Trump administration might prevail. Among them were technical questions about whether the people who’d sued the federal government had legal standing to do so.

Kavanaugh went on to write that “apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion.” But he said it can be a “relevant factor,” and he cited other circumstances that included the “extremely high number … of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area” who “tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work” and “do not speak much English.”

“Under this court’s precedents, not to mention common sense, those circumstances taken together can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote.

He added that “the interests of individuals who are illegally in the country in avoiding being stopped by law enforcement for questioning is ultimately an interest in evading the law.”

Sotomayor countered that the Trump administration — as well as Kavanaugh — had “all but declared that all Latinos, U.S. citizens or not, who work low wage jobs are fair game to be seized at any time, taken away from work, and held until they provide proof of their legal status to the agents’ satisfaction.”

“Allowing the seizure of any Latino speaking Spanish at a car wash in Los Angeles tramples the constitutional requirement that officers ‘must have a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity,’” Sotomayor wrote.

Much has been made of Kavanaugh’s writing. But Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, noted it amounts to the reasoning of one justice. It’s not clear why other justices decided to block the lower court’s order.

So Fleming, who is based in Chicago, said he doesn’t believe the law has changed.

Fleming also made note of a reference by Kavanaugh to the experiences of U.S. citizens who are stopped and questioned by immigration authorities. Kavanaugh wrote that, if such a person is lawfully in the country, they’ll “be free to go after the brief encounter.”

“The reality on the streets, that I have seen, is that ICE comes with overwhelming force and only figures it out after they have already placed the person under arrest,” Fleming said.

Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law Foundation in California, said attorneys in Chicago might benefit from seeing how things played out in the California courts. “They are aware now of some of those landmines,” he said.

But the Supreme Court’s unwritten order also left many to speculate about the justices’ ultimate intentions. Even Sotomayor noted “it is entirely unexplained” — and part of a growing trend with the court.

“This is another reason why, perhaps, we shouldn’t be getting these kinds of monumental decisions in this sort of rapid-fire way,” Fleming told the Sun-Times. “Particularly if the court is not prepared to provide a reasoning on such a fundamental constitutional right in their emergency decision.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be381ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5239x2991+0+251/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5b%2Fef%2Ffedfa1676b5b858cc2935988a260%2Fsupreme-court.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 01:56:25.402281

The lawsuit comes weeks after the Trump administration fined the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) $1.2bn and froze research funding after accusing the school of allowing antisemitism on campus and other civil rights violations. It was the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze. The administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges, including Harvard, Brown and Columbia.

According to the lawsuit, the Trump administration has made several demands in its proposed settlement offer to UCLA, including giving government access to faculty, student and staff data; releasing admissions and hiring data; ending diversity scholarships; banning overnight demonstrations on university property and cooperating with immigration enforcement.

The Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of the UC system’s president.

The coalition is led by the American Association of University Professors union, or AAUP, and represented by Democracy Forward, a legal group that has brought other lawsuits against the Trump administration over frozen federal funds.

“The blunt cudgel the Trump administration has repeatedly employed in this attack on the independence of institutions of higher education has been the abrupt, unilateral, and unlawful termination of federal research funding on which those institutions and the public interest rely,” the lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco said.

The US Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights has launched dozens of federal investigations also targeting K-12 school districts.

University of California president, James Milliken, said the federal government has also launched investigations and other actions against all of the UC’s 10 campuses but offered no details in a statement on Monday.

“This represents one of the gravest threats to the University of California in our 157-year history,” he said, adding that the university system receives more than $17bn each year in federal support, including nearly $10bn in Medicare and Medicaid funding, and funding that goes toward research and student financial aid.

The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that Trump decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.

This summer, Columbia University agreed to pay more than $200m as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government’s allegations that the school violated federal anti-discrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400m in research grants.

A. from unreasonable, prolonged Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention, the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights filed a habeas petition in the Western District of New York demanding his immediate release. The groups argue that due process does not permit the government to detain noncitizens like J. M. A. indefinitely, without any opportunity to seek bond.

Fleeing political persecution in Cuba for his anti-Communist beliefs, J. M. A. came to the United States in 2023, through the CBPOne App. He applied for lawful permanent residence status under the Cuban Adjustment Act, and received work papers, and a social security number. But in February 2025, J. M. A. was falsely accused of a petty crime—the charges have since been dismissed—and was turned over by local police to ICE, in violation of state law. He has been locked in the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility (Batavia) ever since, despite the fact that he is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community.

“It is unconstitutional and profoundly harmful for ICE to arbitrarily detain J. M. A. in Batavia — a facility long criticized for its cruel, inhumane conditions — for months, with no due process and no end in sight,” said Thomas Munson, Staff Attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “J.M.A. has done exactly what the government asked of him while pursuing a legal pathway to citizenship. For ICE to subject him or anyone else to prolonged detention without any justification is a blatant violation of the constitutional rights afforded to every person in this country.”

“J.M.A. came to the United States to escape an oppressive government in Cuba,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. “He did everything that was asked of him, from filing applications and attending court hearings to securing a job. But instead of granting the humanitarian protection that he is legally entitled to, the U.S. government traded one form of oppression for another. J.M.A.’s prolonged detention isn’t just unlawful and unnecessary – it’s reflective of a broken system that punishes people even when they follow the rules.”

Over the past few months, ICE officers have tracked, arrested, and detained thousands of immigrants in New York’s detention facilities. As of September 8, ICE has trapped over 52,000 immigrants in facilities in New York — and the numbers are only climbing.

Representative Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, filed an amendment to eliminate the measure from his department of state policy provisions act, a bill meant to reform the state department in the Trump administration’s image, after widespread criticism from civil liberties advocates, according to the Intercept.

The original language would have given Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, the power to deny or revoke passports for individuals the department determines have provided “material support” to terrorist organizations. Given similar language employed by the Trump administration in other contexts, it is believed to have been intended to target pro-Palestinian activists specifically.

Since Rubio became secretary of state, he has overseen efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students and deploy an AI-powered “Catch and Revoke” system to target foreign nationals government authorities allege support Hamas. The US also recently announced it will look for “anti-American” views when assessing visa applications.

But the new measure would have significantly escalated these efforts by targeting US citizens. Mast had initially defended the broader legislation, saying it “ensures every dollar and every diplomat puts America First and is accountable to the president’s foreign policy” when the House foreign affairs committee introduced the package last week.

However, a committee spokesperson told the Intercept the committee would not allow the passport revocation amendment to “overshadow the bipartisan effort to restore command and control of the State Department to the Secretary”.

A committee spokesperson did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on Mast’s decision to remove the provision.

Among other provisions, the bill package also includes a proposal to create a new “state sponsor of unlawful or wrongful detention” designation to penalize foreign governments that detain US nationals and require stronger accountability measures in those cases.

The episode unfolded as Rubio wrapped a trip to Israel, Qatar and the UK to discuss Israel’s war in Gaza, ahead of the UN general assembly meeting in New York next week.

PORTSMOUTH – The chair of the Pease Development Authority board said he would have legal counsel explore the idea from former U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey, R-NH, that it has the option to declare Pease a “sanctuary” airport and refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities at Tuesday’s meeting.

Humphrey said the PDA could declare non-cooperation with the federal government in such flights.

“You have the option. I plead with you to use it,” Humphrey said of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation and transfer flights out of Pease International Airport.

Steve Duprey, chair of the PDA board, said he would have legal counsel look into that possibility. “We are not unsympathetic” with Humphrey and the overflow crowd of ICE detention and deportation opponents who came from across the state to its 8:30 a.m. board meeting to demand a halt to future flights.

Opponents of ICE at the meeting said volunteers have watched and filmed from the gate and counted as many 407 people shackled and marched on to airplanes. They have not been given any due process and are being taken away from their families and essential work, the PDA board was told.

They also said PDA has given them access to the tarmac to board planes. Duprey said that is the extent to which the PDA employees have been involved.

Duprey cited a memo which was circulated from the board’s legal counsel which he said explained the board’s legal options to prohibit ICE flights and spoke of counsel’s identification of “limitations” and impacts which could be “extraordinarily severe.”

While he noted public comments that there is a negative economic impact to losing essential workers through ICE detentions, Duprey said there would also be a negative economic impact if the airport was to be closed by federal officials.

Many speakers addressed the moral and ethical concerns of such deportations and questioned the legality of the actions under the Constitution.

A letter from the Council of Churches was read identifying the “deep moral concern,” for the actions which began in July and have now ceased, which some theorized perhaps only temporarily, due to the reopening of Hanscom Field airport in Bedford, Mass.

Whether or not the Trump Administration is watching public activism around these flights is not known but it may not be coincidental that public activism in Massachusetts led to the relocation of flights to Pease.

On Sept. 15, WBUR in Boston reported ICE flights had returned after being halted in July.

WBUR said “Human Rights First, a nonprofit that tracks ICE flights, has logged at least five trips to Hanscom over the past week. The activity comes two months after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it stopped using the airport, located 20 miles northwest of Boston.”

An ICE spokesman confirmed to WBUR that the agency has restarted the flights in Hanscom.

“Flying aliens out of Hanscom allows ICE to move detainees quickly from the intake center at Burlington to a detention center once they have been processed,” the spokesman, James Covington, said in a statement.

The Boston public radio station said The Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Hanscom, has previously said ICE does not need the state agency’s permission to use the facility and does not alert the airport when it lands flights there.

At the monthly meeting of the Pease Development Authority board Tuesday, Kendra Ford said that the last flights out of Pease that volunteers could verify was on Sept. 4.

She said volunteers watched from the airport gate as the shackled individuals boarded a white painted plane with no identifying markers and saw “more than 400 humans torn away” from families and work in flights out of Pease on Aug. 5,7,9,12,14,16,19,21,23,26,28 and September 2 and 4 when there were two flights.

David Holt of Occupy Seacoast said there are economic factors which are one of the Pease board’s most important charges “we are losing people who are doing essential work.”

Both Occupy NH Seacoast, and Mount Washington Valley Resistance, in the Conway area are working on the “ICE Out of Pease” campaign, which is led by the American Friends Service Committee and includes Veterans for Peace, 350NH, NH Youth Movement, Southern New Hampshire Indivisible, Southern NH Democratic Socialists of America, the Kent Street Coalition, and residents from across New England.

In a press statement, Sarah Cornell of Portsmouth said, “We have seen first-hand the abuse and transfer of at least 407 individuals by ICE agents using flights in and out of Pease. Commercial operators of ICE flights from Pease are GlobalX, Eastern Air, and Avelo, which have moved people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts to far-flung parts of the United States.”

The release noted the “Stop Avelo” campaign continues in Manchester, where Avelo still operates commercial flights.

On Aug. 19 another monthly Pease meeting found board members confronted with angry residents and a petition opposing the flights signed by more than 2,000.

Since August 8, there have been regular “ICE Out of Pease” demonstrations around Portsmouth, including a two-day demonstration during the “Thunder over NH” air show September 6-7.

On September 5, the press release said ICE contract flights resumed at Hanscom Air Field and have continued daily carrying an estimated more than 400 individuals to date.

The release noted opposition groups in Massachusetts are re-mobilizing and a Hanscom Advisory Committee meeting is also today, Tuesday at 7 p.m.

Humphrey, a consistent presence at “ICE Out of Pease” demonstrations and a nationally known conservative Republican, has said the Constitution of the United States makes clear that the states are not servants of the federal government, and the PDA is completely at liberty to refuse services of its employees to assist ICE.

“Surely ICE doesn’t show up unannounced,” Humphrey told the PDA board Tuesday. “Surely they email and call and say ‘hey we’re on the way,’ to your employees. Your employees need not talk to them. Let ICE do its dirty work by itself, give them an electronic key to the gate and let them do everything they think they need to do but don’t be part of it,” the former Senator said. “Please.”

He reminded the PDA board they are sworn to the Constitution and should uphold it.

“You’re sworn, as officers of the state,” he said, and should, “Stand up to federal agencies that are denying constitutional rights.”

State Sen. David Meuse, D-Portsmouth, posted on Twitter Tuesday: “Pushing back this morning on ICE operations out of Pease. Every peaceful protest and honest conversation we have with our neighbors about these issues helps. Every time we do something, it means something. Be the sand in fascism’s gears, people.” #ICEOutOfPease #NHPolitics

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Brennan Center for Justice The Alien Enemies Act States United Democracy Center Sharing the Facts About the Alien Enemies Act Church World Service","The Neighbors Not Enemies Act (S. 193/H.R. 630) would repeal the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (AEA), a wartime law that allows the president to deport noncitizens from an “enemy nation.” The law’s most infamous use was during World War II, when over 30,000 Japanese, Italian, and German immigrants were detained and interned. Decades later, Presidents Reagan and Clinton issued national apologies and reparations to survivors.

In March, the Trump administration invoked the AEA to disappear more than 130 men to a mega-prison in El Salvador without due process. For months, their loved ones had no sign of life from their fathers, brothers, and friends. Since being returned to Venezuela in a prisoner exchange, the men have reported verbal, physical, sexual, and psychological abuse in the mega-prison, including beatings and sexual assault by guards.

While relieved they are no longer languishing in a prison notorious for torture, their safety is far from guaranteed. Many fled persecution in Venezuela – and the United States just delivered them back to danger.

More on the Alien Enemies Act: The Alien Enemies Act is the last remaining law of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. It grants the president sweeping power to detain and deport immigrants based on nationality during declared war, invasion, or predatory incursion. The law applies to any immigrant regardless of length of residency, refugee status, or military service.

The Trump administration has weaponized the AEA to disappear immigrants under the guise of national security. Officials allege its invocation was necessary to deport Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members, but the vast majority of those disappeared have no ties to the gang or criminal records, and a federal appeals court found there is “no invasion or predatory incursion.” This use of the AEA abused its original purpose–and now, President Trump has even floated the idea of sending U.S. citizens to the mega-prison in El Salvador.

Now is the time to take action: Passing the Neighbors Not Enemies Act would prevent future presidents from detaining or deporting people without evidence or the chance to be heard in court. Urge your Members of Congress to cosponsor the Neighbors Not Enemies Act today to protect due process and prevent future human rights abuses.

Kennedy Human Rights organization, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, the National Immigration Project and the Southeast Dignity Not Detention coalition, is on behalf of several detainees who say they experienced sexual assault, forced labor, denial of medical care, and retaliatory solitary confinement while awaiting deportation at the Evangeline Parish facility.

The organizations claim that the female-only facility, which also holds detainees of various gender identities and is operated by GEO Group Inc., violated civil and human rights, national standards and several ICE directives. The complaint says the practices were ""part of a systemic pattern of abuse that those in authority at the facility cannot or will not correct.""

South Louisiana ICE Processing Center administration, ICE New Orleans Field Office officials, and GEO Group were not immediately available for comment on the complaint.

The complaint accuses a former assistant warden, Manuel Reyes, of separately approaching four detainees to participate in an unsanctioned ""night shift cleaning crew."" The complaint claims no official record of the program exists, and that Reyes targeted LGBTQ+ detainees.

Reyes is accused of stalking, verbally harassing and sexually assaulting and harassing the four while coercing other detainees into sexual acts. One detainee, identified as Jane Doe, claimed Reyes groped her breasts and forced her to perform oral sex after he threatened her and her family.

The sexual abuse occurred on a near-daily basis over four months, Doe told the organization.

A RFKHR attorney, Sarah Decker, said Doe approached her last year during a bimonthly legal training session for those being held in the facility. Doe told Decker about the alleged sexual abuse happening at the hands of the Reyes. Doe would later connect the attorney with other detainees.

""(Reyes) was using this program to intentionally punish people on the basis of their gender identity."" Decker said. ""The people who were involved in this were all either trans men or masculine-presenting LGBTQ people.""

Official Prison Rape Elimination Act complaints filed by the detainees were left unanswered or deemed unsubstantiated by ICE, while grievances and Office of the Inspector General hotline calls were ignored, according to the civil rights complaint.

When accusations were reported, detainees were met with retaliation following minor or made-up infractions — often placed in solitary confinement for days or weeks, according to the complaint. Officers, under the command of Reyes, would beat at least one detainee after asking to submit a complaint.

""The more we learned, the more apparent it became that this was a really heinous situation,"" Decker said.

Two of the detainees said they were denied medical care, according to the filing. One said he didn't ask for treatment for chemical burns he received during the work program due to fear of retaliation.

Doe and he, both of whom suffer from epilepsy, were denied consistent treatment. Doe was allegedly denied seizure medication, neurologist care, and emergency care after several seizures.

Reyes left his position as assistant warden in July 2024. Decker said Reyes is no longer at the Basile facility. It is unknown if he is still employed by GEO Group.

In August 2024, the FBI interviewed several detainees regarding allegations of sexual and physical abuse at the facility, according to the organizations' complaint.

Three detainees said they faced retaliation after the interviews. Two currently remain in ICE custody.

While the complaint was filed on behalf of four individuals, Decker suggested the issue is a larger, more pervasive problem within the system nationally and that ICE has attempted to cover up allegations.

The human rights organizations are calling for the release of all detainees in the ICE processing facility and the termination of its agreements with the federal agency. Following the facility's closure, the organizations called for a full investigation into the alleged violations.

In 2024, the ACLU of Louisiana called for an independent probe of the ICE New Orleans Field Office to address a 108-page document that described inhumane conditions across the state's nine detention facilities.

A crowd soon forms nearby, and members of the Milford Police Department help with crowd control and traffic.
She added that ICE called his parents to pick him up, but when they “refused to come get him,” ICE drove him home.
Caroll said these incidents sow fear and distrust in the institutions that make America great, such as the immigration court system.
“The trauma that he and his family have endured as a result of ICE’s actions will be difficult to overcome.”","The teen’s family is still waiting for a decision on their asylum case.

A routine after-school stop for a snack turned into a traumatic encounter on Friday when a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer reportedly tackled 16-year-old Gustavo Enrique De Oliveira in Milford, threatened to shoot him, and briefly detained him.

According to his lawyers, the Milford High School student, who has no criminal history, was held for about an hour and ordered to report to ICE’s Burlington office this week. ICE released him after he checked in on Monday.

Lawyers from the Mabel Center, which is providing the family with pro bono legal support, say the unexpected detention has caused “fear” and “anxiety” for the family, who are awaiting a decision on their asylum case and were facing additional scrutiny from ICE on Tuesday.

“It was heart-wrenching to speak with (his mother) and see the suffering, the uncertainty, the anxiety,” said Alexandra Peredo Carroll, the director of legal education and advocacy at the Mabel Center. “This did not need to happen — other than to terrorize.”

Caroll said the incident started when Gustavo was a passenger in his friend’s car and a masked individual approached him — and he ran out of fear. He stopped when the officer threatened to shoot him, she said.

Gustavo’s family told NBC10 Boston that ICE agents then grabbed Gustavo, pinned him to the ground, put him in a car, and took him away.

The teen was taken a few blocks away down Main Street in a dark SUV, which the Milford Police Department caught on camera pulling in front of a white car to question someone in front of the police department.

The video footage shows a passerby stopping and then starting to take footage. He appears to interact with ICE agents. A crowd soon forms nearby, and members of the Milford Police Department help with crowd control and traffic.

The Milford Police did not provide a comment on the incident.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin released a statement stating Gustavo was not the target.

“ICE does NOT target juveniles or children,” her statement said.

During a targeted enforcement operation, McLaughlin said that two “illegal aliens” fled from a car on foot, and one of the suspected targets escaped.

During the operation, she said ICE briefly detained a 16-year-old Brazilian to “determine his identity and if he was a potential safety threat.”

McLaughlin said ICE was unaware of the teen’s age at the time of the detainment. She added that ICE called his parents to pick him up, but when they “refused to come get him,” ICE drove him home.

“He isn’t a public safety threat, and he never should have been arrested,” Gov. Maura Healey said in a statement in response to the incident. “These arrests by ICE aren’t about public safety; they are designed to sow fear and intimidation in our communities, and they make us all less safe.”

Community support

The community has come out to support the family, holding a rally on Sunday supporting immigrant rights near the corner where ICE officials detained Gustavo.

In a Facebook post, photos show signs saying, “Kids need parents, not prison,” “Education, not deportation,” and “Keep families together.”

The rally came as this is the second teenager in the town to be detained by ICE this year. Earlier in the summer, Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, was detained on his way to volleyball practice. A judge later released him on bond.

This most recent incident follows ICE’s new operation “Patriot 2.0,” which follows May’s crackdown, where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in the state.

Caroll noted, “Mildford has had enough with what is happening in their community.”

She pointed to alleged inaccuracies in McLaughlin’s statement that encouraged immigrants to “take control of their departure” using the CBP Home app. The app offers a $1,000 stipend to fly home while preserving the option to return the “legal way and live the American dream.”

The family members are going through the legal process of asylum, which requires them to be in the U.S. to apply. She said the detention is throwing a “wrench” in that process.

Caroll said these incidents sow fear and distrust in the institutions that make America great, such as the immigration court system.

“People have the right to not go through this,” Caroll said. These actions are eroding everybody’s protections, she said.

Caroll said that whether Gustavo will return to school is hard to answer. “The trauma that he and his family have endured as a result of ICE’s actions will be difficult to overcome.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4TO4DG7EMI643BOJBLQB26D5N4-68c9b7d11ee69-768x432.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 19:57:28.758867

President Donald Trump has continually been challenging who gets to be American. His administration has removed thousands of predominantly Black and brown immigrants, and revoked visas and eliminated legal pathways that for decades have allowed people from around the world to visit, live, and work here. Now, his administration has found a new avenue to attack in order to make it harder for immigrants hoping to establish a life in the U.S.: The citizenship test.

“I am declaring war on fraud,” Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said at an event in Washington this month. “I am declaring war on anyone that is coming to this country and wants to get a benefit, but doesn’t want the responsibility of what it means to actually be a U.S. citizen.”

Edlow claimed the current version of the U.S. citizenship test is “just too easy” and that the U.S. government needs a better way of assessing “whether someone has a true attachment to the Constitution, as required by the statute.” The process of becoming a U.S. citizen is called naturalization, and only a select few are eligible: those who have been given lawful permanent resident status—known as a green-card holder—for at least five years, those married to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident for three years, U.S. military service members, or a child of a U.S. citizen. Once an applicant satisfies one of these requirements, they must pay a handsome filing fee, clear extensive background checks, and pass the citizenship test, which consists of an English proficiency test and a civics exam.

This test has mostly stayed the same since the 1980s, with educators and scholars advising the federal government on an appropriate test that’s based on a level of knowledge of American history and civics that an average native-born American would have. Cases of fraud are relatively uncommon, though the Trump administration has directed the Department of Justice to prioritize denaturalization cases to strip people of their American citizenship. Now, it seems, they want to target the test itself.

To understand how the U.S. citizenship test was created and how the Trump administration’s plans to make it harder could actually play out, I spoke with Doris Meissner. She was director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under Bill Clinton’s administration, where she worked on reforms to the naturalization process. She’s currently a senior fellow and director of U.S. immigration policy at the Migration Policy Institute. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Slate: So there is an English language component to the citizenship test and a civics section. Who created this and why?

Doris Meissner: The written test that we’re talking about is the civics test. There hadn’t been a standardized citizenship test until about 1986, and prior to that time, when people had their citizenship interview, they were all interviewed by an immigration adjudicator, who were previously called examiners. The adjudicator speaks to the person in English so they can demonstrate their English language capability through conversation. The civics test, prior to 1986, was informal, with immigration officers all over the country asking questions about the American system of government: Do we elect our president? Who is our current president? What is the first line of “The Star Spangled Banner”? They asked these types of questions at random, and it could be different in any office and among every adjudicator. It was up to the adjudicator to verify that the person had an understanding of the American system of government. This informal process changed to a standardized test process in 1986, and it’s taken various forms since then, but basically followed a similar format.

Generally, over the years, it’s been a list of 100 questions which serve as a study guide for the naturalization applicant, and it is all questions that have to do with the American system of government. What we would consider middle-school civics curriculum is the type of questions the applicant has to study in advance. From those 100 questions, the adjudicator will typically ask 10 questions, and, for most of recent decades, a passing grade is considered anywhere between six to eight correct answers. These 10 questions are randomly selected off of this list of 100 questions, because it presumes that the applicant has studied the test questions and therefore knows the answers to many more of the questions than the ones that are actually asked.

The level of learning that it takes to understand and answer those 100 questions has not just been randomly put together. The Immigration Service has gone through a thorough process of working with educators, English language experts, and history scholars in order to determine what the range of questions should be that actually meet the statutory requirement of knowledge of civics and American government. Over the years, that level of learning has been pegged at about a sixth-grade level of understanding. That is based on a much broader set of standards in the education community about what is a level of learning and understanding that represents what most Americans understand.

The Trump administration said it plans on making the citizenship test harder, establishing a higher bar for passing and adding an essay section. Besides the shift to a standardized test in 1986, how often does this test actually change?

The tests have somewhat improved over the years. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a system where the test would be reviewed every 10 years and updated and refined to reflect constitutional amendments and those kinds of changes. When those reviews took place, test questions may have been edited or changed to a degree, but the test itself remained intact, until the first Trump administration. Instead of a 10-year review, the first Trump administration made the argument that the test was not hard enough and needed to require more answers to questions. Then with the Biden administration in 2020, it was time for the 10-year review, and the test changed again and they made it a little bit more like what the test had been prior to the first Trump administration. Now, we’re seeing, with the return of another Trump administration, that same pattern has come back: The test is not hard enough, we need to make it more rigorous, people need to demonstrate their commitment to being an American, and they need to be convincing about their loyalty and their patriotism.

I’m not sure that the federal statute actually requires this. The statute requires knowledge of the English language and of American government. I don’t know that an attachment to the Constitution is actually language that is in the statute. I would have to say that over the years, when the 100 questions are put before native-born Americans, the failure rate is quite high. If you ask a random group of Americans to answer these questions, they don’t do as well on the test as people who are applying for naturalization do; usually somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 to 91 percent pass the citizenship test. Research also shows that people who are applying for naturalization are worried far more about being able to demonstrate their English language capability than about their ability to pass the civics test, because the knowledge of American government is something you can study, and people do study hard.

How would the government implement an essay section within the current citizenship test?

I don’t think it’s practical at all. What would be the standards for judging whether an essay meets some level of scrutiny? I think that introducing an essay into a system like this would actually make it be more prone to misuse, because there would be all kinds of ways of getting ahold of template essays that have been approved by prior applicants, going to ChatGPT, using who knows what. That proposal to introduce something like an essay, I can’t see doing anything but trying to raise the level of intimidation and an effort to discourage people from naturalizing when they might otherwise be eligible.

The fact that this process, for many decades now, has been one informed by professional opinion and experienced educators gives it the “good housekeeping” feel that is more than sufficient.

The Trump administration has been pushing the idea that immigrants are bad and using that as a justification to completely upend our legal immigration system. Do you think this latest announcement about making the citizenship test harder is another way to fuel more negative sentiment about immigrants?

Yes, I agree with that, and I think that’s a very important shift. Discussing naturalization now entirely through the lens of fraud and of manipulating and misusing the system, being opposed somehow or another to Americanness—whatever that might mean—is very much at odds with what the experience has been. First of all, to apply for naturalization, there is a sizable fee. People have to not only be motivated, but have the financial means. And people who apply for naturalization want to be American, that’s why they do it. They are absolutely attached to the idea of America. This is painting a picture of people going through the naturalization process that is not representative at all of what the experience and the reality is of people who are applying for naturalization.

I think one of the things to really reflect on with all of this is that up until now, the administration has been talking about illegal immigration and being opposed to it, obviously through the mass deportations initiative and the high level of priority that the administration is giving to that. That’s one thing, but they’ve always, until now, basically said, We want people to play by the rules and we want people to use our legal immigration system. But now what’s happening is that the very people who are in fact playing by the rules, exercising their rights under the legal immigration system, are being characterized in a very negative light, and that is a big shift.

In your experience, is there actually a high level of fraud in the U.S. citizenship application process?

No. Any major system has a degree of fraud and does need to be highly vigilant and have procedures in place that detect fraud, like Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security. Immigration is also one, so fraud is always a possibility. But the naturalization system, and the immigration system overall, has had a very consistent focus on fraud detection, and the procedures that are required for people to pass background checks have gotten better and better over the years, particularly since 9/11. Federal government databases have become linked and technology has made it possible to include not only immigration information, but all of the information that the FBI has, like terrorism information—that is in the hands of the government; information from states and localities around the country, in terms of crimes that might have been committed at a local level. Now databases also allow for information on credit history and borrowing patterns. There is a tremendous amount of information that is available in the initial screening, and these are people, of course, who have been screened a number of times already because they have gotten a green card, a visa to come into the country. They’ve been screened at a number of points along the path of the immigration system to even get to the point where they have the basic eligibility to apply for naturalization now.

If one goes back over a number of administrations, I remember during the Obama administration there were some issues that were detected in the naturalization process that had to do with some fraud. There were vigorous efforts to adjust the system to prevent that. The USCIS, as an agency, and the naturalization process as a system, has always been vigilant about its screening process and about the possibilities for fraud. This is not the kind of system that lends itself to fraudsters.",https://compote.slate.com/images/79232fff-55ed-4421-8458-3523cf61a52a.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-09-16 19:57:15.450206

Even though Perdomo is not a merits opinion, it may foreshadow how the Court will ultimately rule on this issue.
At a minimum, it foretells a loosening of the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of immigration stops.
The concurrence allows immigration agents to meet that standard based on “specific articulable facts” which previously would likely have been deemed insufficient and potentially characterized as racial profiling.
This requirement should apply to all employees, including subcontractors and even those individuals born in the United States.","Under federal law, government agents are authorized to “interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States.” Under applicable regulations, the agents “may briefly detain” an individual “for questioning” if they have “a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being questioned . . . is an alien illegally in the United States.”

In June 2025, agents from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the United States Department of Homeland Security were deployed throughout Los Angeles to arrest undocumented immigrants as part of a plan called “Operation At Large,” which “federal officials have described as ‘the Largest Mass Deportation Operation . . . in History.’” Five individuals stopped during Operation At Large and four interested associations challenged the constitutionality of the agents’ tactics, filing a class action against Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and other immigration officials.

In July, a federal district court in California entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining the government from basing reasonable suspicion for a stop “solely” on certain factors, whether “alone or in combination”:

“Apparent race or ethnicity;”

“Speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent;”

“Presence at a particular location (e.g., bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.);” or

“The type of work one does.”

On September 8, the Supreme Court granted defendants’ application for a stay of the TRO pending appeal in the Ninth Circuit. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, concurring in the grant of the stay, wrote that it is “common sense” that in the Los Angeles area, the factors on which the district court’s TRO enjoined the government from relying can, taken together, “constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.” Justice Kavanaugh noted that under the Court’s precedent, “apparent ethnicity” is not alone enough to create reasonable suspicion but can contribute to the formation of reasonable suspicion “when considered along with other salient factors.”

In weighing the balance of harms and equities, Justice Kavanaugh stated that the interests of those in the country illegally in avoiding interrogation or detention is “not . . . especially weighty,” and opined that when individuals legally in the U.S. are stopped by immigration officials, questioning “is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after,” clarifying that they are either U.S. citizens or otherwise legally present in the country. Writing on behalf of the dissenting justices, Justice Sonia Sotomayor deemed the harm to U.S. citizens and documented immigrants significantly greater than Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence recognized and argued that the Court’s decision removes Fourth Amendment protection from “arbitrary interference by law officers” for individuals with a certain appearance and manner of speech who are employed in certain low-wage jobs.

Even though Perdomo is not a merits opinion, it may foreshadow how the Court will ultimately rule on this issue. At a minimum, it foretells a loosening of the reasonable suspicion standard in the context of immigration stops. The concurrence allows immigration agents to meet that standard based on “specific articulable facts” which previously would likely have been deemed insufficient and potentially characterized as racial profiling.

Although Perdomo did not arise out of a worksite enforcement operation, companies operating in industries where employees of foreign descent are common should be mindful of the ruling. Even when those agents are onsite pursuant to a search warrant or consent, before Perdomo they were obligated to identify “specific articulable facts” demonstrating reasonable suspicion before detaining and questioning individual employees. Perdomo lowers the applicable standard, effectively empowering immigration agents to detain and question any employee onsite who meets the criteria listed in the concurrence — though it is unclear how many of the four listed factors must be present to create reasonable suspicion under the “totality of the circumstances.”

In this new environment, we recommend companies consider the following steps:

Develop a response plan for unannounced visits by government agents. Senior officials onsite and those employees most likely to interact with those agents initially should be trained on how to respond.

Evaluate the areas of greatest risk and adjust policies accordingly. For example, temporary staffing agencies are often a source of undocumented workers. Companies should work to ensure that individuals provided by such agencies are properly documented and terminate relationships with agencies who demonstrate insufficient attention to detail in this area.

Employees should be strongly encouraged, if not required, to carry identification and/or documentation demonstrating that they are in the country legally and are authorized to work. This requirement should apply to all employees, including subcontractors and even those individuals born in the United States. Because Perdomo validates detention and questioning based on an individual’s “apparent race or ethnicity” coupled with a factor such as “the type of work one does,” even those individuals born in the United States are subject to detention and questioning if they appear to be of foreign descent and are working certain jobs (such as agriculture, construction, or assembly line work).

Where feasible, companies should separately maintain identification information for employees, and strongly encourage subcontractors to do the same. Having such information readily at hand can serve to reduce the disorder and disruption that might otherwise result from an unannounced visit.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-09/immigration%20law%20bigstock%20140660921.jpg.webp?itok=ufPQFY-3,N,,2025-09-16 16:57:57.347607

If their conduct, which McIver’s attorneys said was “far more egregious” than anything McIver did, has been treated so gently by Trump’s DOJ, then the vigorous prosecution of McIver should be seen as politically motivated.
The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, and earned the U.S. Attorney’s office a scolding from a federal magistrate judge.
Another motion filed by McIver last month demanded that the Trump administration cease making “extrajudicial statements” about her and withdraw any such prior statements.
Finally, McIver and the DOJ remain at odds on discovery.","Last month, New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-Newark), under indictment for assault, asked a federal judge to throw out the charges against her for containing a number of supposedly fatal defects. In an 80-page brief filed yesterday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) argues that no such dismissal is warranted.

The brief also largely corroborates McIver’s own account of what happened on May 9 at the Delaney Hall immigrant detention center. McIver and two of her congressional colleagues were allowed into the facility for an oversight visit; Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was also let inside the facility’s gates, then told to leave, which he did after a tense interaction with immigration officials who threatened to arrest him; and finally, even after exiting the gates, Baraka was arrested anyways, prompting the scuffle that forms the basis of the charges against McIver.

Another detail confirmed by the brief: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents arrested Baraka after “consulting with the Deputy Attorney General,” Todd Blanche, the DOJ’s second-in-command.

In their motions last month, McIver’s defense attorneys put forward two key arguments for why the charges should be dismissed: the prosecution against her is vindictive and politically motivated by her criticism of President Donald Trump’s policies, and the charges center around official legislative business that’s protected by the Constitution’s Speech or Debate clause.

Writing for the DOJ, however, Assistant U.S. Attorneys Mark McCarren and Benjamin Bleiberg work to dismantle those arguments, saying that they are an attempt to obfuscate what is otherwise a straightforward case of assault. A trial in the matter is scheduled for November 10, but the decision about whether the case will continue ultimately rests with U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper.

McIver’s claims of selective prosecution, the DOJ argues, fall apart because she provides no specific evidence that she was treated any differently from another defendant in her situation, or that the prosecution – led by controversial acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, whose authority as New Jersey’s top prosecutor remains in limbo – harbors any specific animus against her.

“[McIver’s allegation of discriminatory intent] relies primarily upon a mistaken understanding of DOJ policy, as well as out-of-context statements concerning the Administration’s well-publicized law enforcement policies and priorities,” the brief states. “In the process, McIver omits mention of evidence contradicting her claims from the very sources upon which she relies for her supposed evidence of ‘discriminatory intent.’”

McIver’s motion also rested heavily on a comparison to the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, who were subject to blanket pardons and dismissals of charges when Trump retook office this year. If their conduct, which McIver’s attorneys said was “far more egregious” than anything McIver did, has been treated so gently by Trump’s DOJ, then the vigorous prosecution of McIver should be seen as politically motivated.

The DOJ, however, calls that comparison “apples to oranges,” saying the treatment of one cannot be used as a defense of the other. Moreover, the DOJ contends that Trump’s sweeping pardons covered even January 6 defendants who had not yet been prosecuted, and a presidential pardon is “absolute.”

“McIver’s claim faces a threshold, insurmountable defect: the January 6 Defendants cannot be considered similarly situated because they all were pardoned,” the brief states. “As a consequence, their ongoing prosecutions had to be dismissed without regard to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, and they could not be prosecuted for January 6th related crimes thereafter.”

Another argument McIver put forward, that the DOJ failed to consult with its Public Integrity Section (PIN), is similarly moot, the brief states, because the DOJ had already suspended its own policy requiring consultation with PIN before bringing charges against members of Congress.

Citing a Reuters article, the brief places the suspension of the policy around May 10 – right as DHS began publicly threatening action against McIver and the two other Democratic members of Congress present for the visit and ensuing fracas. Reps. Rob Menendez (D-Jersey City) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Ewing), referred to as “Betsy” at one point in the DOJ’s brief, ultimately were not charged.

As for McIver’s claims that her conduct is protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, the DOJ acknowledges that the Delaney Hall oversight visit falls under the category of McIver’s official actions as a congresswoman, but disputes the idea that an altercation with law enforcement officials is subject to the same protections.

“Imagine, for example, that McIver, while touring Delaney Hall, smuggled in contraband that she surreptitiously slipped to a detainee,” the brief states. “Such conduct would violate a number of federal and state statutes, and it would certainly have no legitimate legislative purpose. But under McIver’s theory of immunity, she would be immune from prosecution because it occurred during an otherwise legitimate legislative act.”

“It defies logic to believe that the Founders envisioned the immunity conferred by the Speech or Debate Clause sweeps so broadly,” it continues.

According to the brief, McIver attempted to impede Baraka’s arrest twice: first when Baraka was confronted while inside the gates, and again during Baraka’s actual arrest outside the gates. The latter incident, when McIver placed her arms around Baraka to prevent the arrest and “barreled after the Mayor and the [Special Agent in Charge], making forcible contact with the SAC and one other ICE officer,” provides the basis for the charges against her.

The trespassing charges against Baraka were later dropped, and earned the U.S. Attorney’s office a scolding from a federal magistrate judge.

The brief’s summary of events appears to concede a key point that McIver has suggested: none of the federal agents involved in the scuffle actually experienced any injuries as a result. The DOJ argues, however, that “the Government does not need to show harm or injury to satisfy the elements of the offenses charged.”

Seemingly contradicted by the brief, meanwhile, are claims from DHS officials in the wake of the incident that McIver and her colleagues had “stormed” and “illegally [broken] into” Delaney Hall, rather than simply walking in for an oversight visit. The brief’s timeline of events states that McIver “entered through the front gate into the secured area of the facility,” and makes no mention of any forcible entry into the facility.

Another motion filed by McIver last month demanded that the Trump administration cease making “extrajudicial statements” about her and withdraw any such prior statements. The DOJ says in its brief that it has asked DHS to remove five of its posts that McIver found objectionable, but all five of the posts remain public on the DHS’s website or social media as of this morning.

Finally, McIver and the DOJ remain at odds on discovery. McIver’s flurry of motions last month insisted that the DOJ has not handed over a raft of important evidence; the DOJ’s brief says it is willing to grant McIver’s request for internal video of McIver’s oversight tour, but called other requests “breathtaking in [their] scope.”

The DOJ also contested McIver’s claim that some relevant body camera footage has not been released; while footage from 11 agents’ body cameras have been provided, the DOJ says other agents present for the incident were not wearing cameras at the time, including the two agents identified as “Victim-1” and “Victim-2.”

FEMA has not issued that notice for the Shelter and Services Program.
The Shelter and Services Program is designed to provide temporary housing to relieve overcrowding in federal immigration facilities.
Instead, the President must ‘faithfully execute’ the law as Congress enacts it,” the GAO report states.","The Government Accountability Office released a report Monday concluding the Federal Emergency Management Agency violated the law “when it withheld or delayed the obligation of” funding Congress approved for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program and the Shelter and Services Program.

The finding is the sixth time this year the GAO has determined the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act, which lays out a legal process for the president to request Congress cancel previously approved spending.

Instead of following that process, the GAO report says, the Trump administration significantly delayed issuing a notice of funding opportunity, the first step in awarding grants from the Emergency Food and Shelter Program. FEMA has not issued that notice for the Shelter and Services Program.

FEMA programs provide food, shelter

GAO wrote in the 22-page report the delay in the Emergency Food and Shelter Program notice of funding opportunity “constitutes an impermissible withholding and a violation of the ICA.”

The Trump administration’s actions regarding the Shelter and Services Program “establish the intent to impermissibly defer or preclude the obligation of budget authority,” according to the report.

The Emergency Food and Shelter Program “supplements and expands ongoing work of local nonprofit and governmental social service organizations to provide shelter, food and supportive services to individuals and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, hunger and/or homelessness,” according to FEMA’s website.

The Shelter and Services Program is designed to provide temporary housing to relieve overcrowding in federal immigration facilities.

Congressional powers

GAO also sought to reinforce the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution in the report, explaining that Congress approves laws and that once the president signs those laws, it’s up to that branch of government to implement them.

“This process does not grant the President the authority to pass his own laws or to ignore or amend a law duly enacted by Congress. Instead, the President must ‘faithfully execute’ the law as Congress enacts it,” the GAO report states. “It follows from this that Executive Orders cannot function to repeal or undo legislation.”

Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement the latest GAO report “is another stark reminder of a fact we have known for months: President Trump is breaking the law in order to prevent communities across the country from receiving resources they have been promised, including critical funding to address homelessness.

“The same guy who says he wants to get people off the streets is blocking funding for communities to tackle homelessness. Donald Trump and Russ Vought need to immediately allow these resources to flow, and Republican lawmakers need to join us insisting every last bit of this funding gets out the door in a fair, impartial way.”

Vought is the director of the Office of Management and Budget.

The report, based on accounts of several unidentified federal employees familiar with the data, appeared to contradict a sworn statement made in a lawsuit over the children’s fate by Angie Salazar, a senior health official. She said the children had been properly screened and cleared for repatriation. It also came less than a week after the judge presiding over the case, Timothy J. Kelly, challenged lawyers from the Justice Department about the veracity of another of their central claims in the dispute: that the children’s parents had requested their return.

Filed to Congress by the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower protection group, the report said at least 30 of the 327 children the government cleared for imminent removal had “indicators of being a victim of child abuse” in Guatemala, based on the government’s own findings.

The children, who came to the United States as unaccompanied minors in recent years and have been living in shelters or foster care under government supervision, were hastily targeted by the Trump administration over the Labor Day weekend. Upon learning that the children were being loaded onto flights to be sent back, lawyers from the National Immigration Law Center sued to block the removals and a federal judge ordered the government to halt until the case could be argued.

The Trump administration has said it was exercising an authority to reunify unaccompanied children with their parents abroad, claiming that it was acting at the behest of the children’s families and with the children's well-being in mind.

But the report on Tuesday was the second time that notion had been called into question.

Ms. Salazar filed the declaration in her capacity as the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services that maintains custody over minors who enter the United States alone.

As of September 11, the average daily population at Otay Mesa was about 1,400 people, according to ICE detention data.
Several San Diego immigration attorneys who talked to inewsource said they haven’t had any clients held in solitary confinement recently.
The DOJ found that custody staff often did not conduct mental health reviews before putting immigrants in isolation cells.
The Trump administration attempted to shutter that office as well as the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, two of the main oversight bodies for conditions inside immigration detention centers, and the U.S.","The number of immigrants spending time in isolated cells inside a federal detention center in San Diego County has spiked in the last three months, according to data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Custody staff at the Otay Mesa Detention Center put 42 immigrants into “segregation” in August – eight times higher than a year prior – marking a sharp increase as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown swells detentions beyond capacity in some places.

ICE uses the term “segregation” to describe placements in one to two person cells where detainees can be held for up to 24 hours a day. National detention standards which ICE follows define segregation as “confinement in an individual cell isolated from the general population.” Human rights groups, however, widely recognize the practice as solitary confinement.

The upward trend in San Diego follows a similar one across the country, with ICE increasingly relying on the isolation cells as more than 60,000 people remain detained in immigration detention centers as of August.

More than 1,000 people have spent time in segregation in ICE detention every month since April, according to ICE data, which counts individuals who spend at least one day in segregation in a month. That’s about double the monthly number from last year.

ICE uses isolation cells as a punitive as well as a protective measure, including for vulnerable detainees, according to its policies. Between January and March, the latest time frame reported by ICE, the average time spent in isolated cells in ICE custody nationwide was 38 days. That’s more than double the amount that constitutes torture according to the United Nations.

About a third of those placements were for disciplinary reasons. The next most common reasons were protective custody followed by mental health reasons. ICE does not provide the placement reasons for specific facilities.

The use of solitary confinement broadly has been criticized by human rights groups as inhumane, especially in immigration detention, where people are held for civil immigration proceedings or while awaiting deportation. Research shows that solitary confinement has detrimental physical and psychological health effects.

As of September 11, the average daily population at Otay Mesa was about 1,400 people, according to ICE detention data. About 89% had no criminal convictions.

In February, a German tourist said she spent more than a week inside solitary confinement at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, during which she “went so insane that she started punching the walls” and got blood on her hands, the woman’s friend told a TV station. News outlets across the country have documented other cases of immigrants placed in solitary confinement.

CoreCivic, the private contractor managing the Otay Mesa Detention Center, took issue with the term solitary confinement and denied that it exists at its detention centers.

Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, said they use “restrictive housing units” for “various reasons” and noted that some people request to be in restrictive housing. He denied that CoreCivic uses it for disciplinary action for ICE detainees and said people placed in restrictive housing units have access to “courts, visitation, mail, showers, meals, all medical facilities and recreation.”

Gustin also said the ICE data is “not reflective on how long detainees may have remained in segregation” and referred inewsource to ICE.

Spokespeople for ICE did not answer questions from inewsource except to send a link to their segregation policy from 2013.

That policy says placing someone in segregation is a “serious step” that should involve considering other options and should only happen when “necessary.” Segregation for administrative purposes should be “for the briefest term and under the least restrictive conditions practicable” and for vulnerable immigrants should only happen “as a last resort,” according to the policy.

In December, ICE released an updated policy further outlining health evaluations and guidelines for who could be put in segregation and for what reasons.

Under previous administrations, reports from government watchdogs and independent researchers have found issues with ICE’s use of isolation cells including poor record-keeping for immigrants with mental health risks and arbitrary placements for minor disciplinary issues and sometimes yearslong confinements.

One person detained at Otay Mesa spent two years in solitary confinement through the end of 2019, according to a report published last year from Physicians for Human Rights.

But the average time in isolation cells varies widely depending on the reason for the placement. For mental health placements, the average time was about 8 days. For disciplinary reasons, that number jumped to more than 30 days. For those deemed a “security threat” or placed in protective custody, which could include victims of violence, LGBTQ+ immigrants, or medically vulnerable, the averages were about 56 and 68 days, respectively.

Inside Otay Mesa, reports of overcrowding have plagued the facility for months.

“Basically everybody’s saying that it’s overcrowded. There’s people sleeping on the floor,” said Valerie Sigamani, an immigration attorney in San Diego, about her clients inside Otay Mesa.

Crystal Felix, a local immigration attorney, said recent changes to immigration bonds have meant far fewer people are eligible to be released while they pursue their cases and that detainees are “languishing” inside as a result.

Several San Diego immigration attorneys who talked to inewsource said they haven’t had any clients held in solitary confinement recently.

In the spring, the California Department of Justice released a report following its state-mandated review of immigration detention centers in the state. The DOJ found that custody staff often did not conduct mental health reviews before putting immigrants in isolation cells.

However at Otay Mesa, the state DOJ found that staff in multiple cases “approved restrictive housing placements for detainees experiencing significant mental health concerns.” That included one person who “had engaged in self-harm and been placed on suicide watch” during a nine-month stay in isolation.

According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, solitary confinement increases the risk of suicide, making existing mental health issues worse and bringing on new symptoms completely, with effects that can last past the dentention period.

The DOJ found that immigrant detainees across the six detention centers they inspected had “high rates of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, increased likelihood of self-harm behavior, and negative changes in self-perception.”

The 2024 report from Physicians for Human Rights, Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic and Peeler Immigration Lab found that solitary confinement disproportionately impacted transgender people and people affected by mental illness and sometimes meant substandard medical care leading to “life-threatening conditions.”

The report also found that staff placed immigrants in solitary arbitrarily for minor infractions, such as using profanity or a “consensual kiss,” or in other cases due to overcrowding.

The Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in 2023 investigated ICE’s use of isolation cells for immigrants with mental health issues. The office said they opened more than 60 such complaints in the previous four years.

The Trump administration attempted to shutter that office as well as the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, two of the main oversight bodies for conditions inside immigration detention centers, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office. A legal battle to restore the offices is ongoing.

The letter, sent to the military services and provided to The Associated Press, comes two weeks after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges. It is part of the steps the Trump administration has taken to use the military in broader ways than previously seen, particularly in its immigration crackdown, including sending the National Guard into American cities and deploying active duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.

“These military officers would serve under the command and control of the Attorney General and would execute administrative determinations at the direction of the Attorney General,” according to the letter signed by 12 Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee. It added that “these actions are inherently law enforcement actions that may not be performed by members of the armed forces.”

“We remain extremely disturbed about the impacts on readiness of using military personnel to perform what are traditionally Department of Justice functions,” the letter says.

The nation’s immigration courts — with a backlog of about 3.5 million cases — have become a key focus of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration enforcement efforts. Since Trump returned to office, dozens of immigration judges have been fired, while others have resigned or taken early retirement.

The senators’ letter, sent to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services on Monday, is asking the Pentagon to say where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and for insight into what legal analysis the military has conducted into whether the move would violate the Posse Comitatus Act. That law prevents the military from conducting law enforcement outside of extreme emergencies.

A Pentagon memo that described the plan said the lawyers should not be detailed for longer than half a year. The memo also showed that Pentagon officials were cognizant of the possibility for conflict with that law and said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring that the military lawyers do not violate it.

The Democratic senators said they were “deeply concerned” that pulling those lawyers away would have an impact on service members who are going through the military’s judicial system.

“These reassignments come at a time only shortly after Congress completely overhauled how the military investigates and prosecutes serious ‘covered’ criminal offenses … by establishing the Offices of Special Trial Counsel (OSTCs) in each of the Services,” the letter read.

Those offices were set up by Congress in 2022 as part of an effort to reform the military justice system by moving decisions on the prosecution of serious military crimes, including sexual assault, to independent military attorneys, taking that power away from victims’ commanders.

The offices began taking cases at the end of last year.

The letter asks the Pentagon what it will do to “preserve the OSTC’s progress in building specialized trial capacity” and what the services will do to “ensure that diversion of OSTCs, trial counsels, and defense counsels does not create delays or diminish quality in court-martials.” The senators say that the plan is a demonstration of how “the Trump administration views skilled personnel as pawns to be traded between agencies, rather than as professionals essential to their core missions, in order to advance misguided immigration policies.”

Provide eligible Dreamers with access to federal financial aid

Allow eligible Dreamers located abroad to apply for relief

Prevent penalizing states that grant in-state tuition to undocumented students based on residency

A new law gives federal agencies $170,000,000,000 ($170 billion) for anti-immigrant enforcement, detention, and deportation. The law is called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” or OBBBA, for short. This money makes the U.S. immigration enforcement agencies richer than many nations’ entire military force. It allows the federal government to step up attacks on the rights of immigrants, especially children and families.

Where does the $170 billion go?

This money goes to federal agencies, with the largest amounts to Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), including:

$30 billion to detain and deport more immigrants, more quickly

$45 billion to build new immigrant detention facilities

$47 billion to build more border walls and other barriers

$16 billion for increased border security, including surveillance and technology

$14 billion for state and local agencies that participate in immigration enforcement

$12 billion for more Border Patrol checkpoints, vehicles, and agents

An additional $11 billion goes to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and the Bureau of Prisons for uses including immigration enforcement and detention.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement gets $330 million for extreme vetting of unaccompanied children and their sponsors.

How will the agencies use this money?

Agencies can mostly choose how and where to spend this money, but the law gives some instructions for how money should be used, including:

Fingerprinting and DNA analysis of families arriving at the border

Additional screening for people coming to the U.S.

Remain in Mexico, a policy that forces migrants to wait for their U.S. court cases in Mexico, a human rights catastrophe

Sending unaccompanied children back to their country without seeing a judge

Allowing state and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws (287(g) program), and paying them for participating in immigration enforcement

Allowing more deportations without seeing a judge and using secret evidence in some cases

Physical exams of children who arrive at the U.S. border without a parent or guardian

Detaining children with their parents while the parent is prosecuted for illegal entry

Creating the “Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office,” a political tool to scare immigrants

The Department of Justice (DOJ) can use money for:

Investigating immigration-related offenses, such as unauthorized entry, failure to register, and voting by non-citizens

Crime prevention programs, including programs for immigration enforcement and deportation

Pay states and cities that put certain immigrants in jail

How does the bill expand immigrant detention?

The law provides funding for federal, state, and local authorities to detain adults and children, including new forms of family detention. The bill provides $45 billion for immigrant detention for single adults and families. It also creates a new form of family detention, where parents can be detained with their children while they are prosecuted for unauthorized entry. The funds provided to the Department of Defense and states and localities also may be used for detention-related activities.

How are immigrant children and families treated?

This law causes suffering and life-long trauma to children and families as:

Entire families (including children and babies) can be placed and kept in detention for however long their immigration cases take.

Border patrol agents can physically examine children as young as 12 (and children of any age may be examined if they are in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody). The government says they are checking for tattoos and gang-related markings.

How do state and local authorities get money to detain immigrants?

The bill gives $14 billion for state and local governments to do border and immigration enforcement, including:

Funds to DHS and to ICE for 287(g) agreements, and to pay states and local agencies for:

immigration enforcement,

criminal and gang investigations, and

jailing non-citizens convicted of certain crimes

$13.5 billion for grants to state and local governments for immigration enforcement, building border walls and barriers, detaining immigrants, and potentially for building state-run immigration jails

$450 million for Operation Stonegarden to pay state and local governments that cooperate with border enforcement

“People detained at this facility—including immigrants—have a constitutional right to due process and the right to counsel in immigration court.

However, her office has since received reports from nonprofit and pro bono legal providers contradicting those claims. These conflicting accounts raise serious concerns about transparency, accountability, and whether ICE is meeting its legal and constitutional obligations.

In her letter, Rep. Crockett called on DHS to:

Clarify ICE’s policies regarding attorney access to clients at Camp East Montana;

Clarify ICE’s policies related to access to legal libraries and resources; and

Guarantee that individuals in ICE custody are being afforded their constitutional right to counsel and due process.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. – In another effort to expand his power and stoke fear, President Trump issued a memorandum yesterday establishing a regressive policing task force made up of various federal departments and agencies — including the FBI, ICE, and DEA — to go into Memphis. The memo also orders the Secretary of Defense to request state National Guard troops from the Tennessee governor. And it authorizes the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with additional governors to “augment” this federal task force with their own troops. This latest step makes clear that the Trump administration is claiming a sweeping mandate to patrol, arrest and detain people in Memphis, and will bring back the same failed policing tactics that caused widespread constitutional violations for decades.

“When military troops police civilians, we have an intolerable threat to individual liberty and the foundational values of this country,” said Hina Shamsi, director of American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “President Trump may want to normalize armed forces in our cities, but no matter what uniform they wear, federal agents and military troops are bound by the Constitution and have to respect our rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of speech, and due process. State and local leaders must stay strong and take all lawful measures to protect residents against this cruel intimidation tactic.”

Trump’s latest escalation comes at a time when the administration has cut millions in grants for proven strategies to reduce crime and improve safety. It escalates tensions in the community, undermines the reform efforts that Memphians are leading with local law enforcement, and encourages police practices already found to be unconstitutional.

In May, the Trump administration retracted findings from a Department of Justice report that revealed deeply disturbing patterns of local police misconduct and brutality, including police unleashing K9 units on people who were sleeping or otherwise complying with officers, training directives that instruct officers to “hurt them first and hurt them bad,” and routine use of pepper spray until people could barely breathe. Trump’s latest memorandum undermines the police and safety reform efforts that Memphians are leading.

Trump’s memo also directs federal law enforcement to work with state and local law enforcement agencies to “enforce Federal immigration law.” When combined with over-policing, this mandate is likely to escalate immigration arrests and deportations of people from traffic stops and other routine interactions with police, heightening a climate of fear for thousands of residents.

“While we all want to see a safer Memphis, flooding the city we love with hundreds of federal, state, and local agents, and threatening to send the military into our communities, is dangerous and counterproductive,” said Memphis resident Claire Gardner, community engagement director for the ACLU of Tennessee. “President Trump is only going to make things worse. He is prioritizing abusive policing tactics that will further break trust between law enforcement and the community they are meant to serve, endanger lives, and lead to violations of our civil rights and liberties. True safety comes from empowering the community, not using state power to go after our immigrant neighbors, people of color, and those who dissent against the government’s brutal policies.”

As a result, what exactly happened to hundreds of people detained in January remains a secret.

Federal agents have rounded up scores of others since then, including some in the ongoing Operation Midway Blitz ordered by Trump. With a few exceptions, immigration officials won’t disclose details about who they arrested this time either.

Here’s what officials have revealed:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested nearly 400 people in Chicago and neighboring states during the 10 days after Trump’s inauguration, according to records released to Block Club Chicago — after we sued to get them.

At least 122 of those 393 arrests occurred in Illinois, including at least 53 in Chicago, the records show.

Combined with data acquired by other groups, the records show that 32 of the people apprehended in Chicago faced charges for criminal offenses, while 21 were picked up for alleged immigration violations.

Authorities arrested people all over the city during those 10 days — including at their homes, at their workplaces and at public facilities, such as Cook County jail and the federal building at 101 W. Ida B. Wells Drive, which houses an ICE field office.

The data shows that 219 of the 393 people arrested in the broader Chicago region had a “departed date” and “departure country” listed, indicating they’ve since been deported. The leading destination country was Mexico, for 119 people, followed by Guatemala (24) and Honduras (22). People were also deported to 15 other countries, from Poland to Micronesia.

But the records released to Block Club are missing other crucial information. They don’t include the names or birth dates of the people arrested, making it difficult if not impossible to determine what their backgrounds were, why they were targeted and where they are now. The records also leave out the city and state for 44 arrests and the street addresses for 155.

Lawyers for ICE cited provisions in the federal Freedom of Information Act that allow them to redact personal information out of privacy concerns.

Yet ICE regularly issues press releases revealing the names and alleged criminal histories of detainees it labels “the worst of the worst.”

Attorneys for the agency have continued to maintain they have the right to redact names and other arrest details from records released to the public. Block Club’s lawyers, from the Chicago-based firm Loevy + Loevy, have argued that some of that information should be disclosed to ensure accountability. Discussions continue, as does our fight for transparency.

ICE Regularly Ignores FOIA Requests

As Trump sends more immigration agents to Chicago, the records released by ICE offer a glimpse of the scale of its operations — and a reminder of how difficult it is for the public to track what’s going on.

In the days after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, ICE and other federal agencies launched visible — and sometimes televised — “enhanced targeted operations” in Chicago.

But ICE officials refused to provide any specifics about their raids, including basic information such as how many people were arrested, what they were charged with and where they were taken afterward. The agency ignored more than a dozen inquiries from Block Club reporters in addition to questions from other news organizations.

“Thank you for your email,” said one typical response from ICE’s media contact. “I am out of the office.”

At the end of January, I submitted a FOIA request for records showing ICE arrests and detentions in Chicago or the Chicago area from Jan. 21 through Jan. 30.

By law, federal agencies have a month to respond to FOIA requests. But in another automated email, ICE told me officials would need more time.

Over the next two and a half months, I sent the agency 10 emails asking for an update. I didn’t get any responses.

On May 1, Block Club sued ICE and its parent department, Homeland Security, for violating the federal FOIA. Block Club is represented by the FOIA team led by attorney Matt Topic at Loevy + Loevy. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.

“Plaintiff Block Club Chicago brings this suit to force Defendants … to conduct a reasonable search, issue a determination, and produce records regarding arrests and detentions in the Chicago region from a ten-day time frame” in January, Block Club’s complaint states.

It took almost two months before ICE agreed to release the arrest data from January — and even then, the agency wouldn’t provide everything we asked for, including the names of the people agents picked up.

As Block Club’s experience illustrated, ICE rarely provides specific information to the public except when the agency is sued over records requests, according to immigration experts and attorneys.

“There is no other way to get them to respond to FOIA requests, and the backlog is getting worse,” said Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance. The nonprofit represents a range of individuals and organizations seeking government transparency and safeguarding immigrants’ rights.

While the Trump administration is pouring more resources into immigration enforcement agencies, “they’re not putting it toward complying with the law, and FOIA is the law,” Realmuto said.

After receiving 59,300 FOIA requests in the 2024 fiscal year, ICE still had 22,246 pending when the year ended Sept. 30, according to an annual report from the Department of Homeland Security.

Altogether, Homeland Security agencies had 220,112 requests pending in September 2024, including 134,406 for Customs and Border Protection.

Block Club is hardly alone in seeking immigration enforcement records. Through a series of FOIA requests and lawsuits, a group of attorneys and professors put together the Deportation Data Project, which includes a library of datasets they’ve shared with the public.

Federal officials did not disclose names and other personal identifiers in that data, but it includes other details of immigration arrests and detentions across the country from September 2023 through this July. The records include the state where each arrest occurred, the individual’s country of citizenship and birth year and the status of the case.

Over the past few months, researchers, advocates and journalists have used these datasets to offer snapshots of who’s been apprehended and deported, including recent stories in the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ.

To update the data, the Deportation Data Project has to make new FOIA requests every month. And each time, “we have to threaten litigation again,” said David Hausman, an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and one of the project’s co-directors.

Hausman said they’re working to get a court to order the regular release of data so they don’t have to go through the FOIA process each time.

“You just really can’t get any information from ICE without litigation,” Hausman said.

Earlier today, the U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory said in a 72-page report that Israel’s government is responsible for four of the five acts prohibited under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The report holds three Israeli leaders responsible: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog. Navi Pillay, who heads the commission, drew parallels between Israel’s assault on Gaza and the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

Navi Pillay: “Genocide is occurring in Gaza. … In the Rwandan genocide, the group were the Tutsis, and here the group are the Palestinians.”

The findings could be used by prosecutors at the International Criminal Court or the U.N.’s International Court of Justice.

Israel’s military says it has launched a major ground offensive to seize Gaza City and displace its 1 million residents. Israel’s defense minister says quote, “Gaza is burning.” Gaza health officials report at least 68 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes since dawn, most of them in Gaza City. This is Fatima, an elderly resident of a tent camp close to the Al-Ghefari building in western Gaza City, which Israel bombed into rubble on Monday.

Fatima: “I cannot stand on my legs out of fear. Enough hunger, thirst and fear. When they did this, I collapsed completely. I cannot walk.”

The Palestinian Civil Defense reports Israel has blown up over 50 Gaza high-rises in recent weeks.

In Geneva, Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, said Monday Israel’s military is destroying entire neighborhoods and the remnants of buildings where people were seeking shelter.

Francesca Albanese: “It’s trying to forcibly evacuate the 800,000 Palestinians who were seeking refuge there. But the question is 'why?' Why? Because this is the last piece of Gaza that needs to be rendered unlivable before advancing the ethnic cleansing of that piece of land, and then probably they will move to the West Bank.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is in Doha today for talks with Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, in the wake of Israel’s deadly strike last week targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Rubio’s trip comes after leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday they had agreed to activate a mutual defense pact in response to Israeli aggression. Meanwhile, Axios reports Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu informed President Trump last Tuesday morning that Israel planned to attack Hamas leaders in Qatar nearly an hour before the strike took place. That report contradicts White House claims that Trump was notified only after missiles were in the air, giving him no opportunity to oppose the strike.

President Trump said Monday the U.S. had carried out a strike against a second boat he alleged was carrying drugs from Venezuela, killing at least three people on board. Trump made the announcement on social media and posted a video of an apparent airstrike, showing a speedboat erupting in flames. This follows a strike earlier this month on another boat also allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, which reportedly killed 11 people. Speaking to The New York Times, Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter, a retired top judge advocate, said, “Trump is normalizing what I consider to be an unlawful strike.” Here’s Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro speaking shortly before the second strike.

President Nicolás Maduro: “This is not tension; it is outright aggression — judicial aggression, when they criminalize us; political aggression, with their daily threatening statements; diplomatic aggression; and possible military aggression. Venezuela is empowered by international law to comprehensively confront this aggression. It is not tension; it is aggression.”

FBI Director Kash Patel says investigators have found DNA evidence linking 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson to the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in Utah last week. Utah County prosecutors will formally arraign Robinson today; they’re planning to seek the death penalty.

On Monday, Vice President JD Vance vowed to dismantle institutions on the political left that he claimed were promoting violence and terrorism. Vance made the remarks while hosting Kirk’s podcast “The Charlie Kirk Show.”

Vice President JD Vance: “Of course, we have to make sure that the killer is brought to justice. And importantly, we have to talk about this incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism that has grown up over the last few years and, I believe, is part of the reason why Charlie was killed by an assassin’s bullet. We’re going to talk about how to dismantle that.”

Joining Vance’s call for retribution were White House adviser Stephen Miller, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt and Health Secretary RFK Jr. Since Kirk’s killing, scores of politicians, public figures and private-sector workers have faced firings, suspensions or investigations over their comments about the assassination — among them, The Washington Post’s last remaining full-time African American opinion columnist, Karen Attiah. In a post on Substack Monday, Attiah wrote, “Last week, the Washington Post fired me. The reason? Speaking out against political violence, racial double standards, and America’s apathy toward guns.”

President Trump signed an order Monday authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to Memphis, Tennessee, in support of a new federal task force to combat violent crime in the city. Trump’s order came just days after the Memphis Police Department reported crime is at a 25-year low, with robbery, larceny and burglary all at record lows over the past eight months. Tennessee Democrats gathered in Memphis Monday to condemn Trump’s crackdown. This is state Representative Justin J. Pearson, who represents Memphis.

Rep. Justin Pearson: “Today, it is a conversation about crime. In 14 months, it will be a conversation about protecting the vote at the vote — at the voting booth. In three-and-a-half years, it’s going to be about a presidential election and the need to protect it. And what happens when we go to the polls, and the National Guard is there, and all they’re doing is asking you, 'Are you sure you want to vote?' This isn’t just a slippery slope; this is a dangerous impediment on our democracy.”

President Trump said Monday that New York Governor Kathy Hochul’s endorsement of Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election was “a very bad one for New York City.” Trump suggested that he would consider holding back federal funds from the city if Mamdani is elected.

After headlines, we’ll look at Trump’s escalating immigration crackdown on Chicago with Congressmember Delia Ramirez. Trump has also threatened deploying U.S. troops to Chicago.

A New York Times report has revealed how a member of the ruling family of the United Arab Emirates invested $2 billion in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency company just days before the UAE received access to rare artificial intelligence chips. Back in May, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan invested $2 billion into World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency startup run by the Trump and Witkoff families — Steve Witkoff is President Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East. Two weeks later, the Trump administration approved the sale of hundreds of thousands of AI chips to the Emiratis, despite concerns that the chips could be shared with China.

The Times report did not directly link the two deals, but cast suspicion on the timing. Ryan Cummings, chief of staff at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy, said, “If this is true, this is the largest public corruption scandal in the history of the United States and it’s not even close.”

The Trump administration said Monday it has reached a deal with China to keep TikTok operational in the United States, after Trump threatened to shut down the popular social media platform, saying it poses a national security concern. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says Trump will speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday to finalize the deal. It’s not clear who the U.S. buyer will be, but it’s widely expected to be led by Oracle co-founder and chair Larry Ellison, who last week briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world’s richest person.

Larry Ellison has a decades-long history with the Republican Party and has frequented Trump’s Mar-a-Lago for dinners and has met Trump in the Oval Office. He’s also an ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, donating money to Israel’s military through the nonprofit Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.

This comes just months after the Trump administration cleared the way for an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance, which is run by David Ellison, son of Larry Ellison. According to The Wall Street Journal, Paramount Skydance is exploring a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, which would put two of Hollywood’s most powerful legacy studios under the same owner.

Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance is reportedly in talks to hire Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief or co-president of CBS News. Weiss has opposed diversity and inclusion programs and is an ardent supporter of Israel’s war on Gaza; her publication The Free Press has called widespread reporting on famine conditions there “a myth.”

Senate Republicans have confirmed one of President Trump’s top economic advisers, Stephen Miran, to the Federal Reserve Board. In an unusual arrangement, Miran will only take a leave of absence from his role as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, instead of resigning from his post. Miran says he intends to return to the White House after his term ends. The move allows Miran to attend the Fed’s two-day meeting to set interest rates, which starts today.

Meanwhile, a U.S. appeals court blocked Trump’s attempt to fire Federal Reserve

Governor Lisa Cook before today’s interest rate meeting. In an opinion, Appellate Judge Bradley Garcia wrote, “Before this court, the government does not dispute that it provided Cook no meaningful notice or opportunity to respond to the allegations against her.” President Trump has repeatedly demanded that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates fast, and has threatened to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",https://assets.democracynow.org/assets/default_content_image-354f4555cc64afadc730d64243c658dd0af1f330152adcda6c4900cb4a26f082.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 13:57:14.668883

Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and eight states are continuing operations in the city.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to once again federalize Washington, D.C.’s police force, in what he suggested could come in response to the city’s mayor’s stated refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Trump’s emergency order, which took over the local police force, expired last week. Hours before it elapsed, Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the city would not cooperate with Immigration, Customs and Enforcement in their continued operations in the nation’s capital. Earlier, she had said the city would work with other federal agencies even after the emergency order expired. In an early-morning social media post on Monday, Trump said his intervention into the D.C.’s law enforcement had improved crime in the city, a claim Bowser has backed up, though, data shows crime was already falling in Washington before the law enforcement surge began. Trump said crime could increase if cooperation on immigration enforcement ceases, in which case he would “call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!” The mayor’s office declined to comment. The White House did not say if Trump would follow through on his threat. It also did not say whether the president had considered trying to extend his previous order that placed the city’s police force under federal control. The order was not renewed by Congress and lapsed September 11. Later Monday, speaking in the Oval Office where he signed an order sending the National Guard into Memphis, Trump said they would federalize the police in Washington if they had to, “but we don’t have to anymore, because it’s in such great shape.” Bowser issued an order September 2, setting up how the local police will continue working with the federal law enforcement agencies that continue working in the city. The order listed a number of federal agencies she anticipated working cooperatively with the MPD, the local police, including the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Secret Service, among other agencies. Absent was ICE. Speaking September 10 at a ribbon cutting ceremony, the mayor said “immigration enforcement is not what MPD does,” referring to the local police department. She added that when the emergency order ends, “it won’t be what MPD does in the future.” Data analyzed by the Associated Press during the emergency period showed that more than 40% of arrests were immigration related, highlighting that the Trump administration continued to advance its hardline immigration policies as it sought to fight crime in the nation’s capital. Federal law enforcement agencies and National Guard units from D.C. and eight states are continuing operations in the city. The district’s attorney general filed a lawsuit opposing the use of the military in the city. On Monday, a group of former civilian leaders and retired four-star level officers weighed in on the case, highlighting what they said were the dangers of presidents deploying the National Guard for law enforcement, which they said could pose “safety concerns for servicemembers and the public alike.” Among the officers, who served during both Republican and Democratic administrations, was former National Security Agency director Michael Hayden. Trump’s threat comes the same day that the House Committee on Rules is taking up several D.C.-related bills, including a proposal to lower the age at which juveniles can be tried to 14 from 16 for certain serious crimes, as well as restricting the district’s authority over its sentencing laws and its role in selecting judges. The bills passed out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last week on a party-line vote. The district is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973, but federal political leaders retain significant control over local affairs, including the approval of the budget and laws passed by the D.C council.

“What President Trump is doing is unprecedented, unnecessary, and an affront to our city’s ability to govern itself.” – Rep. Steve Cohen

President Donald Trump has intensified his immigration crackdown, deploying National Guard troops to Memphis, threatening to federalize the District of Columbia’s police department, and ramping up deportation operations in cities like Chicago.

The moves mark the latest escalation in the administration’s nationwide enforcement campaign, drawing both support and outrage across the country as immigrant communities brace for what they describe as a new era of fear and intimidation.

In Memphis, Trump ordered the deployment of 500 National Guard troops after what he described as a surge in violent crime. His decision followed an Oval Office address in which he vowed to use federal power to restore law and order, saying he would not hesitate to intervene when local governments failed to keep residents safe.

The White House said the Guard would assist local police with patrols, checkpoints, and “community stabilization efforts.”

Local leaders expressed alarm at the militarized response, with critics warning it could erode trust in already vulnerable communities and escalate tensions rather than calm them.

The deployment comes at a moment when Trump has openly linked crime and immigration, portraying both as threats that demand extraordinary federal intervention. Supporters of the move argue that Memphis, a city with one of the highest homicide rates in the country, needs urgent help.

Critics say the deployment risks setting a precedent in which federal troops are used in domestic law enforcement far beyond their intended role, raising constitutional questions and fueling concerns about civil liberties.

Democratic leaders sharply criticized the move.

“This is not about public safety — it is about politics,” said Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat who represents Memphis. “What President Trump is doing is unprecedented, unnecessary, and an affront to our city’s ability to govern itself.”

Cohen added that the decision “ignores local solutions and community trust in favor of heavy-handed federal control.”

Trump has also threatened to take control of Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department, citing its refusal to fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. “If they don’t want to work with us, we’ll take it over,” Trump told reporters at the White House.

The threat underscored the administration’s willingness to assert federal authority over local police when immigration enforcement is at stake. The District’s mayor and city council leaders responded by saying such a move would violate the city’s limited home rule and further destabilize community-police relations at a time when trust is already fragile.

At the same time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has launched what officials are calling Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, focusing on arrests in the heavily Mexican-American neighborhood of Pilsen.

The Department of Homeland Security said the operation has led to arrests of people accused of robbery, assault, and other violent crimes. In one incident in a Chicago suburb, an ICE officer fatally shot a man during a vehicle stop after the man struck and dragged an officer while fleeing, according to the agency.

The shooting inflamed concerns in immigrant neighborhoods, where residents said the raids have upended daily life and silenced the normally vibrant celebrations surrounding Mexican Independence Day.

The streets of Pilsen, ordinarily bustling in September with music, house parties, and food vendors, were subdued this year. Attendance at the annual Mexican Independence Day parade appeared far lower than in previous years. Many residents said they stayed indoors, fearful of raids.

“Something has got to break,” said Carlo Romano, 52, a hair colorist and naturalized citizen from Mexico City. “Democrats throw the ball to Republicans, and Republicans throw the ball to Democrats, and there’s no concrete solution to the problem.”

Other residents voiced frustration at both parties, blaming Trump’s heavy-handed tactics and what they described as Democrats’ decades of failures on immigration reform.

“He let all the immigrants come in from Venezuela, and now all these raids are the cost of that,” said Ventura Alvarez, 56, a Mexican-American born in Chicago. “And the people who are here that came from Mexico? They never got nothing.”

Some residents said the fear extended even to families with legal status, as rumors of raids spread quickly through the community.

Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, said her office had fielded 6,000 requests in the last eight months from residents seeking dual citizenship for themselves or their children.

“The fear is general — it doesn’t matter what your status is, the whole family feels the uncertainty,” Torres Mendivil said.

In interviews, some said they felt abandoned by both major political parties. Isabel Hernandez, 50, a naturalized citizen from Mexico who grew up in Pilsen, pointed to past administrations.

“Obama deported millions of people — you just didn’t see it on television,” she said. Longtime resident Rafael Vieyra, 85, a permanent legal resident, said he had seen anti-immigrant crackdowns come and go for decades as he moved back and forth between Chicago and his native state of Guanajuato in Mexico.

“I’ve seen it all,” he said. “This is the worst period yet.”

Though many residents stayed indoors, others looked for ways to resist. At the parade earlier this month, Mexican cowboys known as charros passed out “know your rights” flyers.

People wore bright orange whistles around their necks to warn others if ICE raids unfolded. Local businesses reported steep declines in customers, with vendors waiting for crowds that never came. Some families described canceling quinceañeras or birthday parties for fear of drawing attention.

Nationwide, the Trump administration has accelerated partnerships between local police and federal immigration enforcement under the controversial 287(g) program. In Pennsylvania, the number of local law enforcement agencies signing agreements with ICE surged from 10 to 39 in recent months, including county sheriffs, district attorneys, and constables’ offices.

“The Trump administration is very aggressively seeking to sign more 287(g) agreements,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council. Opponents argue the program erodes trust and exposes local governments to legal and financial risks, while ICE insists it strengthens public safety.

The ACLU has strongly condemned the expansion.

“This is about transforming local police into a deportation force,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. “It undermines community safety, it encourages racial profiling, and it strips away the protections that keep immigrant families from living in constant fear.”

The 287(g) agreements authorize local police to perform certain federal immigration functions, such as identifying and detaining people for possible deportation. ICE has promoted the program as a force multiplier, giving the agency more capacity without significantly expanding its workforce.

The Trump administration has tied new funding to the program, offering reimbursements of up to 25 percent of the salary and benefits of trained officers and quarterly performance bonuses for successful enforcement actions.

Critics, however, say the program incentivizes aggressive enforcement while exposing municipalities to lawsuits.

In Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Sheriff Fred Harran’s decision to join ICE sparked public protests and a lawsuit. County commissioners warned that employees who cooperated with ICE could be personally liable, calling the partnership an inappropriate use of taxpayer resources.

Advocacy groups warned that the arrangement would erode trust with immigrant communities and undermine public safety by discouraging victims and witnesses from coming forward.

Despite the backlash, ICE officials say more partnerships are signed every week, and in some states local law now requires them. Texas passed a measure this summer mandating county sheriffs to participate, while Florida approved a similar law in 2022 requiring police agencies that operate detention facilities to sign agreements.

Trump’s actions have sparked protests in cities and towns where residents say the administration’s tactics amount to intimidation. In Chicago, immigrant rights groups set up hotlines to track sightings of ICE vehicles.

In Pennsylvania, the ACLU and other organizations sued local sheriffs who signed agreements, arguing that some agencies lacked legal authority to join the program. Across the country, church leaders and community groups have held know-your-rights workshops and organized networks to provide food and shelter to families disrupted by raids.

Supporters of Trump’s policies insist they are necessary to restore order and protect communities. “This is about illegal immigration,” said George Rabiela, 70, a retired Chicago firefighter and naturalized citizen. “It does hurt me to see that people who have lived here all their life, they’re getting caught in the net, but they are illegal.”

For many, the crackdown has sharpened feelings of disillusionment with the political system itself. Residents in Pilsen described shifting loyalties, with some noting that support for Trump in the neighborhood ticked upward in 2024 compared to prior elections. Others said they had grown weary of Democratic promises of reform that never materialized. A generational divide was also visible, with younger activists pressing for sanctuary protections while some older residents expressed sympathy with Trump’s emphasis on security.

Trump’s actions in Memphis, Washington, Chicago, and beyond underscore a strategy of deploying military force, expanding ICE partnerships, and leveraging federal authority in pursuit of mass deportations.

For immigrant communities, the result has been fear, anger, and deepening distrust in government.

For supporters, the crackdown represents long-overdue enforcement after decades of what they view as failed immigration policies.

As the raids and deployments continue, the clash between these competing visions of law, order, and belonging is shaping the national political landscape in profound and divisive ways.

ICE has rescinded a policy that had shielded many victims from detention and removal.
Of those detained, many have been declared ineligible for release under another ICE policy change.
“Any contact with any level or kind of state or federal law enforcement, civil or criminal, puts you in danger of detention by ICE.” ICE removed protections for crime victims in January In January, ICE rescinded a policy that called on agents to generally avoid detaining and seeking to remove immigrants who have been crime victims.
But instead, he has been at the Muscatine County Jail in ICE detention for nearly three months.","Days after he nearly died when an assailant shot him during a robbery attempt, Felipe de Jesus Hernandez Marcelo went to an Iowa police station hoping to get his belongings back.

The police in Muscatine, Iowa had his car and the cash he was carrying when he was shot and nearly killed on June 21. Hernandez, 28, recalled in court testimony that the department said he couldn’t have those items back. Instead, police arrested him on an old warrant for failing to pay a traffic ticket.

Within hours, Hernandez was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He’s been detained ever since pending removal proceedings, having entered the country illegally from his native Mexico in 2021.

Hernandez is one of a growing number of crime victims and relatives who have been arrested and indefinitely detained during the Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

ICE has rescinded a policy that had shielded many victims from detention and removal. The number of people applying for visas that allow some victims and their families to remain in the country appears to have plummeted. Others are being detained as they go through the lengthy application process. Of those detained, many have been declared ineligible for release under another ICE policy change.

Critics say the outcome is not only cruel to victims and their families but is harming public safety by making those who are in the U.S. illegally unlikely to report crimes and cooperate with police.

“This type of thing is now the new normal. This scenario is happening every day in every city,” said Dan Kowalski, a retired attorney and expert on immigration law. “Any contact with any level or kind of state or federal law enforcement, civil or criminal, puts you in danger of detention by ICE.”

ICE removed protections for crime victims in January

In January, ICE rescinded a policy that called on agents to generally avoid detaining and seeking to remove immigrants who have been crime victims. It protected those carrying so-called U and T visas that allow crime and human trafficking victims and their relatives to remain in the country. The protections extended to those who had applied for such visas and were awaiting decisions, which can take years to process.

Hernandez is seeking to apply for a U visa, and would appear to be eligible as the victim of a felony assault and key witness against the two charged in the attack. But the Muscatine County prosecutor Jim Barry has yet to certify his eligibility, according to Hernandez’s attorney. Barry didn’t respond to messages.

The Biden-era policy called on ICE agents to look for signs immigrants had been victimized and to consider that as “a positive discretionary factor” when deciding whether to detain them. The goal was to avoid discouraging immigrant victims from cooperating with police in reporting and solving crimes.

But some conservatives have argued that victimization alone should not entitle immigrants to a benefit.

The new policy allows ICE agents to detain crime victims, including the U and T visa holders, as long as they check with police “to ensure criminal investigative and other enforcement actions will not be compromised.” Agents aren’t required to look for any evidence of victimization.

Applications for visas for crime victims dropped in first months of 2025

The number of applications for U visas dropped by nearly half in the quarter that ended in March, which included the first 2½ months of the new Trump administration, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Some immigration lawyers say the drop reflects concerns that an application by itself will put someone on the government’s radar for potential removal.

Immigration lawyer Bethany Hoffmann said one of her clients, whose wife had been a kidnapping victim, was arrested by ICE when he showed up to an appointment to be fingerprinted as part of the U visa application process.

“I have been practicing for 17 years and I have never seen that before,” she said, adding that the man had no criminal history but was subject to a 10-year-old removal order.

Court documents show other U visa applicants across the country have been taken into custody by ICE, including a woman detained in Maine who had been assaulted and kidnapped in 2021.

ICE is indefinitely detaining many who would have previously been out on bond

Compounding the impact is another new practice in which ICE and immigration judges have required the indefinite detention of anyone who entered the country without permission.

Over the past 30 years, immigration lawyers say many such detainees would have been able to be released pending removal proceedings as long as they were deemed not to be a flight risk or danger to the community. With a steady job, local relatives and a minimal criminal history, Hernandez would have been a candidate for release.

But instead, he has been at the Muscatine County Jail in ICE detention for nearly three months.

Hernandez has been apart from the 9-year-old son he was raising as a single father, unable attend medical appointments critical for recovering from his gunshot wounds, and unable to work the construction job that paid his family’s bills.

He said he was denied medicine for the first five days as he suffered in excruciating pain, he said.

“I was locked in a single cell for several days. It felt like forever,” Hernandez recalled this month in court testimony.

A federal judge ruled on Sept. 10 that ICE’s detention of Hernandez without a bond hearing was illegal, and ordered an immigration court to hold one within seven days. She found that he was suffering “irreparable harm” in the meantime. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",https://molawyersmedia.com/files/2025/09/AP25254551543581.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:57:31.913508

But last month, he found himself on a layover at the airport in Cairo, frantically trying to avoid boarding a flight to Moscow. The United States was deporting him alongside dozens of other Russians after rejecting his pleas.

As the Egyptian authorities boarded the final people onto the deportation flight, Mr. Vovchenko, 26, loitered in the restroom, possibly hoping he could resist, abscond or somehow be forgotten. He had no such luck.

Egyptian guards pulled him out of the bathroom and roughed him up, leaving him with an injury on his forehead. They marched him onto the flight and to the back of the cabin, tying him to a middle seat. The plane soon began gliding toward Moscow. Mr. Vovchenko cried for much of the flight. He knew what would come next.

This episode was recounted by a woman who sat near Mr. Vovchenko on the plane and spoke to The New York Times, as well as by a man on the flight whose account was posted online by a Russian human rights activist.

Mr. Vovchenko’s plight represents a new reality for Russians who are struggling to persuade American judges to allow them to stay in the United States on account of their political or religious views. As President Trump accelerates deportations, some are being sent back to Russia, despite facing imprisonment or worse at home.

“Parents are saying, ‘Well, we're leaving … we don't want to live where there's ICE on the streets, so we're leaving Chelsea,' ” Abeyta said.
Across Chelsea, the ramp-up in ICE arrests has parents on edge, according to Daniel Mojica, who runs Chelsea schools’ Parent Information Center.
The biggest portion — about half the students leaving Chelsea — are bound for other U.S. states.
That could result in a $5.7 million shortfall for Chelsea schools; the state sends the district about $19,000 per pupil.","Hundreds of students have left Chelsea public schools this year, as families exit a community — and a state — that’s become a prime target for immigration enforcement.

Chelsea superintendent Almi Abeyta said school staff tell her some parents are moving to places where there's less heat on immigrants.

“Parents are saying, ‘Well, we're leaving … we don't want to live where there's ICE on the streets, so we're leaving Chelsea,' ” Abeyta said.

Chelsea has long been a community of immigrants, some of whom have been in this country for decades. The city has among the highest concentrations of immigrants in Massachusetts, with 45% of residents born abroad. School administrators said 85% of students live in a home where English is not the primary language.

Across Chelsea, the ramp-up in ICE arrests has parents on edge, according to Daniel Mojica, who runs Chelsea schools’ Parent Information Center.

“It's got a different feeling in the air,” Mojica said. “The school year's going to be different, and I think it's going to continue on like this for the next three years.”

Chelsea doesn’t ask for students’ immigration status, but Mojica said parents worry about whether ICE can enter the schools. He tells them what he knows: Agents can't go in without a warrant signed by a judge, but he can’t control what happens outside the school doors.

Mojica oversees transfers in and out of the district. He said roughly 990 students have transferred out of the district since last October. Based on those who have submitted transfer forms that indicate where they're going, Mojica estimates a quarter are enrolling in other districts in Massachusetts. Another quarter are leaving the country for places like Honduras, Guatemala and Colombia. The biggest portion — about half the students leaving Chelsea — are bound for other U.S. states.

Mojica said one striking trend is that most of the families are moving to Republican-leaning states, including Florida, Arkansas, Alabama, Ohio and South Carolina. One day in early September, an elementary school reported four student transfers: two said they were headed for Texas and two planned to leave the country.

The district expects to lose a net 300 students from last year's 6,100 enrollees, about a 5% decline. That could result in a $5.7 million shortfall for Chelsea schools; the state sends the district about $19,000 per pupil.

The student departures won’t affect funding for the current school year, Abeyta said, but officials will likely have to start planning cuts to next year’s budget.

“We staff according to numbers, and so when we're looking at numbers, we will have too many staff” for the lower student headcount, she said.

“It's never a fun conversation when you're talking about cutting positions.”

Chelsea isn't the only district that will face hard decisions in the months ahead, said Mary Bourque, a former Chelsea superintendent who now heads the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents. Based on a meeting she had Friday with officials from urban districts across the state, Bourque said Chelsea is one of several school systems losing students from immigrant families.

“What we're seeing is certainly an exodus from our districts,” Bourque said.

Chelsea has six months to finalize next year’s school budget. Abeyta said the city could increase funding for the schools, while Chelsea School Committee member Sarah Neville said she hopes the state will help soften the blow — for example, by tapping into funds raised under the so-called ""millionaire's tax"" for investments in transportation and education.

“We might have fewer students, but we still have the same amount of school buildings and we still have the same electrical bills — all that overhead stays the same,” Neville said.",https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0426_chelsea-04-1000x607.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 12:57:13.094759

“Anyone – regardless of immigration status – who assaults an ICE officer WILL face federal felony assault charges and prosecution to the fullest extent of the law,” the agency posted on X. Embedded in the post was an image that read “think before you resist” with a clenched fist.

The post represents a direct public threat of prosecution, and the broad language could allow prosecutors to pursue federal assault charges for actions that would traditionally be classified as resisting arrest or even protest activities.

But the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has expanded its definition of threats to include filming Ice operations. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, defined “violence” in July as “anything that threatens [DHS agents] and their safety. It is doxing them. It is videotaping them where they’re at.”

One example of that has been the case of Spanish-language, Georgia-based journalist Mario Guevara, who was detained for more than two months after he filmed enforcement operations, despite his attorneys saying he had legal work authorization.

The message also follows the DHS’s claims in August that attacks on Ice officers have increased by 1,000%, though when pressed for examples, officials told the Prospect that incidents included trash dumped on an agent’s lawn and a profanity-laden sign targeting an agent by name. In one notable case, the FBI put out a $50,000 reward for someone who “appears to fire a pistol” at Ice during a raid on a farm in California.

Federal prosecutors have also filed assault charges against multiple protesters this year, with some cases involving actions that would traditionally fall under resisting arrest. In the suburbs of Chicago last week, an Ice officer fatally shot an individual during a traffic stop after the person allegedly dragged the officer.

Yet Ice operations appear to only be intensifying, as a supreme court ruling last week removed legal barriers that had limited agent authority in California, prompting DHS to vow it would “flood the zone in Los Angeles”.

The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31e84ac00879bff2838d6676a0836bf0b6077d1b/474_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=78b80ee3225ee725bb90bf1ae1fde243",N,,2025-09-16 12:57:16.821767

It’s like a horror movie.’”

Officers at the facility, the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, La., soon placed Mr. Cortes De La Valle on suicide watch. This meant solitary confinement, where he fought off biting ants and endured black mold on the wall and feces in his cell, according to a complaint he later filed against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the staff at the detention center. The lights, kept on 24 hours a day, aggravated his seizure condition.

In November 2023 he voluntarily accepted deportation to Colombia. In his complaint against ICE officials, he said that he attempted suicide four times during his year at the Jena facility, including twice that July. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security found that ICE and its contractor had discriminated against him.

Since January, the Trump administration has been pursuing its promised campaign to deport tens of thousands of immigrants. More than 60,000 people were in detention as of August, many of them in overcrowded facilities where some detainees sleep on bare floors, eat rotten food and often cannot access the medicines they need, according to immigration lawyers. Watching from Colombia, where he now lives, Mr. Cortes De La Valle reflects on what he would tell detainees: “Don’t give in to the dark place.”

But many have thoughts of suicide, and some have taken their own lives. At least 12 immigrants are known to have died in ICE custody since Jan. 1. They include at least two people by suicide: Jesus Molina-Veya, in June at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia, and Chaofeng Ge, last month at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Pennsylvania.

The problem is not new. Under the Biden administration, 26 detainees died in ICE custody, of which at least four were either publicly reported as or suspected to be suicides.

Family members said that Oliveira was leaving a bakery in downtown Milford when agents approached — he attempted to get away but was caught. His father said that he was pinned to the ground and taken away in a dark SUV.

On Tuesday morning, Oliveira's parents appeared before immigration officials at the ICE field office in Burlington. They had been concerned they may wind up in custody, but walked out of the office smiling and thanking supporters who were outside.

“I hope no other family and no other parents have to go through this situation,"" Itamer De Oliveira said in Portuguese. ""I want you to thank you for the support and your prayers.”

According to DHS, this was a routine operation to determine his identity and if he was a potential safety threat. They said the agents had no idea he was a minor. Once they learned that, they called his parents to come pick him up. Officials said his parents refused, so ICE drove him home.

The family's attorney said they have a pending asylum case and that the parents have no criminal history. Itamer said that he's had a work permit for more than five years.

Itamer spoke to NBC10 Boston Monday — we've translated his comments from Portuguese.

""They're treating us like animals,"" he said. ""We're not criminals. We work, pay taxes, play nice with society — there's no problem.""

""This government just wants to destroy families... and destroying families means destroying its own country.""

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin released the following statement to NBC10 Boston.

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn’t be right to “hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts.” ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE’s presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Trump aims at so-called ‘sanctuaries’

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0"" on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,” she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

Detainees housed in facilities across New England

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Families in hiding as more ICE sightings reported

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some at risk for detention who are also the primary caretakers of their families.

“Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Asylum-seekers and other legal immigrants targeted

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE’s latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

“We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,” she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is “trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

“I think you’re going to see more and more how families are going to be torn apart, how individuals with no criminal history, with pending forms of relief, pending applications are just going to be rounded up,” she said.

In greater Washington and around the country, teams of masked officers from D.H.S.","Eight years ago, Sara Fernandez flew into Newark, New Jersey, on her way back from the Dominican Republic, where her boyfriend lived. As she was going through airport security, she heard a T.S.A. agent say to one of his colleagues, “Do I need to pick her up and put her through the scanner?” Fernandez has dwarfism; she identifies as a little person. She also happened to be a new hire in the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which oversees anti-discrimination enforcement for the Department of Homeland Security, including T.S.A. “The guy obviously didn’t know I worked for D.H.S.,” Fernandez recalled. He had made her feel “really awkward and uncomfortable,” but she didn’t want to get him in trouble, so she contacted T.S.A. and scheduled a phone call with him. “I wanted to be, like, ‘You upset me. Look at me. I’m a professional,’ ” she said. After their call, “he got some training. Moments like that can actually stick with a person more, because he got to hear it from me.”

Fernandez was raised in Pittsburgh by adoptive parents, also little people, who’d met at an annual meeting of Little People of America. Her mom’s family was “historically Republican,” in a moderate, John McCain kind of way, Fernandez told me. Her dad had emigrated from Argentina and worked as an accountant. “I have a picture of us at his naturalization ceremony, with American flags,” she said. Her parents weren’t political, but they believed in equal rights and taught their daughter not to feel limited by her stature. Still, she recalled, “as a kid, I was very reserved, observant, anxious. I didn’t want anyone to notice me.” Fernandez earned degrees in law and social work, and entered federal service through the Schedule A program, which expedites the hiring of qualified candidates with disabilities. She started at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, then went to D.H.S. in 2017, during the first Trump Administration. She married the man she’d been dating, who’s of average height, and gave birth to their son, a little person who’s now five years old.

Being in a civil-rights office, Fernandez often thought about the laws that made her career possible. In the federal government, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination on the basis of “a physical or mental disability,” and requires that “reasonable accommodations,” or tweaks to working conditions, be provided to disabled employees. (In 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act extended this protection to workers in state and local governments and the private sector.) D.H.S. gave Fernandez an accessible parking spot, placed step stools in common areas of the office, and brought over the customized chair she’d used at the E.E.O.C. During the pandemic, when she was dealing with an autoimmune sickness, her supervisor allowed her to work from home. “It was the best environment I’ve ever worked in,” she said.

Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had issued executive orders to improve access and opportunities for civil servants with disabilities. The first Trump Administration also “prided itself on continuing efforts around disability hiring and retention,” Daniel Davis, a disability expert who recently left the Department of Health and Human Services, told me. More than a tenth of the federal workforce identified as disabled in fiscal year 2021 (the most recent data available), including a great number of disabled veterans. In the past decade, the over-all employment rate for adults with disabilities has risen from seventeen per cent to nearly twenty-three per cent, with a big jump since 2020. The pandemic that killed more than 1.2 million Americans and caused many others to become disabled also led employers to offer flexible schedules and remote-work arrangements that made it easier for disabled people to do their jobs.

Fernandez’s office was at D.H.S. headquarters, at St. Elizabeths, a huge campus in Washington, D.C. that was once the grounds of the Government Hospital for the Insane. Not long ago, people with disabilities had been relegated to such institutions, often against their will. At the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or C.R.C.L., Fernandez was part of a team that enforced anti-discrimination and language-access laws, led equal-opportunity trainings, and reviewed requests for accommodation for D.H.S. employees. In 2023, she appeared alongside Alejandro Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland Security at the time, at a conference that marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Rehabilitation Act. They posed for a photo—Fernandez wore a blue pleated dress, her hair down to her shoulders—that was later published in an agency newsletter.

C.R.C.L. also set policies for, and handled complaints from, the public. Its jurisdiction was vast, ranging from the encounter Fernandez had at Newark Airport to much graver incidents: sexual harassment in immigration detention, neglect of wheelchair users in FEMA disaster recovery, racial bullying in the Coast Guard, assault by federal security guards.

Last year a group funded by the Heritage Foundation set up a website, “DHS Watch List,” to publicize the names and photographs of immigration judges and bureaucrats it deemed “subversive.” It described C.R.C.L. as “a bastion for leftist [sic] who want to use the tools in the department to frustrate efforts to deport illegal aliens.” Fernandez was surprised by this characterization. C.R.C.L. was a law-enforcement agency within a law-enforcement department—so unprogressive, in fact, that friends in the disability community had asked how she could even work there.

Early this year, when the Department of Government Efficiency started to push large-scale layoffs, Fernandez reassured herself that, because C.R.C.L. was mandated by the founding statute of D.H.S., its hundred and fifty or so employees would be protected. In late March, she learned otherwise. Her position, according to an e-mail from Human Resources, was being eliminated as “a result of the dissolution of Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.” The entire office was found to be “non-essential or not legally mandated,” as were two smaller offices that conducted oversight of the immigration-detention system and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. A spokesperson for D.H.S. referred to the three as “internal adversaries.” Civil-rights mechanisms at Homeland Security were essentially wiped out. Fernandez would be put on paid administrative leave for sixty days, then terminated at the end of May. She packed up her office and left.

One way to parse Donald Trump’s approach to disability is on the basis of his public comments. At a campaign rally in 2015, he mocked the hand movements of a disabled reporter. In his first term, he told aides that he didn’t want to appear with military amputees because “it doesn’t look good for me.” In 2020, according to a memoir by Trump’s nephew, who has a disabled son, the President said, of people with serious disabilities: “The shape they’re in, all the expenses, maybe those kinds of people should just die.” And this year, after his second Inauguration, he said that Biden’s recruitment of “individuals with ‘severe intellectual’ disabilities” were partly to blame for an aircraft collision over the Potomac River that killed sixty-seven people.

Fernandez had been so rattled by the general chaos in the Administration that her layoff initially came as a relief. Her husband, their five-year-old son, eight-year-old stepdaughter, and four dogs kept her more than occupied, especially when school let out for summer break. “Do you want some kids to live with you?” she joked to me one day, by text. “Mine are available.” After bedtime, she would go online to browse and exchange messages about crystals and rocks, which she’s collected her whole life. She posted closeups of blue lace agate and pink sugar amethyst on Instagram.

But the relief soon curdled into worry. Her family relied on her salary and health insurance; her husband, who is Dominican and has a green card, took irregular freelance gigs as a construction worker, a personal trainer, a dance instructor, and an Uber driver. She would have to find a new job soon, but where? She had only ever been in the public sector, and by choice. “I want to do good work, but also, I want to move the world forward,” she said.

Across the federal government, the kind of work she’d done at C.R.C.L. seemed increasingly in peril. The Department of Housing and Urban Development cancelled grants that go to poor people with disabilities. (A spokesperson told me that HUD continues to serve “Americans who are not able bodied or able minded.”) At the Department of Health and Human Services, a division that helps disabled people and seniors live at home had its staff cut in half. Trump’s trillion-dollar reduction in Medicaid spending, meanwhile, could make it harder for disabled people to access long-term care. The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education laid off nearly fifty per cent of its personnel, though some staff have since been rehired. According to a lawyer there, disability discrimination complaints were “our bread and butter, the bulk of our caseload.” Now, “the agency is just not carrying out its statutory function. They’re dismissing thousands of cases.” The Department of Labor withdrew a plan to establish a minimum wage for workers with disabilities and abolished wage protections for the home-health aides who assist millions of seniors and disabled people. “Prior to this year, there was such a hope that the needle had moved,” Verlencia Somuah, a former employee of D.O.L. who is legally blind, told me. “Now, I’m looking for employment. Do I even say I’m a person with disabilities?”

Disabled government employees have struggled to obtain accommodations that were once routine. The Administration’s mandate to return to full-time, in-person work spurred “huge influxes in requests for telework,” Anupa Iyer Geevarghese, who crafted disability policies during the Biden Administration, told me. “With civil-rights offices being gutted, how are agencies going to process these requests?” (Twenty-eight per cent of federal employees currently have a hybrid-work arrangement, compared with fifty-one per cent for employees over-all.)

Civil servants I spoke with reported backlogs and waits of up to five months for a decision. Some resorted to filing union grievances or complaints with their agencies; requests that languished or were denied could be appealed to the E.E.O.C. Disabled workers at the E.E.O.C. were themselves fighting to get, or keep, their accommodations. In addition to telework, employees needed flexible hours to fit medication schedules, standing desks for bad backs; those with autism or A.D.H.D. needed key dates and instructions in writing. Two former E.E.O.C. employees told me that the agency’s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, had taken the unusual step of reviewing more than a year’s worth of approved and pending accommodations requests. (The E.E.O.C. did not respond to a request for comment.) The Department of Veterans Affairs announced plans to reëvaluate existing accommodations. “Everyone is on edge, wondering, is your accommodation safe?” Somuah, the former D.O.L. employee, said. Another federal employee, who has chronic pain and a condition that requires the use of a wheelchair, had previously worked on a hybrid schedule. The new Administration, she said, required her to apply for a formal accommodation and submit extensive medical records, even though her need for hybrid work was obvious to her supervisors. Her request was still pending when she resigned. (A White House spokesperson told me, “The Trump-Vance administration values the contributions of government employees with disabilities and believes they should be recognized and rewarded based on the merit of the work.”)

Fernandez said that she was “worried for employees with disabilities that are still working at D.H.S. If they aren’t getting what they need, it’s going to make it seem like they can’t do their job.” In April, civil-rights groups filed a federal lawsuit against D.H.S. over its closure of C.R.C.L. and the two ombudsman offices. D.H.S. told the court that all three offices were in fact still open. C.R.C.L. was apparently being run by two people; there were plans to recruit around twenty more. “The staffing numbers would be just a tiny fraction of what the office was before,” Karla Gilbride, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told me. As of August, only two full-time employees had been added. A group of fired workers submitted a separate whistle-blower letter to Congress. C.R.C.L., they said, can no longer perform its duties, including investigating “allegations of disability discrimination and deaths in custody.” They estimated that “approximately 550 open complaint investigations and hundreds of allegations pending review” had been abandoned. A representative for D.H.S. would not answer my questions, but told me that “C.R.C.L. is performing all legally required functions.”

This summer, I met Fernandez at a strip-mall Starbucks near her home in Virginia. We ran into a FedEx deliveryman she knew from her frequent crystal shipments. A woman at the next table kept staring and butting into our conversation. Was she eager to pick up gossip about the federal bureaucracy? Or was it because Fernandez was a little person? “People take videos of us all the time,” Fernandez told me. We moved to a table outside, despite the extreme heat.

Three months had passed since her firing. Soon she would have to start paying more than two thousand dollars a month to keep her family on health insurance. Her biggest concern, though, was her husband’s safety. In greater Washington and around the country, teams of masked officers from D.H.S. were raiding courthouses and patrolling immigrant neighborhoods. Though it had never been Fernandez’s job to weigh in on immigration policy, she’d had faith that even people taken into custody had rights, and could submit complaints to C.R.C.L. Now, she had no one to call if something happened to her husband, who has a dark complexion and speaks halting English. “In this atmosphere, I’m always worried about speaking Spanish in public,” she explained. “What if he gets pulled over for nothing?”","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68bee2f29add9884161b4dfe/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/IMG_3596.jpeg",N,,2025-09-16 11:57:56.594010

Similar protests have cropped up throughout the Chicago area during the Trump administration’s so called “Operation Midway Blitz,” including last week, when Mayor Daniel Biss and Kat Abughazaleh (who are both running to represent Illinois’ 9th Congressional District) joined anti-ICE protesters outside of a Department of Homeland Security processing facility in Broadview.

Abughazaleh has spoken out against ICE and in support of immigrants, posting on X that she was “so glad” to be joined by Biss in Broadview and calling for other candidates and elected officials to protest.

Both Biss and Abughazaleh were once again in attendance at Monday’s protest, which was organized by the Pink Poster Club.

On Sept. 10, the Evanston Police Department confirmed that Homeland Security personnel arrested a suspect in a “criminal matter” the week prior near Church Street and Brown Avenue, after they were present in the same area conducting a criminal investigation.

“This is dark,” Biss said, addressing the crowd. “The attacks that we are seeing are outrageous. They are coming for LGBT people, and they are minutes away from coming for all of us, and in this moment, we have to stick together.”

With a City Council meeting scheduled to begin immediately after the protest, a few other elected officials were also in attendance, including Shawn Iles (3rd Ward), Jonathan Nieuwsma (4th), Juan Geracaris (9th) and City Clerk Stephanie Mendoza.

“Evanston believes deeply in our role as a welcoming city, and our City Council has been preparing for this awful moment, passing what is one of the strongest welcoming city ordinances in the country before Donald Trump took office in January,” Biss said, “to make sure that our police will not collaborate, not only with ICE, but with anyone else doing civil immigration enforcement on behalf of the federal government.”

Emily Miller, co-founder of the Pink Poster Club, led protestors in chants and introductions throughout the hour-long demonstration.

Another rally is in the works for Sunday, Oct. 5, according to Miller.

Miller helped form the Pink Poster Club after President Donald Trump began his second term, she said. Since then, the group has distributed thousands of flyers and posters across the country.

“We’re just getting started. I think flyering is very fun again. I encourage you to join us, but it also has become secondary to our mission, which is building community and community resiliency in a face of a rising authoritarianism,” she said on Monday.

“And I think it’s been clear this past year, and this past week especially, that no one’s coming to save us. So it’s up to us. It’s up to me and you, moms and teachers, journalists, photographers, musicians, artists, cashiers, everyone and anyone who’s brave enough to take a stand.”

By 5 p.m., about a hundred people were in Fountain Square with their own posters, including Kevin, who declined to give his last name out of concern for his safety.

“I’m a child of immigrants, so for me it’s very important to come to these events whenever I can and wherever they are,” he said. “The least I can do for my family, my heritage, is to rise up and show that we deserve to be here, and I hope this continues.”

He said the diverse crowd who spent a Monday afternoon protesting ICE “filled his heart with hope to see people of different cultures, different races, come out and support people like my family.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3076-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 11:58:19.723854

BOSTON (AP) — Immigrants are being detained while going to work, outside courthouses, and at store parking lots in Metro Boston as President Donald Trump targets so-called sanctuary cities in his effort to ramp up immigration enforcement.

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

Just north of Boston, the city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it wouldn’t be right to “hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials like New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts.” ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE’s presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

Trump aims at so-called ‘sanctuaries’

Cities like Boston and Chicago — where Mayor Brandon Johnson has also condemned the Trump administration’s recent immigration crackdown, calling it an example of “tyranny” — have become targets for enforcement in recent days. Trump also threatened to potentially deploy the National Guard to Chicago, though he had wavered on a military deployment last week.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they’re interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0″ on the heels of a May crackdown where nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won easily. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,” she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

Detainees housed in facilities across New England

ICE has contracts to detain people at multiple correctional facilities across New England, including county jails as well as the federal prison in Berlin, New Hampshire, and a publicly-owned, privately operated prison in Central Falls, Rhode Island.

Volunteers monitoring flights carrying detainees from New Hampshire’s Portsmouth International Airport at Pease have documented the transfer of more than 300 individuals since early August, with at least five flights per week transferring people from New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts. All of the detainees have been in shackles, said David Holt, who has been organizing regular protests at Pease.

Protesters gathered at venues like the ICE office in Burlington, where three participants were arrested on trespassing charges.

Families in hiding as more ICE sightings reported

Luce, the Immigrant Justice Network of Massachusetts, staffed its hotline with interpreters who speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Mandarin, and Haitian Creole to collect information about ICE sightings. The organization put out a call for volunteers who speak languages like Cape Verdean Kriolu, Nepali and Vietnamese to help manage the influx.

Kevin Lam, co-executive director with the Asian American Resource Workshop, a community group that works on immigration and other issues, said they have seen a “spike” in ICE activity, including five Vietnamese residents from a Boston neighborhood who were detained last week.

He and other advocates said many immigrants have expressed fear about everyday tasks like picking up their kids at school and riding on public transportation. However, he said many are still attending work, with some at risk for detention who are also the primary caretakers of their families.

“Many of them are like, ‘Yeah, it is a risk every day when I step out, but I need to work to be able to provide for my family,’” he said.

Asylum-seekers and other legal immigrants targeted

Republican Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Leah Foley said she is “100% supportive” of ICE’s latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Noncriminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

“We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,” she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates like Lam pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others who are here legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond “bad immigrants” with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal Education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is “trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

It adds that it's up to the applicant to satisfy the visa officer that they meet the requirements for a visa.","Immigration professionals and people applying to enter Canada say they're increasingly getting refusal letters they think don't make sense — leading them to wonder whether their cases are being fully and properly reviewed by a human being.

Toronto immigration lawyer Mario Bellissimo began to have concerns after seeing multiple examples, such as a case he worked on where the officer refused an application on the grounds that no birth certificate was included, even though he says a copy of the birth certificate was attached to the application.

""It worries me as an applicant and as a lawyer for an applicant: what is actually being looked at?"" Bellissimo told CBC News.

Immigration professionals like Bellissimo are pointing to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada's use of computer-assisted decision-making technology as the problem.

Although IRCC acknowledges it has developed computer programs that allow officers to sort and process applications faster, it rejects the idea these programs affect the thoroughness of officers' reviews.

IRCC says human officers make the final decision on eligibility and admissibility for immigration cases. It says refused applicants get ""thorough correspondence"" from the department.

""Decisions about whether an applicant meets these requirements are made by highly trained officers who assess each application against the relevant program criteria,"" IRCC said in an email statement to CBC News.

But multiple immigration professionals told CBC News they're concerned some IRCC officers are refusing applications without checking all the submitted documents.

""[Refusals] should never infringe or breach procedural fairness. And in order to do that, it is required that the officer looks at every single document in the file,"" said Annie Beaudoin, a retired senior immigration officer for IRCC who is now an immigration consultant.

""And lately, there is evidence that that is not done.""

Why IRCC turned to technology in decision-making

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has faced immense public pressure to deal with backlogs and long processing times, which can take years in some cases.

How long does a Canadian visitor visa take? 500 days later, these parents are still waiting

Immigrant entrepreneurs say years-long wait for Canada's startup visa leaves them in limbo

Numbers released by IRCC at the end of July indicated there were more than 2.2 million applications in IRCC's systems. Of those, more than 901,000 had exceeded the department's time standards for processing and were considered back-logged.

Beaudoin, who worked for 15 years in the immigration department's Los Angeles office, says that when she started in 2004, there was ""much less pressure.""

She says that by the time she retired in 2018, managers would regularly remind officers of quotas for the number of cases to process in a given time. She felt there was a lot of pressure to go fast, and less emphasis on the quality of the work.

The department began to use a computer model in 2018 called ""advanced data analytics"" to sort cases and help officers make eligibility decisions. It claims the system can speed processing by up to 87 per cent.

In an email, IRCC said advanced analytics uses ""machine learning technology"" to find patterns in data, such as how likely it is that a specific type of applicant has been approved by an officer in the past.

It says advanced analytics doesn't recommend refusals; only human officers can do this, ""based on their own review.""

For the human review step, IRCC developed a spreadsheet-based tool called Chinook to allow officers to examine and approve or refuse multiple cases at the same time. It offers officers boilerplate language to explain their decision.

IRCC describes Chinook as a tool to ""simplify"" the displayed information for the officer. The agency emphasizes the tool itself doesn't use any artificial intelligence and doesn't make or recommend decisions.

But immigration lawyer Bellissimo, who has made submissions to parliamentarians on IRCC's use of new technology, worries it can lead officers to miss or skim over parts of applications.

He says he has seen some decisions with time-stamps that suggest the officer only considered the case for a couple of minutes, which in Bellissimo's view should not be viewed as a ""badge of honour.""

""It does not instill the confidence we need in an immigration system to foster a belief that we are processing applicants in a fair and transparent manner to the benefit of Canadians,"" he said.

A 2018 Chinook user manual released under access to information suggests an officer can use the system to examine up to 1,000 cases at the same time.

Vancouver immigration lawyer Will Tao, who wrote a master's thesis on IRCC's use of technology, is concerned that officers can use Chinook to take ""bulk"" actions, giving the same answer to multiple cases. The feature can be used for both refusals and approvals.

Internal IRCC documents state officers can use Chinook to make decisions on up to 150 applications, which IRCC says can all be added into its information management system at once.

In a 2023 briefing note, IRCC described bulk processing as important for handling growing numbers of cases efficiently.

""This bulk and blanket treatment of individuals definitely has had a negative impact on the system,"" Tao told CBC News.

Tao acknowledges IRCC's view that the tools do not affect the officers' decisions, but he thinks the ""line between the two is quite thin.""

""What it does do is it alters decision-making,"" he said.

Speed of processing

Chinook was first rolled out in some IRCC offices in 2018. An IRCC document released under access to information in 2022 praised the efficiency in processing cases that offices from Ankara to London were able to gain by using Chinook.

It even noted that computer problems in some offices meant ""strong processing officers were down to 60/day compared to their usual 75+/day.""

Beaudoin says she saw but never used an early version of Chinook before retiring from the L.A. office.

In the last year, in her work as an immigration consultant, she says some of her clients have received refusals she feels defy logic. She cites the example of a work permit refusal on the grounds that only one employment-related document was submitted, when in fact multiple documents were included.

""As a [former] immigration officer, I have a lot of sympathy and compassion, because officers have a lot of pressure to do a lot of decisions extremely fast,"" she said. ""And that's when these problems occur.""

In its statement to CBC, IRCC says it trains officers to ""carefully and systematically"" assess all applications and make decisions ""based on the information presented before them."" It adds that it's up to the applicant to satisfy the visa officer that they meet the requirements for a visa.

Beaudoin says the department is willing to acknowledge and reconsider errors, but she says a refusal based on an incomplete review of a file is unfair.

Other immigration professionals are equally worried.

In an open letter to IRCC on Aug. 13, the Canadian Immigration Lawyers Association wrote, ""The introduction of automated and analytic tools to assist decision makers is in our opinion directly linked to the increase in decisions that are neither meaningful nor well-reasoned.""

Family reunification

When applicants disagree with an officer's reasons for refusal, they may ask IRCC to reconsider. That was the case for Chandni Ajwani and Jay Dave, whose application to be reunited in Canada was initially refused.

Ajwani is a Canadian citizen and lives in Montreal, while Dave is an Indian citizen who lives in Ahmedabad, India. The couple married in July 2023.

They have a spousal sponsorship application underway, which is expected to take some time to complete. In the meantime, Dave applied for a visitor visa so he could see Ajwani in Canada.

""When you're staying at a distance, that is something that pinches you a lot,"" Dave said.

In December 2024, an officer rejected the application for a visitor visa, saying Dave had insufficient funds and that the visit wasn't consistent with a temporary stay.

The couple, who work in finance and human resources, disagreed with that reasoning, and told CBC they submitted many documents to prove their incomes.

The notes on the officer's reasoning for refusal didn't mention a Canadian spouse or that Ajwani has an active sponsorship application for Dave.

Their immigration consultant, Beaudoin, expected to see at least some acknowledgement of that relationship, and believes an officer gave insufficient attention to the file.

This led Beaudoin and the couple to ask for a reconsideration. Dave's visitor visa was eventually granted in March 2025.

Ajwani says she was upset and felt the application wasn't examined fairly the first time.

""There was anger, I'm not gonna lie. And the sad part is I know that's not how Canada functions. Our immigration system is quite fair,"" she said.

IRCC plans to keep using computerized tools to assist its officers, saying in a statement it has assessed the impacts and considers technology ""essential to modernizing our immigration system.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7631833.1757629776!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/immigration-visas-20230606.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-16 12:57:09.024450

As families hole up in homes — afraid to leave and risk detainment — advocates are reporting an increased presence of unmarked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement vehicles sitting in parking lots and other public areas throughout immigrant communities, where agents appeared to target work vans. One man captured a video of three landscapers who were working on the Saugus Town Hall property being arrested after agents smashed their truck window.

The city of Everett canceled its annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival after its mayor said it would not be right to “hold a celebration at a time when community members may not feel safe attending.”

The actions have been praised by public officials such as New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who signed legislation this year banning sanctuary city policies in her state, vowing not to let New Hampshire “go the way of Massachusetts.” ICE this summer began utilizing a New Hampshire airport about an hour from Boston to transport New England detainees.

However, others argue that ICE’s presence in Massachusetts is doing more harm than good.

“This is really increasing the fear in communities, which is already incredibly high,” said Elizabeth Sweet, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition.

The U.S. Department of Justice on Sept. 4 filed a lawsuit against Mayor Michelle Wu, the city of Boston and its police department over its sanctuary city policies, claiming they were interfering with immigration enforcement. In response, Wu accused Trump of “attacking cities to hide his administration’s failures.”

Now, ICE has launched an operation it called “Patriot 2.0″ on the heels of a May crackdown in which nearly 1,500 immigrants were detained in Massachusetts. Its latest operation came days before a preliminary mayoral election, where incumbent Wu won comfortably. The mayor has become a frequent target over her defense of the city and its so-called sanctuary policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Boston surge would focus on “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” living in Massachusetts.

“Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but protect them at the peril of law-abiding American citizens,” she said in a press release early last week, which detailed the arrest of seven individuals by ICE, including a 38-year-old man from Guatemala who had previously been arrested on assault-related charges.

The agency did not respond to requests from The Associated Press about the number of immigrants detained since “Patriot 2.0” began.

Asylum-seekers and other legal immigrants targeted

U.S. Attorney Leah B. Foley said she is “100 percent supportive” of ICE’s latest operation in the state and that her office will not hesitate to prosecute immigrants without legal status who commit crimes. Non-criminals have also been swept up in raids that ICE calls “collateral arrests.”

“We stand ready to charge individuals who violate all federal laws, including those who enter our country without authorization after being deported and those who assault federal law enforcement officers or impede or interfere with federal officers doing their jobs,” she said in a statement to the AP.

Advocates pushed back on claims that ICE agents are only targeting criminals, saying that with fewer protections for asylum-seekers and others in the country legally, the strategy seems to be going well beyond immigrants with records.

Alexandra Peredo Carroll, director of legal education and advocacy at the Boston-based Mabel Center for Immigrant Justice, said the Trump administration is “trying to fit folks into this narrative of being illegal or having broken the law, when in fact, many of these are individuals who are actually going through the legal process.”

TOP TALKER

MORE ARRESTS: The Trump administration is ramping up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area with 250 individuals taken into custody, according to Congresswoman Lauren Underwood, the ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Underwood, who was briefed Monday on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in the region, expressed concern about the impact on Illinois.

“Everyone deserves to feel safe in their community. Like all Illinoisans, I’ve been concerned and alarmed by reporting about ICE’s conduct and operations in our state under Donald Trump,” said Underwood, who had pushed for the briefing about “Midway Blitz,” as the operation has been named.

ICE activity took a deadly turn Friday when a federal officer fatally shot a person who had allegedly injured an ICE agent during an arrest. The lack of details surrounding the incident has drawn criticism from elected officials and residents alike.

“We need more information,” Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Monday. “If this were the Chicago Police Department, if this were the Sheriff’s Office in Cook County, if this were Illinois State Police, you would have had a lot more information already released.”

In a wide-ranging speech, Pritzker said that heightened federal activity is causing fear across communities that has been exacerbated by the political tensions since the assassination of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.

Threats are on the rise: Pritzker told reporters he’s received an increased number of threats since Kirk’s death. Mayor Brandon Johnson has similarly seen an increase in threats, according to a person close to the mayor.

Pritzker called it a “watershed moment,” saying “Americans must come together and say clearly that threats and political violence are not the answer.”

He listed recent acts of violence targeting Republicans and Democrats — including “the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump, arson at Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home … the assassinations of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and the shootings of State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife.”

“It’s now incumbent upon leaders of all stripes to work together to stop [political violence]. Most especially, this should come from the top,” Pritzker. said. “Yet with each new crisis in recent years, we are reminded that we cannot rely on President Trump to tamp down the anger and the passion in the aftermath of political violence. Instead, he actively fans the flames of division.”

Pritzker emphasized that leadership requires a choice: “We can choose to stay silent and live in fear of more political violence, or we can choose to be loud for peace, for compassion and for an America where people settle their political differences through free speech and at the ballot box. Let’s be those people.”

Illinois House Republicans scoffed, asserting in a statement that Pritzker has been “one of the loudest voices” escalating political rhetoric and pointing to his comparing Trump policies to Nazi Germany.

Meanwhile in Washington, the president again threatened to send the National Guard into Illinois. “We’ve got to save our big cities,” Trump told reporters at the White House, adding after sending troops to Memphis, Chicago is “probably next.”

That won’t be a surprise. Pritzker warned earlier, “We never really know what [Trump] intends to do.”

THE BUZZ

A MADIGAN TRIBUTE: Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, who has largely stayed out of the public eye since his conviction earlier this year on bribery and corruption charges, broke his silence to honor the late Gov. Jim Edgar.

“Shirley and our family express our condolences upon Jim Edgar’s passing. We send sympathy and prayers to Brenda, Brad and Elizabeth,” Madigan said in a statement Monday.

The longtime Democratic leader reflected on his years working alongside the former Republican governor, recalling both his wife’s role as chair of the Arts Council and his own as speaker.

“We worked with Jim ... We found him to be at times conservative, but generally moderate, as when as a Republican he supported the pro-choice position concerning reproductive rights. We worked with him to find common ground among competing interests in developing the State budget, where he was always supportive of the Arts Council,” Madigan wrote.

“We found him to always be respectful of others; personally and with regard to governmental and political views. Illinois is a much better place because of Jim Edgar. Shirley and I have lost a good friend.”

— FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: State Rep. Nick Smith won’t seek reelection, capping off an eight-year term in the Illinois General Assembly.

The surprise decision came “after much thought and careful consideration,” the Democrat told Playbook. “Serving as a member of the Illinois General Assembly in the House of Representatives has been an honor of a lifetime. Serving the people of the 34th Representative District and the state of Illinois has been an absolute privilege.”

Smith was appointed in 2018 and won every election after that. A chemistry major at heart, Smith’s legislation has been focused on workforce development, environmental justice and infrastructure investment, often working across ideological lines to find practical solutions.

His departure will leave a significant vacancy in a district that straddles urban and suburban concerns, stretching from Chicago’s Pullman neighborhood to parts of the south suburbs. Smith’s exit sets the stage for a competitive Democratic primary.

Wilson, in a statement Monday, said the Education and Justice departments recently rescinded 2015 federal guidance that clarified states’ obligations to English Learner students.

The rollback, say the lawmakers, threatens to weaken enforcement of existing laws, strip protections for nearly 5 million students nationwide, and limit the ability of parents with limited English proficiency to make informed decisions about their children’s education.

The new Treasury sanctions also follow lockstep with Israel’s near-identical sanctions against human rights groups and activists.
On June 30, Israel imposed sanctions on Al Haq Europe, Law for Palestine, the Hind Rajab Foundation, Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, and DAWN, where I am the executive director.
As with the U.S., Israel explained these moves as punishment for the work these groups did with the ICC’s Palestine prosecution.
Both the Israeli and U.S. sanctions clearly violate the Rome Statute, the treaty that established and governs the ICC.","For decades, the Treasury Department has politicized its authority to impose sanctions. Now, however, with the Trump administration sanctioning three Palestinian human rights organizations, civil society activists around the world are shocked and terrified: Could they be next?

The alarm is due to the brazen willingness of President Donald Trump to sanction the staff of these Palestinian groups specifically because of their advocacy with the International Criminal Court to hold Israeli war criminals accountable.

It’s the first time the U.S. has levied sanctions against an organization specifically for its efforts to use lawful, peaceful tools of advocacy in pursuit of legal accountability. There is no pretense other than the groups’ work on legal issues that the administration doesn’t like.

Trump has global civil society directly in the crosshairs.

Copying another page from the authoritarian playbook, Trump now has global civil society directly in the crosshairs of the U.S. government’s legal, financial, and criminal arsenals. The next disfavored issue, these groups fear, could be climate change, arms control, or reproductive rights — virtually anything.

To justify its recent sanctions against Al Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, the Treasury announcement said the groups “directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals.”

The only other sanction the U.S. ever imposed on a human rights organization was earlier this year against Addameer, a Palestinian group that the Trump administration claimed was linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization.

Blocking Accountability

Trump has gone far out of his way to shield Israel from any form of judicial accountability for its atrocities in Gaza, illegal occupation, and apartheid rule.

The sanctions on the Palestinian organizations follow extensive attacks and threats against the ICC itself, including sanctions against the ICC prosecutor who secured the arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. Later, four of the judges who approved the warrants were also sanctioned.

The new Treasury sanctions also follow lockstep with Israel’s near-identical sanctions against human rights groups and activists. On June 30, Israel imposed sanctions on Al Haq Europe, Law for Palestine, the Hind Rajab Foundation, Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights, and DAWN, where I am the executive director. Additionally, Israel targeted individual staffs of these organizations, myself included.

As with the U.S., Israel explained these moves as punishment for the work these groups did with the ICC’s Palestine prosecution.

Both the Israeli and U.S. sanctions clearly violate the Rome Statute, the treaty that established and governs the ICC. Article 70 of the treaty prohibits obstruction of justice, and the sanctions by Israel and the U.S. are seeking to interfere with the court’s prosecution.

For Americans caught up in the sanctions, there are also First Amendment issues. The sanctions could chill protected speech, advocacy, or engagement by hanging “material support” charges over the heads of those who would work with the ICC or the sanctioned Palestinian organizations. Federal courts have already concluded that this chilling effect can take place, issuing preliminary injunctions in two cases in favor of plaintiffs who argued the sanctions had impinged on their free speech rights.

Short of a judicial ruling overturning the sanctions entirely, however, Americans will remain in fear of prosecution simply for talking to the court or these organizations.

All for Israel

The effectively unregulated ability of the U.S. to deploy its powerful sanctions arsenal has now moved beyond the usual grounds of terrorism, human rights abuses, or violation of U.S. laws or other sanctions to include anything the Trump administration disfavors.

There’s nothing to stop this administration from seeking to sanction any other organization in the world for pursuing advocacy odds with Trump’s worldview.

The Biden administration’s feeble effort to reform America’s gargantuan global sanctions regime, which it critiqued as an overused “tool of first resort,” ended up producing a seven-page report and zero concrete action.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and congressional Republicans have made no secret of their aim to crush pro-Palestine activism with every tool available. Immigrant students were the first targets, swept into deportation proceedings for their speech about Palestine.

Now, the administration and its allies are pursuing more concrete moves. Last week, Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., introduced a bill that would allow the secretary of state to revoke the passports of Americans they accuse of giving material support to a terrorist group.

As happened with immigrant students, the provision could easily be used to label criticism of Israel as tantamount to support for Palestinian groups, such as Hamas, designated as terrorists by the U.S. (Following The Intercept’s coverage of the bill and widespread opposition to the measure, Mast moved to strike the language.)

The passport bill followed a narrowly defeated effort to include a provision in Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that would allow the Treasury Department to strip nonprofit organizations of their tax-exempt status merely by accusing them of supporting terrorism.

Efforts to quash Israel’s prosecution at the ICC with these sanctions may seem less dangerous than U.S. military and financial support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza, efforts to annex the West Bank, and military attacks against seven other countries in the Middle East. And the sanctions may be less consequential than the unprecedented attack on academic freedom by punishing universities for speech critical of Israel.

What the sanctions do, though, is open up an entirely new front for the Trump administration’s global attack on civil society around the world — all in defense of Israel.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2223423623_f3b0ab-e1757969892748.jpg?fit=4000%2C4000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-09-16 11:58:00.147158

Since 2014, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has operated a secretive program in which ICE agents train civilian volunteers in the operation of firearms, surveillance of immigrants, and use of lethal force against others.

ICE describes its courses, called Citizens Academies, as a way to educate civilians “intrigued by the Enforcement and Removal Operations Unit mission.” That unit’s mission, according to ICE’s website, is the “arrest and removal of aliens.”

Volunteers also participate in simulations of drug busts, executions of warrants, surveillance of immigrants, and detentions, some of which feature violent or shoot-to-kill maneuvers taught in Citizens Academies by ICE agents. ICE has planned or conducted multi-week Citizens Academies in over two dozen U.S. cities and had planned at least 30 courses in 2020.

The scope and details of Citizens Academies were not known until October 2024, when ICE produced documents in response to litigation filed by Organized Communities Against Deportations (OCAD) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). For the first time, agency documents detail ICE’s decade-long initiative to engage civilians in surveillance, detention, and weapons training.

Over 6 to 10 weeks, groups of about 20 civilians participate in Citizens Academies, meeting for 2 to 4 hours weekly, and up to 8 hours for firearm trainings. Civilian participants are instructed by federal agents from ICE’s two enforcement offices, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), sometimes in cooperation with local law enforcement.

ICE’s website lists the Academies as outreach programs designed to strengthen ties with local leaders and to promote community cooperation by teaching participants about HSI’s offices, operations, and “how to partner with [ICE-HSI] to improve the safety and security of our local communities.”

At Citizens Academies, participants conduct “mock investigations, learn defense tactics and even participated in mock surveillance,” according to HSI Executive Associate Director Derek Brenner. Invitations sent by ICE to Chicagoans in 2020 advertised “scenario-based training” that included “defensive tactics, firearms familiarization, and targeted arrests,” all centered on interactions with immigrants.

Participants in one Kansas City Citizens Academy spent their second and third weeks on live weapons fire and on what agents call a “takedown night.” Live-fire scenarios appear integral to Citizens Academy agendas, and ammunition is included in the cost of the course.

In Kansas City, internal ICE emails show that HSI agents prepared a 3-hour “room clearing instruction” activity with scenarios that placed civilian participants in the role of ICE agents or local officers entering a “shoot house” to arrest suspects for drug trafficking and firearm possession. Two of the four simulated arrests on HSI’s agenda are tagged with the instruction “This is a SHOOT scenario no other outcome should happen.”

Congressmembers Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Robin Kelley (D-Ill.) of the House Judiciary Committee wrote to ICE’s Acting Director in 2020 requesting information on Citizen Academy participants’ use of real or simulated firearms. ICE did not publicly respond to the legislators, but Congress’s request for basic information—How many Academies are there? Where have Academies been held? On what criteria does ICE select participants?—highlights how little was known about Citizens Academies outside of ICE-HSI before the 2024 FOIA lawsuit.

According to an internal memo, the ICE-HSI Citizen Academy program was first launched as a pilot in 2014 in Puerto Rico and expanded to ICE field offices during the first Trump Administration. OCAD noted that ICE hosted many Citizens Academies in sanctuary cities in cooperation with local law enforcement, including in several cities with policies “limiting information-sharing [by local police] with ICE in certain circumstances.”

Citizens Academies are neither schools nor academic programs, though ICE refers to past participants as “graduates,” and ICE agents present volunteers with certificates at “special ceremonies.”

But Citizens Academies are not open to all citizens. ICE has advertised that HSI and ERO Citizens Academies are open to community “stakeholders,” but they are usually not open to the public at large. Rather, ICE is strategic about whom it selects to invite, relying on existing relationships with news media and businesses to determine whom it invites to apply.

A memo prepared by HSI’s Executive Associate Director in 2020 or 2021 states that Citizens Academies are designed to counter “current negative opinion” toward ICE “fueled by harmful headlines or political views.” ICE views Citizens Academies as “critical and instrumental in changing that narrative and improving community relations,” according to the memo.

A 2022 “Communications Plan” lists the types of people ICE prioritized for recruitment: “Media, Hill, Academic leaders, Business/community leaders, Prosecutors and local and state law enforcement, Local citizens, Non-governmental organizations.” One Academy in Austin invited Texas Governor Greg Abbott to give a keynote speech to the graduating stakeholders, among whom were reporters from ABC and NPR, a community liaison from Austin’s police department, and three congressional staffers, according to an ICE email.

Although participants’ information is partially redacted in ICE documents, OCAD noted that employees at major American banks comprised a significant portion of Citizen Academy attendees, along with several legislative staffers at the state and national level. Victims advocates, criminal justice professors, local journalists, and religious leaders have also participated in Citizens Academies.

Among the documents released in October 2024 are training slideshows used in Citizen Academies, which include instruction on the two highest levels of force taught to ICE agents: hard techniques and deadly force.

So-called “hard techniques” include take-downs and riot baton strikes. ICE instructs participants using detailed maps showing where to strike someone with a baton or weapon in “vital and vulnerable striking areas.”

One ICE-HSI slideshow instructs participants on the legal standards for law enforcement officers’ use of lethal force, such as when they may fire at fleeing suspects or moving vehicles. In another slideshow, ICE-HSI includes instructions for civilian participants to yell “‘Police, drop the gun,’ while drawing and firing on the target,” as justification for using deadly force.

In 2020, ICE spokesperson Nicole Alberico told Newsweek that “ICE is not training anyone to do immigration enforcement” and that Citizens Academies “show the community what this training [for federal law enforcement officers] looks like.”

Many non-profit and community organizations have questioned the public benefit of Citizens Academies. Genia Blaser, hotline director at the Immigrant Defense Project, stated that ICE was “recruiting people who could incite vigilante violence in communities.” Congressmembers Jamie Raskin and Robin Kelley wrote that “role-playing exercises—complete with simulated firefights—are of dubious public benefit.”

Worries over vigilantism against immigrants has risen in recent years, especially along the Mexico–U.S. border, where armed civilian groups who claim to collaborate with police and immigration agents also film themselves “conducting patrols…issue orders, and detain and even point guns at migrants.” In 2024, Arizona lawmakers attempted to expand the state’s “castle doctrine” to allow property owners to use or threaten deadly force against trespassers anywhere on their farmland, and not just their home or yard. Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed the bill, stating that it valued “property over human life and incentivizes vigilantism.”

Months into the second Trump Administration, ICE officers have rounded up and deported tens of thousands non-citizens and U.S. citizens without presenting identification or warrants. ICE agents’ conduct during many arrests—plainclothes agents swarm a suspect, then pull them into an unmarked vehicle—makes it easier for civilians to kidnap or otherwise abuse people by impersonating ICE agents.

Civilians impersonating ICE have proliferated in 2025, with prominent cases in South Carolina, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Washington. The Democratic Women’s Caucus wrote to DHS and ICE about a spike in ICE impersonators attacking women, citing several reports of men in ICE gear using threats of violence or deportation to assault and sexually assault women. The Congresswomen argue that ICE protocols excusing agents from showing official badges and photo identification endangers law enforcement legitimacy and citizens, also noting that “fake ICE jackets became a ‘best seller’ on Amazon in February of this year.”

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons defended the use of masks to protect ICE agents and their families, citing death threats and harassments towards agents while emphasizing the agency’s singular focus on deportations in line with President Trump’s policy goals.

Ramirez's green card application had been improved prior to his detention, according to a letter written by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reviewed by Chicago Sun-Times.

Why It Matters

Immigration enforcement has been a key focus of the Trump administration. On President Donald Trump's first day of his second term, he signed 10 executive orders and proclamations related to immigration. During the administration's first 100 days, ICE reported that it arrested 66,463 undocumented immigrants and removed 65,682.

What To Know

Sergio Ramirez and his wife, Kristina Ramirez, were near the U.S.-Canada border on May 29 when they realized they were going the wrong way and turned around, Chicago Sun-Times reported. The husband and wife were pulled over, searched and questioned by federal agents, the outlet reported.

Sergio told the outlet that he was detained for three months before deciding to self-deport after receiving advice from his lawyer.

Kristina, a U.S. citizen who was born in Illinois, told the outlet that she was detained for three days. She said she showed her driver's license, but DHS and ICE officers still questioned her about where her parents were born and accused her of being ""illegal.""

A CBP spokesperson previously told Newsweek that ""the assertions Mrs. Ramirez was held by CBP for 3 days are a bold face lie.""

""CBP has no indication Mrs. Ramirez was held for 3 days. Her and her husband were referred to secondary for not having the proper U.S. travel documents on May 31,"" the spokesperson said.

Sergio told Chicago Sun-Times that he did not have any criminal record.

""My husband has a legit Social Security number and his work permit. I'm an American citizen, and we have all our documents. Who's thinking that, 'Oh my God, they're going to take us?'"" Kristina said.

The Department of Homeland Security told the outlet, ""Being married to a U.S. citizen, or any pending application for a visa, does NOT shield an illegal alien from removal proceedings. All of his claims will be heard by an immigration judge. The Trump administration is not going to ignore the rule of law.""

What People Are Saying

A CBP spokesperson, in previous comments to Newsweek: ""After inspection and questioning, CBP determined Mr. Ramirez is removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality Act and was turned over to ICE. Mrs. Ramirez was subsequently admitted into the U.S. on June 1.""

Sergio Ramirez, in comments to Chicago Sun-Times: ""There's a lot of people that came to the United States to work and better their lives, and not everybody's the same. There's some people that are bad, but not all of them. We still have a lot of good people out there.""

Kristina Ramirez, in comments to Chicago Sun-Times: ""My greatest fear already happened. My greatest fear was that he self-deported.""

What Happens Next

Kristina Ramirez told the Chicago Sun-Times that she planned to travel to Mexico to reunite with her husband and explore whether he could return to the U.S. legally or if they would remain in Mexico.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2722871/us-customs-border-protection.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 10:56:23.426143

09/15/2025 — WHAT WE’VE HEARD TODAY:

The TRiiBE is collaborating with indie investigative newsroom Unraveled Press and Chicago alt-weekly Chicago Reader to publish reports about the increased enforcement and presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agents. Due to the rapid and sporadic nature of federal agent activity in the Chicagoland area, we’re working together to confirm and publish reports.

As of 3:45 p.m. today, federal agents have been spotted across the Chicagoland area. Federal agents have arrested people in southwest suburb Joliet, according to Chicago Reader news editor Shawn Mulcahy.

There’s also been activity in northwest suburb Elgin and suburban West Chicago. Illinois State Sen. Karina Villa (D- 25th District) went live on Facebook, alerting people about ICE activity in West Chicago this morning.

According to Elgin Rapid Response, which posted an activity recap for today, twelve people were detained from a residence in West Chicago this morning around 6:30 a.m. One video posted to Bluesky this morning shows agents breaking a person’s car window in West Chicago before handcuffing them.

Last week, Unraveled Press reported that U.S. Immigration Enforcement Agents (ICE) shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in the northwest suburb of Franklin Park during a traffic stop.

Though many local media outlets quoted the statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), claiming Villegas González dragged an ICE officer during his attempt to flee arrest, Unraveled published video accounts that show Villegas González driving away from the officers instead of towards them.

Bystanders who are interested in sending in video of federal agent activity can send it to newsrooms collecting footage using this link.

The escalated ICE activity in and around Chicago is part of “Operation Midway Blitz.” The plan was announced by the Department of Homeland Security last Monday, targeting “illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois.”

The Berwyn-Cicero Rapid Response Network, one of many groups across the city and state, posted multiple updates to its Instagram page of ICE sightings in Cicero this morning. The posts include the make and model of the alleged ICE vehicles, along with license plate numbers and a hotline number to report ICE activity at 855-435-7693.

A post this afternoon from Bluesky user, The People’s Fabric, shows an ICE branded Dodge Charger in the west suburb of Broadview, where the ICE processing facility is located and people were reportedly “snatched” by ICE agents this morning.

12:00 p.m. The city of Waukegan released a statement about ICE activity within its city limits on its Instagram page.

“The City of Waukegan has confirmed reports of ongoing operations by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) within the city. You are encouraged to know your rights and be aware of misinformation. Inform yourself through trusted sources,” reads the statement.

“As a reminder, officers with the Waukegan Police Department will not conceal their identity and will continue to be clearly identifiable while on duty, wearing official uniforms with badges. In accordance with the Illinois TRUST Act, the Waukegan Police Department will not participate in federal immigration enforcement, as the act prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from assisting the federal government with civil immigration enforcement,” the statement read.

The agents told her to follow them to a room and turn off her phone.

Since that Aug. 3 airport confrontation, Santiago has been held in a detention center as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement works to deport her. Since her arrest, there have been demonstrations in Phoenix, El Paso, Chicago and Boston — places where she has worked with immigrant rights organizations — demanding that ICE release her.

An immigration judge ruled last week that Santiago can’t be deported because she has permission to live in the U.S. through DACA, an Obama administration program that has given many undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children work permits and temporary protection from deportation.

“This decision is a victory, but the fight is not over until Xochitl is free,” said Desiree Miller, Santiago’s spouse. “Our family and community have suffered every single day since she was taken. Now that the judge threw out her case, she should not spend another night in detention. We need her home now.”

Still, ICE lawyers said they would appeal the judge’s ruling and will keep her in an ICE detention center in El Paso, according to Norma Islas, Santiago’s immigration lawyer.

It’s unclear why Border Patrol agents approached Santiago, but under federal law, immigration agents have the right to question and search people without a warrant within 100 miles of an international border.

“The victories that we have gotten thus far are important but they’re just the beginning of the fight,” Islas said during a demonstration Wednesday afternoon in front of the El Paso detention facility, where about 30 people waved signs calling for Santiago’s release. “If we’re successful on the merits of this case, it can help other (DACA recipients) from being detained.

Santiago was born in Oaxaca, Mexico, and is Zapotec, an Indigenous group. Her parents brought her and her brother to Florida, where her parents worked as migrant farmer workers. The children learned Spanish and English when they attended school.

In 2012, Santiago applied and received DACA and has renewed her two-year work permit six times.

She became an immigrant rights advocate, first in Florida then Boston before moving to El Paso nearly six years ago. She also worked taking care of a small community farm, where she met Miller.

For years, DACA recipients felt relatively safe from deportation. It was meant as temporary protection from deportation for young immigrants without a criminal record until Congress could approve legislation that would create a permanent solution. Thirteen years after its creation, Congress has not approved such legislation and the Trump administration has prioritized cracking down on undocumented immigrants this year.

The administration has said it is targeting the “worst of the worst” undocumented immigrants, highlighting the arrest of those convicted of rape, pedophila or other violent crimes. But government data shows that the vast majority of the more than 70,000 immigrants detained as of August don’t have a criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonprofit that collects and analyzes federal government data.

The Trump administration has also tried to dismantle DACA, which it has called illegal. So far, federal courts have kept the program in place for current DACA enrollees.

Still, U.S. Department of Homeland Security press secretary Tricia McLaughlin said people who “claim to be recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals are not automatically protected from deportations.” She also described Santiago as a “criminal illegal alien” who was arrested in Arizona on suspicion of trespassing, possession of narcotics and drug paraphernalia in 2020. In the same statement, McLaughlin encouraged DACA recipients to self-deport.

But Graham County Attorney L. Scott Bennett, the Arizona prosecutor whose office reviewed the case in 2021, said his office didn’t prosecute Santiago because of “insufficient information.”

Now, Santiago’s legal team has asked a different federal judge to order ICE to release Santiago from custody. A court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 23 before U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso. Cardone also ordered the Trump administration not to transfer Santiago out of El Paso.

“Constitutional protections generally apply to all people within the jurisdiction of the United States regardless of immigration or citizenship status,” Cardone wrote in her order.

“Simply put, if Santiago is removed from the country, she may never be able to return,” Cardone wrote, adding that if the Trump administration has evidence that can justify her deportation, it can present them in a hearing.

Santiago’s brother, José, said that because his sister is involved in the immigrant rights movement, she knew what to expect in an immigrant detention center and knew that it could be a long fight to get released.

“She's very aware of what the situation she's in, knows what she wants to do,” he said.

Miller, who talks to Santiago by phone every morning, said it’s been difficult having her wife detained.

“There's no reason for them to keep holding her in there. There was no reason for them to detain her in the first place.”

Midterm elections, held two years into a presidential term, usually flip House control from the president’s party to the opposition. It happened in 2022 under Biden, in 2018 under Trump’s first term, in 2010 under Obama, and in 2006 under George W. Bush’s second term.

Facing a potentially similar result next year in 2026, Trump encouraged Texas to redraw its districts with new maps projected to net Republicans up to five additional seats. For context, Republicans currently control the U.S. House by only five seats nationally.

Texas’s move sparked an arms race to respond in kind, among both red and blue states. California, Illinois, and Maryland are now considering mid-decade redistricting on the Democratic side; Florida, Missouri, and Ohio on the Republican side.

Context: what is mid-decade redistricting?

Each U.S. House district is supposed to contain an approximately equal number of residents, currently around 761 thousand. But populations in these districts gradually change: births, deaths, people moving in, people moving out.

To keep the numbers equal over time, states usually redraw their district boundaries once per decade, after a Census. The Census occurs in years ending with 0, such as 2010 and 2020. So those new lines go into effect during years ending with 2, such as 2012 and 2022. Anything after that, such as for next year’s 2026 election, is considered “mid-decade.”

10 states actually ban mid-decade redistricting in their state constitutions, comprising red, blue, and swing states alike: Alabama, Alaska, Kansas, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.

But it’s not banned at the federal level. Should it be?

What the bills do

Two bills in Congress would do just that. The two main proposals this summer were introduced by Texas Democrats in opposition to that state’s Republican plan, and by a California Republican in opposition to that state’s Democratic plan.

Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX33) introduced the former, titled the Anti-Rigging Act, on July 10. Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA3) introduced the latter, numbered H.R. 4358, without an official title, on August 5.

The bills’ sponsors have not coordinated their legislation.

Both bills contain provisions making an exception for mid-decade redistricting if a state does so to comply with either the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act of 1965, if mandated by a federal court. For example, in 2023, the Supreme Court nixed Alabama’s map for violating the Voting Rights Act—a rare 2020s Supreme Court ruling considered good for Democrats.

What supporters say

Congress’s lead Democrat and lead Republican on this issue both argue that mid-decade redistricting changes the rules of the game for pure partisan gain, when it should only be done for neutral reasons.

“This move by Gov. Abbott does Trump’s bidding, not for any legitimate constitutional purpose as they claim, but to attempt to win an election before the first ballot has been cast,” lead Democrat Rep. Veasey said in a press release. “It is cynical, racist, and with clear political intent. This bill would ensure it could never happen again.”

“Gavin Newsom is trying to subvert the will of voters,” lead Republican Rep. Kiley said in a separate press release. “Fortunately, Congress has the ability to protect California voters using its authority under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This will also stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.”

(The Constitution’s Elections Clause allows Congress to set parameters for the “times” and “manner” of congressional elections in the states.)

What opponents say

The most prominent Republican and Democratic governors on this issue both argue that states are within their rights to maximize partisan political advantage—and that current times call for it.

The new congressional districts “better reflect the actual votes of Texans,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said in a press release upon passage of the state-level One Big Beautiful Map Act. “While Democrats shirked their duty, in futility, and ran away to other states, Republicans stayed the course, stayed at work, and stayed true to Texas.”

“California will not sit idle as Trump and his Republican lapdogs shred our country’s democracy before our very eyes,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a separate press release upon introducing the state-level Election Rigging Response Act. “This moment calls for urgency and action—that is what we are putting before voters this November, a chance to fight back against his anti-American ways.”

Odds of passage

So far, the Democratic congressional bill has attracted nine cosponsors, all Democrats from Texas. No Democrat outside of Texas has yet cosponsored it.

Two Democrats from Texas haven’t signed on, either: Reps. Joaquin Castro (D-TX20) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX28).

The Republican congressional bill has not yet attracted any cosponsors, likely because such a move would be considered too “anti-Trump” within the party. Not even any of the other eight California House Republicans have signed on.

Both bills await a potential vote in the House Judiciary Committee, unlikely under Republican control.

Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY17) has publicly come out against mid-decade redistricting, in opposition to his home state New York’s Democratic plan, but has neither cosponsored the existing Republican bill nor introduced his own such bill as of this writing.

Take New York City's Charter Revision Commission. Despite acknowledging that a million New Yorkers identify as independent, so cannot vote in the primary, they punted in July, declining to send an open-primary proposition to the November ballot. The excuse? Supporters hadn't reached a ""clear consensus"" on either the problem or the remedy.

Reformers had pinned their hopes on 2024, believing this would be the year voters finally flung open those gateways through some combination of Open-primary, Ranked-choice, or Top-X general elections (let’s call them ORT).

Alas, these efforts hit a wall. Eleven ORT proposals in nine states were on the November 5th ballot. Every single one lost.

Why? Independents and third parties don’t just want to be heard; they want a seat at the table in the room where decisions are made. They want their views rewarded. They want true representation.

Elections, at their core, are about redistributing political power. And clearly, ORT struggles to sell a polarized and skeptical public on its benefits.

RCV and Open Primaries/Top-X, despite their vocal proponents, are burdened with a litany of well-documented flaws, like exhausted ballots, strategic voting, complexity, and perverse outcomes. Linking them together on a single vote, as we just witnessed, only diminishes their combined prospects.

Why else did ORT fail at the polls? Logically, many independents understand their third-choice ranked ballot might tip the scales towards an acceptable, if uninspiring, candidate. They might even take intellectual pridein playing kingmaker.

However, RCV falls short on both the emotional and utilitarian litmus tests.

Did the eventual winner make explicit policy commitments to independents for their support– commitments they'll honor in office? Or were independents taken for granted, a default vote in the ORT system? Were third-party candidates even listed on the general election Top-X ballot? If not, a third party feels erased from history.

For a major party member, the situation is more favorable. Backing the winner brings tangible emotional and political benefits, reinforcing their social group's standing in both primary and general elections. But in ORT elections, where your leading candidate is squeezed off the ballot, you feel marginalized and demeaned.

Negotiated Consensus: A Different Approach

Voting method experimentation stretches back millennia, and while history may not repeat itself, it often rhymes. So, is there a better alternative waiting to be unearthed from the archives that might be attractive to the sidelined forty percent?

In 1885, Charles Dodgson—yes, the mathematician and author of Alice in Wonderland—grappled with precisely this challenge after discovering issues with a new preferential voting system. His remarkable suggestion? To ""club"" and trade votes. It’s a proposal I’ve expanded upon and call “Negotiated Consensus.”

Under Negotiated Consensus, all major candidates are listed on the primary and general election ballots. Voters cast a single vote for the nominee they enthusiastically endorse and trust as their proxy. If no candidate secures a simple majority, aspirants negotiate among themselves (and in consultation with their supporters) for policy concessions, redistributing (or “clubbing”) their proxy votes until a majority winner emerges. If a clean majority can't be negotiated, the race defaults to a top-two runoff (details can be found in the original article).

The public debate and the inherent tension of a plurality election highlight the critical role small parties and independents play as ""kingmakers."" Trading votes for policy concessions ensures the winner’s administration is more representative than in a plurality election or RCV, all the while sidestepping ORT's pathologies. Indeed, drawing two-party gerrymandered districts may backfire when independents shift the balance of power.

By marrying the clarity of a single-choice ballot with the accountability of public coalition-building, NC can succeed where RCV and non-partisan primaries stumbled. It promises to give independents and third parties the influence and spotlight they’ve been seeking—and in the process, revitalize majority rule itself.

The Georgia facility, operated by Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution, saw 475 of its workers arrested on allegations that they were in the U.S. illegally, or without the proper work permits, with hundreds of detained South Koreans sent home Thursday.

The raid was part of a broader deportation drive by the Trump administration, which the White House has described as central to fulfilling U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff and homeland security adviser, has pushed for 3,000 arrests a day.

Amid backlash and concerns over how the raid could disrupt efforts to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. — a move called reshoring or onshoring — Trump, in a post on Truth Social Monday, stressed that foreign workers are ""welcome"" in the country.

Trump said that he wants foreign companies building complex products, machines, and various other ""things"" to bring skilled employees to train the domestic workforce, though he emphasized that these foreign workers are expected to return home eventually.

""If we didn't do this, all of that massive Investment will never come in the first place... I don't want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,"" Trump said.

Besides Washington's reconciliatory statements, Landau also said in a post on X that the U.S. State Department ""will ensure that [the South Koreans] have the necessary and proper visas to comply with our laws.""

South Korean state media reported that Washington has agreed to establish a new ""visa working group"" for the country, with discussions said to include Seoul's desire for a separate U.S. visa quota for its workers.

Currently, the U.S. allows employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in ""specialty occupations"" under its H-1B visa program, but the system is highly selective due to an annual cap and a lottery system.

A South Korean presidential spokesperson also told local media on Monday that Seoul is conducting a more thorough review to determine whether any human rights violations had occurred during U.S. immigration enforcement at the Georgia battery plant.

U.S. government officials said that hundreds of the workers detained at the facility had been staying in the country illegally.

Experts have told CNBC that the immigration actions — the single largest enforcement operation in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's history — could lead to other foreign businesses reassessing their workforces in the U.S.

LG Energy Solution told CNBC last week that the commencement of the Georgia EV battery plant had been postponed from 2025 to 2026. However, the company claimed that the decision was not related to the recent incident but rather to external factors, including overall market conditions.

“The court does not reach this conclusion lightly,” Judge Chutkan wrote in her 16-page ruling.","A federal judge in Washington excoriated the Trump administration on Monday for what she described as its disregard of court-ordered protections for migrants it had deported to Ghana, even as she declined to rule on their behalf, citing a lack of jurisdiction.

The judge called out a “cavalier acceptance” that they may face torture and persecution in their home countries, as several are set for deportation again. One of the migrants had said in a sworn statement that he had been beaten and tortured by police officers and soldiers in his home county of Nigeria, and had been told that if they ever saw him again, they would kill him.

But Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the Federal District Court in Washington ruled late Monday that she could not prevent those migrants from being sent to their home countries because they had already been sent to Ghana — and thus out of her legal purview.

The decision was a victory for the Trump administration and the most recent sign of how recent Supreme Court rulings have paved the way for elements of President Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

The five plaintiffs in the case, identified by their initials for fear of persecution in their home counties, are citizens of Nigeria and Gambia. One man, known in the filing as K.S., has already been deported by Ghana to Gambia, where he is in hiding. K.S. is bisexual, and Gambia criminalizes relationships between men with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

The other four plaintiffs were still in Ghana as of early Tuesday, and have been told by officials there that their deportations were imminent.

“The court does not reach this conclusion lightly,” Judge Chutkan wrote in her 16-page ruling. But, she added, despite being “alarmed and dismayed,” her “hands are tied.”

The ruling brought an end to a frantic legal battle that began on Friday and lasted through the weekend.

Lawyers representing the five migrants had sued in federal court, accusing the Trump administration of using an agreement with Ghana to accept deported migrants to “do their dirty work” and send them onward to their home countries, despite orders from immigration judges who had determined that those migrants were more likely than not to face persecution, torture or death if returned.

Judge Chutkan appeared to largely agree with that assessment, saying in an emergency hearing on Saturday that “I have not been shy about saying that I think this is a very suspicious scheme.” But, she added, the Supreme Court had blocked a lower court decision in a similar case earlier this year, and told the plaintiffs’ lawyers that “there’s no point in getting decisions from me that are immediately going to be stayed.”

The Trump administration has brokered deals with several African nations, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini and — most recently — Ghana, to accept deported migrants, many of whom have no connection to those countries. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out his promised mass deportation operation, have moved swiftly on these so-called third-country deportations.

The Supreme Court has broadly allowed the government to deport migrants to countries other than their own, and had paused a federal judge’s ruling that said the migrants must first be given a chance to show that they would be at risk of torture.

Justice Department lawyers conceded in arguments that it appeared Ghana had violated the migrants’ legal protections, but argued that the U.S. government was powerless to tell Ghana what it can do with migrants once immigration authorities had delivered them into Ghanaian custody — an argument the Trump administration had previously used in the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia.

“The United States is not saying that this is OK,” Elianis N. Pérez, a Justice Department lawyer, said during the hearing. “What the United States is saying is that the United States does not have the power to tell Ghana what to do.”

In sworn statements submitted to the court, the migrants said that they were told by U.S. and Ghanaian officials that they would all be sent to their home countries after arriving in Ghana — despite informing them of their protective orders.

The migrants also described abysmal conditions both during their initial deportations from the United States, and at a remote detention facility known as Dema Camp, at an undisclosed location in Ghana.

On Sept. 5, the migrants were awakened late at night, shackled and put on a military cargo plane without being allowed to notify family or legal counsel, and, in at least one case, without identification documents. They claim that some of them were placed in straitjackets for up to 16 hours during the flight, and one of the plaintiffs in the case, D.A., claimed that he now has difficulty walking because his straitjacket was secured so tightly.

D.A., a citizen of Nigeria, was a member of the People’s Democratic Party, one of the main political parties in the country. In the sworn statement, D.A. said that he had been a target of violent attacks in his home country. First, he was beaten by members of a rival party, the All Progressives Congress, he said. Months later, he was tortured by the military and police officers.

“They tortured me and kept me locked in a dog cage for three days,” D.A. said, adding that after letting him go, “they told me they would kill me if they ever saw me again.”

“After this incident I had to leave Nigeria to save my life,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/15/multimedia/15dc-ghana-deport-fgck/15dc-ghana-deport-fgck-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 03:56:58.931810

He refused to follow law enforcements commands and drove his car at law enforcement officers. One of the ICE officers was hit by the car and dragged a significant distance. Fearing for his own life, the officer fired his weapon.”

But the CCTV footage that has emerged does not show Villegas-Gonzalez’s car driving at or hitting law enforcement officers. In the footage, two officers stand on either side of Villegas-Gonzalez’ vehicle as he reverses away from the officers. One of the officers appears to hold onto the window frame on the driver's side, moving backward with the vehicle, and then forward as the vehicle drives out of frame of the CCTV camera. It is unclear why the ICE officer moves with the vehicle or whether he is being dragged.

Two other videos have emerged showing two officers in flak jackets with “Police” written on the back pulling Villegas-Gonzalez out of his car roughly 20 meters from where he was initially stopped and providing him with medical care. His death was confirmed by the Mexican embassy later that day.

In Lyons, Adolph Lyons had been victimized by the Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) use of a chokehold device he claimed violated the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
In other words, Justice Kavanaugh doesn’t ask at all how overinclusive ICE’s race-based (at least in part) policy might be.","Last week’s emergency-docket decision by the Supreme Court in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo to lift a preliminary injunction entered by a federal district judge in Los Angeles against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials has caused understandable consternation on the part of civil rights groups and immigration-rights activists, among others. The district court had enjoined ICE agents from over-relying on an individual’s skin color, Spanish language use, occupation, and physical location in deciding whether to detain that person for investigation of the person’s immigration status. The case was brought by (among others) several individuals, some of whom are U.S. citizens, who were detained by ICE officials allegedly on the exclusive basis of a combination of the four factors identified above. The plaintiffs argued that the Fourth Amendment’s requirements that government have individualized reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a person’s wrongdoing before that person can be seized was being violated by ICE policy that made use of these factors. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (which declined to disturb the preliminary injunction) explained:

The district court ordered that. . . defendants were not permitted [within the Central District of California, which includes seven counties, from Orange County to San Louis Obispo County and Los Angeles County to Riverside County] to rely solely, alone or in combination, on the following factors to form reasonable suspicion for a detentive stop: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; presence at a particular location [such as an agricultural site]; the type of work one does [such as day labor].

The Supreme Court, with the three Democrat-appointed Justices dissenting, granted the federal government’s request to stay (or block) the district court order’s implementation, pending further litigation of the case on the merits. What that means in practice is that ICE agents within the capacious Central District of California remain free to make use of the factors at issue in the case, including “apparent race or ethnicity,” in making detentive stops for immigration purposes. The Court did not issue an explanation that spoke for the majority, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write an opinion setting forth his reasons for concurring in the decision to grant the government’s application. While Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Jackson, our attention below will focus on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s writing, which has received the bulk of analysts’ attention.

THE GOOD

What positive things can be said about Justice Kavanaugh’s explanation? Importantly, that he felt the need to explain at all. Of course we don’t know any of the other five Justices who voted to grant (and perhaps there was no single rationale that commanded a majority), but as Justice Sotomayor’s dissent powerfully observed, the Court’s unexplained intervention in Vasquez Perdomo is part of a troubling pattern in recent months by which significant, precedent-altering law is frequently being made without any meaningful justification that accounts for the votes of a majority of the Court. To his credit, Justice Kavanaugh is less guilty of this disturbing practice than are many of the other Justices whose votes are often similar to his own.

Second, Justice Kavanaugh does purport to place some limits on ICE’s ability to rely on race. As he puts the point: “to be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion.” But he quickly (and problematically, as we explain below) adds: “however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.” (citation omitted).

THE BAD

So much for the good. Unfortunately, the bad is somewhat more copious. For starters, he suggests that plaintiffs likely lack Article III standing and, on that ground, will probably lose their case. In reaching this conclusion he not only relies on, but inexplicably and implausibly extends, the highly criticized 1984 Los Angeles v. Lyons ruling. In Lyons, Adolph Lyons had been victimized by the Los Angeles Police Department’s (LAPD) use of a chokehold device he claimed violated the Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. He sued the City of Los Angeles for damages and also for an injunction preventing the LAPD from unconstitutionally choking him again. (The chokeholds at issue in Lyons and other cases at this time were not child’s play; for example, 16 or so persons died from LAPD chokeholds between 1975 and 1982.) The U.S. Supreme Court held that while his damage claim presumably could go forward, his claim for an injunction was not justiciable because he was very unlikely to be subject to another chokehold, in part because even if he were to encounter police again in the near future the odds are low that he would “provoke the use of a chokehold by resisting arrest, attempting to escape, or threatening deadly force or serious bodily injury.” Lyons was bad law on its own facts, first because (as the Court seemed to concede) Lyons’s damage claim already established a “case or controversy” within the meaning of Article III of the Constitution, and so the question of his entitlement to an injunction should have been considered to be a matter of remedial discretion, not (as the Court suggested) constitutional authority. Moreover, because Lyons could have sought and obtained an injunction the instant before he was choked the first time had he been able to call a time-out and invoke a judge’s intervention then and there, that ripe-at-that-time claim for an injunction should not have become legally moot simply because of the practical reality that litigation takes time. Recognition of that practical reality is, after all, what drives the “capable of repetition yet evading review” exception to mootness the Court has explicitly recognized.

But however bad Lyons was (and it was bad and should not be relied upon, especially by a Court and a Justice for whom first principles are more important than stare decisis), it simply has no application to Vasquez Perdomo. As fellow Verdict columnist Mike Dorf put it on his blog:

As Justice Sotomayor . . . pointed out in dissent, unlike Lyons, whose future encounters with the police were unpredictable, the plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo had every reason to believe that they would encounter ICE agents repeatedly—given the ICE policy of targeting their workplaces [and ethnicities] for immigration enforcement raids.

This point seems so obvious (especially because the dissent made it too) that we are reluctant even to spend time echoing Mike, except that even smart legal minds (see Orin Kerr’s post, for example) seem to unquestioningly accept and endorse Justice Kavanaugh’s use of Lyons. We emphasize this point also because the error in Justice Kavanaugh’s extension of Lyons would mean that even if ICE had a policy of relying on race alone (which Justice Kavanaugh says is plainly impermissible) no one would have standing to sue for injunctive relief in that situation either.

There is also plenty of bad (or at least question-begging) in Justice Kavanaugh’s discussion of the merits. To be sure, Justice Kavanaugh explains correctly that reasonable suspicion is a lesser standard than probable cause, and that it is determined by considering the totality of the circumstances. In listing and evaluating those circumstances, however, he raises more questions than he resolves.

First, he never grapples with the fact that previous “reasonable suspicion” cases by the Court require more than statistical correlations and probabilities but some kind of “individualized” or “particularized” reasons for detaining an individual, even briefly. To be sure, the meaning of “individualized” can be arguable in some instances. For example, imagine that past police arrest records make clear that a particular street corner is a very common venue for certain kinds of criminal activity at certain times of the day; would stopping all of the individuals (a small number of racially diverse folks) at that locale at those times be unconstitutionally based on population-wide statistics or instead permissibly based on “individualized” assessment of that venue? Moreover, the Court’s own caselaw has so many implausible exceptions and deviations from the ostensible requirement of individualized suspicion (think airport and school metal detectors, random drug searches, sobriety checkpoints, administrative subpoenas of large groups of people, drug tests for transportation employees, etc.) that one has to wonder how seriously the Court takes its own doctrine, and whether the Court would, if pressed, create an “immigration” exception alongside all the others, given the difficulty of immigration enforcement. To be clear, we are not arguing that the results of any of these cases invoking exceptions are wrong—the Fourth Amendment, after all, speaks of overall “reasonable[ness]” and not of “individualized” suspicion, and one of us (Professor Amar) has been on record in favor of a move away from the Court’s arbitrary doctrinal boxes in favor of a more holistic reasonableness analysis. But if the Court is going to make that kind of move, it should not be in a shadow-docket case, and it certainly shouldn’t be without a robust explanation.

And even if the Court were to openly move away from individualized suspicions to focus on group statistical generalizations, it would have to do so much more carefully than Justice Kavanaugh does, especially where race is concerned. One key factor he identifies is the “extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area,” a number Justice Kavanaugh describes as 10 percent of the people in the region, or approximately 2 million illegal immigrants. Even assuming his statistics are valid, there is no evaluation of what percentage of Hispanic-looking and sounding men at day labor sites in Southern California are in the U.S. unlawfully. In other words, Justice Kavanaugh doesn’t ask at all how overinclusive ICE’s race-based (at least in part) policy might be. It is certainly possible that the “hit rate,” if you will, of undocumented persons among groups of Hispanic men near Home Depots is equal to or higher than the 10% baseline. But given the publicity over ICE raids (and the fear it has stirred among undocumented persons) that rate could also be much lower than 10%. The fact that Hispanics and Spanish-sounding folks make up such a large percentage of Angelinos and of day laborers means that there are many, many, Hispanic men working as day laborers in the region who are not in the U.S. unlawfully. Justice Kavanaugh never demands that the government (which has more information on these questions than do plaintiffs) demonstrate, empirically, that its targeting of persons and locations is sufficiently free of under- and over-inclusiveness to count as reasonable.

Justice Sotomayor’s dissent highlights these failures. Focusing on precedent she reminds us that “a set of facts cannot constitute reasonable suspicion if it describes[s] a very large category of presumably innocent’ people. . . . Never mind that nearly 47 percent of the Central District’s populations identifies as Hispanic or Latino . . . Never mind that over 37 percent of the population of Los Angeles County speaks Spanish at home. . . .”

Justice Sotomayor’s last point, about the prevalence of Spanish speakers, bears emphasis. Putting aside native Spanish speakers who might speak Spanish at home, California is home to over 750 Spanish immersion programs in its public education system. Every year the state is graduating thousands of students whose use of their achievements as bilingual speakers somehow marks them, under ICE’s policies, as suspicious and fuels the perception that they are unlawful immigrants.

There may be room for useful discussion on this issue, about just how large the category of innocents defined by a particular policy must be for the policy to be rejected as unreasonable. But there is simply no such discussion in Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence because a concern for detaining a significant number of innocent individuals for stops is never addressed.

Part of Justice Kavanaugh’s silence here is likely explained by the kind of limited detentions he appears to think are at issue. He repeatedly emphasizes what he views as a de minimis burden of stops on lawful immigrants or citizens: “Importantly, reasonable suspicion means only that immigrant officers may briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status. If the person is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

But just how does Justice Kavanaugh envision an individual’s lawful presence in the U.S. is to be established such that she is free to go? If all detained individuals have to do is to assert that they are citizens or lawful immigrants, the encounter would indeed be brief, but also completely ineffectual from ICE’s perspective. And there is no reason to think that such bare assertions would be accepted. All the record evidence described in Justice Sotomayor’s dissent is to the contrary. If Justice Kavanaugh is licensing detentions based even in part on race, it is incumbent on him to show not only (as discussed above) that the enforcement gains are substantial enough to justify racial means, but also that the detentions he is willing to allow have to remain very minimal in duration and force. But he never says that; his suggestion that excessive force claims can be litigated not only ignores immunity doctrines but also fails to recognize that force might not rise to the level of excessive within the meaning of due process but can still be unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, especially where race is being used as a sorting tool.

All of this leaves us to wonder whether all of us (or at least all of us who “look” Hispanic, speak Spanish, or speak English with an accent) must carry proof of legal status with us at all times? For citizens, does that require carrying a United States passport everywhere? (Note here that half of American citizens do not even have passports.) Must lawful immigrants carry alternative proof of legal status? If this evidence is at home or otherwise not immediately accessible, can the investigative detention continue until it is provided to the immigration officer’s satisfaction?

The failure of the concurrence to elaborate on what an investigative stop by immigration officials can entail contributes to Justice Kavanaugh’s one-sided discussion of the equities in this case. Having to establish citizenship through a passport or other documents is itself a burden. Further, if an individual’s workday is disrupted to respond satisfactorily to an immigration officer’s inquiries, he may lose pay because of lost time off the job. Employers may be reluctant to hire lawfully present Hispanic workers or those who speak Spanish out of a concern that their presence at the workplace may trigger ICE raids or that temporary detentions will interfere with the performance of job duties. On top of this, there is some stigma attached to being hauled off as an illegal immigrant, even if mistakenly. Onlookers who see workers taken away may not be there to see that they were later released. Indeed, one may argue that the very use of ethnicity and language as proxies for illegal status communicates the invidious message that most Hispanics are here illegally.

It may be that a fair balancing of the equities in this case, even taking into account the need for extra caution in making any race-based decision and the reality of what an investigative stop entails, would still result in a ruling favorable to the government. The effective enforcement of immigration laws is never going to be without cost and free from all externalities. But a persuasive account of such a fair balancing should involve a more focused attention on the competing interests than the concurrence provides.

The UGLY

Most importantly, one might have expected a judicial decision allowing government to take race and ethnicity into account (as well as language and accents which we consider to be factors tightly related to race and ethnicity) to say something about the depth of our core constitutional commitment to rejecting such considerations. This is a Court, after all, that recently held race cannot be a factor in college admissions, no matter how closely it correlates in a statistical sense with legitimate educational goals or the background or perspective of applicants. Even hunches based on professional experience about race are impermissible tools for lawyers in deciding which potential jurors to strike through preemptory challenges. The enforcement of immigration laws may require a limited exception to this commitment. But one would hope that our country’s historical and constitutional misuse of race should warrant some words of caution when describing the scope and operation of this exception. Remember, we are talking here not about the inclusion (in, say, an APB) of a person’s race in a witness-provided description of an individual suspect after a crime has been committed; we are talking about sweeping racial correlations (also known as generalizations) about (il)legitimate presence in a diverse and cosmopolitan community.

In reading Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence, we get the sense that consideration of racial correlations in reasonable suspicion analysis warrants no greater judicial attention than consideration of any other statistical factor. In other words, his concurrence reads as if an ICE policy based on race and occupation would be no different from one based on location and occupation. But legions of cases under equal protection (and how can constitutional equality not be a factor in reasonableness?) teach us that not all classifications or sorting tools should be viewed with similar skepticism. In this regard, the district court’s order itself was quite thoughtless in banning “any combination” of the four factors at issue; an ICE policy detaining every person seeking work outside a Home Depot (including a large number of Whites, Blacks, and Asians) is very different from the ICE policies actually being deployed. The Justices could perhaps have justifiably vacated the district court order on this, much narrower, ground, and avoided the ugly look of a Court that is rigidly color-blind, except when it’s not.",https://i0.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_300476858.jpg?quality=90&resize=426%2C350&strip=all&fit=1000%25&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-16 03:57:07.946335

For the most part, his administration has gloried in the many excesses of its mass-deportation program, apparently on the theory that aggressive enforcement tactics and even cruelty would help move things along as anyone not legally in the country would self-deport instead of finding themselves in a brutal ICE detention facility or an even more brutal rent-a-prison overseas.

But an immigration raid on September 4 at an EV battery plant in Georgia, which was supervised by the elite Homeland Security Investigations arm of ICE, has caused some real buyer’s remorse for the 47th president. The 475 arrests for immigration violations included 317 South Korean citizens sent to oversee the building of the plant, and their government was not at all happy with their treatment. The busts (mostly for visa overstays) disrupted U.S.–South Korean diplomatic relations, including sensitive negotiations over tariffs, and appear to have traumatized the workers involved, as the Los Angeles Times reported:

Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines … Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.

Collectively, the detained South Koreans chose to go home even after they were offered a temporary respite from deportation. Indeed, the South Korean government is investigating the possibility that the raid violated international human-rights agreements. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has “expressed deep regret” for the raid in a meeting with South Korean diplomats. And most remarkably, the president himself backtracked in a Sunday Truth Social post:

This was a very wordy way for Trump to admit that two of his biggest priorities are in conflict. The ultimate prize at the end of the rainbow for his Liberation Day tariff initiative is to push the world’s manufacturers into relocating facilities to the U.S. That isn’t going to happen if the people they send over to set up said facilities are being rounded up by ICE and put in cages. In retrospect, it’s rather surprising the administration didn’t foresee this problem and at least provide some coordination between their economic-policy folks and the zealous deporters of DHS and ICE. And you have to wonder if anyone on the immigration side of the policy table got chewed out for blowing up U.S.–South Korean relations, making other countries nervous, and forcing the president to semi-apologize. Are there limits to Stephen Miller’s power after all?

This isn’t just an embarrassment for the administration, to be clear. The EV-battery plant was very necessary for a Hyundai EV-manufacturing plant next door. Together these facilities represented the largest economic development project in Georgia history and the crown jewel of Brian Kemp’s governorship. To add insult to injury, DHS pressed Georgia state troopers into service during the battery-plant bust, presumably as part of routine state cooperation with federal immigration-enforcement efforts. Kemp, whose relationship with the president is famously fraught but recently peaceful, couldn’t have been happy. Beyond that, though, someone needs to make the Trump administration aware that attracting foreign direct investment is one of the favorite economic-development tools of virtually every Republican governor; for some, it’s all they know how to do, other than cutting taxes, to create wealth.

It will be fascinating to see if the incident puts a bit of a damper on the nativist strain of America First politics and policy and maybe keeps a few people out of ICE-detention hell.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9da/54c/d1051c652db1e0619d82cb7c127161d798-georgia-ICEraid.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 02:56:47.480274

The news of the deportation of these African nationals from the United States surfaced last week and prompted a lawsuit by American lawyers. They claim that Washington’s move was an attempt to circumvent its own immigration laws that prohibit returning certain people to countries where their well-being may be at risk.

On Monday, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, Ghana’s Minister of Government Communications, told the Associated Press that all 14 people – 13 Nigerians and one Gambian – “have since departed for their respective countries,” without specifying when exactly they were returned.

According to the lawyers, this is yet another example of how the Trump administration deported people and then distanced itself from the consequences. The case drew parallels with the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, in which the administration erroneously deported him to El Salvador despite a court order, and then claimed that his return was impossible.

The Trump administration, facing immigration proceedings in which for legal and procedural reasons some people cannot be sent back to their countries of origin, has increasingly sought to send them to third countries with which agreements have been made.

“It smells like fraud.”

– Lee Gelernt

Lawyers representing five of these African men filed suit on Friday, arguing that they have legitimate protections against removal due to fears of torture.

“What the United States knew that these individuals would be sent into serious danger despite an immigration judge’s order, and yet refused to act, is striking. It seems evident that the United States hatched a scheme to use third countries to bypass what the United States cannot do directly.”

– Lee Gelernt

On Saturday, a federal judge asked the government to describe in detail what exactly is being done so that Ghana does not send migrants to other countries in violation of U.S. court orders. The so-called third-country agreement, such as Ghana, is part of a broader immigration policy campaign aimed at deporting millions of people from the United States.

A Justice Department lawyer said that the judge hearing the case does not have the authority to control how another country treats the deported. It was also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court this summer ruled that the administration may continue sending immigrants to countries from which they do not originate, even if they have not yet had the opportunity to raise concerns about torture.

Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is part of the group of lawyers representing five of the men in the suit, said on Monday that the whole situation “smells like fraud.”

“We simply could not continue to endure the suffering of our West African compatriots,” said Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa during a briefing in Accra. “As long as the United States adheres to a strict understanding that we will only take West Africa, we will continue to adhere to this principle,” he added.

The Government of Nigeria said it was not informed about the deportation of its citizens to Ghana and that it had previously received Nigerians deported directly from the United States. “We do not reject Nigerians deported to Nigeria. The only thing we reject is the deportation of other citizens to Nigeria,” a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told AP.

The Government of The Gambia did not respond to requests for comment. None of the 14 deportees originated from Ghana, and five of the African migrants who filed suit had no ties to the country or did not name it as a potential removal country, according to the lawsuit.

Lawyers and activists note that the Trump administration appears to be turning to third countries with requests for deportations to bypass U.S. law in the areas of trade, immigration, and aid.

The resolution, which passed unanimously, comes less than a week after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents refused to identify themselves while detaining a parent near Talbot Community School.

The document singles out and denounces “the use of unmarked vehicles, masked agents and unidentifiable personnel in immigration enforcement activities within the city,” especially near “churches, schools and other public institutions.”

It also calls on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to “implement clear, uniform identification standards for all field agents,” including badges, marked vehicles and advance notice when operating “in or near local jursidictions.”

The resolution also directs the city’s Health & Human Services & Public Safety Committee to consider policies or agreements “that seek to prioritize transparency and public safety in immigration enforcement and uphold and protect the civil rights of our community members.”

ICE detained Denis Rivera Martinez, 42, around 8 a.m. Thursday on an access road near Talbot Community School. According to a letter to the community from Superintendent Ryan Scallon, the ICE agents refused to identify themselves and used unmarked vehicles.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email statement last week that Rivera Martinez, of Honduras, is in the country illegally.

Portland police spokesperson Brad Nadeau confirmed that Portland officers arrested Rivera Martinez, who is accused of Class D domestic violence assault, on Wednesday, one day before he was taken into ICE custody.

Rivera Martinez should have been immediately turned over to ICE when he was arrested, McLaughlin said, and the arrest had to be made “at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE.”

Portland resident Joey Brunelle equated the federal immigration law enforcement agencies to President Donald Trump’s secret police.

“They show up in unmarked vehicles, they wear masks or refuse to identify themselves, they grab people, handcuff them and take them away and never state why they are being taken away, ” Brunelle told the council. “They’re secret police kidnapping our neighbors.”

Brunelle said, “This proclamation is a start,” but the council ought to take further action, such as educating the public on their rights and documenting and announcing detainments in the city.

Kerrie Dowdy, president of the Portland Education Association, warned “this will keep happening” at Portland schools and urged the council to pass the resolution.

“Our schools should be safe places where students can focus on learning and engaging with their peers instead of worrying that a classmate or a parent will get arrested on school grounds,” Dowdy said, later adding, “We cannot do this alone. We need help.”

School Board Chair Sarah Lentz said in a news conference Friday that the community is “reeling” from the arrest so close to the school. On Monday, she urged the council to pass the resolution.

“As stewards of these institutions that are so vital to our city, we always have another choice about what we can do to protect our city and to help make it thrive,” Lentz said. “The collective power in this room is capable of so much.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/20170921_CityHall_0191-1757540929.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 00:56:29.355142

On September 4, 2025, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), supported by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), conducted a raid at the $4.3 billion Hyundai-LG battery plant construction site near Savannah, Georgia. Authorities detained 475 people, of whom more than 300 were South Korean nationals. The facility is a joint project between Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution.

Many of the detained South Koreans were reportedly engineers or equipment installers brought in under B-1 business visitor visas or visa waiver programs. Attorneys argue that their roles were short-term and specialized, not long-term. Video released by ICE shows some workers shackled at the wrists, ankles, and waists while being transported on buses.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry confirmed it is investigating whether workers’ rights were violated, focusing on visa status, detention conditions, and access to counsel and interpreters. To mitigate long-term immigration consequences, Seoul arranged with US officials for the workers’ voluntary return on a chartered flight instead of formal deportation.

US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau expressed “deep regret” over the incident during bilateral talks in Seoul, according to a statement from the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

One central issue under review is visa authorization versus work authorization. Reports indicate that many of the detained workers had entered the US under short-term B-1 business visitor visas or through the visa waiver program. Questions have arisen as to whether these visas were improperly used for labor activities that legally require separate work permits.

South Korea’s government has emphasized the long-term reentry implications for those detained. By negotiating for the workers to depart voluntarily on a chartered flight, Seoul sought to avoid formal deportation orders that could have carried severe consequences for the workers’ future ability to re-enter the US.",https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Hyundai_Motor_Manufacturing_Indonesia_HMMI_2023.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 20:56:36.038605

]” But Kavanaugh and other justices have already restricted how someone can succeed when suing federal agents over constitutional violations like the use of excessive force.

It would create a private right to sue federal officials who deprive New Yorkers of their constitutional rights.
If passed, the laws would offer state court options that aren’t available federally, allowing compensatory damages, punitive damages, or attorney’s fees.","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — Democratic legislators are pursuing new state laws to let New Yorkers sue government officials who violate their constitutional rights. This comes in response to a September 8 U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the ability of federal agents to enforce immigration law.

The bills could create a new legal pathway to seek justice in New York state courts, which the bills’ sponsors call necessary in light of SCOTUS actions to counter longstanding federal precedents and protections. Any official—federal, state, or local—who violates a suspect’s rights or freedoms while acting in their official role could be held accountable under the proposals.

The push follows the decision in “Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo” permitting federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume investigative detentions in Los Angeles. The ruling temporarily lifted a lower court order that had previously limited how ICE targets people.

The lower court had found a “mountain of evidence” that the agency or its officers were violating the Constitution. Ultimately, it told agents that they had to consider more than just a suspect’s race, ethnicity, language, or work history when planning stops or arrests. But in a partisan six to three decision, the conservative SCOTUS majority—including Justice Brett Kavanaugh—undid that requirement.

In a concurring opinion, Kavanaugh added that the Fourth Amendment bans federal agents from using excessive force, and that “remedies should be available in federal court” if they do. He said that in an area like Los Angeles, featuring lots of undocumented immigrants, several factors can establish “at least reasonable suspicion” for a stop. Kavanaugh also wrote, “to the extent that excessive force has been used, the Fourth Amendment prohibits such action[.]”

But Kavanaugh and other justices have already restricted how someone can succeed when suing federal agents over constitutional violations like the use of excessive force. The 1971 case “Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents” allowed lawsuits against federal officers for monetary damages under a Fourth Amendment violation, which is supposed to prevent unreasonable searches and seizures. But SCOTUS has limited this precedent to only three cases over the years, repeatedly declining to cover new contexts, so victims of constitutional violations find it difficult to pursue a legal remedy.

And the Federal Tort Claims Act is supposed to allow civil action against a government employee for a constitutional violation, too. Still, in 2002’s “Egbert v. Boule,” a U.S. citizen who sued a Border Patrol agent over excessive force on American soil. SCOTUS decided they lacked standing under Bivens.

Trying to close that gap, state Democrats introduced the new bills days after the SCOTUS decision. On September 10, State Senator Zellnor Myrie and Assemblymember Gabriella Romero introduced the New York Civil Rights Act, S8500/A9076. The law’s text explains that it is designed to “restore a meaningful avenue of accountability consistent with federal supremacy, state sovereignty, and the longstanding principle that rights must be paired with remedies.”

The bill lets state courts issue injunctions in such cases. That means they’d be able to order a government agency or official to stop performing certain actions or behaving in particular ways, depending on the specifics of the case—like, for example, targeting New Yorkers for immigration enforcement based on their use of a language besides English.

In a press release about the New York Civil Rights Act legislation, State Senate Deputy Leader Michael Gianaris said, “We cannot leave New Yorkers defenseless to the Trump administration’s relentless assault on Americans’ civil rights.”

Two days later, State Senator Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assemblymember Micah Lasher introduced a similar bill, S8504/A9092. It would create a private right to sue federal officials who deprive New Yorkers of their constitutional rights.

The new bills build on a past proposals introduced earlier in the year. For example, State Senator Robert Jackson and Assemblymember Pamela Hunter sponsored S176/A1402 in January, making government agencies pay for any judgments against an employee or for their legal liabilities under that law.

It targets qualified immunity, the shield protecting law enforcement and public officials from lawsuits “when they deprive the rights of New Yorkers.” The legal principle prevents civil lawsuits against those federal officials, officers, or agents unless their conduct violates a clearly established law or constitutional right that any reasonably well-trained officer would know. This defense makes it hard for a plaintiff to even bring a case against the feds, let alone win it.

If passed, the laws would offer state court options that aren’t available federally, allowing compensatory damages, punitive damages, or attorney’s fees. Both the older S176/A1402 and the more recent New York Civil Rights Act also let the New York Attorney General sue on behalf of someone whose rights were violated.

The SCOTUS decision is available below, including Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent. She wrote that the lower court had found that “a very large category of presumably innocent” people were impacted. “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” she wrote.

She also pointed out that SCOTUS lifting the injunction failed to a address that use of force issue, noting that agents jumped out of cars to chase and tackle alleged targets. Sotomayor said that the SCOTUS argument improperly shifts the burden of proof away from the government and onto citizens who are supposed to have the right to due process.

Sotomayor called the majority decision a “grave misuse of our emergency docket.” Here’s the decision:",https://www.news10.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2025/06/justicekavanaugh_010725gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-15 21:57:34.092277

On Monday, Felix Kwakye Ofosu, Ghana’s minister for government communications, told the Associated Press that all 14 men —13 Nigerians and one Gambian — “have since left for their home countries,” without saying when they were returned.

Lawyers say it’s another case of the Trump administration deporting people and then trying to distance itself from the repercussions. The case has drawn parallels to that of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whom the administration mistakenly deported to El Salvador despite a court order prohibiting it, then argued it couldn’t get him back.

The Trump administration, faced with people in immigration proceedings who for legal and procedural reasons cannot be sent to their home countries, has increasingly been trying to send them to third countries with which the administration has created agreements.

Lawyers argue the men have legal protections

Lawyers representing five of the West African men filed a lawsuit Friday arguing that the men had legal protections preventing them from being sent home over concerns they’d be tortured or persecuted. The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said the men had been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries and asked the judge to immediately halt their deportations.

A federal judge Saturday asked the US government to detail what it was doing to ensure Ghana would not send the immigrants elsewhere in violation of US court orders. The administration’s agreements with so-called third countries like Ghana are part of a sweeping immigration crackdown seeking to deport millions of people from the United States.

A Department of Justice lawyer argued that the judge hearing the case had no power to control how another country treats deportees. The lawyer noted the US Supreme Court this summer ruled the administration could continue sending immigrants to countries they are not from, even if they hadn’t had a chance to raise fears of torture.

Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who is part of a legal group representing the five men in the lawsuit, said Monday that the whole situation “reeks of a scam.”

“That the United States knew these individuals were going to be sent to grave danger despite an immigration judge order, and still refused to take any action is outrageous. It seems evident that the United States has concocted a scheme to use third countries to circumvent what the United States cannot do directly,” Gelernt said.

The lawsuit filed on behalf of some of the migrants said they were held in “straitjackets” for 16 hours on a flight to Ghana and detained for days in “squalid conditions” after they arrived there.

Ghana rejects accusation that it endorses Trump’s immigration policy

The opposition and activists in Ghana have criticized the decision to accept the third-country deportees. Opposition lawmakers said it raises “serious constitutional, sovereignty and foreign policy concerns which cannot be overlooked.”

At a press briefing in the capital of Accra, Ghana’s foreign minister, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, pushed back on criticism that the decision was an endorsement of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. Ablakwa said Ghana did not receive any financial compensation from the US over the deportation.

“We just could not continue to take the suffering of our fellow West Africans,” the minister said of the rationale behind the government’s decision. “For now, the strict understanding that we have with the Americans is that we are only going to take West Africans,” he added.

Nigeria’s government said it was not briefed about its nationals being sent to Ghana and that previously it had received Nigerians deported directly from the US.

“We have not rejected Nigerians deported to Nigeria. What we have only rejected is deportation of other nationals into Nigeria,” Kimiebi Imomotimi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AP.

The authorities in Gambia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

None of the 14 deportees were originally from Ghana, and the five West Africans who filed the lawsuit did not have ties with the country or designate it as a potential country of removal, according to the complaint.

Lawyers and activists have said the Trump administration appears to be making such deportation requests to the nations most affected by his policies on trade, migration and aid.
