The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts.
Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.","The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.

By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department.

As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.”

Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.

Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists.

A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out.

In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.

“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Pretti’s body.

“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”

“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.

The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.

Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.

A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.

On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.

“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.

Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.

Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.

“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.

Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him.

“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote.

Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began.

Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms. On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.

“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.

False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement. A group of right-wing activists led by Mike Lindell — the pillow mogul currently running for governor as a Republican — claimed widespread voter fraud after the 2020 election. But as part of the state’s usual election auditing process, a random group of precincts in every congressional district were chosen for review, totaling roughly 440,000 votes after the 2020 election, spanning more than 200 precincts. The hand tallies were virtually identical to the machine tallies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0763-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 06:58:07.846046

Protests continued in Minneapolis and other US cities on Sunday over the fatal shooting by immigration agents of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said America was at an ""inflection point"" and repeated calls for US President Donald Trump to remove federal immigration agents from the city.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot on Saturday because he was ""brandishing"" a gun. Local authorities deny this, adding that the gun was legally registered and that he was shot after the gun was removed.

Trump has signalled that he might be willing to eventually withdraw ICE agents from the Minneapolis area but has not given a time frame.

""At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job,"" he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Sunday.

Multiple vigils were held for Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend. He is the second person to be fatally shot in the city during the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown this month.

Lifelong resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those who gathered on Sunday afternoon to pay her respects and protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE).

""I'm tired of protesting,"" she told the BBC. ""We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?""

Demonstrators of all ages were chanting ""No more Minnesota nice - Minneapolis on strike"" and ""ICE out now"" before they began moving through the city streets.

""This is not the America I fought for,"" said one man the BBC spoke to, who asked not to be named.

Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The chief executives of more than 60 Minnesota-based businesses, including 3M, Best Buy and Target have also signed an open letter calling for ""an immediate de-escalation of tensions"" and for local and federal officials ""to work together to find real solutions"".

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told the BBC that state officers were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's shooting by federal agents, despite securing a search warrant.

He added that all levels of law enforcement in Minnesota have been working with federal law enforcement ""for several years"", and that the unfolding situation in Minnesota was hampering agencies' ability to continue such investigations.

Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.

The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety effort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. It has also described Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist"".

Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.

Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment, saying: ""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting"".

They added that he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. According to Associated Press (AP), court records show he had no criminal record.

""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,"" his family said in the statement.

On Sunday, Tim Walz said: ""I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America.

""If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.""

Backlash against the Trump administration's crackdown is growing, including from within the Republican party.

Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt told CNN that people were watching fellow Americans being shot on television and that ""federal tactics and accountability"" had become a growing concern for voters.

Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said the Minneapolis shooting was ""incredibly disturbing"" and ""the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

Democrats have responded by threatening to block a key government financing package if it contains funds for the Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, raising the prospect of another government shutdown.

Former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both criticised the situation in Minneapolis, with the former described events in Minneapolis as ""horrible scenes"" that ""I never thought would take place in America.""

Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally.

Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as ""EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States"" must ""formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence"".

He also called on US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of ""all these problems"".

The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities.

Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging ""left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations"".

Federal agents shot and killed Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday, and videos have since emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and Pretti just before the shooting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.

O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.

The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a ""full investigation"" into the killing of Pretti.

In a statement, it said: ""Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens.""

US Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were looking for a man named Jose Huerta Chuma during a ""targeted"" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanour-level traffic offences from more than a decade ago.

The latest shooting follows weeks of tensions between the Minnesota authorities, federal agents and protesters who have taken to the streets to observe the agents during their anti-immigration raids.

Earlier this month, an ICE agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation.

In a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, Good's family law firm Romanucci & Blandin urged all Americans to ""trust their own eyes as they interpret the horrific video"" of Pretti's shooting.

Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The state is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers.
Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025.
The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024.
“So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.

“I would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,” Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.

A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China’s Xinjiang region.

The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.

Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said “there was no help from the outside world” and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration’s anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.

He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.

“We are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,” said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.”

Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.

“This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,” she said in a written response to a request for comment. “All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.”

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan’s case, the Illinois Democrat called for “careful adherence to due process and America’s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.”

Immigrants can apply for asylum when there’s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.

Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That’s about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.

The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked “abandoned” when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group’s chief operating officer. He said it’s not yet clear what caused the rise.

In cities across the country, some immigrants have stopped showing up for routine hearings after agents began making arrests right in the courtrooms, turning them into deportation traps.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.

The Chinese government has denied the allegations, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Beijing tolerates little dissent, especially on issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Communist Party rule, and has largely silenced dissent through a range of coercive means, including detention and “forced disappearances.”

Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, said he was unfamiliar with the specifics of Guan’s case but defended China’s policy toward Xinjiang.

“The Chinese government has consistently worked to promote and protect human rights, and the development and progress in Xinjiang are plain to see and should not be smeared,” Liu said in a statement.

With the footage in hand, Guan knew he had to leave the country if he was to publish it. He went first to Hong Kong without a further plan. “I played it by ear,” he said.

From Hong Kong, he flew to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could then travel without a visa, and then on to the Bahamas before sailing to Florida in October 2021. By the time he arrived, he had released most of his video footage on YouTube.

Guan settled in Queens, a borough in New York City, and said he tried to live a “stable” life. Once he had a work permit, he worked as an Uber driver and did deliveries. He cut off contact with nearly all of his relatives back in China so they would not be harassed by the police.

He said he cherished the freedom from fear he enjoyed in the U.S. Then Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched his mass deportation campaign.

Guan said he understands why Trump has taken such a radical approach.

“It’s because the past immigration policy was too lax and caused resentment from many people,” Guan said, adding that he considers such fluctuations to be “normal” in a democratic society.

“No matter what it is, any issue gets both support and opposition,” he said. “I also have come to know that people in all parts of the country are protesting the government’s too aggressive behavior.”

Local residents who don’t know him personally have shown their support, Guan said. “So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said. “At the same time, I’ve felt the warmth of the U.S. society.”

Should he be released, he said he would cherish the opportunity to stay in the United States.

“I would like to do meaningful things,” Guan said. “I hope to establish some connections with others so that I can help others.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mariettatimes.com/images/2026/01/24141315/AP-US-China-Detainee-750x500.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 05:58:47.570915

I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents.
The federal agents, Bovino added, “prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement.
Was he simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road, and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement?
“We heard the law enforcement officer say gun, gun, gun.","Bovino replied, “The victim? The victims are the Border Patrol agents. I’m not blaming the Border Patrol agents. The suspect put himself in that situation.”

Bovino said that Pretti had “injected” himself into a federal law enforcement operation and was “more than likely” on the scene to assault officers.

The federal agents, Bovino added, “prevented any specific shootings of law enforcement. So good job for our law enforcement in taking him down before he was able to do that.”

Pretti was shot and killed Saturday morning as CBP agents continued to patrol Minneapolis streets as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. He is the second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis to be killed by immigration officers in recent weeks. Renee Good was killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month in the city.

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have questioned why Pretti was in an area where agents were on the scene to arrest a “violent” illegal immigrant and accused him of interfering with federal law enforcement operations.

“Let’s look at why he was there in the first place. Was he simply walking by and just happened to walk into a law enforcement situation and try to direct traffic and stand in the middle of the road, and then assault, delay and obstruct law enforcement? Or was he there for a reason?” Bovino said on Sunday.

Video footage of the moments leading up to the shooting and verified by several media outlets, including the New York Times, shows Pretti filming the scene with his phone. While federal officials assert Pretti was holding a gun, video of the incident does not appear to corroborate the allegations. The analysis from the New York Times concludes that agents did not identify Pretti had a gun until about eight seconds after they had wrestled him to the ground.

While Pretti did hold a concealed carry license, video footage of the shooting from multiple angles appears to show Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as he approaches a woman who had been shoved to the ground by agents.

“Are you saying it’s not okay for him to exercise his Second Amendment right, not to mention his First Amendment right to be there in the first place, and if you do you can be shot by federal law enforcement?” Bash asked.

“No, I didn’t say that, Dana. I never said that,” Bovino replied. “What I’m saying is we respect that Second Amendment right. But those rights don’t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers.”

Bovino added he does not know if Pretti was unarmed at the time of the incident but said that agents believed he was in possession of one. “We heard the law enforcement officer say gun, gun, gun. So at some point they knew there was a gun,” he said.

Video footage does not appear to show Pretti holding a gun as he tried to help the woman stand. Still, agents surround Pretti and force him to the ground before opening fire.

Bovino said he doesn’t know how many agents opened fire, but that those involved “will more than likely be on administrative duty” and relocated out of Minneapolis.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F17%2Ff3%2Fe0c114bc42cfa18851c17eb05747%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-61236.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 00:58:01.283994

Chicago-based journalists filed a lawsuit in October alleging federal immigration agents suppressed the journalists’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights by using excessive force.
However, local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents if there is a criminal investigation into an individual.

Should you be arrested or somebody you know be detained by immigration agents, have an emergency plan in place.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are continuing to crack down on undocumented citizens across the United States, including large-scale operations in Chicago, Charlotte, Minneapolis and Portland. Most recently, federal agents shot and killed a Minneapolis woman witnessing an immigration detainment. Agents also shot and injured a man in Portland.

The escalating protests have led to a need to know your legal rights, such as when attending a protest or being pulled over by federal agents. Here you’ll find answers to common questions, ranging from whether you can legally be arrested at a peaceful protest to what to say prior to being detained.

Please note that for specific immigration-related legal questions, consult a lawyer.

I’m going to protest. Can I be arrested?

So long as the protest remains peaceful, you can’t be legally arrested. Citizens and non-citizens alike have First Amendment rights, which include the right to peacefully gather in public forums like streets, sidewalks, parks or plazas. Check with organizers to see if they have a permit for the protest, especially if people plan to march in the streets.

People without status, however, should be careful. According to the National Immigration Law Center, courts have not been consistent with their First Amendment rulings involving people who are undocumented. If you do choose to protest, have a plan in place in case you need to make a quick exit.

Claudia Murphy, a patrol lieutenant for the Bellingham Police Department, said police leadership will have conversations with organizers ahead of time to get an idea of the number of participants, where the gathering is happening and collect contact information.

“That has worked out really, really well for us being able to have that open line of communication,” she said. “Because the people who are gathering for the protest, they also want their folks to be safe.”

But if illegal activity, like an assault, breaks out, then police do have the right to arrest perpetrators.

“Once laws are broken, it is no longer a First Amendment right to do that,” Murphy said.

Can I film police officers or federal agents?

Yes. Filming police officers or federal agents is protected under the First Amendment. Plus, it’s legal in Washington.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem equated filming federal officers to doxxing in July during a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin doubled down on the doxxing comment in September.

“We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.

That flies in the face of what seven federal circuit courts have ruled: filming law enforcement is a protected right. The Supreme Court, however, has not weighed in on the issue.

Chicago-based journalists filed a lawsuit in October alleging federal immigration agents suppressed the journalists’ and protesters’ First Amendment rights by using excessive force.

Can immigration agents come into my house or board public transportation without a warrant?

It depends.

Because we in Whatcom and Skagit counties live within 100 miles of the border, federal law allows for Customs and Border Patrol Agents and other immigration officials to board buses and trains without a warrant. You can also be pulled over if federal law enforcement suspects someone in the vehicle committed an immigration violation or a federal crime.

On the train or bus, federal agents should ask brief questions about passengers’ immigration status and ask to see documentation. But passengers have the right to remain silent.

Should you be pulled over, federal agents should be asking questions related to why they conducted the traffic stop. You can ask about probable cause for the stop and the agent should state why. You can also ask if you’re free to leave, or you can remain silent.

However, noncitizens can still be detained without a warrant.

To make matters more complicated, for those living within 25 miles of the Canadian border in Whatcom County, immigration agents are allowed to enter private property, like a yard or ranch land, without a warrant, according to the ACLU. But their jurisdiction is narrow. If agents want to enter a house, or “dwelling,” they cannot do so without a warrant. Those inside the house can also request to review a signed warrant by a judge.

Recent reporting by the Associated Press revealed a memo circulating by ICE authorizing officers to enter homes without warrants signed by federal judges. Rather, officers can enter the home of someone with a final order of removal so long as they have an administrative warrant. The memo jeopardizes rights under the Fourth Amendment which bars unlawful searches and seizures.

Are local police and sheriff deputies working with immigration agents?

In Washington state, under the 2019 Keep Washington Working Act (KWW), it is illegal for Washington law enforcement to conduct civil immigration arrests in partnership with federal authorities.

Whatcom County Sheriff Donnell Tanksley said the last year has been one of reeducation in telling people that his office and deputies have a policy not to work with immigration authorities on civil arrests.

“Some people, not all people, but some people do not want to believe that local law enforcement are not working hand-in-hand with federal immigration authorities,” he said.

However, local law enforcement can help federal immigration agents if there is a criminal investigation into an individual.

Following an immigration-related detainment in Lynden in October, where members of the sheriff’s office’s SWAT team assisted in establishing a perimeter after federal law enforcement requested backup, Tanksley requested a meeting with the Washington state Attorney General’s Office to ensure he was in compliance with KWW.

An arrest warrant signed by a federal judge had been presented. The U.S. Border Patrol said the man arrested was a member of the Sureño gang and was under investigation for assault on a federal officer. Tanksley does not have the power to call the judge to request an explanation of the warrant.

The AG’s Office told Tanksley he was within the rights of the law.

“Maybe the optics didn’t look well, but it was there for a criminal violation,” he said. “I know a lot of people are concerned, but there’s definitely two different things going on here at the federal level that they’re doing with immigration, and what we’re doing here at the sheriff’s office is criminal investigations.”

How can I visibly tell police and federal immigration agents apart?

Bellingham police officers will have police on the back of their uniforms as well as on the front of their vests, said Murphy, the police lieutenant. The uniforms are deep blue in color and the badges feature Old City Hall on them — a unique identifier.

Police SWAT teams will wear a muted brown color but will still have a badge that says Bellingham Police on it.

Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office deputies will have patches with the sheriff’s office logo on them.

As for federal agents, it depends on the agency. Most recently, with federal immigration enforcement, agents have been in plain clothes with brown or black vests. Sometimes, the patches on the vest read ERO, or Enforcement Removal Operation, or HSI, Homeland Security Investigation. ICE can also be seen on patches. But sometimes, there is only “police” on the vest.

Federal immigration agents have also been frequently covering their faces with masks. Local law enforcement officials will not wear face coverings.

In Washington state, the legislature is mulling a bill to make it illegal for local, state and federal law enforcement to wear face coverings. California put a similar law in place at the beginning of the year.

State law already requires officers to be “reasonably identifiable” while on duty but does not specify language about face coverings.

What do I do if I’m stopped by federal immigration agents?

Remain calm and don’t run away. Don’t lie to officers or show false documentation.

Henry Hwang, directing attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, told KUOW he has differing advice based on someone’s immigration status on what to do if they’re pulled over by ICE.

Hwang said if you’re undocumented, remain silent and ask if you’re free to go. If the agent says no, then say you would like to speak with a lawyer. If you have legal status or are a citizen, you could show proof, such as a passport. Again, ask if you’re free to go.

If you’re at a protest and you’re stopped, ask if you’re free to leave. And if you are arrested, ask police why.

Should you be arrested or somebody you know be detained by immigration agents, have an emergency plan in place. That means making sure someone can take care of children and memorizing emergency numbers, including that of a lawyer.

Immigration court doesn’t guarantee a lawyer, but a detained person still has the right to speak with one.

And some Republicans were publicly digging in, suggesting that the shooting was a tragic but inevitable outcome in a city that declines to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

“I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Mr. King said.","The fatal shooting of a 37-year-old man by a federal agent in Minneapolis has set off alarm bells among Republicans, fueling worries within the party about a potential backlash to violent tactics by the Trump administration in its immigration crackdown.

Some Republicans came forward on Sunday to vigorously defend the administration and place blame for the death of the man, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a U.S. citizen, on forces on the left who oppose President Trump’s immigration policies. But many party leaders stayed silent, and some G.O.P. lawmakers both in the center and on the hard right raised grave concerns, suggesting a rare moment of dissent over a killing carried out in broad daylight and recorded by bystanders.

Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who is facing a primary challenger backed by Mr. Trump, called for a “full joint federal and state investigation” into the fatal shooting of Mr. Pretti, in a statement that called his death “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Mr. Cassidy said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”

Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement on Saturday night that he had requested testimony from the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Even Representative James Comer of Kentucky, a staunch ally of the president’s, appeared to concede that federal agents were killing innocent people in the immigration crackdown, as he suggested on Fox News’s “Sunday Morning Futures” that Mr. Trump should consider removing ICE agents from Minneapolis and sending them elsewhere.

“If the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way, and there’s a chance of losing more innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals?’” said Mr. Comer, the chairman of the Oversight Committee.

Their reactions reflected a current of discontent among at least some Republicans about the bare-knuckled tactics of Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown. They are unlikely to signal a sea change in a party that is firmly in the president’s grip, but could indicate a political red flag for the G.O.P. as it fights to maintain control of Congress in midterm elections in November.

A poll from The New York Times and Siena University conducted this month showed that roughly half of voters supported Mr. Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico, but that a sizable majority — 61 percent — believed that ICE’s tactics had gone too far.

“The death of Americans — what we’re seeing on TV — it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, told CNN on Sunday. “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.” He said that there was broad agreement with Mr. Trump’s emphasis on sealing the border, but that “he’s getting bad advice right now.”

“We have to enforce federal laws, but we need to know what is the end game,” Mr. Stitt added.

In his own scathing statement, Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, a Republican who has a long record of criticizing and clashing with Mr. Trump, condemned the immigration crackdown, saying it was “at best” a law enforcement failure and “at worst it’s a deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens that’s resulting in the murder of Americans.”

Prominent gun rights groups who count conservative Republicans among their members also raised concern about the shooting, as did former Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote in a lengthy social media post that the right would be outraged if federal agents under the Biden administration had done to a “MAGA supporter” what was done to Mr. Pretti in Minneapolis.

Neither Speaker Mike Johnson nor Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, had commented on the shooting as of Sunday evening, though a senior Senate Republican aide said the party would to push ahead as planned this week with a spending package that would fund the Department of Homeland Security, over the opposition of Democrats.

And some Republicans were publicly digging in, suggesting that the shooting was a tragic but inevitable outcome in a city that declines to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, described the episode as a “tragic shooting in Minnesota where Border Patrol agents used deadly force against an armed protester trying to impede a lawful arrest.”

“It is a direct result of the heated rhetoric and over-the-top reaction toward ICE, who are simply trying to enforce the law in sanctuary cities,” Mr. Graham said. “You have every right to protest and you have every right to disagree with President Trump. No one has the right to impede law enforcement officers carrying out their duties.”

(His account of the shooting was not supported by video of the events.)

But others, including some Republicans from politically safe districts, said they wanted an investigation into the killing and said they were upset by the videos widely circulating that showed that Mr. Pretti was restrained and disarmed before agents fired multiple shots into his back.

Representative Michael Baumgartner, Republican of Washington, said in a statement that he was “disturbed by what I’ve seen from today’s video from Minnesota.”

“It’s critically important that the American people and Congress be given a better understanding of how immigration enforcement is being handled,” Mr. Baumgartner wrote on social media, “including the methods federal law enforcement officers are using to prioritize, identify and arrest suspected targets, the training they are receiving, the implementation of body cameras, the threats they face in conducting operations and the challenges posed by sanctuary cities and states.”

While Mr. Garbarino, the New York Republican who is chairman of the homeland security panel, did not mention Minneapolis in his statement, he said: “I take my oversight duties for the department seriously, and Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Mr. Cassidy’s call for a joint investigation, which came as he is fighting for his political career amid accusations that he has been insufficiently supportive of Mr. Trump, was a break with the Trump administration’s approach. Federal officials had said the Department of Homeland Security would lead the investigation into the shooting and initially blocked Minnesota authorities from examining the scene of the shooting, according to a state official.

Other Republicans who are not seeking re-election, including Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, also endorsed a fuller investigation.

Some conservatives expressed alarm about the administration’s attempts to justify the shooting by noting that Mr. Pretti, who had a license for a concealed firearm, was carrying a pistol when he was killed.

“Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don’t understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,” Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and a libertarian who often clashes with Mr. Trump, wrote on social media.

Senate Democrats had said on Saturday that they would not vote for a spending package needed to avert a government shutdown at the end of the week if it included money for the Department of Homeland Security, and Republicans had considered trying to drop that portion of the deal. But the senior aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans have yet to be announced, said the legislation, which also funds the Pentagon and other programs, would move ahead as one bill, raising the risk of a funding lapse.

Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he “hates” government shutdowns but that he might be forced to back one this week. In November, Mr. King was one of eight senators in the Democratic caucus who broke their party’s blockade and voted with Republicans to advance legislation to end the government shutdown.

“I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Mr. King said.

After a year of gutting the United States government, deploying armed jackboots to American cities, and bombing at least seven countries, the Trump administration kicked off 2026 by invading Venezuela and kidnapping its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores. In the wake of that assault, President Trump doubled down on his abandonment of the isolationist positions he once supposedly held, threatening military action against Colombia, Cuba, Iran, and Mexico. He then vowed that the U.S. would come to “own” Greenland either “the easy way” or “the hard way.”

In truth, American imperialism defines much of this country’s history, but the latest escalation comes at a time when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have also been deployed around the nation to grab immigrants off the streets and whisk them to detention centers. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to preach the jingoistic gospel of stopping the arrival of new refugees and migrants, while blasting European governments over migration — even as he vows to launch military campaigns that will undoubtedly result in further mass displacements and fleeing people crossing borders in search of safety.

Destabilizing countries the world over and then attacking the people who flee those wars is, of course, nothing new. From the September 11th attacks in 2001 until September 2020, this country’s war on terror, according to one study, displaced an estimated 37 million people in eight countries. And that figure doesn’t even include several million displaced during smaller conflicts the U.S. participated in from Chad to Tunisia, Mali to Saudi Arabia. Nor does it include the number of people displaced by Israel’s five wars since 2008 in and around the Gaza Strip, its land theft in the occupied West Bank, or its frequent airstrikes in Lebanon, Syria, and even Iran, all made possible thanks to Washington’s financial and military support.

When it comes to Washington demonizing the people displaced by its weapons, just ask the Palestinians. Millions of them live strewn across the map of the Middle East and beyond thanks to Israel’s ongoing military occupation and the American tax dollars that have enabled it.

“Eight Lives, Gone Just Like That”

In March 2015, I sat in the back of a taxi bound for Saida, a Lebanese coastal city a little less than an hour south of Beirut. The taxi hummed down the highway, the sea blurring through the windows to our right, and then swerved inland. Saida is more than 30 miles north of the country’s boundary with Israel and some 50 miles west of the border with Syria, but even that deep inside Lebanon, a de facto border appeared in the front windshield. The driver made a series of turns, braked, and inched toward a military checkpoint outside Ain al-Hilweh, a Palestinian refugee camp.

Lebanese soldiers appeared on either side of the vehicle. Their job was to decide who could — and could not — enter the camp. After reading over our documents and ensuring that we had the proper military permission to enter the camp, the soldiers motioned the driver to move forward. We eased in amid a sprawl of ramshackle homes, many built atop one another. It was a dusty, humid day, but people clogged the streets. Children punted a soccer ball back and forth in the road. Motorbikes trembled over potholes. Men stood around in knots, smoking cigarettes and sipping coffee, and some walked by with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders.

Along with an American photographer and a Lebanese reporter, I had gone to Ain al-Hilweh, the largest of Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian camps, to speak to people who had been doubly displaced by the war in neighboring Syria. As that civil war tore through the country — a war that drew interventions from the U.S., Great Britain, France, Israel, Russia, Iran, and several other places — Palestinian refugees from Syria found themselves fleeing to Lebanon. The population of Ain al-Hilweh alone had swelled by tens of thousands.

Of the Palestinians we met that day, the only ones who had ever set foot in their ancestral homeland were those who had been born before — and lived through — the 1948 war that led to Israel’s creation. What we’d soon learn, however, was that a term like double displacement failed to capture the extent to which borders had governed every aspect of their lives in permanent and repeated exile.

In a corner store with barren shelves, we found Afaf Dashe sitting in a small chair near the counter. At 70 years old, she had survived the Nakba — Arabic for catastrophe, the term Palestinians use to describe the ethnic cleansing of their country since 1948 — as a three-year-old girl when her family fled to Syria. She had grown up in a suburb of Damascus, married, and raised children. When civil war started to rip through Syria in 2011, she and her family gritted it out through four years of barrel bombs, airstrikes, and shelling before they finally escaped.

While Ain al-Hilweh offered some respite, it offered neither true safety nor stability. In Lebanon, decades of state repression, lethal Israeli interventions, and failed Palestinian rebellions had left such refugees particularly vulnerable. Rather than setting down new roots in that dismal camp, Afaf explained, three of her daughters, along with five of her grandchildren, had decided to risk taking the long, often deadly journey to Europe. After crossing from Syria to Lebanon, they parted with Afaf and continued on by sea to Libya. They then paid smugglers to board a boat bound for Italy. As Afaf reached that point in her story, tears gathered in her eyes and she paused, for a long moment staring into the distance, seemingly at nothing, before turning back to us. The boat carrying her family, she said, had capsized in the Mediterranean Sea. “Eight lives, gone just like that. For my whole life, I’ve seen Palestinians move from tragedy to tragedy, and from nakba to nakba.”

More than once in her life, it occurred to me, wars had pushed her, her children, and her grandchildren across borders and, in a distinctly embattled world, borders decided where she and her loved ones could possibly move, where they could live, and where they could die. I thought about the U.S. passport in my pocket, the relative ease with which I had crossed borders throughout my adult life, and the American tax dollars that helped doom Afaf to a life of permanent exile. She would be the first person I met who had lost loved ones simply looking to cross a border to find safety, but by no means the last.

Violent Borders

For tens of millions of people, borders are not merely places where the risk of violence is present. Borders are, by definition, violent. Borders are not merely crossed. Borders must be survived and endured. Borders are not only walls and razor wire. Borders are guards and police, surveillance cameras and drones, batons and bullets. For those tens of millions of people, borders don’t stop where one country ends and the next begins; they stalk and haunt across endless miles and years. Borders are both crime scenes and crimes, with nationalism the motive.

For people forced to flee, the violence doesn’t stop once they escape countries being bombed or economically strangled. The journey itself offers its own slate of dangers. The International Migration Organization has recorded more than 33,200 instances of refugees and migrants dying or going missing in the Mediterranean Sea alone since 2014. Between 1994 and 2024, rights groups estimate that more than 80,000 people died in the deserts or rivers on and around the U.S.-Mexico border.

Throughout the last decade, I’ve traveled along the European refugee trail, stopping off in countries across the Balkans and Central and Western Europe, while also reporting from American communities along the heavily militarized U.S.-Mexico border. Wherever I’ve gone, the displaced have horror stories to tell — of people drowned at sea, of migrants shot along borders, and others who simply disappeared along “the refugee trail.” At a shelter in Belgrade, Serbia, Afghans who had fled the fallout of the U.S. war in their country and walked the endless land route from Turkey spoke of the Bulgarian border police who had detained, threatened, or beaten them along the way. On the Serbian border with Hungary, Moroccans and Algerians told me of policemen who beat their feet with batons to deter them from ever trying to cross the border again. In Greece, young men from Sudan and Somalia — their countries no strangers to U.S. intervention — described the tear gas and rubber bullets they faced on the country’s northern border with Macedonia. In Turkey, Syrians told me about the dogs that Bulgarian border police sicced on them. In Arizona, people recalled walking for so long in the Mexican desert that the soles of their shoes tore apart.

Perhaps more than anything else, the idea of strong borders has fueled the fascist-style surge that now grips the United States and significant parts of Europe. From the time Donald Trump first entered the Oval Office in January 2017, far-right and ultranationalist parties around Europe have also gained ground in ways that would once have been unimaginable — and where the far right has yet to take power, center-left and liberal parties have often swung hard to the right on their immigration and border enforcement policies.

In one breath, even Democratic Party officials in the United States, still singing praises of liberal democracy, are also promising to crack down on immigration and strengthen border enforcement in a desperate bid to appear tougher in the age of Donald Trump. In the United Kingdom, the center-left Labour Party ousted the Conservatives in 2024, only to put into practice anti-immigrant policies that align with those even further to the right, like Nigel Farage and his UK Independence Party. In Greece, even after the violent neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party was banned, following years of anti-immigrant violence, the nominally center-right New Democracy Party adopted and repackaged its rhetoric in slightly modified form, while placing a former fascist in charge of its migration ministry. From the United States to Europe, immigration is ever less often discussed as a humanitarian issue and ever more often described in terms of an “invasion,” functionally recasting desperate civilians as armed soldiers.

Politically, the invasion story is more easily digestible than the grim actual stories of displaced people. Unsurprisingly, it has found ever larger audiences. And consider that a grim irony, since so many of the people crossing into the U.S. and Europe, even before they faced deadly journeys at sea and militarized borders, were driven from their countries at least in part due to American and European involvement in mass violence and policies designed to foster economic collapse in their homelands.

Such invasion stories about immigrants are, of course, anything but new, after centuries in which a nationalistic desire for hard borders has undergirded so many claims that war and violence are necessary. In 1908, a decade before she herself was deported from the United States, the Lithuanian-American anarchist Emma Goldman pointed to the violence at the heart of such nationalism during a speech in San Francisco. “Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate,” she told her audience. “Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot consider themselves nobler, better, grander, more intelligent than those living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living on that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die in the attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.”

Hope in the Pushback

In the decade since I started covering migration and borders, I have also witnessed what resistance to the anti-immigrant far right might look like. In Greece, activists and volunteers, anarchists, socialists, and everyday people worked together to do what they could to offer an alternative to the grim realities displaced people were experiencing. On Greek islands like Lesbos, humanitarians gathered by the shore to help the displaced disembark from boats. Others headed out to sea to rescue people from sinking vessels. In Athens, anarchists and other leftists occupied abandoned buildings, refashioning them into squats that displaced immigrants could inhabit without the overcrowding and decrepit living conditions of the official camps. In Germany, everyday people opened their homes to newly arrived refugees. In Austin, Texas, the congregants of a church told me about how they had taken in asylum seekers facing deportation.

And today, Americans in cities from Chicago to Los Angeles have rallied to push back against the Trump administration’s immigration raids. Ever since an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis in January, ever more protesters have taken to the streets in growing numbers to voice their opposition to state-sanctioned murder and the Trump administration’s drive to carry out mass deportations fueled more by cruelty than any concern for the country’s safety. As the president deepens federal deployments and threatens to use the military against what he calls the “invasion from within,” those demonstrators undoubtedly understand that their own fates are wrapped up with those of immigrants and refugees. Squats, humanitarian aid, and mass protests may not stop the cruel wheels of the anti-immigrant political machine, but they do offer glimmers of hope at a time when hope is in short supply.

In the early months of 2026, that hope may be needed more than ever, in part because all too many Americans and Europeans continue to empower politicians who recycle the tired argument that, if there were fewer immigrants, life in their countries would be more prosperous and peaceful. In the lead-up to the 2024 election, Donald Trump bluntly assured Americans that immigrants were invaders who were “poisoning the blood of our country.” During the first year of his second term, his administration snatched international students off the streets, separated families, and shipped immigrants off to foreign prisons. Meanwhile, he continued to repeatedly tell Americans that they were being “invaded,” a story that comes with a painful body count, while courting what inevitably loiters behind nationalism and nativism: fear.

In her novel White Teeth, Zadie Smith put all of that in perspective this way: “But it makes an immigrant laugh to hear the fears of the nationalist, scared of infection, penetration, miscegenation when this is small fry, peanuts, compared to what the immigrant fears — dissolution, disappearance.”

Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimated that more than 122 million people across the world had been displaced as a result of war, violence, or persecution, a number that marked a decade-long high and was also the 10th consecutive year that the total number of people displaced across the globe had increased. Worse yet, war and military campaigns are still driving people from their homes globally.

Sooner than later, such wars and other disasters will result in yet more people seeking safety in Europe and the United States. When that happens, there is little doubt that far-right leaders, hoping to offload the blame for their own failures, will once again stand in front of us and claim that state violence is necessary to protect our country from an “invasion.” Then, you’ll have to make a choice: You can buy into the claim that the most powerful countries on the planet are the victims of invasions or remember that actual invasions and the military campaigns that create lethal cycles of mass displacement are happening in all too many places on this planet. That choice will determine just how much hope there is for a world where desperate people escaping disasters they had no hand in creating don’t have to consider crossing a manmade line a matter of negotiating their very survival.

SARAH MCCAMMON: OK.
SARAH MCCAMMON: So there is bipartisan pushback against this killing and the Trump administration's response.
After Saturday's killing, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told NBC she just can't vote for the current funding package.","SARAH MCCAMMON, HOST:

This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Sarah McCammon. Tensions remain high in Minnesota, where local and federal officials continue to fight over the killing of Alex Pretti. The 37-year-old U.S. citizen and VA nurse was shot dead by federal officers during an immigration enforcement protest in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti's killing has prompted strong bipartisan condemnation today in Congress, a forceful defense from the Trump administration and the prospect of another government shutdown. NPR's Luke Garrett joins us now to explain. Hi, Luke.

LUKE GARRETT, BYLINE: Hello, Sarah.

SARAH MCCAMMON: Well, let's start in Minneapolis, Luke. What do we know about the investigation into Pretti's killing?

GARRETT: Local and state law enforcement remain at odds with federal officials. The Department of Homeland Security is investigating this deadly shooting, but they're not cooperating or sharing information with those local and state investigators. Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota accused the Trump administration of a, quote, ""cover-up"" Sunday. She told NPR the federal government is ignoring a recent court order that allows state investigators access to the evidence around Pretti's killing.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR CONTENT)

TINA SMITH: Our state investigators had to get a warrant to have access to the evidence of the shooting of Alex Pretti. And even then, the federal agents refused to give them access to the evidence.

GARRETT: Now, Smith called on the Trump administration to preserve the evidence and share it with those local and state investigators. And it's worth noting here, Sarah, that three moderate GOP senators echoed this call. Those are Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Murkowski went further and called for congressional hearings as well.

SARAH MCCAMMON: And what are we hearing from the Trump administration?

GARRETT: The Trump administration, you know, continues to defend the federal agents who killed Pretti. They also criticized the 37-year-old VA nurse, you know, saying he was, quote, ""perpetrating violence."" Here's the head of President Trump's immigration operation, Border Patrol commander, Greg Bovino, on CNN.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""STATE OF THE UNION WITH JAKE TAPPER AND DANA BASH"")

GREG BOVINO: That suspect injected himself into that law enforcement's - into that law enforcement situation with a weapon.

GARRETT: Now Sarah, the video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far refute that assertion. There has been no evidence that NPR has verified of Pretti brandishing his handgun at any time during the encounter with federal agents. And to be clear, legally carrying a concealed firearm is protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution.

SARAH MCCAMMON: OK. So what are gun rights groups saying about this?

GARRETT: So they are taking issue with a post from Trump-appointed U.S. attorney Bill Essayli. He said if a U.S. citizen approaches law enforcement with a gun, federal officers, quote, ""will be legally justified in shooting you."" The gun rights group the NRA, you know, called this post, quote, ""dangerous and wrong."" Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky and frequent Trump critic, went a step further saying Essayli had, quote, ""no business in law enforcement or government.""

SARAH MCCAMMON: So there is bipartisan pushback against this killing and the Trump administration's response. What can Congress actually do?

GARRETT: Well, Senate Democrats are poised to partially shut down the government. The deadline for government funding is Friday, and the Senate still needs to approve the funding for some government departments. One of them is the DHS. After Saturday's killing, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told NBC she just can't vote for the current funding package. Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Angus King of Maine have all said they won't vote for it, either. That's notable. They're very moderate Democratic senators as well. So on Saturday, Senate Majority - Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would not vote to advance the spending package if it includes this DHS funding, so it's setting up a fight in Congress.

SARAH MCCAMMON: NPR's Luke Garrett, thanks so much.

Federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, early on Saturday, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway in the Midwestern city, less than three weeks after an immigration officer fired on Renee Good, also 37, killing her in her car.

President Donald Trump's administration quickly claimed that Pretti had intended to harm the federal agents – as it did after Good's death – pointing to a pistol it said was discovered on him. However, video shared widely on social media and verified by US media outlets showed Pretti never drew the weapon, with agents firing around 10 shots at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with chemical irritant and thrown to the ground.

The video further inflamed ongoing protests in Minneapolis against the presence of federal agents, with around 1,000 people participating in a demonstration on Sunday. One person held a cardboard sign that read: ""Be Pretti, be Good.""

Trump slams Minnesota Democratic officials

Trump provocatively attributed the deaths to Minnesota's Democratic elected officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, writing on his Truth Social platform: ""Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE."" ""Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,"" he added.

While administration officials have defended the officer who shot Pretti, Trump in a brief Sunday interview with the Wall Street Journal declined twice to say whether the officer had acted appropriately. ""We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,"" the president told the paper

US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, speaking to NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" also said an investigation was necessary to get a full understanding of the killing. Asked if agents had already removed the pistol from Pretti when they fired on him, Blanche said: ""I do not know. And nobody else knows, either. That's why we're doing an investigation.""

When asked on Sunday what she would say to Pretti's parents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said: ""Just that I'm grieved for them."" ""I truly am. I can't even imagine losing a child,"" she told Fox News show The Sunday Briefing. She said more clarity would come as an investigation progresses.

'Sickening lies'

After top officials described Pretti as an ""assassin"" who had assaulted the agents, Pretti's parents issued a statement Saturday condemning the administration's ""sickening lies"" about their son.

Barack and Michelle Obama, meanwhile, issued a forceful statement condemning the killing of Pretti by federal agents, saying it exemplified President Trump's ""assault"" on American values. ""The killing of Alex Pretti is a heartbreaking tragedy. It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,"" the former president and first lady said in a joint statement.

Hours later Bill Clinton delivered a fierce indictment of the current administration, saying peaceful protesters ""have been arrested, beaten, teargassed, and most searingly, in the cases of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, shot and killed."" ""All of this is unacceptable,"" Clinton said in a statement as he urged Americans to ""stand up, speak out."" ""If we give our freedoms away after 250 years, we might never get them back.""

'Joint' probe

Their comments came after multiple senators from Trump's Republican Party called for a thorough probe into the killing, and for cooperation with local authorities. ""There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,"" Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said. The Trump administration controversially excluded local investigators from a probe into Good's killing.

Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz posed a question directly to the president during a press briefing Sunday, asking: ""What's the plan, Donald Trump?"" ""What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state?""

On Sunday, business leaders from 60 corporations headquartered in Minnesota – including retailer Target, food giant General Mills and several professional sports franchises – signed an open letter ""calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.""

Court order

Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed to heavily Democratic Minneapolis for weeks, after conservative media reported on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants. Trump has repeatedly amplified the racially-tinged accusations, including on Sunday when he posted on his Truth Social platform: ""Minnesota is a Criminal COVER UP of the massive Financial Fraud that has gone on!""

The city, known for its bitterly cold winters, has one of the country's highest concentrations of Somali immigrants. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison pushed back against Trump's claim, telling reporters ""it's not about fraud, because if he sent people who understand forensic accounting, we'd be having a different conversation. But he's sending armed masked men.""

Since ""Operation Metro Surge"" began, many residents have carried whistles to notify others of the presence of immigration agents, while sometimes violent skirmishes have broken out between the officers and protesters. Local authorities have sued the federal government seeking a court order to suspend the operation, with a first hearing set for Monday.

Recent polling has shown voters increasingly upset with Trump's domestic immigration operations, as videos of masked agents seizing people off sidewalks – including children – and dramatic stories of US citizens being detained proliferate.",https://img.lemde.fr/2026/01/25/0/0/8256/5504/1440/960/60/0/652a7f4_ftp-1-jwmujxq72hyo-5987088-01-06.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:20.449016

Why it matters: The growing tension could result in a government shutdown, politically charged hearings and even an impeachment vote.

More and more Democrats are signing onto Rep. Robin Kelly's (D-Ill.) articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, with Kelly's office telling Axios they expect a surge in co-sponsors in the coming day.

Senate Democrats are threatening to allow a partial government shutdown next week unless a DHS funding bill is altered with language reining in the agency.

And Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), the chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, has asked the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to testify to his panel.

Driving the news: While many Republican leaders and loyal Trump allies leapt to DHS' defense in the wake of the shooting, a noticeably large group of GOP lawmakers offered more equivocal statements than in the aftermath of the Renee Good shooting weeks earlier.

Many centered their responses on calling for a full investigation, including Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), Jon Husted (R-Ohio), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.), Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas).

The office of Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.), a staunch conservative and Trump ally, said in a statement: ""Leaders at every level must lower the temperature, enforce the law, and protect public safety. In the days ahead, we will work to ensure a full and transparent review of events.""

""Law enforcement should conduct an objective investigation and get the facts. We defend people's free speech and right to protest,"" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) in a statement to Axios, though he added that it is ""not right to interfere or obstruct law enforcement in their official actions.""

Zoom in: The responses of Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) to two different shootings in her home state offer a revealing picture of how the GOP's tone has shifted since the start of the year.

After Renee Good was killed on Jan. 7, Fischbach called the incident a ""targeted assault on ICE agents"" in a post on X, writing, ""I stand with the officer who acted in self-defense to save lives.""

On Sunday, she wrote after Pretti was killed: ""I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life in Minneapolis and fully support the ongoing investigation into this incident.""

Between the lines: Some Republicans also broke with the administration for saying Pretti should not have had a gun on him.

Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) write on X that ""ICE should not leave Minnesota"" but that ""carrying a gun & magazines is not an invitation for cops to shoot you.""

""Fighting cops (esp. w/ a gun) might be,"" he added.

The other side: DHS still had a semblance of Democratic support on Capitol Hill before the shooting, but what little was left appears to have evaporated.

Rep. Laura Gillen (D-N.Y.), one of the seven swing-district centrists who voted to pass a DHS funding bill last week, signed on as a co-sponsor to Kelly's articles of impeachment.

Even some support from senators began to trickle in on Sunday, with centrist Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) calling for Noem's impeachment.

The articles of impeachment stood at Democratic 120 co-sponsors as of Sunday evening — well over half of the 213 Democrats in the House. Kelly can force them to a vote, though it is not clear if and when she plans to do that.

What to watch: The most immediate impact of the shooting will be in the Senate, where a package of six spending bills is now in significant peril.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said this weekend that Democrats won't vote for the DHS funding bill.

The package would also fund a huge portion of the federal government beyond DHS, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Transportation and Labor.

Take a listen to what he said during his speech at Davos where he tried to coerce Denmark and other U.S. allies to give the United States control of Greenland.
When he threatened force to take Greenland, when he threatened to put tariffs on U.S. allies, the markets tumbled.
RASCOE: Well, what are some of the long-term implications of Trump's aggressive posture toward U.S. allies?","AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Joining us now is NPR senior political correspondent Mara Liasson. Welcome.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi there.

RASCOE: So, you know, as you just heard, there's a lot we don't know about the shooting yesterday in Minneapolis. But what strikes you politically about this?

LIASSON: One thing that strikes me is how the Trump administration tries to get out immediately after these incidents with a narrative that may or may not be true. This happened with the shooting of Renee Macklin Good just a few weeks ago, when the administration said she carried out an act of domestic terrorism. Trump called her a professional agitator, accused Good of trying to run over the ICE agent who shot her, before there was an investigation or much evidence of this.

We're also seeing some pushback from Congress. Senate Democrats say they will not vote for the Department of Homeland Security's funding bill. And all this occurs at a time when Trump's approval ratings are dropping. Immigration has been the aspect of Trump's policies that was the most popular. Voters in general approve of his efforts to secure the Southern border and to deport undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

But new polls show that a majority of voters disapprove of ICE's tactics. Now, a New York Times poll taken right before the second fatal shooting shows that majorities of voters disapprove of the way ICE is doing its job. Only 36% of voters approve, and 61% said ICE had, quote, ""gone too far."" Now, this could have an impact on the midterm elections, even though Trump himself is not on the ballot.

RASCOE: I want to - you know, moving on another topic. I want to ask you about yet another tariff threat from President Trump. He's now saying he'll impose a hundred-percent tariff if Canada moves ahead with the trade deal with China. Is this fallout over Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's remarks at Davos last week?

LIASSON: It seems like it. Carney gave a very candid speech, laying out what he called a rupture in the world order. He encouraged middle countries like his and other NATO allies to work more independently, saying they can't rely on the U.S. anymore as a stabilizing force. That speech got a standing ovation. Donald Trump didn't like it at all, and then he threatened the 100% tariffs on Canada.

And the trade deal that Canada made with China - where they agreed to lower tariffs on some Chinese electric vehicles, China agreed to lower tariffs on some Canadian agriculture products - interestingly enough, Trump was for it. He seems to have reversed himself. When the deal was announced last week, he said it was a good thing. He said, it's what you should be doing. He said, quote, ""if you can get a deal with China, you should do that."" But then he changed his mind. He now is attacking Carney for being ungrateful. And the bottom line here is that Donald Trump is very unpredictable.

RASCOE: Well, and given that he reverses himself so much over tariffs, are these threats kind of losing their punch?

LIASSON: Well, they could be. He does have a pattern of blustering then backing down. This is something termed the TACO theory for Trump always chickens out. And some of these threats seem to be performative for Trump. At times, he sounds like he's in a ""Godfather"" movie. Take a listen to what he said during his speech at Davos where he tried to coerce Denmark and other U.S. allies to give the United States control of Greenland.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.

LIASSON: And I think it's apt that the term TACO came originated with Wall Street traders because the markets seem to be the last guardrails on Trump's behavior. When he threatened force to take Greenland, when he threatened to put tariffs on U.S. allies, the markets tumbled. Then when he backed off, the markets bounced back. But the bottom line again is, the whole - his behavior is so unpredictable, and it makes some sort of sense that other countries - even long-term US allies - are now looking to find their own path and make deals with other superpowers like China.

RASCOE: Well, what are some of the long-term implications of Trump's aggressive posture toward U.S. allies?

LIASSON: They could be profound. If the Western alliance permanently ruptures, the implications could be very big. Article 5 of NATO says, an attack on one member is an attack on all. All protect each other. But Donald Trump has called that into question, raising doubts about whether he would come to Europe's aid if it was invaded by Russia.

And the question hanging over Europe right now is, if the alliance does rupture, is it possible for Europe to rearm itself to make up for losing the U.S. as an ally? Does Europe have the means or the will to do this, to make up for the intelligence and the weapon systems and the nuclear umbrella that they get from the United States? Estimates are that it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars and take decades.

So this is a big question. There really isn't an alternative to the Western alliance for European countries. And in the meantime, Russia is happy to see these divisions. Vladimir Putin has been trying to break the Western alliance for his entire life, and right now, he's watching it break apart possibly from the inside, so this is a big gift to Putin and a lot of uncertainty for European countries going forward.

RASCOE: That's NPR senior national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara.

LIASSON: Thank you.

It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents.","Following the killing of Minnesota nurse Alex Pretti at the hands of a Border Patrol officer on Saturday, Michigan’s U.S. Senate candidates are now laying out their plans on how to deal with increasingly violent federal immigration enforcement actions that have resulted in three shootings in three weeks, with two now ending in death.

Local and state Democratic officials in Minnesota immediately condemned Saturday’s shooting as protests ramped up, while Republican President Donald Trump threatened again to send military forces to Minnesota, according to reporting from Michigan Advance’s sister publication, Minnesota Reformer.

In Michigan, the three Democrats in the Senate race followed suit, but they each have slightly different policy contemplations to either rein in, curb or abolish the executive branch’s increasingly troubling immigration force.

Former health official and Bernie Sanders-wing progressive Abdul El-Sayed has called for the outright dismantling of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a position he’s held since 2018, a message he has amplified in the wake of the government killings of Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7.

“The murderers of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were eight-year and ten-year agents — training isn’t the issue,” El-Sayed said in a statement issued Sunday. “ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against and our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot? Ask the families of Renee Good or Alex Pretti — both American Citizens — if ICE is protecting us. There can be no justification for lawlessness in the name of the law. And now is not the time to put political convenience. Trump is trying to normalize military force on peaceful streets, tearing apart our constitutional rights one by one. Our tax dollars are being used to kill Americans on our streets rather than save lives in our hospitals like Alex did.”

El-Sayed added that the U.S. must work to secure its border and work toward comprehensive immigration reform through legislation, and not through continued executive action. ICE, in that regard, has been shown to be “irredeemable,” he said.

“Retraining won’t fix it,” El-Sayed said. “And the only reason to deny this is political cowardice. … Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

While El-Sayed stated his belief that this stance sets him apart from his opponents, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) has called for denying further funding for ICE and has demanded the immediate and sweeping overhaul of the agency. She says the upcoming vote in the U.S. Senate would be a good place to start for Democrats to assert leverage.

“Another person was killed by ICE in Minneapolis, after state leaders told them to leave, local officials told them to leave, and local law enforcement told them to leave,” McMorrow said in a statement on Saturday. “But Trump’s ICE continues on its collision course making our communities LESS safe — not more. Congress: not one more penny until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”

McMorrow and her Democratic colleagues in the Michigan Senate are working on a game plan to respond to ICE tactics in the Great Lakes state, and that includes legislation prohibiting officers from being masked on operations with full identification. News that ICE has been distributing memos indicating that the agency does not need a judicial warrant — but rather a Fourth Amendment-bucking administrative warrant signed by an ICE official — has also led state Democrats to consider banning entry by law enforcement without a warrant.

McMorrow has also called for strict, codified use-of-force policies on the federal level to give courts a clear line for when an officer has abused their station if it ends in a preventable violent encounter. Vetting of recruits and vigorous training is part of McMorrow’s plan, as well as a demand that ICE stop detaining American citizens.

“Continuing to provide funding to this agency without a complete overhaul to return it to its duty will be a failure to meet the moment,” McMorrow said in a statement released prior to the death of Pretti this weekend. “The leverage is there. And Democrats should force Republicans to the table to demand that Congress use its power of the purse to end this nightmare and restore the community safety that Americans are demanding.”

U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) on Sunday said she was joining as a co-sponsor for H.R. 7163, which would divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund, created with the passage of last year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, to state and local law enforcement agencies.

The bill would hire and train an estimated 200,000 local police officers across the nation, reverting funds to what Stevens called “proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.”

“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control — this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” Stevens said in a statement. “Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached. It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents. We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”

Other aspects of the bill include:

Reallocating $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions); and

Reallocating $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens voted against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, which did pass in the U.S. House last week, and last year co-sponsored the VISIBLE Act to ban ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities. Stevens has also called for U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to be removed from office and co-sponsored articles for Noem’s impeachment.

What about Republicans?

The main Republican in the race, former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, as of Sunday afternoon, had not issued a direct statement on the killing of Pretti. Rogers, who is endorsed by Trump, did issue several statements following the killing of Good, saying Democrats, and more specifically his Democratic opponents in the race, were persistently supporting “criminals over cops and America’s safety.”

“The Left’s never-ending war against law enforcement is an assault on Americans’ safety,” Rogers said in a statement issued Jan. 22. “These brave men and women protect our streets so that Michigan families can drive to work and walk to school without fear. But when you have Democrats releasing violent offenders onto the streets, and siding with criminals over cops, that all goes out the window.”

The only other Republican in the race, former Michigan Republican Party co-chair Bernadette Smith, has not issued any public statement on either Pretti or Good’s deaths.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_7744-2048x1536-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:02.727687

BG Independent News

As Americans watch ICE agents sweep into cities in Democratic states, some wonder who will be next. If ICE were to show up in this region, what rights do immigrants have? And what role can bystanders play legally?

To answer those questions, a “Build the Nest” training was hosted last week by LaConexion of Wood County, a non-profit community-based organization bringing unity, voice and representation to the immigrant community in the Northwest Ohio region.

The training was led by Mechelle Zarou, an attorney serving immigrant and refugee families in Northwest Ohio, and Brittany Ford from Welcome Toledo-Lucas County.

“We are building a nest of protection for immigrants across the state,” Ford explained.

Making immigrants and citizens aware of their rights has become rather complicated in the past year since the federal government is ignoring some long-standing constitutional human rights.

“We really have no pathway to legal immigration to the U.S.,” Ford said. There is no refugee or asylum system anymore – “unless you’re a white Afrikaner.”

“When we created these materials, we were in a very different world,” Zarou said.

The brutality seen in Minneapolis the last few weeks has shaken up faith in the rights people previously relied upon, she said.

“Everyone has rights,” Zarou said. “We’re holding them (ICE) accountable for following the law.”

Here are some tips offered for those who may encounter ICE:

If you are stopped on a street or in a public place, you have rights under the 5th Amendment to remain silent. Arrests cannot legally be made without warrants, unless ICE agents have reason to believe you have committed a crime – other than just being brown. In Ohio, while people are required to give police their name, address and date of birth – there is no requirement to answer questions about citizenship.

Carry the small “Know Your Rights” wallet-sized card with you. It states your rights as a human being. They are available with English writing on one side, and 18 different languages on the other.

Use your 4th Amendment rights to not give authorities permission to enter your home – unless they have a warrant signed by a judge or magistrate with your name on it. ICE has been using battering rams to violate that Constitutional right, Zarou said. “They should be held to comply with the law just like we are,” she said.

Ask to speak to an attorney. Since ICE is likely to confiscate your phone, have a phone number memorized for a legal aid attorney.

If you speak a language other than English, you have the right to an interpreter, as part of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964. “Which hasn’t been rescinded yet,” Ford said.

Don’t sign anything without your attorney present. No matter how much pressure is exerted, do not sign paperwork that may be seen as a waiver of rights or an agreement to deportation. “There’s a lot of tricks being played,” Zarou said.

Do not lie to immigration enforcement since that could be used as reason for deportation. “Under no circumstances should anyone give false information,” Zarou said.

Detained immigrants have the right to ask to be released on bond.

In preparation for encounters with ICE, immigrants should collect and copy important documents. Zarou – who hopes this still holds true in America – does not recommend carrying your passport in public.

Make plans for temporary guardians for your children if it becomes necessary.

Ford and Zarou also talked about how local residents can be effective bystanders, offering support and documenting incidents legally.

Confrontations with ICE agents are often “highly charged situations,” so it’s important that bystanders not interfere, Zarou said. However, citizens are in no way required to help ICE enforce immigration laws.

“You can be a good bystander in a lot of different ways,” she said. For example:

Bystanders can lawfully videotape ICE officers. That has put some citizens at risk in some communities. So if videotaping is too scary, use your phone to record audio.

As soon as the incident is over, write down everything you witnessed right away, while it’s still fresh in your memory. “Eyewitness testimony still means something,” Zarou said.

If you witness someone being detained by ICE, you can advise that person to remain silent.

You can volunteer to deliver groceries to immigrant families who fear leaving their homes, or offer help with their children if the adults are detained.

“Safe spaces,” like churches should have some spaces labeled as “private” where ICE agents cannot legally enter.

During the meeting, Pastor Jeff Schooley asked if Bowling Green City Council could establish some local rules for ICE agents – such as not allowing facial masks, requiring body-cameras and limiting how local police assist ICE.

While some communities have taken such actions, the federal government is ignoring local ordinances, Ford and Zarou said. And declarations of “sanctuary city” status have made some communities targets for the federal government.

Ford also shared data about immigrants in Ohio. In 2023, there were approximately 550,000 living in the state – about 4.7% of the population. Many of them filled positions as physicians, professors, and STEM professions. Asians made up the largest percentage of immigrants, at 42%.

Ohio’s population grew from 2023-2024 – only due to immigrants, Ford said.

In 2024, immigrants paid total taxes of $7 billion in Ohio. “We need immigrants,” Ford said.",https://bgindependentmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-BGIN_logo_blue_square_300px-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:57:47.159363

Minnesotans shot – and even killed – at the hands of federal agents.

U.S. citizens arrested by masked officers in broad daylight.

These headlines should be enough to make anyone rethink their support of President Donald Trump’s immigration agencies.

The death of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday – caught on camera from multiple angles — must finally shock this country’s lawmakers into action.

The country is horrified by abuses committed using hundreds of millions in tax dollars. According to a recent survey from Data for Progress, 55% of voters think any increased funding for immigration enforcement agencies is a bad use of taxpayer money. New York Times polling released on Friday, meanwhile, found that 61% of people believe ICE’s tactics have “gone too far.”

Voters who watched yet another American protester shot down in the middle of a Minneapolis street are looking to Congress to rein in ICE. And senators currently hold the fate of ICE and Border Patrol funding in their hands.

This week, the Senate is meeting to vote on six government funding bills ahead of a Jan. 30 government shutdown deadline. If Congress now renews the ICE budget with no strings attached, it will become complicit in the violence, violations of rights, and chaos ICE is fomenting every day.

Thankfully, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seems to understand the urgency of this moment. The minority leader vowed on Saturday night to oppose any funding package that includes DHS funding. There can be no business as usual for DHS at a time when it is rampaging through communities, wreaking havoc and inflicting physical and constitutional violence.

Senators have worked hard to negotiate bipartisan compromise spending bills (no easy feat), and they should go ahead and pass the five bills funding other departments. But any bill that would fund ICE and Border Patrol without any meaningful limits is effectively endorsing the conduct of rogue agencies that are causing indelible harm to people across the country, including many U.S. citizens. No senator should want that on their record or their conscience.

ICE is randomly stopping people who appear Black or Brown, including off-duty cops – and demanding they show proof of citizenship. Small business owners who were able to survive the Covid-19 pandemic now worry about how they’ll survive ICE’s Operation Metro Surge, with customers too afraid to leave their homes.

Alex Pretti and Renee Good were shot by federal agents at point blank range. They should both be alive today.

But the shootings weren’t the beginning of ICE’s cruelty, nor the end.

Within 72 hours of Good’s death, over 1,000 protests sprung up across the country. That’s not an aberration. According to at least one survey, a majority of American voters watched the video of her killing. Many, it seems, were horrified. This weekend, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said some 15,000 people braved subzero temperatures to peacefully demand ICE get out of their city.

Last Tuesday, a medical examiner ruled that the death of a 55-year-old man detained at Fort Bliss, Texas – the former Japanese internment camp repurposed as part of ICE’s deportation machine – was a homicide, due to asphyxiation; ICE officials initially called it a suicide.

More from MS NOW Daily

Must reads from Today's list

Just a few days ago, federal agents detained Liam Conejo Ramos – a 5-year-old preschool student – in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. Local school officials claim ICE vehicles are tailing school buses and trying to enter school grounds.

On top of that, a leaked Department of Homeland Security memo showed that the department has been telling ICE agents it’s OK to break down doors and force their way into homes without a judicial warrant. The Fourth Amendment was written to protect us from exactly this: heavily armed government forces invading our property at gunpoint, and on their own say-so.

These agencies are also attacking our First Amendment right to speak out. People who simply videotape agents’ behavior, stand on sidewalks, pray in front of ICE facilities, or watch these masked and armed agents are facing gas and pepper balls, as well as seemingly indiscriminate arrests and physical assault.

Now the Senate has an opportunity to put its foot down. Some will fret about another funding fight after the bruising, record-breaking shutdown in the fall. But this situation is completely different. The question is not whether to use government funding as leverage to accomplish a policy aim. The question is whether the funding Congress is considering for DHS will be used to violate the law, and our rights.

There’s a long list of things Congress should insist on before ICE and Border Patrol get another dime. For example, ICE needs to end warrantless arrests and home invasions without judicial warrants. Border Patrol needs to stop policing our cities. And the administration must turn over all evidence and witnesses related to the killings of Good and Pretti to Minnesota investigators.

Last week, the ACLU’s polling showed that 54% of voters oppose any increased budget for ICE’s enforcement and detention budget. And 65% support Congress holding rogue agencies and officers accountable for constitutional violations, using something like the proposed Bivens Act to do so.

Everywhere ICE goes with its lawless dragnets and wanton violence, communities suffer. Kids stay home from school. Businesses lose employees and customers. Citizens and legal residents are harassed and asked to “show their papers,” arrested, and even locked up because of the color of their skin or their language or their accent. And of course, thousands of people have been terrorized, traumatized, ripped away from their families — and sometimes — tragically killed.

The American people don’t want to live in this kind of police state.

Senators should listen. And then do something about it.","https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/f_auto,q_auto/v1769313332/260124-federal-agents-mn-mbs_1159417b56e0_1159417cd550_1159417661d6/260124-federal-agents-mn-mbs_1159417b56e0_1159417cd550_1159417661d6.jpg?_i=AA&w=1200&h=630&crop=1",N,,2026-01-25 22:58:07.890306

On Saturday night, Minnesotans gathered in candlelight vigils on street corners in our neighborhoods to mourn and remember Pretti.","On Friday, hours before Shabbat began, I was arrested with 96 other multifaith clergy members and Faith in Minnesota leaders while protesting ICE in Minneapolis.

“Who could have imagined such times as these?” we sang, in the words of local songmaker Sarina Partridge. “We will grieve through these times, and soon enough we’ll be grieving on the other side.”

We cannot keep on with business as usual when our federal government is engaged in escalating state terror right here, right now. To grieve through these times is not enough; we must also act.

In the bitter cold, thousands of Minnesotans gathered at that airport. Tens of thousands more marched downtown, and others simply stayed home in the largest work stoppage in this country in many decades, the Day of Truth and Freedom. Nearly one thousand interfaith clergy answered the call to come to Minnesota — as they did for the Civil Rights Movement call to march in Selma in 1965 — to join us in the fight.

Standing there among them, on erev shabbes in the cold, I thought about the Torah portion we would read the next morning in shul: parashat Bo, from the Book of Exodus.

In it, the darkness of the ninth plague that befell the Egyptians is described as something that the oppressors — the mitzrim, which I’ll translate as “the ones of narrowed sight” — could actually touch. It was so thick that it kept them isolated from each other, unable to move.

In contrast, the dwellings of those seeking liberation were full of light.

I imagined that palpable darkness not as a punishment, but as a reflection of reality. The oppressors were unwilling to see the humanity of their neighbors. But if they had been, they too could have found themselves in dwellings full of light, able to clearly perceive the richness and possibility of living in a multiethnic community.

So too with the federal oppressors here in Minnesota, and those who collude with them. They are so welcome to join us in the light of that recognition. We were there at the airport to invite them in.

Instead, they arrested nearly 100 of us, while we sang and prayed for the protection of our people in the languages of our diverse traditions. Doing this work in coalition builds the power we need to break through the oppression: Our differences make us stronger.

As a minister next to me chanted the Lord’s Prayer, and a clergy member close by meditated with closed eyes, I chimed in with “Ana Bekoach,” a kabbalistic prayer that is part of Friday night services, envisioning divine protection holding close all the people of this place.

At our airport, Signature Aviation is facilitating the internment of our fellow Minnesotans every day, adults and children alike, flying them to detention centers where they suffer in conditions that deny their humanity. ICE is even disappearing workers at that airport from the jobs they work every day, keeping all of us safe and supported as we travel.

The airport is supposed to encourage connection. Come join us in our city, it is supposed to say; come see the beauty of our communities. Come, with your eyes open, to join a dwelling of light. Instead, it has turned into a hub of darkness, and separation.

As Jews, so many aspects of our history are particularly resonant in this moment.

As ICE has engaged in a campaign of terror in our city since the start of the year, I have heard Jews in my community reflecting on their families’ experiences with state terror in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, and under dictatorships in Latin America. We join neighbors, refugees and immigrants from around the world, who never thought those feelings of suffocating fear would again define their lives here in the United States.

Now that they are, our obligation is to resist.

I was moved to tears during a march last week, when I saw families in hiding peeking out from behind their attic blinds as we sang of our love for our immigrant neighbors. It reminded me of Jewish families reduced to hiding in Nazi Germany, and of those brave souls who tried to protect them.

When I was arrested, I felt my heart open to the clergy standing and kneeling together with me, and all those in our state who have stood up with courage and generosity throughout these weeks and months. I hoped that all those who would see or hear of our arrest would be motivated to join this work.

The safety of all marginalized communities in this country, our Jewish community included, depends on our efforts to protect our democratic practices, and one another. You can join us, in Minnesota, or wherever you are.

Call for ICE to get out of Minnesota. Their presence is endangering us all. Just yesterday, Alex Jeffrey Pretti — an ICU nurse, mountain bike enthusiast, dog lover and beloved community member — was shot and killed by federal agents while attempting to aid a fellow protester. Our government, rather than accept responsibility for the injustice of his death, and that of Renée Nicole Good, is already lying about who these upstanding Minnesotans were and what those agents did.

Learn from us and protect each other in your home communities. You can stand with Minnesota; we’ll stand with you too. Call your senators to demand that they deny ICE funding in an upcoming vote this week. Push for prosecution of ICE agents who kill our civilians. Together we will fight the plague of narrow sight, instead creating dwellings of warm light where we hold and honor the fullness of humanity of each and every one of us.

On Saturday night, Minnesotans gathered in candlelight vigils on street corners in our neighborhoods to mourn and remember Pretti. I was with hundreds of my students on campus. We imagined, together, all the vigil-goers, holding candles to decry Pretti’s death and honor his memory, as points of light, linked across Minnesota and the country, and around the world.",https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ice-minneapolis-clergy-protest-airport-rabbi-arrested-GettyImages-2257689256.jpg?_t=1769384216,N,,2026-01-25 19:57:30.967811

The impromptu march that the organization Hands Off and the New York Immigration Coalition called on Jan. 24 was sparked by several gruesome viral videos that showed multiple masked federal agents in Minneapolis shooting protester Alex Pretti multiple times. Pretti, an ICU nurse, had come to the aid of a woman whom agents knocked down before ICE members turned their attention to him — wrestling him to the ground and pummeling him with their fists.

One of the agents then grabbed what appeared to be a holster with a gun from Pretti’s waist; multiple reports indicated that he had a license to carry the weapon in Minnesota. After the gun was taken, multiple ICE agents fired shots at Pretti, killing him.

The videos contradicted multiple narratives from the Department of Homeland Security, its secretary, Kristi Noem, and others who claimed that Pretti had confronted them first with a gun and threatened the agents’ lives.

However, the released videos do not appear to show Pretti holding a firearm; instead, the weapon appears to be concealed in his waistband. Local police say Pretti has no criminal history aside from traffic violations and did have a permit for the weapon, as required by state law.

Meanwhile, in the Big Apple, elected officials denounced the slaying. Mayor Zohran Mamdani wasted little time in again calling for the dismantling of the immigration enforcement agency.

“As tens of thousands across America protest the violence that ICE sows with impunity, federal agents shot and killed another person in Minneapolis today. ICE terrorizes our cities. ICE puts us all in danger. Abolish ICE,” Mamdani wrote on X.

U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also took to social media to demand fellow elected officials vote to cut funding to ICE.

“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny.DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence. They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO,” Ocasio-Cortez said.

Immigration rights advocates, like the Immigration Coalition and Hands Off NYC, called an emergency protest in Union Square on Saturday to stand in solidarity with Minneapolis and to demand that ICE be withdrawn from the state and that operations in New York cease.

“This is not normal — no one should be killed for protecting their neighbors. No one should be killed for standing up to masked agents who are abducting people off the streets. ICE’s killing of another Minneapolis observer makes it clear: when masked, armed agents are unleashed on communities with no accountability, people die,” a statement released by Hands Off NYC read.

Minneapolis, MN — National Immigration Project Executive Director Sirine Shebaya issued the following statement on the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minnesota:

Over the weekend in Minneapolis, federal immigration enforcement officers publicly executed a peaceful observer. We mourn the senseless killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse who worked at a Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, gunned down by a U.S. Border Patrol agent. This marks the second fatal federal shooting in Minneapolis in less than three weeks.

When federal officers repeatedly kill people on our streets, it is not a failure of policy; it is the policy. This is a system that has abandoned human life, constitutional limits, and basic accountability. With a $170 billion military-style budget, Congress has enabled a massive federal enforcement operation that uses taxpayer dollars to inflict brutality on the American people and treats constitutional rights as a nuisance, not protections.

The National Immigration Project calls for:

ICE operations to end everywhere;

Full legal accountability for any use of force by federal immigration officers;

No funding for ICE or other Department of Homeland Security agencies;

An end to warrantless arrests and arrests based on racial profiling;

A transparent, independent investigation into ICE and Border Patrol for human rights and Constitutional violations.",https://nipnlg.org/themes/radicati_drupal/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-26 01:57:48.473088

In Saint Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win.
We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day.
Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors.","This is part of a series of on-the-ground reports from Minneapolis.

On Thursday, I ended my day on daycare patrol as the windchill crept close to 25 degrees below zero. The patrols began after ICE appeared at my son’s daycare two weeks ago; that same day, a daycare worker for the same provider was taken by agents at a nearby location while trying to get in to work. During my recent patrol, ICE agents were spotted in the neighborhood, as they nearly always are, but everybody made it out of the building safely.

As I write this, a helicopter is circling over my neighborhood, as happens most days now. My phone is pinging near constantly with alerts from Signal groups that exist to defend and support our community. A friend texted to ask how concerned we should be that the president will invoke the Insurrection Act and send the military into our city; my husband just learned that workers at a nearby small business were taken by the government; a friend’s school went on lockdown today because ICE was nearby.

Our neighborhood has never been more united, but you wouldn’t know it from how few people are out on the streets. Nobody opens their door anymore, knowing that the next knock might be a federal agent demanding to know where the Brown people live in your neighborhood. People are making a point to support immigrant-owned restaurants, but you have to check if they’re open before you go, because so many aren’t. Folks are out delivering food and essentials to neighbors who are unable to leave their homes for fear, but they have to be careful to use a different car than they drive when they’re observing ICE, because the government is tracking license plates.

Earlier this week, students in our city lost two days of learning because schools closed—the teachers needed time to shift to the virtual learning model which began on Thursday. This time, it’s not because of an unknown and deadly illness; it’s because the government is attacking our students. People are being shipped out of the state so fast that their families don’t have time to get to their holding cell with the paperwork proving they’re legally authorized to be here before they’re gone.

The horrors have not ceased since Renee Good’s death, instead they have increased. Protestors are being attacked and shot. On Tuesday, a five-year-old was detained by ICE and used to bait his family into leaving their home. The preschooler and his father have now been sent to Texas, and it is unclear if or when they’ll return. On Thursday, multiple civil rights leaders, including Saint Paul Public School board member Chauntyll Allen, were arrested for exercising their First Amendment right to protest, in a DOJ action that the NAACP has said was a likely violation of First Amendment rights. And on Saturday, Alex Pretti was killed by ICE agents, shot multiple times at close range. Every day, there is a new horror to process, a new way in which the federal government inflicts irreparable harm on our community.

I serve as a Saint Paul City Councilmember, and our community is under a violent attack at the hands of the federal government. And so we are fighting back in all the ways we know how.

On January 12th, Saint Paul announced a joint lawsuit with the city of Minneapolis and the state of Minnesota against the Department of Homeland Security, seeking to end this unconstitutional operation. Our City Council is working to strengthen our separation ordinance and develop other legal tools to make certain that our city resources—including our police department—cannot and will not support the work of immigration enforcement. We are calling on the governor to declare a state of emergency and enact a state-wide eviction moratorium to ensure that nobody loses their home because the federal government is making it impossible for them to earn a living. Every elected official in our city is working to connect our residents with whatever support they need right now. We are also demanding that Congress act—that our representatives and senators use every tool at their disposal to end this occupation—because neither cities nor states alone have enough tools to protect our people from the federal government.

None of this feels like enough. Individually, none of it is. But what we know from other countries that have successfully defeated authoritarianism is that democratic resurgence is possible. Over the last 30 years, 52 percent of “autocratization episodes” were followed by democratic resurgence. In 90 percent of those cases, countries were ultimately as or more democratic than they were previously.

In Saint Paul and across Minnesota, we’re showing that we have what it will take to win. We are cultivating solidarity and pushing back through every channel that we have—and building more capacity to fight for our community every day. We are demonstrating our commitment to nonviolence, even in the face of incredible levels of violence being used against us. We might get tired, but we are not succumbing to despair. Our civil resistance movement is strong, and it is growing.

Most importantly, we know what we’re fighting for, because we’ve already lived it. Saint Paul has always been at its strongest when we’ve embraced our immigrant neighbors. Minnesota has always been at its best when we’ve built structures that allow everybody in our state to flourish, whether they’ve been here for months or for generations. This is a place where we take seriously Paul Wellstone’s immortal words that “we all do better when we all do better.” The cruel, painful world that Donald Trump is trying to force on us is not one that we will ever, ever settle for. The path ahead is not clear, but we will continue to put one foot in front of the other until the day we win.",https://compote.slate.com/images/e0fbca6f-121d-4eeb-9e26-545a0e2c0315.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:49.120156

We are “deeply disturbed and saddened to learn of the death of Alex Pretti, a registered nurse, in Minneapolis earlier today.
We have lost a fellow registered nurse to an act of violence connected to immigration enforcement.","The largest organization of registered nurses in the United States, National Nurses United (NNU), has called for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital, was shot multiple times by ICE agents during an anti-immigration operation on Saturday.

NNU, representing over 225,000 members, expressed outrage, stating, “The nation’s nurses are horrified that immigration agents have committed cold-blooded murder against a public servant who posed no threat. We demand justice and accountability for his murder.”

The incident marks the third shooting involving federal agents in Minneapolis this month, following the deaths of Renee Good and another individual during arrests.

On January 7, 37-year-old US citizen Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent. Another ICE agent, on January 14, shot a Venezuelan national in the leg during arrest.

NNU criticized the Trump administration’s crackdown, declaring that ICE poses a serious public health threat. They emphasized that ICE agents have repeatedly shown violence, stating, “They have kidnapped hardworking people and now murdered a trusted nurse.”

The American Nurses Association (ANA) and the Minnesota Organization of Registered Nurses (MNORN) also issued statements expressing sorrow and demanding transparency in the investigation.

We are “deeply disturbed and saddened to learn of the death of Alex Pretti, a registered nurse, in Minneapolis earlier today. We extend our condolences to Alex’s loved ones, colleagues, and the community at large,"" ANA said in a statement.

ANA added that it condemned violence and demanded accountability and transparency in investigating and determining the cause of the incident.

""The seriousness of this incident and others demands transparency and accountability. ANA calls for a full, unencumbered investigation, and urges that findings be shared promptly and clearly so Alex’s loved ones and the public have answers,” it emphasized in its statement.

Meanwhile, MNORN expressed heartfelt grief over the loss.

""Today, our nursing community is grieving. We have lost a fellow registered nurse to an act of violence connected to immigration enforcement. Regardless of where each of us stands on the issues surrounding this moment, the loss of a nurse, a caregiver, a colleague, a human being cuts us deeply. This message is not about politics. It is about mourning a life taken too soon and honoring the calling we all share,"" MNORN stated,

""Please be gentle with yourselves and with one another in the days ahead. Check in on each other. Allow room for sorrow, confusion, and reflection. If you are struggling, please reach out, no one needs or should carry this alone…When one nurse is lost, all of us feel it,"" MNORN added.

Pretti’s family condemns accusations

Pretti’s family condemned accusations labeling him a ""domestic terrorist,"" asserting he was unarmed during the incident. They described him as a compassionate individual deeply concerned for others.

Pretti’s family said they are ""heartbroken but also very angry"" over the agent's killing of Alex, a Democratic voter who had taken part in woke protests.

Alex's father, Michael Pretti, told AP that Alex viewed participating in protests as a way to express his care for others. His parents described him as a compassionate person, “deeply concerned about people.”

His parents, who live in Wisconsin, said they had also recently told their son to be careful. ""We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,"" Alex told his father.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed the shooting occurred during a targeted operation against an armed individual, asserting that an agent fired in self-defense.

Protests erupted in Minneapolis on Saturday, calling for justice and opposing federal enforcement actions, prompting Governor Tim Walz to activate the Minnesota National Guard for local law enforcement support.

Protesters gathered near the location of the latest shooting, and tensions rose in parts of the city. Federal agents used crowd-control measures, including tear gas and flash bangs, after confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement personnel.

Governor Walz authorized the activation of the Minnesota National Guard to assist local law enforcement at the request of the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office.

Walz said he had communicated with the White House, stressing that the investigation should be led by the state.

""The state has the personnel to keep people safe -- federal agents must not obstruct our ability to do so,"" Walz said on X.",https://cdn.presstv.ir/Photo/2026/1/25/85d40adb-c874-4beb-961c-534d9ab9effb.JPG,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:45.214447

Local officials have disputed administration officials' claims that the shootings were acts of self-defense, citing bystander video that appears to contradict the government’s accounts.

The Reuters Inside Track newsletter is your essential guide to the biggest events in global sport. Sign up here.

Here is a look at the potential legal repercussions for the officers.

WHAT HAPPENED?

An ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good in her car on January 7. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer had fired ""defensive shots"" after Good attempted to run him over, though online videos of the shooting verified by Reuters cast doubt on the government's narrative.

ICE agents shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in a separate incident on January 24. DHS said Pretti approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, though bystander videos verified by Reuters show Pretti - whom Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said carried a handgun lawfully - holding a phone as he tries to help protesters whom agents pushed to the ground.

WHAT DOES THE LAW SAY?

Minnesota’s use-of-force law permits state police to use deadly force only if reasonable officers would believe doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, from death or serious harm.

Federal law has a similar standard, permitting use of deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury.

COULD THE OFFICERS BE PROSECUTED?

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties. Immunity only applies when an officer's actions were authorized under federal law and were necessary and proper.

If Minnesota charged the agents, they could seek to move the case to federal court and argue they are immune from prosecution. To prevail, the state would have to show their actions were outside of their official duties or were objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful. If a judge ruled an officer was immune, the case would be dismissed and the state would not be able to charge him again.

COULD FEDERAL PROSECUTORS CHARGE THE OFFICERS?

Federal prosecutors can charge law enforcement officers for fatal shootings, but the bar is very high and charges are rare. Prosecutors would need to show an officer knew his conduct was unlawful or acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional limits of his authority, which is difficult to prove in court. The Trump administration has so far defended the officers' actions.

WHAT DEFENSES WOULD THE ICE AGENTS HAVE?

In addition to federal immunity, the agents could argue that their actions were reasonable under the Constitution, that they acted in self-defense or that they did not act with intent to harm or kill the victims.

COULD THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES SUE FOR CIVIL DAMAGES?

Federal officers are immune from civil lawsuits unless their conduct clearly violated a clearly established constitutional right. This legal standard, known as qualified immunity, has become a highly effective tool for shielding police officers accused of using excessive force, a series of Reuters investigative stories found in 2020.

However, victims can also sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work. This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity that usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In an FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully. The statute would allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

But while the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.

The crisis response from President Trump’s top Homeland Security officials followed a familiar playbook from an administration eager to project grit and resolve, particularly on immigration, in the face of inconvenient facts. Despite their efforts, damage from the incident continued to reverberate Sunday, creating political jeopardy for the president.

Videos that emerged of Pretti’s killing enraged the public. Government lines justifying the use of lethal force prompted blowback among staunch Republican supporters and conservative groups. Negotiations in Congress to thwart another shutdown were upended over Immigration and Customs Enforcement funding. And a Trump-appointed judge blocked the administration from attempting to destroy evidence in the case, lending weight to fears of a cover-up.

It is new terrain for Trump, whose handling of immigration had been a rare bright spot in polling of his job performance throughout his first year back in office. Now, for the first time, surveys show a plurality of Americans disapprove of the administration’s enforcement tactics, with 1 in 3 Republicans expressing concern they have grown too harsh.

Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at a hospital for veterans in Minneapolis, was shot 10 times at close range by ICE agents. Multiple videos of the incident appear to show Pretti attempting to aid a fellow civilian who had been pushed by an ICE officer, before he himself was wrestled to the ground by agents.

He had been carrying a firearm that Minneapolis police said was lawfully purchased and registered. The videos that circulated on social media do not indicate that he had brandished, or was attempting to reach for, his weapon, despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accusing Pretti of attending the protest with the aim of committing violence.

Bill Essayli, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, warned that approaching law enforcement while armed created “a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.” But the administration’s decision to blame Pretti’s death on his decision to bear arms drew harsh rebuke from 2nd Amendment advocates across the Republican Party.

“Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens,” the National Rifle Assn. said in a statement.

Erick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, accused Noem and Greg Bovino, Trump’s head of the U.S. Border Patrol, of making matters “far worse by being unrestrained in how they proceed.”

“The President is a great marketer and PR guy,” Erickson wrote on X. “While those around him may not realize it, I’m pretty sure he understands another dead American with his team rushing to undermine second amendment arguments and define the dead guy with a lot of facts still unknown is a bad look.”

John Mitnick, the general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security during Trump’s first term, said he was “enraged and embarrassed” by the agency’s “lawlessness, fascism, and cruelty,” and called for the president’s impeachment and removal.

“People have had enough,” Brian O’Hara, Minneapolis’ police chief, told CBS News’ “Face the Nation.” “The Minneapolis Police Department went the entire year, last year, recovering about 900 guns from the street, arresting hundreds and hundreds of violent offenders, and we didn’t shoot anyone. And now this is the second American citizen that’s been killed, it’s the third shooting within three weeks.”

This month, Renee Nicole Good, also 37 and a mother of three, was fatally shot by an ICE agent while in her car, shortly after dropping her son off at school. As in Pretti’s case, Noem and other senior administration officials justified the incident within hours of her death by impugning the victim’s motives without producing substantive evidence.

The aggressive response comes as the administration has faced accusations of misrepresenting other facts to the public.

After the president confused Greenland with the separate island nation of Iceland four times in a speech last week in Switzerland, Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, flatly denied he had made the mix-up.

And on the same trip, Trump dismissed the role of North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies in the war in Afghanistan — where partner nations lost more than 1,000 soldiers over the course of the conflict — falsely claiming they “stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.” The remark has infuriated some of Washington’s closest allies.

Only when Noem was questioned by a conservative reporter on Fox News about the circumstances of Pretti’s death did she suggest error may have been at fault.

“This happened in seconds,” Noem said, asked whether Pretti had been shot and killed after being disarmed of a weapon he hadn’t brandished in the first place. “They clearly feared for their lives and took action to defend themselves.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e9c3a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3469x1821+0+246/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2Fca%2F032e55a947deb8c41b50956ac284%2Fap26025583749400.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 17:59:46.440833

The latest shooting has also sparked a legal fight over control of the investigation and renewed calls by state and city officials for an end to the immigration surge that has swept across Minneapolis and surrounding cities.

Federal officials said agents were acting in self-defence by opening fire on Saturday morning, local time, when Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse, stepped into a confrontation between an immigration officer and a woman on the street.

Officials said Mr Pretti was armed, but no bystander videos appear to show him holding a weapon. The Minneapolis police chief said Mr Pretti had a permit to carry a gun.

Mr Pretti's family said they were ""heartbroken but also very angry"" at authorities, saying in a statement that Mr Pretti was a kind-hearted person who wanted to make a difference in the world.

Former US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama put out a statement saying Mr Pretti's death was a ""heartbreaking tragedy"".

""It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,"" they said.

""For weeks now, people across the country have been rightly outraged by the spectacle of masked ICE recruits and other federal agents acting with impunity and engaging in tactics that seem designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city.

""These unprecedented tactics — which even the former top lawyer of the Department of Homeland Security in the first Trump administration has characterised as embarrassing, lawless and cruel — have now resulted in the fatal shootings of two US citizens.

A federal judge has already issued an order blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to the shooting, after state and county officials sued.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said the lawsuit filed on Saturday is meant to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect. A court hearing is scheduled for Monday in federal court in St Paul.

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which are named in the lawsuit, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment from the Associated Press.

Another federal judge previously ruled that officers participating in the federal immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, though an appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling days before Saturday's shooting.

The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Governor Tim Walz, officials said, with troops sent to both the shooting site and a federal building where officers have squared off daily with demonstrators.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Mr Pretti showed up to ""impede a law enforcement operation"".

She questioned why he was armed but did not offer details about whether Mr Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.

But gun rights groups have noted it is legal to carry firearms during protests.

""Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers or exercising their First Amendment rights,"" the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus said in a statement.

""These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed.""

Trump blames Democrats

The president weighed in on social media by lashing out at Mr Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.

He shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: ""What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?""

Mr Trump said the Democratic governor and mayor ""are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric"".

US House Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among several Democratic politicians demanding that federal immigration authorities leave Minnesota.

She also urged Democrats to refuse to vote to fund US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying via social media: ""We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer later said that Democrats would not vote for a spending package that included money for DHS, which oversees ICE.

Senator Schumer's statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down January 30 when funding runs out.

Mr Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an ICE officer killed 37-year-old Renee Good on January 7, sparking widespread protests.

Mr Pretti's family was furious at federal officials' description of the shooting.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,"" the family statement said.

""Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.

""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

Video shows officers, man who was shot

When the Saturday confrontation began, bystander video shows protesters blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on a commercial street in south Minneapolis.

The videos show Mr Pretti stepping in after an immigration officer shoves a woman.

Mr Pretti appears to be holding his phone toward the officer, but there's no sign he is holding a weapon.

The officer shoves Mr Pretti in his chest, and pepper sprays him and the woman.

Soon, at least seven officers are forcing Mr Pretti to the ground. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. An officer holding a canister strikes him near his head several times.

A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it is not clear where it came from. Multiple officers back off. More shots are heard. Officers back away, and the man lies motionless on the street.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander leading Mr Trump's crackdown, was repeatedly pressed on CNN's Sunday State of the Union for evidence that Mr Pretti did anything illegal or assaulted law enforcement, as officials have claimed.

Mr Bovino said it was ""very evident"" that Mr Pretti was not following the the officers' orders.

""It's too bad the consequences had to be paid because he injected himself into that crime scene,"" he said.

""He made the decision.""

Mr Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and the state would lead the investigation into the shooting.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

Protests continue

Demonstrations broke out in several cities across the country, including New York, Washington and Los Angeles.

In Minneapolis, protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather with temperatures around -21 degrees Celsius.

An angry crowd gathered after the shooting and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them ""cowards"" and telling them to go home.

Protesters dragged garbage bins from alleyways to block streets, and people chanted ""ICE out now"" and ""Observing ICE is not a crime"".

As darkness fell, hundreds of people mourned quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting.

A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.

Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration.

""It feels like every day something crazier happens,"" he said.

""What's happening in our community is wrong, it's sickening, it's disgusting.""",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4d3922968675aabc27111eefcb76d5db?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=1687&cropW=3000&xPos=0&yPos=157&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2026-01-25 18:57:57.523431

What makes the immigration agencies different? - USA Today,Christopher Cann,,,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2026/01/25/immigration-and-customs-enforcement-border-patrol/88347803007/,"The ongoing immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota involves mainly two branches of the Department of Homeland Security: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

ICE is tasked with enforcing the nation's immigration laws in the interior of the country, while Border Patrol officers do so near border crossings and ports of entry.

But under the second Trump administration, those distinctions have become murky as the two agencies have undergone sweeping changes – and increasingly work alongside one another – to boost President's Donald Trump's wide-reaching deportation campaign.

Border Patrol, which is typically constrained to a 100-mile zone near any U.S. border, began deploying into the interior of the country, leading some of the most intense and visible enforcement operations in Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina, for example. They've assisted helping ICE agents conducting immigration stops across the country, including in Minneapolis.

ICE, meanwhile, has seen a more than doubling of its workforce after receiving a historic funding boost through Trump's massive tax and spending legislation, which he dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill."" With $84 billion at its disposal, ICE has become the nation's most well-funded law enforcement agency, over the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The agency has become the face of the nation's immigration enforcement in many respects, with protesters organizing ""ICE Out"" demonstrations nationwide and polls showing Americans becoming less favorable of its tactics.

The ongoing federal immigration operation in Minneapolis, which has prompted intensifying protests after federal officers shot and killed two people in less than a month, involves 3,000 agents from Border Patrol and ICE. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both agencies, described it as the largest immigration operation ever.

Can Border Patrol and ICE conduct arrests and searches?

Border Patrol agents can make stops, arrests and search vehicles, particularly within 100 miles of border crossings and ports of entry, the agency says. In that 100-mile zone, Border Patrol agents have broad authority to interrogate people and conduct warrantless searches when there's ""reasonable suspicion"" of immigration violations.

ICE says its agents can ""briefly detain"" people who they have ""reasonable suspicion"" of being in the country illegally. The agency also says its agents can ""arrest people they believe are illegal aliens"" and ""initiate consensual encounters and speak with people"" on the street.

Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that cleared the way for ICE to use race, accents and places of work as factors in deciding who to stop and potentially detain. Since the ruling, state and local officials, protesters and even police chiefs have accused immigration enforcement agents of engaging in racial profiling.

ICE is also facing scrutiny over its assertion that federal officers can forcibly enter homes without a warrant signed by a judge – a move constitutional scholars, immigration experts and a federal judge say is a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment.

How to tell ICE and Border Patrol agents apart

Many federal immigration agents involved in the latest high-profile operations have worn masks, balaclavas, hats and sunglasses, with no personal identifiers, unlike local police who often have visible badge numbers.

Many have also refused to identify themselves or the particular agency they're with, which has fueled confusion among civilians and local law enforcement alike.

Border Patrol agents often dress in dark green colors or camouflage, and they often identify their agency with vests reading ""U.S. Border Patrol"" or with patches on their sleeves. Some agents in U.S. cities are a part of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, a team specialized in high-risk operations like counterterrorism and hostage rescue. These agents have been seen wearing vests that say ""BORTAC.""

ICE agents, meanwhile, have been known to wear vests reading ""Police ICE"" or ""HSI,"" which is a reference to Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of ICE that handles federal criminal probes. ICE agents have also been seen dressed in plainclothes, sometimes with a visible badge reading ""ICE."" Many of the street operations are conducted with unmarked cars.

David Harvey quit on Friday but Richie Taylor, Mayes’ spokesperson, has not confirmed whether Harvey’s resignation was directly due to the attorney general’s rhetoric on a 12News interview from Tuesday, according to azcentral.com’s Stacey Barchenger.

Taylor did say that Mayes “was articulating a very deep concern she has about the possibility for these situations to spin out of control and end in tragedy,” as Minneapolis has recently experienced a pair of deadly shootings involving federal agents.

Mayes has served as state attorney general since being elected in 2022.

What did Attorney General Kris Mayes say about ICE, Stand Your Ground law?

The controversy began when Mayes expressed concerns that confrontations between Arizona residents and ICE could turn deadly in an interview with 12News. She called the combination of armed residents who are empowered under the law to defend themselves and mask-wearing agents without uniforms “a recipe for disaster.”

Brahm Resnik, the journalist conducting the interview, asked her to clarify if she was “giving license to a person to shoot an officer.”

“Absolutely not. But how do you know they’re a peace officer? That’s the key,” Mayes said. “And so if there’s a situation where somebody pulls out their gun, because they know Arizona is a Stand Your Ground state, then it becomes, did they reasonably know that they were a peace officer? You know? I mean, this is a different set of circumstances in the state of Arizona.”

Mayes also vowed in the interview to prosecute any ICE agent who violates Arizona law, although federal immunity law makes that more complicated to bring to fruition.

Mayes talked further about the issue Thursday during an interview with KTAR News 92.3 FM’s Outspoken. She explained that under Arizona law, residents who reasonably believe their lives are in danger can use lethal force to protect themselves.

“If you are really sure that they are ICE and they present a badge or they present identification, then I would not recommend using lethal force against them. But one of the worries that I have is … that we have a Stand Your Ground law in Arizona,” she said.

Joe Clure, executive director of the Arizona Police Association, responded to the attorney general’s comments Friday on KTAR News, calling them “reckless” and “dangerous.”

“I was in complete shock when I heard the … highest law enforcement official in the state of Arizona essentially giving a tutorial on how to shoot a police officer, specifically ICE agents, and get away with it,” Clure said.

Clure also accused Mayes of misinterpreting Arizona’s Stand Your Ground law because it doesn’t allow for lethal force against law enforcement officers performing official duties.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of two Americans being killed at the hands of Trump’s lawless and out of control Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Congresswoman Haley Stevens (D-MI) announced she will cosponsor H.R. 7163(link is external), a proposal to divert ICE’s $75 billion slush fund to state and local law enforcement agencies.

“Donald Trump’s ICE is out of control—this situation requires real reform and real accountability. Trump’s ICE Agents have now killed two American citizens in broad daylight and they are putting more Americans in danger every single day,” said Michigan Congresswoman Haley Stevens. “Not one penny more should go to ICE.

We’ve heard today from law enforcement leaders in Minnesota who want to keep their communities safe, but are being blocked from accessing evidence and information about these crimes.”

H.R. 7163 would help hire and train 200,000 local police officers nationwide, investing in proven law enforcement personnel who have real ties to the communities they serve.

The bill would move the additional funding granted to ICE in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to local law enforcement agencies, leaving the agency with historically normal funding levels to conduct traditional immigration enforcement operations.

It would reallocate $29.85 billion in funds for ICE’s enforcement and operations to the COPS Hiring Program (and waive the program’s traditional matching contribution requirements for small jurisdictions).

It would reallocate $45 billion in funds designated for ICE’s detention capacity to the Byrne JAG program, which provides funding to support training, crime victim assistance, and crime prevention.

Stevens has been leading the fight to hold ICE accountable in Congress and to rein in Donald Trump’s repeated abuses of power during his Administration.

Last week, Stevens voted against(link is external) the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, refusing to fund ICE’s operations without major reforms or accountability measures.

Last year, Stevens cosponsored the VISIBLE Act(link is external) to prohibit ICE agents from wearing masks and concealing their identities.

Stevens joined over 150 of her colleagues in demanding(link is external) ICE end its surge of officers in Minnesota and conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Renee Nicole Good at the hands of an ICE agent.

Stevens and her Michigan colleague, Rep. Hillary Scholten, demanded an investigation(link is external) into the death of Nenko Gantchev, an individual who died in ICE custody in Baldwin, Michigan.

Following a lack of accountability or answers related to Gantchev’s death and the death of Renee Nicole Good, Stevens called for the immediate removal(link is external) of Secretary Kristi Noem and cosponsored an effort to impeach her in the House of Representatives.

Stevens voted against(link is external) the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gave ICE its nearly $75 billion windfall.

Stevens introduced the Stop Trump’s Abuse of Power Act(link is external), legislation to prevent the President from deploying the military against Americans without express consent from state officials, an authoritarian tactic this President has used repeatedly to fuel fear and intimidation during aggressive ICE crackdowns.

Stevens voted against(link is external) the Laken Riley Act, which would sweep thousands of people into jails and detention centers at enormous taxpayer expense while diverting key law enforcement resources and potentially violating civil liberties.

Stevens has repeatedly voted and spoken out against unconstitutional efforts to demonize immigrants and subject them to racial profiling and gross violations of their basic rights.

“There is no way Senate Democrats can approve funding for an agency that is killing innocent Americans in the streets.","A second high-profile killing by a federal agent in Minneapolis has jeopardized the chances of Congress averting a partial government shutdown as Democrats come out en masse against the funding measure for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Lawmakers had been on the verge of completing their funding work for fiscal 2026 this week after the House last week passed its final four appropriations bills. However, the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, 37, a nurse at the city’s Veterans Affairs hospital, by a Border Patrol agent has seemingly torpedoed the chances of those bills passing the Senate, with one key Democrat after another saying they will not vote to fund DHS.

The DHS bill is tied in with five others that fund the departments of Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education — all of which have broad support.

Democrats are now saying they will not support the so-called minibus as long as the DHS portion is included. Senate Democrats are expected to have an all-members call on Sunday evening to figure out the plan forward, one aide told The Hill.

“I hate shutdowns. … But I can’t vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told “Face The Nation” on Sunday. “Take up DHS by itself. Let’s have an honest negotiation. Put some guardrails on what’s going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don’t have to have a shutdown.”

The Maine independent’s comments came a day after multiple key Democrats indicated they will vote against any funding package that includes the DHS segment.

Among them were Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who said that he was against it Friday morning before the latest shooting. All four were among the eight Democrats who voted to end the 43-day government shutdown in November. King was also part of that group.

“The Trump Administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability. They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement,” Cortez Masto said in a statement, after previously pitching her colleagues on a fix that would not require a shutdown. “This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

“I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,” she said. “We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget. We’ve already passed six funding bills. Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe.”

Adding to the chorus was Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who announced on Saturday that Democrats “will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill” with the DHS bill included.

The latest calls from the minority party mark a moment of whiplash.

Democrats were furious in recent weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, amid the protests in the Twin Cities. Almost all House Democrats voted against a stand-alone DHS bill last week, but lawmakers and Capitol Hill sources were still hopeful as recently as Friday that the “minibus” would stay on track.

One former senior Senate Democratic aide had told The Hill on Friday that the chances of a shutdown were roughly 25 percent as Democrats had been hearing from constituents about ICE actions in their home states and were under pressure to act.

Now, it’s tough to see how the measure moves on.

“90 percent [chance of a] shutdown,” the former aide said Sunday morning. “There is no way Senate Democrats can approve funding for an agency that is killing innocent Americans in the streets. It’s the only lever of power they have left to show the American people they are standing up to Trump and ICE.”

The killing of Pretti has also spawned another clash between federal and state agencies. Gregory Bovino, the official in charge of President Trump’s Border Patrol operations, blamed Pretti for the incident — an account that has come under major skepticism from statewide officials.

Up until recently, Democrats had also been skittish about careening into another shutdown, having felt the aftershocks from the longest shutdown in history last fall, which came over their insistence on extending the enhanced ObamaCare subsidies.

Both sides had hailed the bipartisan work to clear the funding decks for 2026. Schumer earlier in the month had insisted that lawmakers were not heading toward a shutdown during a Sunday show appearance, with appropriators being pleased at the progress.

However, they all acknowledged the DHS measure was a particularly difficult one for them to get their arms around from the get-go.

We can trust the American people with the truth.” The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis.","The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.

Mere hours after Mr. Pretti died, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, declared without offering evidence that Mr. Pretti had “committed an act of domestic terrorism.” Gregory Bovino, a border patrol official, offered his own assessment: “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

These unfounded and inflammatory judgments pre-empt the outcome of an investigation, which the Department of Homeland Security has promised. They also appear wholly inconsistent with several videos recorded at the scene.

Those videos showed that Mr. Pretti had nothing but a phone in his hands when he was tackled by border patrol agents, and that he never drew the gun he was carrying (and reportedly had a license to carry). Indeed, the videos seem to show that one federal agent took the gun from Mr. Pretti moments before a different agent shot him from behind. Separate analyses by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, CBS News and other organizations all concluded that the videos contradict the Trump administration’s description of the killing.

The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears. Ms. Noem and Mr. Bovino are lying in defiance of obvious truths. They are lying in the manner of authoritarian regimes that require people to accept lies as a demonstration of power.

Even worse is that all of this feels so terribly familiar. Earlier this month, a federal agent shot and killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. In that case, too, the Trump administration has demonized the victim and has blocked a state investigation of the killing.

Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.

The temperature in Minneapolis is dangerously high. There is an urgent need for the federal agents deployed to the city to step back and take a breath before more Americans are hurt or killed. Those protesting the Trump administration have an equal obligation to avoid violence.

The American people also need answers about whether federal agents acted inappropriately, and the behavior of the Trump administration means that it will be impossible to trust any federal investigation that it conducts. President Trump and his appointees have demonstrated themselves to be unconcerned with truth and willing to lie to serve their own interests. Congress therefore must step in. The Constitution vests it with the power to hold hearings, issue subpoenas and demand answers.

Congress ought to investigate both the circumstances of the recent killings in Minneapolis and the broader conduct of the federal agencies engaged in Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown, including their treatment of peaceful protesters. The video evidence shows that the incident that ended in Mr. Pretti’s death began when a federal agent lunged at a protester and knocked her to the ground. There are many similar videos and documented instances of federal agents using unnecessary violence against people who are peacefully protesting or documenting events — both behaviors protected under the First Amendment.

Congress has the power to hold the administration accountable through its control of federal spending. A pending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security offers a crucial opportunity to perform scrutiny and impose necessary guardrails, such as funding for body cameras.

The federal government also has sought to prevent investigations by the state of Minnesota. This must end. A federal judge in Minnesota issued a temporary restraining order on Saturday evening, at the behest of the state, barring federal agencies from destroying evidence related to Mr. Pretti’s killing. The need for such an order is both evident and extraordinary.

“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican increasingly at odds with Mr. Trump, posted on social media on Saturday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”

The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis. It is a disgrace that the first public comment by Mr. Trump in the wake of Mr. Pretti’s death was to post a picture on social media of what he described as “the gunman’s gun.” Stephen Miller, arguably Mr. Trump’s most influential adviser, wrote on social media, without offering evidence, that Mr. Pretti was “an assassin.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/opinion/25ICE-editorial-image/25ICE-editorial-image-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:57:54.374412

While the weakening resolve was far from a full break with Trump, it signals growing unease with the administration’s aggressive actions as Democrats threaten another government shutdown and November’s midterm elections come into view. Until now, Republicans have backed Trump as he deploys federal agents and National Guard to US cities.

Hundreds of videos have shown the agents using pepper spray, shoving, punching and kicking protesters who have stayed largely peaceful and are recording the agents’ actions. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a nurse at a VA hospital, while he was subdued and on his knees after they discovered a gun he had a permit to carry.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, suggested on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures that Trump should consider going “to another city and then maybe let the people of Minneapolis decide” how to proceed on immigration. He also defended immigration agents.

New York Republican Andrew Garbarino, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, has requested public testimony from top immigration officials, telling them in a letter Saturday that Congress “has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Other Republicans who have previously broken with Trump on other matters — including retiring Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Thomas Massie — were more frank.

“There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on X.

Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, also called in post on X for an investigation “both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system.”

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said on CNN’s State of the Union that the agents involved in Pretti’s killing were “most likely” being placed on administrative leave and sent from Minneapolis.

Another Senate Republican, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also broke sharply from the White House’s messaging and demanded “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis “incredibly disturbing” and said the credibility of ICE and Homeland Security are at stake.

“We can trust the American people with the truth,” Cassidy said.

But silence from other leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, suggest that many in the party are still weighing how to respond to Pretti’s killing.

Shutdown Threat

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer vowed late Saturday to block a massive spending package next week unless Republicans strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security, dramatically increasing the risk for a partial US government shutdown.

Democratic opposition to the funding package potentially affects not just Homeland Security but also the departments of Defense, Labor, Education, State, Treasury and Health and Human Services.

None of the Republicans speaking on Sunday mentioned the looming shutdown fight.

The effects of another shutdown would be widespread, including possibly delaying the next Bureau of Labor Statistics report.

In the event of a shutdown, many essential workers — including the military and Transportation Security Administration agents — may have to work without pay. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol employees would likely be paid through additional funding in Trump’s tax bill signed last year.

The House passed the spending bill Thursday and left Washington until after the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.

With the White House calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and accusing him of impeding the work of Border Patrol, despite video evidence to the contrary, Senate Republican leaders will be under enormous pressure to protect DHS funding.

The spending legislation needs votes from at least seven Democrats to pass the Senate.

Several moderates in the party quickly announced Saturday they’d oppose the bill. .

At least one other American, Renee Good, was killed by an ICE agent when he stopped her for partly blocking a street with her car, claiming she tried to run him over.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE.”

Forcing a shutdown risks hard-fought Democratic victories in the spending deal, including reversing many Trump cuts to medical research, foreign aid, education grants and mass transit.

The situation in Minnesota, however, has alienated key Democratic senators.

Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, each of whom voted to end the last shutdown, said in statements Saturday they would oppose funding for Homeland Security without changes. Rosen insisted she will oppose funding “until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said the resistance isn’t about his party or politics.

“It’s about our country and our Congress, and what we need to do to impose some safeguards on an out-of-control agency which is imbued with a culture of lawlessness and seems to be committing murder in Minneapolis,” Blumenthal said.

Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, called Pretti’s killing a “heartbreaking tragedy.”

“It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,” they said in a statement.

Delays Ahead

The Senate, a slow-moving legislative body, already faces potential delays from an expected snowstorm. The House’s planned absence next week complicates matters further ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

All but seven House Democrats voted against the DHS bill in the House, with many in the party seeking body camera requirements and other restraints on raids by ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Top Senate Democrat spending panel member Patty Murray said she won’t support the DHS bill as it stands, and it “needs to be split off from the larger funding package.”

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray said in a post on X. “I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

One sign was held by Indigo Moore, 27, a school administrator who lives in Manhattan. She was horrified by online videos of Mr. Pretti’s shooting. Ms. Moore said she had been to Union Square on Friday for a similarly frigid protest against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“At this rate I’m getting pretty angry,” she said, “and that’s what’s keeping me warm.”

Attendees expressed a mix of anguished resignation and outraged optimism about what effect the demonstration might have.

For Ella Devi, 18, a Parsons University student who lives in Manhattan and who had campaigned for Mayor Zohran Mamdani in Union Square last year, the turnout was a sign that a political movement for change was gaining force.

“I hope it puts pressure on electeds to abolish ICE,” she said.

Angela Fowler, a psychiatric nurse practitioner who lives in Manhattan, said the protest served less as a portent of a good future than as a place to mourn.

“I’m not angry, I’m hurt,” Ms. Fowler said, adding that Mr. Pretti reminded her of her seven kids, four of whom are veterans. “This is America and I love America,” she said, referring to the scene around her.

Ms. Fowler’s sign read “Protesting ICE Is Not a Crime!” Other signs read, “Stop ICE Terror,” “ICE Is Trump’s Gestapo” and “No Kings.”

Manny Vasquez, 21, a service industry worker from Queens, held a giant sign featuring the face of Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House leader, and the words: “Abolish ICE Jeffries.”

Murphy’s remarks come less than 24 hours after a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agent fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an American citizen, in Minneapolis.

BOSTON — A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction just before midnight last night to stop the Trump administration from revoking people’s legal status under the Family Reunification Parole (FRP) program while litigation in Svitlana Doe v. Noem proceeds. This comes after the judge issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) on January 10 that temporarily blocked the administration from separating those families for 14 days.

More than 8,400 future green card holders faced losing lawful status and work authorization after the Trump administration announced in mid-December 2025 that it would prematurely revoke their parole. Green card holders and U.S. citizen sponsors were left scrambling to gain clarity for their immigrant family members who had already shown eligibility for future green cards. The court heard arguments from the government and from attorneys for plaintiffs earlier this month.

“Today’s ruling reaffirms that the Trump administration cannot ignore our nation’s laws in order to rip immigrant families apart,” said Esther Sung, legal director of Justice Action Center. “We are talking about people who have done everything the U.S. government has asked of them and who, in many cases, are mere weeks or months from finally receiving their green cards. These families should be able to live their lives and pursue their immigration cases peacefully and without fear that they will be ripped away from their loved ones.”

Among other findings, the court’s opinion noted that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the administration’s manner of terminating FRP parole was arbitrary and capricious and that the government had failed to provide FRP beneficiaries with sufficient notice that their grants of parole would be prematurely terminated. In describing the plight facing this particular group of people, the opinion noted, “FRP Parolees have arrived in the United States after a long process, following all directives from USCIS, to obtain lawful permanent residence in this country…many parolees, upon receiving approval to travel to the United States and seek parole, prepare for a permanent move.”

“The Trump administration cannot be allowed to strip people of their legal rights arbitrarily, and we are relieved that the judge recognized this in her ruling,” said Anwen Hughes, senior director of legal strategy and legal initiatives at Human Rights First. “Today’s preliminary injunction means that the Trump administration cannot de-legalize thousands of immigrants throughout the country who have done everything the U.S. government asked of them in order to be here. Most importantly, it means that families will get to remain together and build their futures without being unjustly ripped apart.”

On December 29, 2025, Justice Action Center and Human Rights First rushed into court on behalf of family members of U.S. citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents waiting to become eligible to apply for green cards whose parole status would have been revoked on January 14, 2026. These people, who entered the United States under FRP, are represented by five new plaintiffs added to Svitlana Doe v. Noem, the class action lawsuit filed on behalf of humanitarian parole beneficiaries, sponsors, and Haitian Bridge Alliance. The plaintiffs had asked the court to block the Trump administration’s Federal Register Notice revoking FRP beneficiaries’ lawful status and to allow the plaintiffs to incorporate this effort into their existing lawsuit to protect parole.

I asked the man how he knew the drivers at the intersection were ICE agents.
Were they ICE agents?
Were they people watching for ICE agents?
As tensions in Minneapolis escalated, Lang announced he would be coming to town to lead a “CRUSADER MARCH on ‘Little Somalia,’” with the aim of burning a Quran outside Minneapolis City Hall on Jan. 17.","Donald Trump’s most profound break with American democracy, evident in his words and actions alike, is his view that the state’s relationship with its citizens is defined not by ideals or rules but rather by expressions of power, at the personal direction of the president. That has been clear enough for years, but I had not truly seen what it looked like in person until I arrived in Minneapolis, my hometown, to witness what Trump’s Department of Homeland Security called Operation Metro Surge.

On Jan. 14, at 7:44 p.m., eight hours after I got to town, the City of Minneapolis’s official X account announced that there were “reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in North Minneapolis.” “Federal law enforcement,” as everyone by then knew, meant one of the 3,000 immigration agents fanned out across the metropolitan area, which Minneapolitans invariably called “ICE”: Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency at the vanguard of the surge.

They had been there since December, ostensibly in relation to a fraud investigation that fell well out of their departmental purview and settled instead for what appeared outwardly as a more indiscriminate pursuit of potential immigration violations. The Minneapolis metro area is not big: Hennepin and Ramsey Counties — home to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, respectively, and many of their suburbs — are together less than one-fifth the size of Los Angeles County, the target of the administration’s first such immigration crackdown last year.

In the heightened atmosphere of the moment, the lines between documentation and confrontation had grown blurry. ICE officers, when they stuck around anywhere for more than a few minutes, were likely to be met by not just one or two camera-wielding observers but many, and observation inevitably turned into protest. The latent combustibility of these encounters was visible in the footage that bystanders had captured of an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, fatally shooting a resident, Renee Good, in her car on a snowy street in South Minneapolis on Jan. 7. That combustibility would be visible again in the fatal shooting on Jan. 24 of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old V.A. hospital registered nurse, by Border Patrol agents.

Shock over the violence of the deployment quickly gave way to redoubled anger. Within minutes of the city’s X post on Jan. 14, a crowd of perhaps a hundred people from all over the metro area had assembled at the location, in the Hawthorne neighborhood on Minneapolis’s north side, where, according to an F.B.I. agent’s affidavit, an ICE agent had shot an undocumented immigrant in the leg after being attacked with a broom during an arrest. When I arrived, several blocks were cordoned off with crime-scene tape, and milling around in the darkness beyond it were federal agents in balaclavas and tactical gear, most of them identified by their patches as members of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations unit.

A woman in a fur-ruffed parka swung a plastic post at the rear windshield of the vehicle, which shattered with a dull crunch. It was not long before the air was alive with smoke grenades and sting balls and thick with tear gas. Faces peered out of second-floor windows along what had been, less than an hour earlier, a quiet residential street. “You killed Renee Good!” a man bellowed.

The atmosphere was strange and unstable for a street protest, missing some important steps of the usual choreography, and it took me a moment to realize why: I saw no police officers. I had passed a Minneapolis Police Department cruiser parked some distance down the street, but here, where the agents were clashing with the crowd, they were nowhere to be seen. The federal agents themselves looked more like a platoon of soldiers navigating a hostile foreign capital than conventional law enforcement in an American city.

For weeks, these agents had been actors in a kind of theater of power, meting out various forms of state force and violence, framed by the smartphone cameras they carried, providing a steady stream of content for the Trump administration’s various social media platforms. What was clear in person, seeing the scene outside of the frame, were the limits of this performance of power. The agents had no capacity to maintain order or much apparent interest in doing so. Their presence was a vector of chaos, and controlling it was not in their job description. All that was holding the crowd back, as far as I could tell, was the knowledge that an officer like these shot a woman a week earlier and that another shot a man up the street an hour ago. I left the scene that night certain it would happen again.

‘Take Out That Phone and Hit Record’

Tim Walz, Minnesota’s embattled governor, appeared live on camera from his official residence on the night of the second shooting and clash. He described the federal deployment to his state as an “occupation” and “a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government.”

This sort of citizen surveillance of federal agents is a tactic that had spread widely — often with the support of Democratic officials like Walz — along with the immigration raids themselves, refined over the course of previous operations in Los Angeles and especially Chicago. As Walz suggested, it served a kind of double purpose: capturing evidence and also capturing the narrative, showing the world what Trump’s immigration crackdown looked like in practice.

Because of Minneapolis’s small size, the sledgehammer scale of the deployment and the extreme contempt that Minneapolitans had for it, ICE-watching had attained a manic intensity in some neighborhoods of the city, which became an exacerbating factor in the fog-of-war confusion and paranoia the raids brought to town.

One afternoon, I was idling in my rental car in the parking lot of a gas station where my friends used to buy cigarettes in high school when I heard a shrill chorus of whistles behind me — Minneapolitans, like Chicagoans last year, had distributed them widely and blew them en masse to alert people to ICE’s whereabouts. I got out to look around, only to see that the whistlers were pointing at me. It was the third time I had been mistaken for an ICE agent in the space of a week.

On the ICE-watchers’ heels was a pack of journalists, many of whom I knew from the expanding media circuit of the great American unraveling: militia rallies, Trump court appearances, protests against immigration raids in other cities. I reached out to shake the hand of a celebrated war photographer, but he retracted it, holding up his palms apologetically: “Mace,” he said.

They had just come from a clash in a nearby park between locals and Gregory Bovino, the camera-mugging senior Border Patrol official, who had been on the scene in Minneapolis personally for weeks, ducking in and out of the action, often dressed in a military-style greatcoat that invited, and received, Gestapo comparisons. Someone pulled out a phone to show me a video of Bovino minutes earlier, personally lobbing a green-smoke grenade at some protesters, with the jocular informality of a backyard barbecue host tossing a tallboy to a newly arrived neighbor. As they left, once again a federal agent dropped a magazine of live ammunition in the street. Officers from Bovino’s agency would shoot and kill Pretti less than a mile away three days later.

What was striking, and not a little chilling, when you watched videos like this as well as their public digestion on various social media platforms, was that they did not differ dramatically from the videos that the Trump administration disseminated itself. Nor did people on either side of the country’s chasmic ideological divide seem to disagree all that much about what they were seeing in the images of immigrants being marched away from their cars in subzero temperatures and demonstrators pepper-sprayed at point-blank range. These were pictures of the state deploying violence confidently and with open disinterest for the niceties of process or protocol — the expression of power as an end to itself. To some, it was horrifying; to others, it was exhilarating. To many city residents I talked to, the message of it all was clear enough: Nobody could help them. They were on their own.

“I’ve been telling people, if you want to really be prepared for stuff like this that’s going on in Minneapolis right now, you need to know your neighbors,” Steve Gagner, a resident, told me the day after Walz’s address. We were sitting at a coffee shop not far from Gagner’s house in South Minneapolis, an area that had become the heart of the local resistance to the federal deployment. The shop’s owner was running around directing pickups and drop-offs of boxed groceries and household necessities stacked by the door: donations for the thousands of immigrant families, undocumented and otherwise, that were known to be hiding out in their homes across the metro area for fear of arrest.

South Minneapolis might be thought of, in coastal terms, as roughly comparable to Brooklyn’s Prospect Heights or Los Angeles’s Echo Park: a historically diverse (by Minneapolis standards) and working-class area that was now the gravitational center of the city’s college-educated, progressive professional cohort, a neighborhood of social workers and graphic designers. Gagner, a longhaired 41-year-old who grew up in the suburbs, now lives in the city with two children and twice as many jobs: carpentry and handyman work, animation and jewelry design. He had made the earrings he was wearing, in the image of the Minnesota state flag, which had taken on an unexpected valence in recent weeks as a banner of defiance.

South Minneapolis was also where George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in 2020. At the time, Gagner lived five blocks from the Third Precinct police station, where the officer, Derek Chauvin, was assigned; the first group of demonstrators had marched past Gagner’s house on the way to the station. “We were actually out there, clapping,” he said. Half an hour later, tear gas began wafting into the open windows. “And then,” he said, “everything erupted.”

The protests and rioting that followed Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, in which the Third Precinct building and a number of local businesses were burned down, were often depicted in the national media as occurring along racial lines, which was not quite right. They raged most furiously in largely white South Minneapolis, not the historically Black north-side neighborhoods like Hawthorne. Gagner had supported the protests and was highly critical of the Police Department, but he also did not particularly want his house to burn down.

He and others in nearby neighborhoods had formed ad hoc community-watch groups during the first days of the upheaval, and much of this informal infrastructure had been revived amid the current crisis. “I’ve seen a lot of the same people that stepped up before stepping right back into those roles,” Gagner said, though now people were using encrypted communications or staying offline entirely. “It’s also very different because this is” — his voice dropped to an incredulous whisper — “this is the government.”

Although the work they were doing was, in the current climate, clearly political, it felt strange to describe Gagner or anyone else I met who was involved in the rudimentary activities of the resistance as activists; most of their activities would, in any other circumstances, have seemed like the most uncontroversial kind of civic participation. Since the early days of the standoff, many people across the Twin Cities and their suburbs had joined neighborhood-level efforts, organized through Signal chats, to track the federal agents and had stood watch around locations — schools, apartment buildings, local businesses — they believed were particularly vulnerable.

But by mid-January, many of the people I talked to in South Minneapolis had decided it was more useful to focus on the targets of the raids, giving immigrant families’ children rides to school — federal agents in Minnesota and other states had been arresting parents during drop-offs and pickups — and delivering supplies to those who were afraid to leave their homes.

Other response efforts were coordinated through parent-teacher organizations, particularly those of schools with large populations of Latino students. The school-based organizing, like the ICE-watching tactics, was a strategy imported from community networks in Chicago, where parents last year mobilized around so-called sanctuary schools. Particularly for parents of elementary-school-age children, who found themselves suddenly having to explain why parents were standing guard against federal agents around the school property and why their Latino classmates were staying home, their latent politics had been supercharged by a very parental mix of fear and fury.

A mother at another school in South Minneapolis, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid drawing further attention to the school, described coming upon ICE agents detaining the driver of a car, then taking him away along with the keys. Looking in the abandoned vehicle, she saw a woman in the front seat and a small child huddled in the back seat. “They just — take off,” she said, and she started sobbing. “They just walk away. They don’t care. It’s like — we’re all people.”

I asked her how she discussed what was happening with her own children. “We’re lying to them all the time,” she said. “‘You are not in danger.’ I don’t think they are, but we can’t guarantee that. Because they” — ICE — “are not following the rules. We’re white, but who knows? You look at them wrong, and they’re going to smash your window.”

‘Don’t Turn On the Lights’

One afternoon later that week, I drove out to a nondescript lower-income apartment complex in a Minneapolis suburb. A man in his 30s let me into the building and led the way up to an apartment on the third floor, then closed the door behind us.

The apartment was small, and it felt smaller with the windows covered. The man and his wife, both of whom asked not to be identified out of fear of arrest, had tacked up a blanket over one window and a floral-print sheet over the other, illuminated by the wan winter light outside. Their young daughters would try to peek out, but the parents would shoo them away from the windows. If anyone pulled back the sheet, they warned the girls, drones could see inside.

The man left the apartment only for the most furtive missions: to take out the trash, to move the car when snowplows came to clear the parking lot. It took him a moment to recall when he had last ventured farther than that. It was November, he thought. That was around the time that “the school,” he said, “let us know that the raids were happening.”

The building was home to a number of immigrants like the man, who said he came with his wife and their daughters several years ago from Ecuador. He said they had petitioned for asylum at the border. This was a legal process under which an increasing number of people had been admitted during the Biden administration. Some asylum applicants cited highly specific threats to their lives. Others made much broader claims, like this man, who said he and his family had come to the United States because of prejudice against the country’s Indigenous people and the escalating violence in the capital, Quito, where they lived. Peaceful as recently as six years ago, it had since become a battleground in a proxy war between Mexican drug cartels vying for control of Pacific-coast smuggling routes.

The family’s claim was still in process, the man said. In the meantime, he said he had been given a work permit and a Social Security number. In the summer, he cut lawns; in the winter, he cleared snow. But an administrator at his daughters’ school had warned him that he should be careful about working outside. He began watching the street from inside the apartment.

He noticed large S.U.V.s, Chevy Suburbans with tinted windows, idling outside the apartment complex for a few hours at a stretch. He took a picture of one of them and sent it to someone at the school. “They told us: ‘They’re ICE. Be careful,’” he said. “‘Cover the windows. Don’t turn on the lights. Don’t go out shopping. If you need anything, ask.’” That was nearly two months ago.

It had taken a week or two, after the man stopped going to work and everyone stopped leaving the apartment, for the food to run out. After days of eating only potatoes, the family appealed for help to their church. Soon volunteers began dropping off essentials in cardboard boxes.

At first the family kept the girls home from school. But after the school warned that such absences could result in legal action, the girls resumed going every other day, escorted by a teacher or an administrator.

The girls asked why they couldn’t otherwise leave the apartment, why they couldn’t buy food themselves, why they couldn’t look out the windows, and the man tried to figure out what to tell them. “I have told them that there are people out there looking for criminals,” he said. Like most of the immigrants I met in Minnesota and elsewhere who had been affected by the immigration raids or were living in fear of them, he had supported the idea of rounding up violent criminals in the United States illegally when Trump first spoke of it. And he assured his daughters that he was not a criminal himself. “But we’re not from this country,” he would tell them, he said, “and we have to be careful. Because they’re taking everybody.”

Although his wife couldn’t bring herself to mention it to the girls, lately the man had started trying to talk to them about what would happen if their parents were arrested. This was difficult in part because he himself did not know what would happen. When it became clear that the federal agents sweeping the city had no plan for the children the raids left behind, school staff members started quietly urging immigrant parents to sign a delegation of parental authority form, which would give someone else the power to make decisions over their children — a limited form of custody. But who could the man even ask to take on such a responsibility? His family’s relatives in Minnesota were all in the same position as he was.

I asked the man how he knew the drivers at the intersection were ICE agents. “They were in two of those big trucks — the really big new ones that are driving around,” he said. Were they wearing masks? He didn’t know.

At some point, the paranoia in Minneapolis had created its own reality. The furtiveness and randomness of the documented raids was very real, but now half of Minneapolis and an ever-expanding press corps were driving around looking for federal agents, too, prowling streets and parking lots in ways that resembled the agents themselves, creating their own layers of rumor and confusion.

When I had first pulled into the apartment building’s parking lot, I saw an S.U.V. idling by the entrance, an iPhone visible against the windshield, filming me. When I got out and held up my press credential, the window rolled down to reveal two smiling white women who were out delivering food to people like the family in the apartment. “Sorry!” one of them said brightly.

Leaving the building an hour later, I saw two more large S.U.V.s slowly circling the lot. Were they ICE agents? Were they people watching for ICE agents? Who knew? Earlier that day, outside a church that was distributing aid, I overheard a young man on his phone reporting a “confirmed ICE” vehicle. I looked around for it, until I realized he was reading off the license plate from my rental car.

‘The Somalis Have Taken Over Your Neighborhoods!’

When Trump, hours after returning to the presidency last year, pardoned the participants in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, one beneficiary was Edward Jacob Lang, a 30-year-old from upstate New York who had spent several years in jail awaiting trial on 11 charges for, among other things, attacking a Capitol Police officer with a metal baseball bat. Lang, who goes by Jake, had parlayed his incarceration into a brand as a sort of political prisoner-influencer, though he did not seem to actually have much of a profile on the right; two years ago, I stopped by a protest on his behalf outside the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was being held, and found it attended by fewer than 10 supporters. The people who most fervently followed him and his stunts — claiming to form a militia from inside jail, throwing Nazi salutes outside the AIPAC headquarters — seemed to be gullible and easily outraged liberals, along with the more shamelessly click-baiting reporters whose content they consumed.

As tensions in Minneapolis escalated, Lang announced he would be coming to town to lead a “CRUSADER MARCH on ‘Little Somalia,’” with the aim of burning a Quran outside Minneapolis City Hall on Jan. 17. The main, if unintended, effect of Lang’s announcement, besides stirring up the people who could be counted on to react to it, was to call attention to just how far Trump’s crackdown had drifted from its stated intentions. Trump initially said federal agents were coming to town in relation to the federal investigation of a several-billion-dollar fraud scandal involving the state’s social services, which had produced indictments of nearly 80 people, most of them members of the state’s Somali community — the largest Somali diaspora population in the country, much of it refugees who settled in Minnesota in the 1990s.

Trump, who had vowed to stop refugee flows to Minnesota during his 2016 campaign, had ranted against Somalis in December, calling them “garbage” in a cabinet meeting. But a majority of Minnesotan Somalis have U.S. citizenship, and by the time Lang came to town, the agents’ attention seemed to have largely shifted; the few arrests that D.H.S. publicly announced appeared to be mostly Latinos and Hmong immigrants.

“The Somalis have taken over your neighborhoods!” Lang shouted into a microphone as he marched through downtown. He was clad in a tactical vest that made him resemble the city’s new diaspora population of ICE agents; as right-wing influencers and law enforcement have embraced similar paramilitary gear and content-creation strategies, the lines that might have once distinguished them visually have grown sketchier. “These people are animals. Look at them! Look at them! Immigrant scum!”

When he got to City Hall, a crowd of perhaps several hundred counterprotesters was waiting for him. They leaned toward the most reliably bait-taking segments of the left-liberal spectrum, from the itinerant leftists leading chants for unrelated causes — “Free Palestine!” — with their own megaphones to older suburbanites holding up signs that read “LOVE ALWAYS WINS.” The South Minneapolis types I had been talking to throughout the week had been urging nonattendance.

I had wondered what a clash between whichever constituency Lang managed to mobilize — it was about 10 people — and an increasingly infuriated population would look like in a city where local law enforcement had been barely visible for days. Making my way through the crowd, I found Lang holed up in the well of a ground-floor window of City Hall along with a few others, gamely enduring the attacks of the crowd: an endless barrage of insults, a squirt gun that lashed him with gouts of freezing cold water and water balloons.

This was a move pioneered during Trump’s first term by more-enterprising right-wing influencers who, with video rolling, would place themselves in the path of particularly knuckle-headed anarchists in cities like Portland, Ore., and lean into their beatings with the verve of Italian soccer players. But there was, once again, something off about the way it was playing out in Minneapolis. I climbed onto a bench to get a better look, just in time to see Lang, who had jumped down from the window well, disappear into a sea of windmilling fists for several minutes, then emerge out the other side.

As the scrum surged in my direction, I joined the crush of people running after Lang, turning the corner past City Hall and bounding over a light-rail track. A man to my left turned and decked another man in the face. Both were wearing balaclavas and heavy coats; everyone was bundled up in so many layers of outerwear — the temperature was in the single digits — that the usual signifiers of political identities were impossible to make out. All anyone seemed to really know was that everyone was either chasing Lang or chasing the people chasing him, and that nobody seemed to be stopping anything; we had passed a single police cruiser idling alongside City Hall.

Lang made it several blocks, as far as the doorstep of the Hotel Indigo, before his pursuers caught up with him, knocked him down and began vigorously kicking him in the head. He managed to get to his feet and sprinted through the hotel bar with a few photographers in tow, crashing out a side entrance and into the back seat of a passing car, which a mob briefly waylaid in traffic before the vehicle managed to get free. (One of his rescuers, a transgender woman named Daye Gottsche, later told a local reporter that she had made it clear to Lang, as they drove him to safety, that she did “not support the type of man he is.”)

From the back of the crowd, it had been hard to follow exactly what was happening, and a number of demonstrators, believing Lang to be inside the hotel, lingered outside. Jody Carr, a retiree from the exurb Chaska, looked on from across the street with her daughter, a nurse. “I am disappointed in the people who’ve gotten violent, because that is not what this is about,” Carr told me. She had attended recent No Kings protests in Chaska; this was her first demonstration related to the ICE deployment. “I’m proud to be an American, but I’m not proud of what our administration is doing,” she said. One of her daughter’s co-workers, an American-born woman of Kenyan descent, had been stopped a few weeks before by ICE and thrown out of her car, she said — “in her scrubs on the way to work!”

Chaska sits on the far periphery of the Minneapolis metropolitan area, a politically mixed territory between the solidly Democratic metro area and Republican rural areas beyond. I asked Carr if there was disagreement about the deployment among the people she knew there, and she nodded.

“My niece told me I was a threat to humanity,” she said.

Just then, a van pulled up carrying a dozen Minneapolis Police Department officers in riot gear, arriving belatedly to disperse the crowd. Following a couple of bullhorn announcements about the impending use of chemical agents — after ICE, which fired them off with no warning, this seemed quaint — the demonstrators took an impromptu victory lap through the streets of downtown. A man with a drum led a call and response:

“Who protects us?”

“We protect us!""

I left the protest feeling numb: It seemed as if we had all come fairly close to seeing a man beaten to death in the street. I called Lang the next night to ask how he was doing.

Lang was back on the East Coast already. He told me he was up for an interview, but only if we did it in the form of a video clip that I would guarantee The Times would publish, and that he would as well. “That’s usually the way that I’m leaning toward things now, because the video content is so important for dissemination on both our social media platforms,” he said. We would not copublish a video. I went to sleep feeling a little sheepish. Lang was going to be fine.

The content, as he surely knew, was exceptional.

‘Get Out of the City’

I went to meet Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis at Karmel Mall, a large and labyrinthine complex of Somali businesses on Lake Street in South Minneapolis, on the afternoon of Jan. 22. The location was his staff’s choice, and a pointed one. As we walked through the mall, it was largely empty, with most of the market stalls closed and locked down behind metal shutters, another picture of a city battened down in a storm. The Islamic afternoon call to prayer drifted from a speaker over a deserted hallway. In one of the few open stalls, he spotted a merchant he knew. “Osman!” he called out. The man greeted him with a hug. “You are winning,” he said.

Although Walz’s career had run aground amid the fraud scandal — he announced, amid Operation Metro Surge, that he would not be running for governor again — Frey, like Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, had arguably benefited from the enemy-of-my-enemy politics the federal invasion foisted upon Minneapolis. Although he easily won re-election in November, many south-side progressives still grumbled about his support for the city’s Police Department during the George Floyd crisis, which had led to his heckling out of George Floyd Square during a visit to the memorial that June.

“I got spat on and shamed and booed,” he told me, tucking into a plate of goat and rice in the otherwise deserted food court. “But it was the right decision” not to defund the Police Department, he said. “And it’s the right decision now to tell ICE to get out of the city.”

Like other mayors and governors who had found themselves on the receiving end of Trump’s immigration raids, Frey — who, like Walz, is currently under investigation by Trump’s Justice Department for impeding the federal action — had responded with lawsuits and media appearances, projecting unequivocal defiance while carefully keeping city law-enforcement agencies out of the fray. When I brought up the Lang episode, he told me that the police, uniformed and not, were nearby, ready to intervene if necessary. “It had the potential to be a complete disaster, and it wasn’t,” he said.

This was true, but in the moment, that outcome had seemed to be luck as much as anything else; I hadn’t seen any officers around until well after the beating, I said. “They were there,” Frey insisted, “and they did run to help” Lang before he got away in the car. Lang, he pointed out, had not actually filed a police report about the assault.

Trump’s federal deployment in Minneapolis, like the others before it, was not only about immigration; it was also a kind of ritual disciplining of unruly liberals, a ripping away of the protections they had so long enjoyed and a demonstration of how little the politicians they elected could really do to stop it. This would be underscored two days later, hours after I left Minneapolis, when Border Patrol agents confronting neighborhood observers several blocks from Karmel Mall shot Pretti, repeatedly and apparently after first disarming him of a gun he was licensed to carry and was not holding, based on video footage.

Only a couple of food vendors adjoining the food court were open, and when we arrived, Frey had stopped to commiserate with one of them, a young Somali man. “It’ll be like a light switch when ICE leaves,” he said. “It’ll be a celebration.”

“We’re going to have a big party,” the man said, hopefully.

Frey nodded. “People will be dancing in the hallways here.”

His promise echoed down the empty hall.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin shared a photo on social media Saturday of a federal law enforcement officer's severed finger after an anti-ICE agitator in Minneapolis allegedly bit it off.

""In Minneapolis, these rioters attacked our law enforcement officer and one of them bit off our HSI officer’s finger,"" McLaughlin wrote in the post. ""He will lose his finger.""

She shared photos of two people seemingly in custody, though it is unclear which person is the alleged biter.

Additional details about the assault have not yet been released, though ongoing protests have escalated after the deaths of two U.S. citizens during immigration enforcement operations in the blue city.

ICE SAYS 2 DEMONSTRATORS WERE ARRESTED IN MINNESOTA FOR ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING OFFICERS

Hours before McLaughlin's post, a Border Patrol agent was captured on video fatally shooting an armed man in Minneapolis amid a crowd of agitators.

The 37-year-old man, a U.S. citizen from Minneapolis, allegedly approached agents and then ""violently resisted,"" while armed with a 9 mm pistol and two magazines, according to Homeland Security officials.

Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said during a news conference Saturday it ""look[ed] like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.""

He reiterated that those who obstruct law enforcement are in violation of the law and will be arrested.

The Minnesota National Guard confirmed Saturday that, in addition to troops previously being mobilized at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office requested additional support, and more soldiers will be brought in.

“Our kuleana (responsibility) really is to be there as a calm, informed presence so that folks are aware that they have rights,” Goodman said.
Last week, El Pueblo en Acción Maui announced on social media that ICE agents had showed up to a Kīhei church during sacrament hour on Jan. 11.
On Maui, Mendoza-Jachowski said people have been taken more “quietly” than in other places.
“The Episcopal Church remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the dignity and safety of all people, particularly those most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions,” Spence said.","It was the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah when Zoe Goodman got the heads up that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were searching for someone in a temporary housing complex for Lahaina fire survivors.

Goodman, the lead volunteer trainer for El Pueblo en Acción Maui (The People in Action Maui), hustled over to the neighborhood. As the agents roamed the complex in a rented pickup, Goodman and other volunteers helped the person run through preparations, making sure they had an emergency contact and had signed a document that would allow a lawyer to contact them if they were taken into custody by ICE.

“Our kuleana (responsibility) really is to be there as a calm, informed presence so that folks are aware that they have rights,” Goodman said.

The agents eventually left the area without making an arrest, but the September episode was one of multiple confirmed and suspected sightings of ICE that have put the Maui community on edge, especially as arrests in Hawai‘i have climbed over the past year and an ICE agent’s fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Good sparked protests across the islands. On Saturday, a Minneapolis man was shot and killed by ICE, setting off a fresh wave of outrage.

On Maui, community groups and concerned citizens focused on immigrant rights and legal services created a coalition known as El Pueblo en Acción Maui to run an ICE tipline and watch group around late 2023 and early 2024, according to Veronica Mendoza-Jachowski, executive director of the nonprofit Roots Reborn that was formed after the fires and is part of the coalition. For awhile, it was the only group of its kind in the state, she said.

The network that Goodman estimated at 50 volunteers can be called at a moment’s notice to verify ICE sightings, help people review their rights and serve as legal observers when someone is being detained in hopes that they won’t get lost in “a black hole of the immigration and detention system.”

They’ve been extra busy over the past year. When Trump took office in January 2025, the tipline was flooded with dozens of text messages, emails and calls from people thinking they’d seen ICE.

“That fear was just heightened and they were on alert,” Mendoza-Jachowski said.

Last week, El Pueblo en Acción Maui announced on social media that ICE agents had showed up to a Kīhei church during sacrament hour on Jan. 11. While no arrests were made, it was another sobering reminder for the community that places once considered off-limits are now fair game to the federal agency.

“The worry here is as we continue to see ICE enforcement presence at these previously protected locations, that there will be a chilling effect,” said Tina Sablan, community and policy advocate with O‘ahu-based nonprofit The Legal Clinic. “Not only that people will stop going to church … but also kids will be afraid to go to school. Families will be afraid to access health care that they need. And there are ramifications for the entire community that will affect a wider sense of public safety when these places are no longer considered protected.”

In the first six months of 2025, ICE arrested 149 people in Hawai‘i, more than triple the amount of people arrested during the same period in 2024, the University of Hawai‘i’s Refugee and Immigration Law Clinic told a Senate Judiciary Committee in December, citing the Deportation Data Project.

ICE claims it’s detaining the “worst of the worst,” highlighting a handful of arrests tied to serious crimes like drugs, assault and firearms possessions. But Sablan pointed out that according to detentionreports.com, which keeps data on ICE detention facilities nationwide, out of a total average daily population of 74 at the Honolulu facility, 57 individuals (77%) were non-criminals.

On Maui, Mendoza-Jachowski said people have been taken more “quietly” than in other places. Aside from the high-profile case of several Maui County teachers who were wrongfully detained in Kahului as immigration officers were searching for someone else, arrests have included individual encounters like a Lahaina fire survivor who lost his home and business, and an undocumented Maui man who showed up at the Wailuku courthouse for a hearing on driving under the influence and without a license.

By contrast, ICE has made mass arrests during raids of Hawai‘i island coffee farms and Kaua‘i homes and businesses.

Sablan said she’s not sure why other islands have seen more mass enforcement, but noted that Maui has “a really strong network of folks” who have been working to educate people on their rights and keep tabs on ICE.

“I think that’s been really effective and had a very protective effect, particularly on communities in Maui,” Sablan said.

Mendoza-Jachowski said the experience of working in disaster response has helped the Maui organizations become more nimble in the face of growing enforcement and constant uncertainty.

El Pueblo en Acción Maui has been holding “Know Your Rights” training for restaurant workers, health care providers, faith leaders, educators and others, reminding them of such constitutional rights as being able to remain silent and refuse a search of themselves or their belongings without a judicial warrant.

Mendoza-Jachowski said “we don’t want anyone breaking the law,” so the goal is to inform people on their rights and equip them to make their own decisions in the moment.

Keeping the community informed and curbing false information is also the focus of the tipline, which takes calls and texts at (808) 500-5533. Volunteers work to confirm or debunk sightings by going to the location themselves or examining photos submitted to the tipline.

Mendoza-Jachowski remembers one report that turned out to be a DUI checkpoint near Mā‘alaea, and another that was a traffic control measure for a construction site. Once they used reverse image search to determine a photo sent to the tipline of law enforcement at a grocery store had actually been circulating on social media over a year ago and showed officers with the Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources, whose green uniforms and holstered guns were reminiscent of ICE agents.

When it comes to deciding what to report, “we take that very seriously,” Mendoza-Jachowski said.

“We don’t want to start a frenzy,” she said. “So I think keeping our community calm means keeping our community safe, and so there is no very clear recipe for how we respond because every single one is so different.”

She said the groups decided to share information about the reports of ICE agents in a Kīhei church earlier this month because it came directly from a “trusted source” who witnessed firsthand the agents showing up and identifying themselves as immigration enforcement. They told church leaders that they were looking for three people and waited out the full service until they determined the people in question weren’t there.

For safety reasons, Mendoza-Jachowski did not share the name of the church.

Members of other churches in Kīhei said they’d also heard about the incident. Shannon Kama, church administrator at Kīhei Lutheran, said she’d gotten word about it from social media and the community service organizations that work with the church.

Kama said her church hasn’t discussed what they would do if ICE showed up, but she said if she saw them coming, “I would lock my office down and I would notify our Montessori preschool on property, just to try to keep everybody safe.”

“It’s just awful,” Kama said of the thought that ICE might come to a church. “Nobody wants to be fearful. We just need to all be mindful, and I think that’s our mindset of our congregation. … Personally, I just pray that nothing like that would happen and be protective of everybody else.”

Chuck Spence, treasurer of Trinity Episcopal-by-the-Sea in Kīhei, said he found out through text messages sharing the post from El Pueblo en Acción Maui. He said Trinity hasn’t had any encounters with ICE as far as he knows, and that the church holds prayers every week for people impacted by what is happening across the country.

“It’s too aggressive and too dangerous when people are starting to get killed,” Spence said.

He noted that Trinity “is an inclusive and all welcoming mission church” and pointed out that Episcopal Church leaders have condemned ICE-related violence, called for prayer and supported peaceful resistance.

“The Episcopal Church remains steadfast in its commitment to protect the dignity and safety of all people, particularly those most vulnerable to immigration enforcement actions,” Spence said.

Churches have long been seen as safe havens off-limits to immigration enforcement, but in January 2025, after taking office, the Trump administration rolled back those protections for churches and other “sensitive” places like schools.

Hawai‘i state lawmakers, who kicked off the 2026 session on Wednesday, are considering a bill that would restore protections for sensitive locations, Sablan said.

It’s one of several bills The Legal Clinic and other immigration-focused organizations will be tracking, including measures that would require clear identification and bar masks for public-facing law enforcement, create a statewide framework for “U” and “T” visa certification for noncitizens who are victims of crime and human trafficking, and prevent “287g agreements” that would deputize local officers to carry out civil immigration enforcement.

In her line of work, Sablan often hears comments that if people were here legally, they wouldn’t have anything to worry about. However, she thinks “there’s a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of how much has changed” to make legal immigration pathways more difficult to obtain, and in some cases, revoking legal status of people already here.

Regardless of their status, Sablan pointed out, everybody “has basic due process rights and a right to a fair hearing, and they should have a right to legal representation.” Federal immigration court is the only court people don’t have the right to a public defender, she pointed out.

The argument that only “the worst” criminals are being taken off the streets doesn’t align with the data, and she said she has to “fundamentally disagree with the argument that it’s worth it to violate the rights of all.”

“If one person’s due process rights are violated, nobody really can feel safe believing that the same couldn’t happen to them,” Sablan said.

On Maui, if someone is detained, groups like Maui Rapid Response, another member of El Pueblo en Acción Maui, step in to help connect their families to services, especially if the person taken was the “sole breadwinner.”

“We’re looking at things like rent, we’re looking at child care, we’re looking at just housing in general, transportation,” said Nicole Huguenin, executive director of Maui Rapid Response.

The organization leads several community initiatives that range from helping unhoused people to assisting with fire recovery. Huguenin noted that people’s needs are often intersectional, such as being both undocumented and unhoused, and she said the fear of being arrested and deported has put additional stress on people already struggling to recover from the wildfires. Nearly one-third of Lahaina’s population before the fire had been born in another country.

“What we’re really seeing across the board in all vulnerable populations of people right now is compounding traumas,” Huguenin said.

In Lahaina, an arrest in September 2024 frightened parts of the community, and the incident in September of last year reignited those fears. Since then, Goodman said all of the four other potential sightings that she’s responded to have been in Lahaina.

She said “it is especially painful” to see people experiencing a moment when they know ICE is coming for them after being a contributing member of the community they’ve lived in for years.

Goodman spent 15 years working with a program that escorted women safely to abortion clinics in Queens, New York, so she’s “no stranger” to encounters with police or protesters shouting in her face. If ICE agents are “yanking people out of cars,” her sentiment is “put me in, coach.” But when she responds on Maui, her main focus is making sure her presence doesn’t make things worse for the people she’s trying to help.

Goodman said if the crackdown was about doing things the right way, ICE wouldn’t be showing up to detain people at their immigration hearings or sweeping kids out of school.

“The right way does not involve terrorizing people who are doing all of the right things,” Goodman said. “…There is no right way in this moment in time, because we’ve designed a system that is terrorizing everybody.”",https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2026/01/50044713306_cff977c927_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 15:57:15.712535

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.
The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""
It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown.
It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown.","The U.S. government is nearing the brink of a partial shutdown by the end of the week after federal immigration agents shot and killed a U.S. citizen in Minnesota on Saturday, the second such incident this month.

The Senate is set to vote this week on a massive House-passed $1.2 trillion package to fund the Department of Homeland Security, along with a wide swath of government, before the Jan. 30 deadline. But the shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is now threatening to derail the funding package as a growing chorus of Democrats warns they will oppose it unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is stripped out.

""I can't vote for a bill that includes ICE funding under these circumstances,"" said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats and helped end last year's 43-day shutdown, on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""Take up DHS by itself, let's have an honest negotiation, put some guardrails on what's going on, some accountability, and that would solve this problem. We don't have to have a shutdown,"" he said.

King's comments significantly raise the likelihood of a shutdown over DHS funding by the end of the week. He voted repeatedly to open the government during the last shutdown as his Democratic colleagues pushed for an extension of Obamacare subsidies.

The House of Representatives, which left Washington last week for a pre-scheduled recess after passing the bill, would need to return to approve any changes the Senate makes before the shutdown deadline. It's unclear whether Republicans who control the House can or will do so.

Meanwhile, Senate Democrats have broadly threatened to tank the funding measure if it includes DHS funding.

""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday night.

The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure. Of the 47, two are independents who caucus with Democrats.

Some Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Education, State, and Treasury.

But Pretti's death is rapidly galvanizing Democratic opposition to the measure.

""No, I am not voting for this funding,"" said Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""Our Republican colleagues have to stand up and stop this.""

The top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, has also said she will oppose the package if it includes DHS funding. Murray warned earlier in the week that the ""suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray said on X Saturday. ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.""

It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up.

It's still possible that enough Democrats join with Republicans to pass the funding bill and avoid a shutdown. Many of the other agencies in the package are important to Democrats.

DHS may also be less hindered during a shutdown if it taps the hundreds of billions of dollars that congressional Republicans injected into the agency as part of their ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" law passed last summer.

But that's far from a guaranteed outcome. Several Democrats who joined with Republicans last year to end a record 43-day government shutdown have warned they will oppose the bill if it includes funding for DHS.

""I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill,"" said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who is one of the Democrats who joined Republicans to end the last shutdown. ""Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown.

“Yes, it’s a problem that Iran is the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism.
Machado said Iran and Venezuela were bound by deep cooperation between their rulers, even as people in both countries rise up against repression.
“Finally in Venezuela we’re seeing President Trump making a tremendous important decision,” she said.
“If the people of Iran were free, the contributions they could make to science, culture, and technology would be extraordinary,” he said.","The non-profit Jewish Institute for National Security of America, founded in 1976, advocates for a strong US military relationship with Israel and researches conflict in the Middle East.

JINSA president and CEO Michael Makovsky and the group’s vice president for policy Blaise Misztal told Iran International’s English-language podcast Eye for Iran that decades of containment, deterrence and nuclear diplomacy have failed because the Islamic Republic itself should be destroyed.

“It should be US policy to seek the collapse of this regime,” Makovsky said.

They said hesitation now — after mass killings of protesters across Iran — risks emboldening Tehran at the theocracy's weakest moment.

“We don’t say regime change,” Makovsky said. “The regime will fall … only when the Iranian people bring it down. But it should be US policy … to seek the collapse of this regime.”

The last months, Misztal said, have created a rare strategic opening: Iran’s nuclear clock has been set back, its regional proxies weakened and Iranians themselves have returned to the streets demanding freedom.

“This is a moment like no other,” he said. “I don’t know when the stars will align like this again… why not make it now? When is a better time than now?”

The duo urged the Trump administration to abandon negotiations, intensify pressure on the Revolutionary Guards and build the infrastructure needed to help Iranians defeat the Islamic Republic.

Misztal said previous administrations focused on Iran’s nuclear program, terrorism sponsorship and ballistic missile development as separate threats without tying them back to what he called the ideological nature of the theocracy.

“Yes, it’s a problem that Iran is the world’s greatest state sponsor of terrorism. Yes, it is a problem that it’s pursuing nuclear weapons,” he said. “But all of that stems from it being the Islamic Republic of Iran.”

Trump’s Promises and a Moment of Decision

Their warnings come as President Donald Trump faces rising scrutiny over his own rhetoric. Earlier this month, Trump vowed support for protesters and issued a direct warning to Tehran.

“I tell the Iranian leaders: You better not start shooting, because we’ll start shooting, too,” he said.

But Makovsky warned that after mass killings and widespread arrests, the absence of immediate consequences risks damaging US credibility.

“The Iranians have called his bluff for now,” he said. “If he doesn’t do it, it will go down as a tragic mistake.”

In recent days, Trump has said a US ""armada"" is heading toward the Middle East, with the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers expected to arrive in the region soon as Washington signals it is positioning military assets amid escalating uncertainty.

The growing tensions are now rippling far beyond Iran itself.

Major European airlines have begun suspending flights across parts of the Middle East, citing security concerns. Air France has canceled flights to Tel Aviv and Dubai, British Airways has halted evening service to Dubai and KLM has suspended routes to Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Industry officials say cancellations are expected to increase gradually as carriers reassess airspace restrictions and passenger safety in a rapidly deteriorating regional environment.

A Cold War–Style Pressure Campaign

Misztal framed the strategy as a modern version of what the United States pursued against Soviet communism: strengthening civil resistance while weakening the ruling system from within.

“The strategy of regime collapse has been precisely what the United States pursued throughout the Cold War,” he said.

He argued that Washington should encourage defections, isolate elites in authority, cut off funding streams and expand opposition communications.

“One of the things we recommended is a quarantine of Iran’s oil exports,” Misztal said, “so that it doesn’t keep getting the money to rebuild its forces to pay the Basij or the IRGC.”

Both analysts warned that Iran’s leadership is entering what they described as its most dangerous phase, amid mass violence at home and the potential for war abraod.

“A showdown of some kind” is coming, Misztal said, and “the next showdown will be the last one.""

The warnings would mark a sharp uptick in rhetoric on Iraq by the administration of US President Donald Trump as it pursues its maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against its Mideast arch-nemesis Iran.

Citing three Iraqi officials and a source familiar with the matter, the news agency reported that US Charge d'Affaires in Baghdad Joshua Harris conveyed the warnings in conversations over the past two months with Iraqi officials from across its fractured political spectrum.

Iran relies closely on the banking sector its Western neighbor, where recent parliamentary polls kept Shi'ite Muslim parties in the ascendant and delivered gains for politicians from the kaleidoscope of militias and parties backed by Tehran.

The Islamic Republic's own economic lifeline of oil exports is under heavy pressure from US sanctions, even if export levels remain buoyant one year into Trump's second term, and Iraqi financial instruments help it skirt US curbs.

Following a 2003 US invasion, the United States has maintained de facto control over Iraqi oil revenues and its preponderant banking and financial puts the funds within its reach.

""The United States supports Iraqi sovereignty, and the sovereignty of every country in the region,"" Reuters quoted a US State Department spokesperson as saying in response to a request for comment. ""That leaves absolutely no role for Iran-backed militias that pursue malign interests, cause sectarian division, and spread terrorism across the region.""

US warnings also broached cutting off engagement with Baghdad if 58 members of parliament Washington views as linked to Iran are elevated by Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani to cabinet positions.

""The American line was basically that they would suspend engagement with the new government should any of those 58 MPs be represented in cabinet,"" Reuters quoted an Iraqi officials as saying.

""They said it meant they wouldn't deal with that government and would suspend dollar transfers,"" the source added.

Forming the new cabinet is due to take months and the US moves did not appear to be linked to a recent deadly crackdown on protestors in Iran, which resulted in new US sanctions on Iranian officials and oil shipping networks.

Machado said Iran and Venezuela were bound by deep cooperation between their rulers, even as people in both countries rise up against repression.

“The Iranian people, the Venezuelan people, we are fighting the same struggle,” she said. “These regimes have been cooperating for many years, exchanging resources, information, technology, agents and weapons.”

She said authoritarian governments help each other bypass pressure and maintain control, while democracies often stop at statements.

“Dictators help each other, they exchange technology, resources, they help each other bypass sanctions and they support each other in international forums,” Machado said. “Democratic governments stay at statements and declarations that at the end do not serve the people.”

Machado said people in Iran had reached a breaking point and were calling on the world to respond.

“We reach a point where the people start asking the world to react and to support,” she said. “What we are asking for is to stop the killings and to save lives.”

She criticized what she described as double standards among democratic governments that condemn repression while maintaining economic ties.

“You sign declarations talking about freedom and equality and respect for human rights, then you do business with these regimes,” Machado said. “You buy oil from these regimes and you keep their assets and resources in your own financial systems.”

Praise for Trump action

Machado praised Donald Trump for taking decisive action against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and said it showed what firm leadership could achieve.

“Finally in Venezuela we’re seeing President Trump making a tremendous important decision,” she said. “Bringing a criminal to justice is precisely what the world needs.”

She said the move sent a signal beyond Venezuela.

“It has brought a lot of hope,” Machado said. “This is a milestone.”

Machado said repression continues when dictators see little cost in using force.

“When you’re dealing with criminals, the only way they will leave is when the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving,” she said.

She said opposition movements cannot succeed alone without coordinated international pressure.

“We have done everything that any civic movement can do and they are killing us,” Machado said. “What we are asking for is applying law enforcement and cutting the resources they use to fund repression.”

Machado said the fall of Iran’s ruling system would have consequences far beyond the country.

“Imagine how the world will look once the Iranian criminal regime falls,” she said. “This is a unique moment in history.”

She said cooperation among opposition groups and diasporas was essential.

“These regimes help each other, and we the people need to connect and coordinate,” Machado said. “Regardless of how far away we are, we are united in this aspiration.”

“I can only speak for myself. I don’t need any more reminding about how bad this regime is and that somebody better do something about it, because if it’s not us, nobody’s going to do anything about it,” Levin said.

Levin said recent reports of increased US military deployments to the region suggested Washington was keeping its options open, although he said he had no insight into whether military action was being considered.

“Most revolutions, including America’s own, needed outside help,” he said. “What is happening in Iran is a counter-revolution against a regime that rules by force and fear.”

Levin also criticized decades of US engagement with Tehran, arguing that successive administrations believed the Islamic Republic could be managed through negotiations.

“This is an ideological regime,” he said. “They talk, they negotiate, but they have no intention of abandoning their mission, and that is why they so brutally suppress their own people.”

Iran has faced widespread internet disruptions during renewed unrest, with only limited information reaching the outside world through satellite connections and virtual private networks.

“I can tell you that tens of millions of Americans stand with the people of Persia. There’s no question about it,” Levin said. “We know the regime there is Hitleresque, Nazi-like. The regime is slaughtering innocent people, especially young people, raping them, and pillaging towns. We know that regime is the enemy of the American people. They’ve made that abundantly clear.”

Iran International has reported that at least 12,000 people have been killed since the protests began, while CBS News has cited estimates placing the death toll as high as 20,000.

Sources told Iran International on Wednesday that hospitals and morgues are facing shortages of body bags, forcing authorities to store bodies in corridors and other areas.

“We know they still want to build nuclear weapons. They back terrorism in our country, throughout Europe, and across the Middle East, but the people they terrorize the most are the Persian people,” Levin said. “I feel horrible about what’s taking place, and all I can do is use my platforms to draw as much attention to this as I can.”

Levin said Iranians possess a long civilizational history distinct from other countries in the region and said those who emigrate to the United States often integrate successfully and contribute to American society.

“If the people of Iran were free, the contributions they could make to science, culture, and technology would be extraordinary,” he said. “Instead, they are focused on survival under repression.”","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/7eea978ab07f845b332619a09d88a117c583a2f9-1920x1005.jpg?rect=3,0,1914,1005&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2026-01-25 11:58:11.735759

The US president’s sabre-rattling may also have shaken the faith of his own Republican party.

Trump’s fleeting threat to conquer the Danish territory prompted the most strident Republican opposition to anything he has done since taking office a year ago. It came on the heels of challenges to his authority over military powers, healthcare legislation and the Jeffrey Epstein files.

The mini-rebellion suggests that a small but vocal minority of Republicans feel increasingly emboldened to speak out against a 79-year-old leader who, for all his dominance of the party, is polling dismally and could drag them down in November’s midterm elections.

“You’ve never had a president with this much influence and this much political and legislative success so in that sense he’s winning but his own party is starting to question and wonder out loud at what cost?” said Frank Luntz, a political consultant and pollster. “He has been the most influential president since Franklin Roosevelt but the public and even people in his own party are starting to wonder whether it’s too much.”

Speculating over Trump’s grip on the Republican party, and whether it shows any sign of slipping, has been a political sport for a decade, producing many false dawns along the way. Dissenting senators and representatives such as Liz Cheney have been ruthlessly purged or made to feel they have no alternative but retirement.

Trump’s biggest crisis came with his crushing defeat in the 2020 presidential election and a subsequent insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the US Capitol, prompting even loyalists such as Lindsey Graham and Kevin McCarthy to condemn him. But not even an attempted coup was enough to break the party’s cult-like fever.

Much-hyped pretenders to the crown such as the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, could not compete and, when Trump roared back from four criminal cases to win the 2024 presidential election, Republicans reclaimed the House of Representatives and Senate and felt vindicated in sticking with their idol.

For much of Trump’s first year in office they gave the president such free rein on government downsizing, immigration enforcement and trade tariffs that critics said Congress had abdicated its responsibility, in effect setting up Trump as a monarch.

But there have been blips. In November four House Republicans – Marjorie Taylor Greene, Thomas Massie, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace – took a rare stand against Trump by signing a discharge petition to force a vote to release federal files related to sex offender Epstein.

Despite months of lobbying against the release, Trump abruptly changed course and announced his support for the bill after it became clear the vote would succeed with potentially dozens of Republicans joining Democrats in support.

Greene, once among Trump’s staunchest allies, resigned from Congress and accused the president of betraying his “America First” base and prioritising elites over his supporters’ concerns. In a New York Times Magazine profile, she described herself as “naive” for initially believing Trump was a true “man of the people”.

Earlier this month more than a dozen House Republicans defied leadership by voting for a Democratic bill to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years without any restrictions. The party has also been scrambling in both chambers to narrowly fend off war powers resolutions intended to force the president to get congressional approval before engaging in military action overseas.

Meanwhile Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year’s Republican incumbents, has criticised “excessive” tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem.

Tara Setmayer, co-founder and chief executive of the Seneca Project, a women-led super political action committee, perceived fractures. “I don’t think it’s as ironclad as it once was, evidenced by the Massies and the Marjorie Taylor Greenes and a few others who have begun to question the America First commitment of Donald Trump. Before, you wouldn’t have seen any of that; now you’re starting to see pockets of it.”

She added: “Whether that’s culminates into a larger rebellion remains to be seen because it is a midterm election year and these politicians want to stay in office so they’re going to continue to watch how the public reacts to Donald Trump’s decision-making and behaviour, which has been rather alarming and erratic. He’s showing signs of wear, his age – all of those things combined are becoming more difficult for rank-and-file Republicans to defend and the polling shows that.”

Few Republicans publicly dissented from the successful operation to capture Nicolás Maduro, the leader of Venezuela and many actively cheered it. But Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about seizing Greenland – threatening tariffs on European allies and refusing to rule out taking it by force – was seen by some as a bridge too far.

The Republican senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Democrats on a bipartisan trip to Denmark. Other Republicans took part in meetings in Washington with the Danish foreign minister and his Greenlandic counterpart where they discussed security agreements.

Murkowski and others pushed legislation that would prohibit Pentagon funds from being used to attack or occupy territory that belongs to other Nato members without their consent. On the Senate floor, the former Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned that any attempt to seize Greenland would “shatter the trust of allies” and tarnish Trump’s legacy with a disastrous foreign policy decision.

Tillis directed his criticism at Trump advisers such as the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, rather than the president himself. “The fact that a small handful of ‘advisers’ are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid,” he said.

The most outspoken was Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska, who told the Omaha World Herald that an invasion of Greenland would lead to Trump’s impeachment – something he would “lean” towards supporting.

It was notable, however, that McConnell, Tillis and Bacon have all announced that they will retire at the end of their current terms and therefore had little to lose by alienating Trump. Indeed the number of Republicans who broke ranks was perhaps less striking than the number who remained silent.

Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Given the gravity of Trump’s behaviour and the global consequences of his decision-making just in the last few weeks, the fact that there hasn’t been a Republican rebellion once again speaks volumes about the cowardice that got us into this position in the first place.

“He has to be reined in and the only people who can rein him in are the Republicans in Congress. Even with them facing electoral slaughter in November, they have yet to come together and work with Democrats to rein in Donald Trump.”

An Emerson College national poll this week found that 43% of likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing while 51% disapprove. Looking ahead to the midterms, 48% support the Democratic candidate on the generic congressional ballot and 42% plan on voting for the Republican candidate.

Trump himself is barred by the constitution from running for president again. Several shops that sell Trump campaign merchandise have recently announced that they are closing down. Next year the Republican political conversation will inexorably turn to the search for his successor, rendering him a lame duck with diminishing influence over the party.

Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: “I don’t see a lot of evidence that many Republicans are willing to break publicly with him. But there’s clearly a sense of unease spreading in Republican ranks as they contemplate running for election or re-election in an environment defined by increasing public discontent with the Trump presidency as revealed by all the standard indices.

“If the traditional relationship between presidential approval and the party’s fortunes in the midterm elections holds true then the Republicans are in for a rough November. They know that. They can’t break with the president but they can subtly distance themselves from him and I suspect that, unless the president’s numbers pick up substantially, that is exactly what they’re going to do.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eadc4d8d78059979bb5e63463343742ee27deb55/720_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ab0747aa4db9eafa5b59b67e7b32a32f",N,,2026-01-25 09:57:47.943177

Most people in the Great Room of Moscow’s 1912 Center raised their hands when asked if they, their parents or their grandparents were born in another country.

That’s how Joann Muneta, chair of the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, opened Saturday’s talk, “Immigration: An American Experience,” at the group’s 33rd annual human rights breakfast honoring Martin Luther King Jr.

The event, which filled to capacity with attendees joining both in-person and via Zoom, also featured the presentation of the 2026 Rosa Parks Achievement Awards and music by Gefilte Trout.

But Raquel Reyes, the event’s keynote speaker and director of programs and operations for PODER of Idaho, a Latinx advocacy group, posed her own question.

“Is it your experience, or are you finally being exposed to what we live with on a daily basis?” Reyes asked the majority-white crowd. “For the allies trying to save us, trying to deter the enforcement of these unlawful policies, I appreciate that. But it’s not your experience.”

Reyes recounted heart-wrenching stories: her father helping his mother and younger siblings cross the Rio Grande on inflatable tubes; the border barring her Apache grandfather from freely visiting ancestral lands; the father of her children seized and sentenced to three years detention; the daily blessing she gives her undocumented husband with the hope he comes home safe every night.

“The border crossed our family, we didn’t cross the border,” Reyes said. “We have to fight the propaganda that convinces communities that immigrants are dangerous and must be deported.”

Just minutes before the breakfast began, news broke that Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, died after being shot by a U.S. Border Patrol officer. Pretti was the third person shot, and second killed, by federal officers in 17 days as anti-immigration enforcement protests continue in Minneapolis.

The shootings have enhanced fears that legal residents and citizens are not safe from President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

For Reyes, who was born in Los Angeles and whose family has always been a mix of citizens, legal residents and undocumented immigrants, this fear is nothing new.

“We have people doing it the right way, but they’re still being detained and deported and arrested and held in detention centers,” Reyes said. “We have to fight back.”

To change the climate in our country, Reyes said, voting in every single election is critical.

“We can register voters endlessly, but the real difference is made when they actually go to the polls,” Reyes said. “Start a carpool. Get people to vote. Educate and inform them. It’s not political, it’s humanity. Being humane – we’ve lost that in America.”

Reyes also called on the crowd to make their voices heard.

“I need you to call our legislators, to write letters, to email them. Everything you can do to let them know their constituents are not happy. Until we really push back, nothing is going to change in Idaho,” Reyes said. “I’m brown. They don’t want to hear me, but they will listen to you.”

The Human Rights Task Force will post a recording of the event on its website at humanrightslatah.org.

Federal agents have shot and killed US citizen Alex Pretti during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the federal government cannot be trusted to lead the probe

Family of man killed by agent slams Trump administration's 'sickening lies'

The family of Alex Pretti on Sunday released a statement in which they expressed their grief and anger over his killing, saying they were ""heartbroken"" and describing Pretti as a ""kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,"" adding, ""Alex wanted to make a difference in this world.""

The Trump administration, as was the case in the January 7 killing of unarmed US citizen Renee Good by ICE officers, has asserted that Pretti was a left-wing radical bent on ambushing and killing as many officers as possible. The authorities have not provided evidence to back the claim.

In turn, the family said Pretti's final act was ""to protect a woman"" who was being manhandled by ICE agents.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,"" they said.

""Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.""

Despite these references to ICE, Pretti was in fact shot by the US Border Patrol agent. This agency is typically active in areas close to the border, but has been working increasingly close with its sister agency, ICE, under the current Trump administration, leading to both agencies being deployed in Minneapolis.

The family ended its statement with a plea: ""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

What do we know about Minneapolis shooting victim Alex Pretti?

The man shot by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Saturday, 37-year-old US citizen Alex Jeffrey Pretti, was an intensive care unit nurse at a local veteran affairs hospital, according to his family and colleagues.

A hospital colleague of Pretti's, Dimitri Drekonja, who heads the Infectious Diseases Section, called him ""a good kind person who lived to help.""

In a post on the Bluesky social media platform, he said Pretti worked ""to support critically ill Veterans.""

Pretti's father was cited by The Associated Press as saying that his son had been deeply disturbed by the actions of federal immigration officials in Minneapolis, and had taken part in anti-ICE protests triggered by the death of another US citizen, Renee Good, in the city at the hands of a federal officer on January 7.

""He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests,"" Michael Pretti said.

AP's report said he was born in Illinois, and was an avid lover of outdoor life.

His family saying his contact with law enforcement had previously been limited to a handful of traffic tickets.

Correction: A previous version of this entry stated that Pretti was shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, rather than a Border Patrol officer. This has now been corrected. We apologize for the error.

Democrats threaten shutdown after Minneapolis shooting

Wesley Dockery Editor

Several Democratic senators have said they will not pass upcoming federal government spending bills after the shooting of a second US citizen in Minneapolis by federal agents, meaning that a government shutdown next week has become increasingly likely.

The current funding for large parts of the federal government expires on January 31.

The funding, which would go partly to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Pentagon, has been passed by the Republican-led House of Representatives through September but will require Democratic support to get through the 100-member Senate with the required majority of 60 votes.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Saturday that ""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.""

Democratic Senator Catherine Cortez Masto from the state of Nevada was one of those who said they would vote against the funding for the DHS.

She accused the Trump administration and DHS chief Kristi Noem of ""putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability.""

Another Democratic senator, Mark Warner of Virginia, also said he would not approve the DHS funding following the shooting death in Minneapolis.

""I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities,"" he wrote on a post on X.

The last government shutdown, the longest in US history at 43 days, ended only in November.

Such shutdowns mean that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed, with only those deemed essential being asked to work on without pay.

Bondi blames Minneapolis's sanctuary city policies after second fatal shooting of resident

US Attorney General Pam Bondi has echoed the White House's line that Minnesota's authorities and their immigration policies have to do with the shooting that killed a Minneapolis man, Alex Pretti.

Speaking during an interview with Fox News, Bondi said the unrest in the city was ""because you have a mayor, you have a governor who has declared Minneapolis a 'sanctuary city.'""

A sanctuary city is a loosely defined term referring to a municipality that limits its cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law.

Proponents of the approach say sanctuary cities help build community trust and improve public safety, while critics argue that they undermine federal law and encourage illegal immigration.

Bondi claimed that Minnesota was stopping ICE from detaining immigrants who have allegedly been charged with violent crimes.

What Pam Bondi said

""Federal law enforcement agents are doing heroic work to remove the worst of the worst in Minnesota — and they’re only there in the first place because of [Minnesota Governor Tim] Walz, [Minnesota Attorney General Keith] Ellison, and [Minneapolis Mayor Jacob] Frey’s dangerous sanctuary policies,"" Bondi posted on X.

She aaccused the state's leaders of ""creating the conditions for violence against law enforcement."" ""NOTHING will stop us from enforcing the law — and NOTHING will stop President Trump from protecting the good people of Minnesota,"" Bondi said.

During the interview with Fox News, Bondi said the Justice Department had sent a ""very strong letter"" to Walz, in which she told him he ""better support President Trump, he better support the men and women in law enforcement, because if he doesn't, we are.""

Shooting is the third involving federal officers in under three weeks — a timeline

This is the third shooting incident in Minnesota involving federal immigration agents in less than three weeks:

Saturday's shooting occurred just blocks from where Renee Good was killed on January 7

The White House labeled Good, a mother and a poet with no criminal record, a 'domestic terrorist' who was shot because she tried to hit a federal officer with her vehicle

Minnesota and Minneapolis authorities have strongly rejected the White House's version of events

Good's shooting further raised tensions in the state amid the crackdown by federal immigration authorities

There have been daily clashes between protesters and law enforcement in Minnesota since Good was killed

On January 15, a federal officer shot a person in the leg during an attempted arrest

The Department of Homeland Security said the officer had fired the shot 'fearing for his life and safety' as he was being attacked with a shovel and a broom handle

National Guard troops will be deployed to the site of the shooting in Minneapolis and the city's federal building.

In a post on X, Minneapolis authorities said the Guard was to be deployed as local police resources ""are already stretched thin because of public safety disruptions federal immigration agents have caused.""

Minneapolis city authorities added that Guard troops would wear neon vests to ""distinguish them from other agencies.""

Local officials said the deployment comes ""at the request"" of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Maine governor demands Trump withdraw 'reckless' ICE agents from state

The governor of the state of Maine, Janet Mills, issued a statement saying she is ""appalled and heartbroken"" by ""yet another killing at the hands of federal immigration enforcement.""

Mills said President Donald Trump's and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem's ""weaponization of federal law enforcement"" is both a ""grave violation of the Constitution"" as well as a ""threat to the lives of law-abiding people in the cities and states they occupy, including Maine.""

The DHS said Friday that ICE agents had arrested over 100 ""illegal aliens"" since a federal immigration crackdown began three days earlier in the state.

In her statement, Mills said she had requested a meeting with Trump to demand the withdrawal of ""these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave danger to public safety.""

She also urged Congress to cut off funding for ICE and to ""immediately"" bring Noem before a public hearing.

""They began to construct and assault law enforcement officers,"" Noem said, adding that they threw objects, ""including ice,"" at the agents.

""An agent's finger was bitten off,"" Noem claimed.

The DHS secretary then blamed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for encouraging violence against law enforcement officers.

""The Minnesota governor and Minneapolis mayor need to take a long, hard look in the mirror,"" Noem said. ""They need to evaluate their rhetoric, their conversations, and their encouragement of such violence.""

Noem said Walz had said the officers were ""not law enforcement, which is a lie; he has called them the Gestapo, he has encouraged residents and citizens and violent rioters to resist.""

While Walz has likened the federal immigration agents to a ""modern-day Gestapo,"" the governor has repeatedly urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully. The Gestapo was the official secret police of Nazi Germany.

Noem also accused Walz of refusing ""to turn over murderers to federal law enforcement officers, he has protected illegal criminals and protected them from being brought to justice.""

She said that Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Frey, instead of cooperating with federal immigration enforcement, ""choose violence, choose to encourage the destruction of their city.""

""It appears they want this lawlessness to continue; it appears they want chaos to distract from the theft and fraud and corruption in this city,"" Noem said.

DHS says man shot dead aimed 'to kill law enforcement'

Kristi Noem, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, has given a press conference in the wake of the shooting of a US citizen by federal officers in Minnesota.

Noem claimed that the man had ""approached US border patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun"" and had ""reacted violently"" when the officers tried to disarm him.

Noem said an agent, who was ""fearing for his life and the life of his fellow officers,"" fired ""defensive shots.""

""The suspect also had two magazines with ammunition in them that held dozens of rounds. He also had no ID,"" Noem continued.

""This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement,"" she said.

Clashing narratives

Noem's description of the incident appears to contradict several videos from the scene filmed by protesters that have been published on social media.

Those videos appear to show a man holding a phone to film the agents' operation and trying to intervene when they start shoving another person.

After multiple agents confront the man, he is wrestled to the ground, before several shots are fired.

At no point is the man seen pulling his weapon or aiming it at the officers.

What have federal authorities said about the shooting?

Federal authorities have said that a 37-year-old man shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis on Saturday morning had ""violently resisted arrest"" before his death.

In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security said that the man had been armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun which led to a federal agent firing ""defensive shots.""

""This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,"" the statement read.

In a press conference later on Saturday, senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino reiterated parts of the statement and added that the officer who carried out the shooting was a ""highly trained"" border patrol agent with 8 years of experience.

According to the account, the man approached officers as they were carrying out ""targeted"" immigration enforcement operations against a separate individual who they said was in the United States illegally.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump sought to portray the shooting as a ""cover-up"" for state fraud scandals without providing details on how the events could be linked in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Local and state officials cast doubt on federal account of shooting

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz cast doubt on the federal government's account of the shooting and insisted the state be allowed to carry out its own investigation into the incidents.

He accused federal agencies of trying to ""spin a narrative"" on the shooting ""before any investigation is done.""

Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said that federal agencies had not provided details on the shooting with local police, but said that a purported video of the incident circulating on social media — which shows masked men who appear to be federal agents kicking and punching someone on the ground before gunshots are heard — ""speaks for itself.""

Man killed in Minneapolis shooting 37-year-old ICU nurse — report

Family members identified the man killed in a shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota on Saturday morning as a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse at a Department of Veteran Affairs hospital, according to the Associated Press.

The report comes after Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said in a Saturday press conference that a 37-year-old man was killed, but declined to identify him.

The man's father was cited in the report as saying that his son was upset by the federal immigration enforcement crackdown in Minneapolis and had participated in anti-ICE protests following the killing of Renee Good by a federal officer on January 7.

The man was a US citizen born in the Midwestern state of Illinois, according to the report.

Minnesota officials had previously stated that the man was a Minneapolis resident and was believed to be a US citizen.

Family members cited by the report said that he owned a handgun and had a concealed carry permit for the state of Minnesota, but added that they had never known him to carry it.

The Department of Homeland Security said he had approached federal officers armed with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun before he was shot dead.

Local and state officials have disputed the account, with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accusing the federal government of ""spinning stories"" before an investigation is conducted.

But when asked by U.S.-based media about its social media posts, DHS has denied it was referring to white supremacist material.","At first glance, there may not appear to be anything unusual about the social media posts that are part of the ongoing recruitment drive by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The posts, which encourage Americans to join ICE, use the same aggressively patriotic imagery that’s become a hallmark of the Trump administration’s online communications.

But to observers of the far-right, and to members of the far-right themselves, there is something else that is recognizable in the language of the posts.

""I would describe it as oddly very familiar as someone who has been looking at the white nationalist and neo-Nazi movement for nearly a decade now,"" said Hannah Gais, a senior research analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Centre, a non-profit that monitors right-wing extremism.

""It's disturbing to see that coming from a government agency.""

Gais is among several U.S. ex perts tracking a series of references in the ICE recruitment posts that, while obscure to most, seem to be wink ing to extremists.

That’s raised the question: Who, exactly, is ICE trying to recruit?

Invoking non-fiction book popular with neo-Nazis

In the year since returning to power, U.S. President Donald Trump has overseen a dramatic expansion to ICE, the agency within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for enforcing immigration within the country.

Trump has set a goal of deporting one million people per year. But as ICE has ramped up arrests, it has been repeatedly accused of racially profiling suspected immigrants and using excessive force in its operations.

Under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed last summer, ICE was given $8 billion US to hire thousands more agents. T he ensuing recruitment drive included social media outreach.

On Aug 11, 2025, ICE posted an image on its socials of Uncle Sam at a crossroads. It included the tag line ""Which way, American man?""

The post echoed a meme popular among right-wing influencers, who use the phrase ""Which way, Western man?"" to illustrate a choice between an image meant to represent liberal values and an image representing their own preferred option.

But the phrase itself is taken from the title of a 700-page antisemitic nonfiction book written by William Gayley Simpson and published by a neo-Nazi press in the late 1970s.

The book has long been a favourite among white supremacists.

Using white supremacist anthem

By itself, the language could have been chalked up to an unfortunate coincidence. But other troubling posts soon followed.

In October, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, posted an image of George Washington on horseback with the URL to the ICE recruitment page. This time the tag line read ""America for Americans.""

It’s a slogan that was used in a xenophobic speech by President Theodore Rosevelt in 1916, before being picked up by the Klu Klux Klan, according to America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States by Harvard history professor Erika Lee.

Not long after, DHS borrowed imagery from the popular video game Halo, writing ""destroy the flood"" atop an armed vehicle.

In the world of the video game, the flood refers to a parasitic alien lifeform. It’s also reminiscent of the language far-right groups use to describe non-white immigrants, according to Gais.

Most recently, in the aftermath of the killing of Renee Good in Minneapolis, ICE put out a recruitment post emblazoned with the line ""We’ll have our home again.""

On Instagram the post first appeared with a clip from a song of the same name by the Pine Tree Riots.

""It is a song only known in white nationalist circles,"" said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism.

Since 2020, the song has been circulated on the messaging app Telegram almost exclusively by accounts linked to far-right extremists, according to analysis by Open Measures, a research firm that specializes in online extremism.

With lyrics about replacement by foreigners, Beirich says the song is only popular in white nationalist spaces. ""This is the kind of thing that I can't find to be a mistake,"" she said.

'Message received,' say Proud Boys

ICE says it received around 220,000 applications during its recruitment drive last year, and hired 12,000 new officers, more than doubling the size of its force.

Beirich wonders how many of those applicants were drawn by the controversial social media posts.

""The most dangerous part is that this is probably attracting white supremacists and other racial extremists to perhaps join the ranks of ICE. And that is a very toxic, very dangerous situation if it's happening,"" she said.

There have been no recent reports of extremists infiltrating the ranks of ICE. But far-right groups have been responding favourably to the social media recruitment campaign, recirculating the posts on their own social media channels.

A Proud Boys chapter reposted the ""We’ll have our home again"" ad next to a picture of a literal dog whistle, adding the line ""message received.""

Another chapter also reposted the ad, commenting ""Hahah. If you know, you know.""

'Attracting the wrong type'

DHS did not respond to a request for comment from CBC News. But when asked by U.S.-based media about its social media posts, DHS has denied it was referring to white supremacist material.

A DHS spokesperson told The Associated Press that the ""We’ll Have Our Home Again"" post was ""a reference to 20-plus million illegal aliens invading the country.""

Its outreach on social media is only one part of a vast recruitment strategy by ICE.

The agency will spend $100 million US this year to target specific demographic groups, according to the Washington Post.

That includes using geo-tagging technology to deliver recruitment ads to people who attend, among other things, UFC fights and gun shows.

ICE has already spent millions running TV ads aimed at recruiting disgruntled law enforcement officers in sanctuary cities, which make public services available to undocumented immigrants.

""In sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,"" the ads say, adding ""Join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst.""

David Lapan, a government communications specialist who was a DHS spokesperson during the first Trump administration, said the department appears to be trying to recruit applicants with a particular mindset.

Its messaging is appealing to people who “want to get rid of foreigners” and “bust some heads,” Lapan said.

""I think ICE is headed in the wrong direction in that they're attracting the wrong type of individual to be involved in a very serious mission that they have,"" he said.

ICE is slated to receive $30 billion by 2029 to fund its deportation efforts.","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/7ba16152-63f6-4ef7-9f8a-a6bd1bb6da5b,1769206809294/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C329%2C4060%2C2283%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-25 11:58:19.141996

The Camarillo branch of American Association of University Women (AAUW Camarillo) encompasses western Ventura County communities including Oxnard, Ventura, Ojai, and up to the Santa Barbara County line. AAUW Camarillo stands in firm opposition to the harmful and discriminatory immigration enforcement practices carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

As a nonprofit committed to advancing gender equity for women and girls through research, education, and advocacy, we see the detrimental impact these actions are having across the county, specifically on women and their families. Masked agents without clear identification have violated constitutional rights to due process and have caused fear, disruption, and trauma across entire communities, trauma that will have longstanding consequences for all of us. ICE raids have had a chilling effect on community trust and well-being.

We call on local leaders to take immediate action:

Prohibit the use of masked or unidentified agents.

Enforce constitutional rights to due process.

Ensure that local law enforcement, in accordance with established city and county policies and the California Values Act (SB 54), will not assist with or participate in the enforcement of federal civil immigration laws.

Take action to protect all individuals from acts of intimidation and aggression perpetrated by ICE agents.

Demand proof that Federal ICE agents employed by the Department of Homeland Security have undergone comprehensive training in use of force and lethal weapons.

AAUW Camarillo condemns the increasingly violent and illegal actions of federal agents, and expects immediate, meaningful action from electeds and government agencies to address this national human rights crisis, from local impacts to global implications.

We need to protect our coast

I am a junior in high school, the co-founder of Simi Valley High School’s Environmental Club, and a youth leader with Climate First: Replacing Oil & Gas (CFROG).

I am also, like many Ventura County residents, someone who loves going to the beach. When friends and family come to visit, the beach is always the first place I want to take them. This is why I was so concerned when I heard about the federal proposal for the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program to open around 1.27 billion acres to new offshore drilling and create six new leases for sale off of California’s coast.

This is fueled by the passing of Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” which requires a minimum of 36 oil lease sales through 2040. With the looming possibility of oil rigs dotting the waters only 3 miles off our shores, I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my family back to the beaches I grew up visiting.

We already know what could happen if this plan comes to fruition. In 1969, the infamous Santa Barbara oil spill polluted our ocean with 3 million tons of crude oil, causing environmental and economic devastation. The silver lining was that this spill spurred the first national Earth Day and an environmental movement that inspired real change. Because people came together to protect our oceans, the last federal oil lease sale in the Pacific was in 1984.

We must use our voices so that this work isn’t undone. I urge the people of Ventura County to submit comments at www.federalregister.gov/documents to protect our coast before the comment period for the Draft Proposed Program ends on Jan. 23.

Don’t let the “Beautiful Bill” destroy what’s truly beautiful: our ocean, our coast, and our community.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from a Minnesota state representative.","Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Saturday that the state will conduct its own investigation into the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis man by federal immigration agents.

The big picture: This is the second time this month local law enforcement said federal agencies have refused to cooperate while investigating the shooting death of a state resident by federal officials.

Driving the news: Walz said he told the White House Saturday morning that the state's justice system ""must have the last word"" because the ""federal government cannot be trusted to handle the investigation.""

A Justice Department spokesperson told Axios that the Department of Homeland Security will lead the investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.

The latest: The 37-year-old Minneapolis resident's death has further inflamed tensions over ICE's continued presence and conduct in the state.

Walz and other officials immediately called on the Trump administration to remove the thousands of immigration agents that have flooded the state in recent weeks.

The president responded with a Truth Social post accusing the mayor and governor of ""inciting Insurrection"" with their rhetoric.

What he's saying: Walz pointed to videos taken at the scene as he dismissed the administration's initial accounts of the fatal encounter as ""nonsense"" and ""lies.""

""Thank God we have video, because according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them,"" he said, accusing federal officials of ""spinning stories"" and ""rushing to judgment.""

""They're telling you not to trust your eyes and ears.""

What we know: Videos from the scene appear to show the man recording agents with a phone and attempting to help another observer as she was pushed to the ground by an agent.

He was sprayed with chemical agents and wrestled to the ground by about half a dozen agents before multiple shots rang out.

The Department of Homeland Security said the man was armed with a gun and that a Border Patrol agent opened fire as the man resisted agents' attempts to disarm him.

Videos circulating so far do not appear to show the man reaching for or brandishing the firearm in question.

Friction point: The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said on X that its investigators were ""blocked"" from the scene this morning by federal agents.

Department of Public Safety commissioner Bob Jacobson told reporters that DHS ""pulled out of the scene,"" and that his agents and officers had to leave for their own safety as the crowd of protesters grew.

State Rep. Marion Rarick, a Republican, implored federal agencies to cooperate with the local investigation.

""Honor federal search warrants. Bring peace to the chaos of our state. Bring full transparency. Bring truth. Follow the constitution. Respect everyones' rights,"" she wrote on Facebook.

Zoom out: Federal officials also blocked state investigators from accessing evidence after an ICE official shot protester Renee Good in early January, declaring that Minnesota has no jurisdiction to investigate the killing.

Local prosecutors pledged to continue to pursue their own probe in that case.

What we're watching: Minnesota Guard Commander Shawn Manke said the guard, which Walz put on standby earlier this week, has been activated to help local law enforcement provide security at a federal immigration building.

More troops remain prepared to respond throughout the metro if the situation escalates, he said.

Federal immigration agents shot and killed a Minneapolis nurse Saturday morning, marking the second fatal shooting by federal officers in the city this month and triggering a rapid cascade of court action, political condemnation, and a brewing budget crisis in Congress as Senate Democrats moved to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE.

The man killed, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record who worked as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti had a permit to carry a firearm, which is legal in Minnesota, but emphasized that bystander video shows Pretti holding a phone — not a weapon — at the time federal agents took him to the ground and opened fire.

Video verified by multiple news organizations shows several federal agents surrounding Pretti, forcing him to his knees, restraining him on the ground and striking him before at least two agents fired. In the footage, one agent appears to pull a gun from the scrum while another unholsters his weapon and fires into Pretti’s back at close range. At least 10 shots were fired within roughly five seconds. Pretti collapses and lies motionless as shots continue.

Federal officials say the shooting occurred during a “targeted operation” in Minneapolis connected to immigration enforcement efforts under the Trump administration.

Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official overseeing the operation, said agents were searching for a man accused of domestic assault and other charges, but acknowledged that Pretti was not the target of the operation.

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the shooting began after Pretti approached agents while armed and that officers perceived him as a threat. Noem said federal agents believed Pretti intended to harm law enforcement.

A senior Border Patrol official described the situation as involving a potential “massacre.”

Those accounts are sharply disputed by eyewitnesses, medical professionals, and sworn declarations filed in federal court within hours of the killing.

In a declaration submitted as part of ongoing litigation challenging federal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, a physician who witnessed the shooting from their apartment said they did not observe Pretti brandish a weapon or pose an immediate threat to agents.

The doctor stated that they rushed outside in freezing conditions to provide medical assistance, identified themselves as a physician, and initially found federal agents not administering medical aid.

The doctor’s declaration describes multiple gunshot wounds, including several to Pretti’s back, and states that federal agents initially blocked or delayed efforts to render emergency care. The physician said they attempted CPR after eventually being allowed access.

Another civilian witness, who was recording video from just feet away, stated in a sworn declaration that Pretti had approached agents with a phone and camera, not a gun, and that federal officers escalated the encounter. That witness said agents forced Pretti to the ground and shot him repeatedly while he was restrained.

Beyond the killing itself, the court filings describe federal agents preventing state and local authorities from securing the crime scene and interviewing witnesses.

Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said federal agents with the Department of Homeland Security blocked BCA investigators from accessing the scene even after a search warrant was obtained. Evans said that in more than 20 years with the agency, he had never encountered federal authorities barring state investigators from a scene involving concurrent jurisdiction.

Within hours, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty filed a new federal lawsuit challenging the federal government’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation.

That same evening, U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud issued a temporary restraining order barring federal agencies from destroying or altering any evidence related to Pretti’s killing and scheduled a follow-up hearing.

The shooting has also been folded into an existing federal case challenging “Operation Metro Surge,” a Trump administration immigration enforcement initiative operating in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Plaintiffs in that case argue the operation violates First and Fourth Amendment protections and sought emergency relief after the killing.

Attorneys for Minnesota, Minneapolis, and St. Paul asked the court to halt the operation entirely, warning that if left unchecked it would continue to cause irreparable harm.

Pretti’s parents, who said they learned of their son’s death when a reporter called them, issued a statement condemning what they described as “sickening lies” told by the administration about their son. They described Pretti as kindhearted and said he had been trying to help members of his community.

The killing reignited protests in Minneapolis, where tensions had already been high following the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, 37, who was shot in the head by a federal immigration officer earlier this month. That shooting also prompted demonstrations and demands by city and state officials for federal agents to leave the city.

Political fallout spread quickly beyond Minnesota. California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused President Donald Trump of escalating federal violence, writing on social media that “Trump made a shooting happen” and calling the federal presence in Minneapolis a “violent occupation.”

Newsom urged Californians to report abuses by ICE and Customs and Border Protection to the state attorney general’s office.

U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff said the killing was another “senseless loss of life” and called for ICE agents to be removed from cities immediately.

Sen. Alex Padilla said the shooting did not make communities safer and only escalated tensions.

At the same time, the shooting triggered an unusual rupture with gun rights groups after Bill Essayli, the first assistant U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, posted online that approaching law enforcement with a gun carries a high likelihood officers would be legally justified in shooting.

The National Rifle Association condemned Essayli’s comment as “dangerous and wrong,” saying public officials should wait for full investigations rather than demonize law-abiding gun owners.

Gun Owners of America said federal agents are not “highly likely” to be legally justified in shooting concealed carry permit holders and warned that treating the presence of a firearm as justification for lethal force undermines constitutional rights.

Essayli later said his remarks were mischaracterized and claimed he was referring only to armed agitators refusing to disarm, but the backlash underscored fractures between the administration’s enforcement posture and traditional gun rights advocates.

In Congress, the political consequences escalated into a potential budget crisis. Senate Democrats announced they would refuse to provide the votes needed to advance legislation funding the federal government if it includes appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called what was unfolding in Minneapolis “appalling” and “unacceptable in any American city,” saying Democrats would block the measure unless DHS funding was separated. The legislation includes billions for DHS and roughly $10 billion for ICE.

Several Democratic senators said they could no longer support funding ICE amid repeated incidents of violence.

Sen. Mark Warner said he would not vote to fund DHS “while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said federal agents were being deployed without accountability and that the operation was “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Republicans acknowledged the funding deal was in jeopardy and began exploring whether DHS funding could be split off to avert a partial government shutdown.

Sen. Susan Collins said negotiations were ongoing but warned that rejecting the full package could jeopardize funding for multiple federal agencies.

As investigations proceed, federal officials have defended their actions as lawful and necessary, while state authorities, judges, medical witnesses, gun rights groups, and Democratic lawmakers have raised sharply different conclusions about what happened in Minneapolis and what it signals about federal power, accountability and the use of lethal force.

Hearings in multiple federal cases are scheduled in the coming days, and the killing of Alex Pretti now sits at the center of a widening legal and political confrontation that extends from a Minneapolis street corner to the halls of Congress.

5:50 p.m.: Susan Collins says Minnesota shooting ‘needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated’

U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, released a statement Saturday responding to the fatal shooting of a man by ICE agents in Minneapolis, saying the incident “needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.”

“This shooting further underscores the importance of equipping federal law enforcement agents with training and body cameras for their safety and the safety of the public,” Collins said in the statement. “I urge protestors to keep space between themselves and law enforcement and not to interfere with operations.”

Collins also said it’s critical that “ICE and other federal law enforcement agents recognize both the public’s right to protest and the highly charged situation they now face.”

4:10 p.m.: Gov Mills requests meeting with Trump after fatal ICE-related shooting in Minneapolis

Gov. Janet Mills issued a statement Saturday afternoon demanding that President Trump withdraw federal immigration agents from Maine, after a fatal shooting in Minneapolis earlier the same day.

Mills also requested a meeting with the president.

“I am requesting that the President of the United States meet with me so that I can demand in person that his Administration withdraw these untrained and reckless ICE agents in Maine and across the country who are stoking fear in communities, arresting legally present people, including law enforcement officials, and who pose a grave threat to public safety,” she said in the statement. “I call on Congress to immediately bring Secretary Noem before them for a public hearing and cut off any further funding for ICE until their lawless tactics and dangerous behavior cease.”

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said a 37-year-old man was killed but declined to identify him. He added that information about what led up to the shooting was limited.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and fired “defensive shots” after a man with a handgun approached them and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him. O’Hara said police believe the man was a “lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.”

Mills said she was appalled at the violence in Minneapolis.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem’s weaponization of Federal law enforcement against the people they are meant to serve is not only a grave violation of the Constitution, but a threat to the lives of law-abiding people in the cities and states they seek to occupy, including Maine,” she wrote.

She encouraged Mainers to continue to protest peacefully.

“I am proud of Maine people for standing up in peaceful protest across our state and I continue to encourage peaceful protest as we show the world that we will always stand up for our values – support for the rule of law, due process, compassion, integrity, and justice. ”

4 p.m.: Attendance down at high school sports event as immigrant families stay away out of fear

Participation was down at Saturday’s morning track meet at the University of Southern Maine in Gorham, which featured teams from Portland, South Portland, Deering and Cheverus high schools.

Athletes whose families immigrated to the United States make up a significant portion of the rosters for the Portland, South Portland and Deering teams. Those teams had a number of athletes missing the meet on Saturday, likely related to the immigration enforcement actions this week.

Andy Schmidt, whose daughter Nora is a freshman distance runner on the Portland track team, took a video of one of Nora’s teammates running a sprint event.

“I was happy to film this race for my friend, who was too scared to come see her daughter compete, even though their family is here legally,” Schmidt said. “I understand we need to enforce immigration laws, but it doesn’t need to be this cruel.”

Adam Ramsell, whose son Caleb is a senior sprinter and jumper on the South Portland track team, said “attendance was way down” at Saturday’s meet, but it could have been even lower.

He said Caleb was one of the students who gave rides to team members who come from immigrant families. That helped minimize the chances those athletes would be targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while traveling to the meet, Ramsell said.

“It’s great to see kids stepping up, supporting and taking care of each other,” Ramsell said.

3:30 p.m.: ICE activities prompt cancelation of weekend puppet shows in Portland

Mayo Street Arts, a community performance venue in Portland’s East Bayside neighborhood, has canceled this weekend’s scheduled puppet shows due to ICE activities.

“We do not feel it is responsible to put international artists at risk,” the organization said in a Saturday afternoon email to members. “ICE is not welcome at MSA and we are implementing policies as best we can to keep our community and the artists that perform here safe.”

In the email, the center said it plans to reschedule the showings of The City That Slept, a story about a sleep-inducing deity wandering the streets of New York City by native New Zealander Tom Tuke, once circumstances in Portland have changed. Ticket holders will receive an email with specific instructions.

3 p.m.: American Legion allows ICE agents to park vehicles in its Scarborough parking lot

Reached at the post, which was in the midst of preparing for a luau celebration, American Legion Post 76 Commander Phil Caesar said he was allowing ICE agents who work at the Scarborough detention center next door to park personal vehicles in the post’s 15-space parking lot.

He said many of the agents appear to live in Scarborough and are veterans themselves.

It’s not like the two groups socialize or that members even talk, he said. It was all handled in one quick phone call, he said.

“They are a federal agency doing federally mandated work,” Caesar said. “We support ICE. That’s it.”

No one from the community or his own membership of a couple dozen have complained about the arrangement, he said.

Caesar said he thought Maine was wrong to refuse to follow federal immigration policies or interfere with ICE enforcement actions or condemn anyone for doing their job. That is why Caesar refused to allow protesters to stage an ICE protest in the post parking lot when asked last year, Caesar said.

Scarborough Democratic Town Councilor Jon Anderson said he is disappointed that the local American Legion post would allow its parking lot to be used by an organization whose recent actions violate people’s civil rights but not local residents who would exercise their free speech right to protest those violations.

Anderson said ICE’s use of the lot is proof the facility has expanded beyond its initial use as a transfer facility. In 2021, the town adopted a 2021 zoning ordinance to prevent any facility expansion, he said. Anderson said that he has asked the town manager to investigate if the facility is in violation of local zoning.

“If they’ve run out of space to park their cars, they’ve most likely expanded, which is exactly what the town took steps to avoid,” Anderson said. “Is the American Legion helping ICE violate our ordinance? I don’t know if there is such a thing as an accomplice to a zoning violation, but I would highly recommend the American Legion reconsider how they are using their land.”

1:50 p.m.: Maine’s congressional delegation begins to react to latest Minneapolis ICE-related shooting

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, discussed the latest shooting on her way to speak at the Lewiston rally on Saturday.

“My heart goes out to the family of the individual shot by ICE,” Pingree said on a message she posted to Facebook. “We have a good idea that this will be yet another unjustified killing.”

She said she was pleased the Minneapolis police would be investigating the incident so it would not be dismissed by ICE.

Pingree is likely to talk about the incident when addressing the crowd in Lewiston. “I’m so proud of Mainers for standing up and fighting for the rule of law,” Pingree said. “ICE needs to get out of our state.”

1:45 p.m.: Anti-ICE rally in Lewiston draws 1,000 protesters to Kennedy Park

LEWISTON — About 1,000 people overflowed the Angora Grand Event Center to protest the surge in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Lewiston and Maine this week.

Speaking at the protest were several local and state officials and candidates for office, including Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline; advocate and former Lewiston City Councilor Safiya Khalid; Portland Mayor Mark Dion; U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner; U.S. House District 2 candidates Matt Dunlap and Jordan Wood and gubernatorial candidates Hannah Pingree, Troy Jackson and Shenna Bellows.

Several religious leaders from Lewiston and beyond also spoke at the demonstration. Asked why she was at the rally, Lewiston resident Debbie Hillman said, “Things are terribly wrong and we need to get together.

“It’s not just one item that Trump has decided to pick, it’s this whole big umbrella of things and it’s frustrating and heartbreaking. This is emotional for me and I had to do something.”

11:15 a.m.: U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner ‘heartened’ by community opposition to ICE

U.S. Senate candidate Graham Platner said he’s “heartened” to see the robust community opposition to a surge of federal immigration enforcement in Maine.

Earlier in the week, Platner urged residents to “actually fight back” against Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers through community organizing. He has accused ICE of terrorizing the community, rather than conducting a legitimate law enforcement operation.

On Friday night, hundreds of protesters marched along Congress Street and dozens of others beat on drums and blew whistles for the second straight night at hotels where ICE agents are believed to be staying.

“The rallies and the protests outside the hotels, of course, I support them immensely,” Platner said in an interview with the Press Herald on Saturday morning.

Platner said he’s proud of the rapid response teams that have formed organically in communities like Portland, Westbrook, Biddeford and Saco to record and document arrests being made by ICE agents and help people too fearful to leave their homes.

“The reason we’re seeing videos of these illegal arrests is because there are people on hand available to videotape them and then report what they’re witnessing,” Platner said. “People are doing this in their communities and then connecting with the greater networks. And I think that that’s something that we should all be proud of.”

Platner is seeking the Democratic nomination against two-term Gov. Janet Mills. The winner will take on Republican Sen. Susan Collins in the fall.

Platner is slated to speak at a rally in Lewiston this afternoon.

10:55 a.m.: More than 200 Maine faith leaders denounce ICE tactics

An open letter circulated by the Maine Council of Churches Friday condemned the tactics of ICE agents in the state. More than 200 faith leaders signed the letter, which called on ICE to end its targeting of immigrants and asylum seekers.

“Our sacred texts teach us to love the stranger and urge us toward empathy and welcome, not toward violence and bigotry,” the letter said. “Yet across our state, parents are afraid to pick up their children from school, workers are afraid to go to their jobs, and parishioners are afraid to walk home alone from worship services due to the discriminatory and unjust actions being perpetrated by ICE agents.

“This sort of terror is not welcome here. We denounce the current operation and call for its end.”

The letter encourages Mainers to report ICE activity to the statewide hotline, document incidents involving ICE agents and help the immigrant community access needed services.

10 a.m.: Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce offers advice to businesses dealing with “troubling” ICE disruption

The Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce said it has been closely following recent federal immigration enforcement activity and has heard concerns from members about how this activity is affecting their businesses.

“The manner and scope of recent immigration enforcement actions are disrupting workplaces, undermining economic stability, and adversely affecting the well-being of residents,” the organization said. “This includes members of our much-valued immigrant community, who play a significant role in the success and vitality of Greater Portland’s economy.”

Businesses rely on employees who are here legally to be able to work without unnecessary uncertainty or stress, it said.

Here is what it told its business members in an email sent out Friday night:

Businesses should designate one person to interact with ICE officers. Employee eligibility forms should be complete and securely stored. Mark non-public workplace spaces. Train front-line staff to refer agents to managers. Keep legal counsel information readily available.

Employees should carry valid immigration documents, know they have the right to stay silent and ask for a lawyer, and not to volunteer information or sign documents they do not understand.

If agents show up, stay calm and act professionally. Do not resist or obstruct officers. Limit agents’ access to public areas unless they have a judicial warrant signed by a judge. Consult a lawyer before providing documents or answering questions. Employers have three business days to respond to a notice of inspection for employee eligibility forms and related records.

“We will continue to support our members and serve as a voice for the Greater Portland business community,” the agency told its members. “In the meantime, we encourage open and constructive dialogue among federal, state, and local leaders.”

Family members identified the man who was killed as Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who had protested President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in his city. After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and protesters clashed with federal immigration officers, who wielded batons and deployed flash bangs.

The Minnesota National Guard was assisting local police at the direction of Gov. Tim Walz, officials said. Guard troops were sent to both the shooting site and to a federal building where officials have squared off with protesters daily.

Information about what led up to the shooting was limited, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that federal officers were conducting an operation and fired ""defensive shots"" after a man with a handgun approached them and ""violently resisted"" when officers tried to disarm him.

WATCH: Thousands brave frigid cold in Twin Cities 'ICE Out' protest

In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.

O'Hara said police believe the man was a ""lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.""

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said during a news conference that Pretti had shown up to ""impede a law enforcement operation."" She questioned why he was armed but did not offer detail about whether Pretti drew the weapon or brandished it at officers.

The officer who shot the man is an eight-year Border Patrol veteran, federal officials said.

Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out at Walz and the Minneapolis mayor.

Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered and said: ""What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?""

Trump, a Republican, said the Democratic governor and mayor are ""are inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.""

Pretti was shot just over a mile from where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good on Jan. 7, sparking widespread protests.

Pretti's family released a statement Saturday evening saying they are ""heartbroken but also very angry,"" and calling him a kindhearted soul who wanted to make a difference in the world through his work as a nurse.

""The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump's murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed,"" the family statement said. ""Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.""

Video shows officers, man who was shot

In a bystander video of Saturday's shooting obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at federal officers on Nicollet Avenue.

The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.

The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.

The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.

Soon at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man's back and another who appears to have a canister in his hand strikes a blow to the man's chest. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.

A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it's not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.

The police chief appealed for calm, both from the public and from federal law enforcement.

""Our demand today is for those federal agencies that are operating in our city to do so with the same discipline, humanity and integrity that effective law enforcement in this country demands,"" the chief said. ""We urge everyone to remain peaceful.""

Gregory Bovino of U.S. Border Patrol, who has commanded the Trump administration's big-city immigration campaign, said the officer who shot the man had extensive training as a range safety officer and in using less-lethal force.

""This is only the latest attack on law enforcement. Across the country, the men and women of DHS have been attacked, shot at,"" he said.

Walz said he had no confidence in federal officials and that the state would lead the investigation into the latest fatal shooting.

But Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said during a news conference that federal officers blocked his agency from the shooting scene even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

Amid the unrest, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats will not vote for a spending package that includes money for DHS. Schumer's statement increases the possibility that the government could partially shut down on Jan. 30 when funding runs out.

Protests continue in Minneapolis

Protesters converged at the scene of the shooting despite dangerously cold weather.

At midday Saturday, the worst of an extreme cold wave was over, but the temperature was still -6 degrees (-21 Celsius).

After the shooting, an angry crowd gathered and screamed profanities at federal officers, calling them ""cowards"" and telling them to go home. One officer responded mockingly as he walked away, telling them: ""Boo hoo."" Agents elsewhere shoved a yelling protester into a car. Protesters dragged garbage dumpsters from alleyways to block the streets, and people who gathered chanted, ""ICE out now"" and ""Observing ICE is not a crime.""

As dark fell, hundreds of people gathered quietly by a growing memorial at the site of the shooting. Some carried signs saying ""Justice for Alex Pretti."" Others chanted Pretti's and Good's names. A doughnut shop and a clothing store nearby stayed open, offering protesters a warm place as well as water, coffee and snacks.

Caleb Spike said he came from a nearby suburb to show his support and his frustration. ""It feels like every day something crazier happens,"" he said. ""What's happening in our community is wrong, it's sickening, it's disgusting.""

___

The age of the man who was shot has been corrected to 37, per information from the police chief. The AP previously reported his age as 51 based on a hospital record.

“The nation’s nurses, who make it their mission to care for and save human lives, are horrified and outraged that immigration agents have once again committed cold-blooded murder of a public observer who posed no threat to them. This time, they have executed one of our fellow nurses, Alex Pretti, who saved veterans’ lives as an intensive care unit RN for the Veterans Health Administration. He not only advocated for his patients inside the VA as a member of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), but also took his advocacy to the streets to stand up for his community as nurses do. We demand justice and accountability for his murder.

ICE and all related immigration enforcement agencies have repeatedly shown through their violence, terror, and lawlessness that they pose a dire public health threat to the entire country and all our communities. ICE agents have been kidnapping hard working people - mothers, fathers, and children - and now murdered a registered nurse, one of the most trusted professions in the country.

Nurses demand the immediate abolition of ICE.

Nurses are trained to respond to emergent situations and this is why we are calling for urgent action to end the ICE violence in our communities. National Nurses United calls for a no vote on the Homeland Security Appropriations bill that is up for Senate approval next week and demands Congress abolish ICE entirely. We will be doing everything in our power to vote out any elected official who supports funding for this all-out assault on the health, safety, and civil rights of our people.

The incident was one of five shootings in January involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good. At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention, an unusually rapid pace.

The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement with $170 billion budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

Minneapolis has become the focus of the Republican president’s crackdown this month, with some 3,000 agents deployed. Thousands of protesters took to the streets despite sub-zero temperatures on Friday to voice opposition to Trump’s enforcement and demand he withdraw the agents, which Minnesota officials have called an occupation.

Trump has argued the militarized operations are necessary to remove criminals from the U.S., but many of those arrested were picked up solely for possible civil immigration violations - the legal equivalent to a traffic violation.

Here is a closer look at the deaths from federal immigration enforcement and the often-conflicting accounts of what happened in each case.

FATAL SHOOTINGS IN MINNESOTA

The man killed in Minneapolis on Saturday was a U.S. citizen, identified in news reports as Alex Pretti, 37, a registered nurse and lawfully permitted gun owner.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent fired at the man, who resisted agents' attempts to disarm him, but local leaders challenged that account.

In bystander videos verified by Reuters, agents are seen pepper spraying Pretti and other protesters as he films them with his cellphone. No weapon is visible. After multiple agents wrestle him to the ground, one draws his weapon and multiple shots can be heard.

The shooting followed Good’s death earlier this month, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle.

Within hours of that shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist” who tried to ram the ICE officer with her car, although the department has not presented evidence of a link to terrorism. Video shows Ross fired as Good's car moved past him.

ICE, BORDER PATROL FIRING AT SUSPECTS

Federal agents have been involved in three other shootings this month during immigration actions.

The day after Good’s death, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man and woman in Portland, Oregon, after what DHS called “a targeted vehicle stop.”

DHS said the driver, Venezuelan immigrant Luis Nino-Moncada, attempted to run over the agents before the agent fired, wounding Nino-Moncada and his passenger, a Venezuelan woman.

The Justice Department later charged Nino-Moncada with assaulting an officer. His passenger, Yorlenys Zambrano-Contreras, pleaded guilty this week to entering the U.S. illegally in 2023.

On January 15, an ICE agent shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg in Minneapolis after DHS said he fled authorities.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan immigrant, and two other men hit an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

DETENTION DEATHS RISE

At least six people have died in ICE detention centers since the start of 2026, following at least 30 deaths in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high.

The death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos has received the most scrutiny after federal authorities provided shifting accounts of what happened.

ICE initially said Lunas died on January 3 at a Trump-era detention camp on the grounds of a U.S. military base in Texas after experiencing ""medical distress.""

The medical examiner released a report this week that found the death was a homicide due to ""asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,"" the Post reported.

On January 14, two other immigrant detainees died: a Nicaraguan man found unresponsive in the military base site, called East Camp Montana, and a Mexican man found unresponsive in a Georgia detention center, according to ICE.

Both deaths remain under investigation, but ICE said the Nicaraguan man, Victor Manuel Diaz, was presumed to have committed suicide.

The other deaths occurred in Houston, Philadelphia, and Indio, California, ICE said.

Trump increased immigration detention to record levels, with 69,000 held as of early January, according to ICE statistics. Some 43% of the detainees picked up by ICE had no criminal charge or conviction, the figures showed.

In a statement to NewsNation, the agency said Border Patrol officers were conducting a targeted operation in the city when the man approached them with a gun. The officers tried unsuccessfully to take the gun away, but the man resisted, officials said.

“Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots,” DHS wrote.

Medics on scene rendered aid to the man, but DHS said he later died at the scene.

DHS said they also found two magazines on the man following the shooting, alleging that he likely wanted to “do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

Tensions in the area following the shooting have grown drastically since news came out that the person died. Protesters began throwing water bottles and other objects at agents, who then responded by deploying tear gas and pepper spray.

The Trump administration last July issued a ""Detained Parents Directive"" that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE ""should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.""
The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America's divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as ""bait"" by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an ""abject lie."" It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family's attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

School officials say ICE used the boy as 'bait'

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, ""essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,"" she said.

The father told the child's mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn't leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

""Why detain a 5-year-old?"" the superintendent asked. ""You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.""

Other adults at the scene wanted to care for the boy

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

ICE denies what school officials and neighbors said

""ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as 'bait,'"" said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. ""ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ""

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. ""Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.""

The officers, she said, ""abided by the father's wishes to keep the child with him.""

Bovino and ICE officials criticize media coverage

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the ""false media narrative"" about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for ""abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle."" He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and ""did everything they could to reunite him with his family.""

""Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

Where are the father and son now?

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children's Rights, who visited the facility last week.

""The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,"" Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

""Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,"" Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

""I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,"" Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers ""get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.""

The family's lawyer was unable to reach them

The family's lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

""We're looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,"" he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch's office said he was unavailable to comment.

What is the Trump administration's policy on detaining children?

The child's immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn't, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

""This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,"" Homan said last year on CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

The Trump administration last July issued a ""Detained Parents Directive"" that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE ""should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them."" The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

""If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child's immigration status,"" said Neha Desai, managing director at Children's Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. ""When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child's care.""

The man was later pronounced dead. This is just the latest incident of deadly violence involving ICE, which has grown increasingly frequent, especially on the streets of Minneapolis. It’s been less than three weeks since an agent murdered Renée Good on January 7th.

Just as in the case of the shooting of Good, video of the killing quickly started circulating online. Though I strongly urge readers to use their judgment before clicking through and pressing play. The video is upsetting and includes the graphic death of a human being.

Governor Tim Walz addressed the public in a conference this afternoon, insisting that the state’s justice system would “have the last word on this.” He harkened back to his earlier calls for citizens to “hit record” when they see ICE. “Minnesotans are witnessing, and we’re creating a log of evidence for the future prosecution of ICE agents and the officials responsible for this,” he said. “Thank god, thank god we have video.”

The Minnesota Star Tribune reports that ICE immediately tried to seize control of the situation by whisking witnesses off to the Whipple building, which has served as a base of operations and detention center during immigration raids in Minneapolis. ICE also attempted to order local police to leave the scene, but Chief Brian O’Hara refused to comply. The official X account of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also confirmed that their access to the crime scene was restricted by DHS agents, despite requests from local police for their assistance in investigating the shooting.

The Star Tribune is updating regularly as information comes in.

But in the hours after fatal shooting, several Democrats have come forward to announce their opposition, including some who had until now appeared ready to vote the funding package.
“The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.
We could beef up training and require identification,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose been pushing his colleagues to block DHS funding for weeks.
What’s unacceptable is the current lawless status quo.” Senate Democrats were expected to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their next steps.","In the wake of another fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minnesota by a federal officer, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said his party would block a funding package next week if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The announcement, which dramatically escalates the potential for another partial government shutdown, comes as anger towards homeland security, which oversees ICE, intensifies among the party after a group of federal agents violently restrained and then fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling – and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer, a New York senator, said in a statement. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no.”

“Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he added.

The Senate is set to take up the spending measure as part of a broader legislative package that would fund broad swaths of the government, including the defense, state , education, labor and transportation departments. That package, which currently calls for $64.4bn for the DHSincluding $10bn for ICE, needs 60 votes to avoid a filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans currently control 53 seats and would need Democratic support to pass the bipartisan package.

The looming vote was seen as a potentially painful decision for many Senate Democrats, wary of setting off another government shutdown just months after a painful 43-day fiscal showdown – the longest in the nation’s history – that ultimately failed to win an extension of healthcare subsidies.

But in the hours after fatal shooting, several Democrats have come forward to announce their opposition, including some who had until now appeared ready to vote the funding package.

“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” Nevada senator Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe. It’s brutalizing US citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Last year, Cortez Masto was one of a handful of Democrats who broke rank and voted repeatedly to keep the government open.

Jacky Rosen, Nevada’s other senator who had also bucked her party during the shutdown, wrote on X: “As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now. That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Mark Warner, a Democratic senator for Virginia, wrote: “I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

In a sign of Democrats’ fury, Washington senator Patty Murray, the ranking member on the appropriations committee, who negotiated funding package, announced she would not support the package as currently written.

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences. I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands,” she said on X. “The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that. I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

It was unclear if Senate Republicans were willing to separate the DHS funding measure from the rest of the package, which would likely win significant bipartisan support. On Saturday, many Republicans defended the agent and the department in the aftermath of the shooting.

Holding up the homeland security budget would not necessarily curtail the department’s enforcement operations, at least not in the short term. Trump’s 2025 domestic policy bill, known as the “big, beautiful bill”, included a $75bn supplement for ICE the agency could potentially tap if its funding lapsed.

But Democrats say they must use the threat to try to establish guardrails on federal immigration agents, whose increasingly violent tactics have fueled protests in cities across the US.

“We should not fund DHS without serious reform. We could return CBP to border. We could require warrants for immigration arrests. We could beef up training and require identification,” Senator Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat whose been pushing his colleagues to block DHS funding for weeks. “The list of possible reforms is long. What’s unacceptable is the current lawless status quo.”

Senate Democrats were expected to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss their next steps.

The funding bill narrowly passed the Republican-controlled House on Thursday, overcoming a Democratic revolt following the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Seven Democrats, however, helped nearly all Republicans move it over the line. Explaining their support, several of the Democrats sharply denounced ICE’s conduct in US cities, but argued that the funding bill contained hard-won concessions, including funding for body cameras and de-escalation training for ICE officers.

But Republicans rejected other proposals sought by Democrats, including measures that would have requires judicial warrants for home entries and a provision explicitly prohibiting funds from being used to detain or deport US citizens.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03898e706322e0f29a19b79d2185c78276b747ed/688_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f376cd0849c7d8b8cbe6d2b0486a8d53",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:14.761169

“Whoever goes to the United States Senate is going to have to be ready for real war.","Hours after federal immigration agents killed a man in Minneapolis, the top Democrats running for U.S. Senate in Texas appeared on a debate stage together and both called for overhauling Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Just minutes into the debate between Rep. Jasmine Crockett and state Rep. James Talarico, which was hosted by the Texas AFL-CIO and moderated by Nexstar’s KXAN-TV and The Dallas Morning News, Crockett referenced the shooting by Department of Homeland Security agents. She pointed to the incident to lay out the stakes of the race ahead of the March 3 primary.

“Listen, we are not looking at politics as usual. Just today, we just had another person gunned down in the streets in Minneapolis,” Crockett said. “And so for anyone that believes that we are going to be able to respond to this in a normal way, I think that they’ve got it wrong.”

Crockett and Talarico also agreed on a range of liberal positions as they fight to flip a Republican-leaning state, including saying that President Donald Trump has committed impeachable offenses and that changing the makeup of the Supreme Court should be considered.

Crockett defended her recent vote against a DHS funding bill, saying, “There was no way I was going to continue to pump a historic amount of money into this rogue organization that is going out and is violating people’s rights every single day in American cities.”

“We absolutely have to clean house, whatever that looks like,” Crockett, who supports impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, later said when pressed on whether she would support defunding or abolishing ICE altogether.

Talarico, who also backed impeaching Noem, said it is time to “tear down” the agency.

“ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning,” Talarico said. “It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

Both candidates were also pressed on how they balance their views of ICE when Texas voters may support deporting undocumented immigrants, a nod to the politics of a state that Trump won by 14 points in 2024.

“They are supposed to do Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not going after U.S. citizens, not going after people that are documented. That is not what they are supposed to do, but that is what they are doing,” Crockett said. “They are turning us into Nazi Germany by saying they’re gonna go door to door. They are going after people because of their accent or the color of their skin because this Supreme Court gave them carte blanche ability to do so.”

Talarico pointed to his family’s roots in a Texas border town, calling for balancing border security with an immigration overhaul.

“Our southern border should be like our front porch. There should be a giant welcome mat out front and a lock on the door,” Talarico said. “We can welcome immigrants who want to live the American dream. We can build a pathway to citizenship for those neighbors who have been here, making us richer and stronger, and we can keep out people who mean to do us harm.”

Both candidates referred to immigration enforcement and the clashes in Minnesota, where protests have continued after an ICE agent shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis earlier this month, in stark terms later in the debate.

Crockett accused Trump of “seemingly trying to plunge us not only into a civil war with ICE, but he’s also trying to plunge us into World War III,” referring to his foreign policy.

Talarico referred back to ongoing clashes in Minnesota during a discussion about potential military action in Iran, saying, “We can have discussions about how to respond in Iran, where we have seen so many innocent civilians, protesters murdered on their streets. We’re also seeing that in Minnesota as we speak.”

Both candidates sharply criticized the Trump administration as they compete to take on Republican Sen. John Cornyn in the traditionally red state, though Talarico suggested multiple times that state Attorney General Ken Paxton could be the GOP nominee. Cornyn, who is seeking a fifth term, is facing a tough primary fight against Paxton or Rep. Wesley Hunt.

Crockett reiterated her support for impeaching Trump, saying, “There is more than enough to impeach Donald Trump. Period.” She pointed to his tariff policy as one potential impeachable offense.

Talarico also said that “the administration has certainly committed impeachable offenses, particularly when it comes to using their public roles to enrich themselves,” but added that he would carefully examine all of the evidence and “vote my conscience,” as the Senate acts as the jury in an impeachment trial.

The debate revealed few policy differences between the candidates, but a handful of dividing lines emerged on their political strategy and their stances on issues like the Senate filibuster, corporate donations and Supreme Court reforms.

Crockett argued she is the more electable candidate in November, touting support among working-class, Black and female voters and suggesting she will more forcefully take on Trump.

“This is about whether or not we have the will,” Crockett said. “And right now, people are not happy with the Democratic Party. I’ve seen the polling. What they want is someone who is going to be unafraid in the face of what we are facing right now, which is someone who believes he’s a king.”

She took a rare swipe at Talarico, saying he is not as well known in the state despite his time in elected office.

“He’s not as known right now because I have engaged in these fights, and they have been right there on the front lines where people could see me out front,” Crockett said.

Talarico framed his campaign as a fight against billionaires, saying “the real fight in this country is not left versus right, it’s top versus bottom.”

“We have traveled to every corner of Texas because we’re not writing off any voter or any community, and we have shattered grassroots fundraising records without taking a dime of corporate PAC money,” Talarico later added.

Talarico called for banning corporate PACs and super PACs, and he defended past campaign donations to his state legislative campaign committee from a pro-gambling PAC funded by GOP megadonor Miriam Adelson. Talarico said he has never met Adelson and they are not aligned on most issues, but the donation was tied to his support for legalizing gambling in Texas.

Crockett also defended donations to her campaigns from a slew of corporate PACs, saying those donations are limited under federal law and that they come from employee contributions to the PACs. She also said she has used her own campaign funds to boost other Democratic candidates.

The candidates also appeared to take different stances on the 60-vote threshold to end debate in the Senate, known as the filibuster. Talarico has previously said he supports eliminating the filibuster, while Crockett suggested carveouts for certain issues like voting rights could be more feasible.

“There are not a lot of people on the Senate side that are going to say, ‘Hey, yes, let’s do it,’” Crockett said of eliminating the filibuster. “But I do think that we can get somewhere if we focus on looking at, historically, the fact that they have had these carveouts. And we need to make it for, at a very minimum, our fundamental issues.”

Crockett also voiced her support for expanding the Supreme Court, while Talarico said he would be “open” to the move. Talarico added that term limits for justices “can do just as much good” to reduce partisanship on the high court.

As they laid out their stances on a range of other issues including lowering costs, supporting unions and navigating artificial intelligence, Crockett and Talarico both talked about the high stakes of the U.S. Senate race in Texas.

“I have seen the consequences in the trenches of the Texas Legislature of losing elections. I’ve seen my constituents get hurt. I’ve seen rights that we took for granted rolled back. I’ve seen schools close. I’ve seen people not be able to access basic health care. So we have to win in November,” Talarico said.

Crockett said she has “been fighting on the front lines in this corrupt administration,” and she has faced death threats in the process.

“Whoever goes to the United States Senate is going to have to be ready for real war. This is how bad it is,” Crockett said, later adding: “I am here to tell you that it is life or death, as we see what is happening in Minnesota and otherwise.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260123-crockett-talarico-debate-bf-1111-ba257b.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 04:57:23.050737

The man was later revealed to be an employee of the Veterans Affairs Department, working as an intensive care unit nurse at the medical center in the city where he was killed.

Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was taken to the ground by several federal agents before one of them shot him. Pretti gathered with other protestors as Border Patrol was conducting what it called a targeted operation to detain an individual it said was in the country illegally.

Trump administration officials accused Pretti of approaching Border Patrol agents with a weapon and resisting efforts to disarm him. They said, without evidence, that Pretti was looking to “massacre law enforcement.” Analysis of videos of the incident by media organizations such as The New York Times found the evidence contradicted that version of events, as Pretti approached the with only his phone and his firearm was holstered and concealed until after the agents had forcefully brought him to the ground.

As a VA nurse, Pretti was a member of the American Federation of Government Employees chapter at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center. AFGE President Everett Kelley said Pretti ""dedicated his life to serving American veterans.""

“Our union is heartbroken,” Kelley said. “An AFGE member is dead. And a family’s life has been forever changed.”

Kelley blamed President Trump’s policies for creating the environment in which Pretti’s death occurred, though he encouraged his members to demonstrate restraint.

“I urge everyone to remain disciplined and measured in public, even as we are rightly angry,” Kelley said. “Still, we must do what we can to maintain peace and calm.”

The Trump administration was quick to denounce Pretti despite his work for the administration and with veterans, with Homeland Security Department Secretary Kristi Noem quickly labeling him a domestic terrorist. VA did not respond to a request for comment. Records indicate Pretti worked for VA since at least 2016.

Pretti’s death marked the third shooting by federal law enforcement in Minnesota in recent weeks. Earlier this month, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed Renee Good, who was protesting the agency’s enforcement activities from her vehicle. Officers shot another man who was fleeing his attempted arrest.

Doug Massey, president of the AFGE chapter that represents employees in VA's headquarters, said the pain of Pretti's death would be widespread.

“Alex…was known by colleagues, friends, and family as a compassionate caregiver who was deeply committed to helping others,” Massey said. “His senseless death is a profound loss to his loved ones, his patients, and our union family.”

The shooting could have further implications for federal employees: Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in response to the shooting that his party would not agree to a six-bill funding package next week if it contains DHS appropriations. Half of the 12-annual must pass spending bills for fiscal 2026 have already cleared Congress, but the remaining six are still pending before the Senate. The House already approved them.

In addition to DHS, those measures would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State and Treasury, as well as other related agencies. They are currently operating under a stopgap continuing resolution that is set to expire Jan. 30. Lawmakers could opt to fund just those agencies and negotiate separately over DHS, though such an approach would require new votes in both the House and Senate.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/24/012426_Getty_GovExec_MinneapolisShooting/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 01:57:13.968069

But through public land orders, an administration can effectively close off these lands to otherwise lawful activities — most often mineral development — without meaningful accountability.
It is a vivid example of how executive power over public lands has grown far beyond what the Constitution ever intended.
Despite their name, public land orders are rules, given their sweeping impact on the public and the economy.
It would not only overturn Biden’s public land order, but it would also permanently bar any future administration from issuing a substantially similar order.","For decades, the executive branch has unilaterally withdrawn vast tracts of federal land from productive use through a mechanism known as a public land order. For instance, the Biden administration in 2023 signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdrew more than 225,000 acres of land in northern Minnesota from mineral development.

According to experts, this area contains “world-class deposits” and one of the largest undeveloped copper-nickel and platinum-group metal resources in the world — potentially including vast quantities of copper, nickel, cobalt, and platinum-group metals.

By locking up these lands, the Biden administration effectively killed a planned development that could have helped meet growing global demand for minerals used in everything from household appliances to military aircraft. This decision was made despite opposition from members of Congress, mineral developers and local residents who recognized the economic opportunity that responsible development could bring to the region.

The federal government owns roughly 640 million acres of land — about 28 percent of the United States. These lands contain many of the natural resources essential to our modern economy. Traditionally, federal lands are presumed to be open to multiple uses, including responsible resource development.

But through public land orders, an administration can effectively close off these lands to otherwise lawful activities — most often mineral development — without meaningful accountability. With a single signature, the Department of the Interior can — as in the Minnesota case — lock away a mineral-rich area of land five times the size of Washington, D.C. There was no debate, no vote and no accountability.

That decision, which was buried in bureaucratic procedure, wiped out jobs, investment and access to critical minerals the nation desperately needs. It is a vivid example of how executive power over public lands has grown far beyond what the Constitution ever intended.

Congress, however, is not powerless in the face of such executive action. The Congressional Review Act provides lawmakers with a powerful tool to rein in agency overreach by allowing Congress to nullify federal rules. Despite their name, public land orders are rules, given their sweeping impact on the public and the economy.

Historically, the Congressional Review Act has been woefully underutilized, with less than 1 percent of finalized agency rules ever targeted for repeal. That is beginning to change. During the 119th Congress, lawmakers have already used it to rescind 22 rules, reducing regulatory burdens on Americans by more than $130 billion. Congress has eliminated regulatory burdens that were previously thought to be off-limits from the law’s reach, including the repeal of California’s EPA electric vehicle waiver and several Biden-era resource management plans.

Now it is time to apply the CRA to misguided, job-killing public land orders.

This month, Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.) introduced a CRA resolution to nullify Biden’s pubilc land order in Minnesota. The House has passed that resolution, marking a decisive step toward lifting the Biden-era mining ban in northern Minnesota. In the previous Congress, the House passed a bill to revoke this order, but this resolution offers an even stronger solution. It would not only overturn Biden’s public land order, but it would also permanently bar any future administration from issuing a substantially similar order. And unlike most legislation, Congressional Review Act resolutions are not subject to a Senate filibuster.

Repealing the Biden-era land order would be a major victory for American consumers, domestic manufacturers and industries that rely on critical minerals. It would also reaffirm the Constitution’s separation of powers by restoring Congress’s role in major land-use decisions.

More broadly, passage of this CRA resolution should establish a critical precedent: that public land orders are rules subject to the CRA. That precedent would empower Congress to reexamine other harmful PLOs, including one that withdrew over 20,000 acres in South Dakota, known to have deposits of gold and other minerals.

Major policy decisions belong in Congress, not behind closed doors in the executive branch. The Congressional Review Act gives lawmakers a brief 60-day window to act. Now that the House has acted, the Senate must seize this opportunity and quickly approve the resolution and send it to the president’s desk. Passing the resolution offers a clear opportunity to restore economic opportunity, domestic production and the constitutional balance of power.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) on Saturday evening said that Democrats will block a major government funding package if it includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), calling the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis “appalling.”

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling — and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said in a statement.

“Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,” he warned.

Schumer blasted Senate and House Republicans for failing to include language in the Homeland Security spending bill to put constraints on ICE officers, who have been accused of using excessive force against protesters in Minneapolis.

He issued his remarks after law enforcement officials identified Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse and Minneapolis resident, as the man who was shot and killed by federal agents during an ICE operation Saturday morning.

“Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,” Schumer said.

Schumer’s statement came after liberal Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who is viewed as a potential primary challenger to Schumer in 2028, called on Senate Democrats to block ICE funding.

“Americans are being killed in the street by their government. Our Constitution is being shredded and our rights are dissolving. Resist. Senate Democrats should block ICE funding this week. Activate the National Guard. We can and must stop this,” she said.

She spoke out against ICE funding after Pretti’s fatal shooting by a Border Patrol Agent.

Senate Democrats are now scheduled to hold a caucus-wide conference call at 6 p.m. on Sunday to discuss their strategy for how to handle the government funding bills that need to pass by Jan. 30 to avoid a partial government shutdown.

Schumer’s new statement marks a significant shift in sentiment among senior Senate Democrats, who signaled last week that a six-bill appropriations package passed by the House would likely to pass the upper chamber by the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the most senior member of the Senate Democratic caucus, said in a statement last week that blocking funding for DHS would have little impact on ICE operations.

“ICE must be reined in, and unfortunately, neither a CR nor a shutdown would do anything to restrain it, because, thanks to Republicans, ICE is now sitting on a massive slush fund it can tap whether or not we pass a funding bill,” Murray said, referring to tens of billions of dollars allocated to ICE in the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law last year.

Murray argued that the “suggestion that a shutdown in this moment might curb the lawlessness of this administration is not rooted in reality.”

The House last week passed a rule to combine six different appropriations bills funding more than two-thirds of the federal government, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Labor, Education and Health and Human Services, into one package that was set to be fast-tracked on the Senate floor.

Several of those spending measures passed the House with strong bipartisan support while the bill funding Homeland Security passed more narrowly by a margin of 220 to 207. Only seven House Democrats voted for that measure, which also fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

Since, then a growing number of Senate Democrats have said they would vote against a government funding package that includes money for Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who has become a target of Democratic outrage over images of violent confrontations between ICE officers and protesters.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who is up for re-election in November, wrote Saturday on the social platform X.

“This brutal crackdown has to end,” he added. “I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

Sen. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) accused Noem of turning ICE “into an aggressive paramilitary force that terrorizes our communities, interferes with local policing and makes our communities less safe.”

“She has abused her authority — I will not support a funding bill that gives her a blank check to fund ICE’s inhumane tactics and excessive force,” he said in a Friday statement.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) on Friday called for Democrats to “insist” on adding language to the Homeland Security bill to require ICE officers to obtain arrest warrants before entering a target’s home and implement other reforms.

“I think there is an opportunity. Certainly, there’s an obligation to try to insist on conditions attached to these appropriations bills,” he said in an interview with MS NOW’s “Morning Joe.”

“I’m a ‘no’ vote on that spending bill unless there are conditions that require ICE to go to a judge to get a warrant as well as other constraints,” he said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/schumerchuck_010626gn12_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-25 01:57:18.479164

They have been eager to avoid another shutdown but have grown increasingly infuriated by the scenes of chaos and violence coming out of Minnesota and facing intense pressure not to fund ICE.
The House considered the homeland security portion separately, given the depth of Democratic opposition, and all but seven House Democrats voted against it.
That legislation largely contained tax cuts and spending reductions for programs including Medicaid and food assistance, but also included $190 billion for the Department of Homeland Security.
But a number of Senate Democrats said on Saturday that those measures fell far short of what was necessary in the current moment.","Bipartisan legislation to fund a broad swath of the government and avert a shutdown at the end of the week appeared to be in grave danger on Saturday, as key Senate Democrats vowed to oppose it after federal agents shot and killed a Minneapolis resident.

The rapidly escalating opposition to the measure, which includes $64.4 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including $10 billion for ICE, amplified the likelihood of a partial government shutdown at the end of the month. The legislation requires the support of Democrats to muster the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster and advance in the Senate.

“Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the D.H.S. funding bill is included,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in a statement, calling what is unfolding in Minnesota “appalling” and “unacceptable in any American city.”

Recognizing the depth of Democratic outrage, Senate Republicans immediately began examining whether they could separate the homeland security funding from the rest of the package and preserve the bulk of what had been a bipartisan deal to fund a large chunk of the government. The measure also funds the Pentagon and State Department, as well as health, education, labor and transportation programs.

“I’m exploring all options,” said Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who is the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, adding that she had been in touch with Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader. “We have five other bills that are really vital, and I’m relatively confident they would pass.”

A planned vote on the package next week had already promised to pose an agonizing dilemma for many Democrats. They have been eager to avoid another shutdown but have grown increasingly infuriated by the scenes of chaos and violence coming out of Minnesota and facing intense pressure not to fund ICE. Some had already announced they would not support the package as a result, but a substantial bloc had been expected to swallow their reservations and back it.

But hours after the killing on Saturday, a flood of Democrats who had previously been seen as likely to support the deal declared that they simply could not do so.

“The Trump administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement announcing her opposition. “They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement. This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe. It’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.”

Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote on social media: “I cannot and will not vote to fund D.H.S. while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

The spending measure that senators are set to take up includes six bills to fund the government that Democrats and Republicans negotiated, and that the House already passed.

The House considered the homeland security portion separately, given the depth of Democratic opposition, and all but seven House Democrats voted against it.

The measure rejects President Trump’s request for an $840 million increase in funding for ICE, instead leaving it roughly the same as the previous year, when the agency was operating off funds provided in a stopgap measure.

While other departments and agencies would most likely shutter if Senate Democrats filibuster the spending package, ICE could potentially tap the $75 billion Republicans allocated to it in their marquee domestic policy bill. That legislation largely contained tax cuts and spending reductions for programs including Medicaid and food assistance, but also included $190 billion for the Department of Homeland Security.

During negotiations on the homeland security bill, Republicans rejected a series of proposals by Democrats to rein in ICE, including barring funds from being used to to detain or deport U.S. citizens. Democrats succeeded in winning the addition of $20 million for purchasing body cameras for ICE agents.

They also won the inclusion of a provision to reduce funding for Ms. Noem’s office by $29.5 million and require the secretary to pay for any travel on government aircraft — in this case private jets the Coast Guard bought — out of the budget for her own office.

Ms. Collins, who called for an investigation into the shooting, noted that the spending measure also include some new guardrails on ICE, included money for de-escalation training and added authority for the agency’s inspector general to investigate disputed accounts of ICE activities. Those provisions would be lost if Congress ended up not approving the new bill, she said.

But a number of Senate Democrats said on Saturday that those measures fell far short of what was necessary in the current moment.

“I am voting against funding for D.H.S. until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a member of the Appropriations Committee. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory and making all of us less safe.”

Mr. Schumer also said he would vote no.

Outrage is growing in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, after ICE agents detained a 5-year-old boy named Liam Ramos and his father, who is an asylum seeker. Photos from the scene show a masked agent standing next to Liam, who was wearing his backpack and a blue winter hat with bunny ears. He had just returned from preschool. The father and son were then quickly sent to a detention facility in Texas.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis and defended ICE for targeting the boy’s father and detaining the preschooler.

Vice President JD Vance: “So, the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old. Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death?”

Local officials in Columbia Heights condemned the detention of 5-year-old Liam Ramos. Rachel James serves on the Columbia Heights City Council. She described efforts by neighbors to protect the boy.

Rachel James: “I heard one neighbor say, 'I live in this house. I'm part of this family. I can take him. Let him come to me.’ I heard another neighbor on the other side say, 'I have the forms. His mom signed the forms. Let me have him. I know him. I know him. … I kept saying, “Stop. Wait. He can go with us. He can go with the teachers.”' And then they took him over to the car, and he was just standing there. And then they quickly put him in the back seat and drove away.”

On Thursday, the lawyer for the Ramos family, Marc Prokosch, said Liam and his father had come to the U.S. in 2024 from Ecuador to seek asylum.

Marc Prokosch: “Liam and his dad did enter the United States at a port of entry to seek asylum through the CBP One app at the Brownsville border crossing. So they did everything right when they came in. They used the app. They made an appointment. They came to the border and presented themselves to Customs and Border Patrol. They’ve shared all of their information with the government, and they were following the process. They were just trying to secure safety and persecution for their family from their home country. But ICE didn’t care about the fact that they had those pending claims, and then just arrested them.”

In news from Gaza, Israeli tank shelling killed four Palestinians on Thursday. The killings came as President Trump was launching his so-called Board of Peace in Davos, Switzerland. At the ceremony, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner outlined his vision for turning Gaza into a glitzy seaside resort filled with futuristic high-rise buildings.

Jared Kushner: “In the Middle East, they build cities like this in — you know, 2-3 million people, they build this in three years. And so, stuff like this is very doable, if we make it happen.”

Kushner said the first phase of the project would be rebuilding the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which was leveled by Israel. The Rafah border crossing with Egypt is expected to reopen next week.

Many Palestinians fear Israel and the U.S. will move to forcibly displace them from Gaza. On Thursday, Israeli President Isaac Herzog met in Davos with the leader of Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region. Israel recently became the first nation to recognize Somaliland as an independent nation. There have been reports Israel wants to expel Palestinians en masse from Gaza to Somaliland.

This all comes as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive with little food or shelter. This is Mohammed Al-Qudra in Khan Younis speaking about Trump’s plan for Gaza.

Mohammed Al-Qudra: “No matter how much he says, it’s all in vain. Why? Because we, as citizens, aren’t seeing any real change on the ground. The suffering remains the same. Rain. There are no tents, no shelters, as you can see, the destruction. Wood, we don’t have that. … President Trump announced that the second phase had begun, but we haven’t seen anything. People in al-Mawasi are living in tents, displaced. People in the east can’t reach their homes. You can hear the shooting, the shelling, day and night, martyrs.”

The Wall Street Journal is reporting the Trump administration has been plotting ways to topple the Cuban government in the wake of the U.S. abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The Journal reports the U.S. is “searching for Cuban government insiders who can help cut a deal” to push out the current leadership.

On Thursday, The Guardian reported the U.S. used a similar model in Venezuela.

Cloud ICE clash.","ST. CLOUD. Minn. — At least 350 people gathered for about two hours from roughly 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Jan. 24, outside the Great River Regional Library in St. Cloud to protest against reportedly violent tactics being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Protesters gathered as a man was reportedly fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis on Saturday, according to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. DHS authorities say the man who was shot was armed.

On Jan. 7, Renee Good, 37, was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis. One week later, on Jan. 14 another man was shot in the leg by a federal agent, after three men reportedly used a broom handle and shovels on the agent.

Americans for Democracy, a St. Cloud-area grassroots group, helped organize Saturday's protest, according to founder Jill Kelly, who referenced the morning's shooting in an interview with the St. Cloud Times.

""People are enraged over what happened, (both with) this morning and what's been happening,"" Kelly said. ""It is unbelievable that it's happening in our state, and they're attacking us more so than any other state.""

While St. Cloud is a little more than an hour-drive north of the Twin Cities, where on Jan. 22, Vice President JD Vance said immigration enforcement is focused, Kelly said, immigration efforts impact the entire state. On Jan. 12 there was a clash between ICE agents and civilians that reportedly percipitated agents to use a chemical irritant on civilians. The crowd threw snowballs at agents during the St. Cloud confrontation.

""I think we've been seeing that (ICE presence) throughout the whole state,"" Kelly said. ""Pop-up protests are happening. People aren't gonna put up with this.""

Immigration enforcement also trickles down into local politics. Two St. Cloud City Council members introduced resolutions after the Jan. 12 St. Cloud ICE clash. Councilmember Hudda Ibrahim introduced a resolution to reaffirm the city's objective to be a welcoming place for all. Meanwhile, Councilmember Scott Brodeen proposed a resolution to support all law enforcement officers, including ICE, and the rule of law.

Those resolutions are slated for discussion at the council's Jan. 26 meeting.

Coleen Fitzgerald, dressed as a clown, drove to the St. Cloud protest from Milaca. She said her outfit resembles federal officials who she believes act foolishly. She held pictures of President Donald Trump, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Vance. The pictures were decorated by Fitzgerald to make the officials look like clowns.

""They were clowns before they got put in those offices, and they'll be clowns when they leave,"" Fitzgerald said. ""They're not people that are respected.""

While both Kelly and Fitzgerald oppose violent tactics used by ICE, they said, they support the deportation of criminals. However, both said, the tactics and methods of those deportations needs to be civil and humane.

""There's got to be some immigration enforcement, but it doesn't have to be done with the vitriol and the violence that they're doing now,"" Fitzgerald said.

Kelly had a similar sentiment, saying she wants to make sure due process is provided.

""I think most of us would agree that illegal immigrants that have committed serious crimes should not be in this country,"" she said. ""But there is a way to go about things. First of all, due process. That is our right.""

The legislation needs 60 votes to secure passage in the chamber, where Republicans control 53 seats. And a number of key Democrats who have voted for recent appropriations measures said they’ll vote against funding the Department of Homeland Security unless restrictions are put on how immigration officers carry out enforcement operations.

Follow live updates out of Minneapolis here.

The package, which has passed the House, is slated to come up for a Senate vote this week.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city. Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Saturday. “Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”

Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., who broke with her party and opposed its recent shutdown standoff over the Affordable Care Act, said she won’t support the DHS measure.

“The Trump Administration and Kristi Noem are putting undertrained, combative federal agents on the streets with no accountability. They are oppressing Americans and are at odds with local law enforcement,” Cortez Masto said in a statement. “This is clearly not about keeping Americans safe, it’s brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants. I will not support the current Homeland Security funding bill.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., who, like Rosen, was one of the eight Senate Democrats who voted to reopen the government in November, also came out against the DHS legislation.

“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen said in a statement. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., another one of the eight Democrats who voted for the November bill, came out against the current package one day before the Minnesota shooting. He said Congress shouldn’t validate a president who is “acting chaotically and unlawfully” and that he wants “significant amendment” to it.

Numerous Republican senators defended DHS after the killing of the man, identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse serving veterans.

But the department’s actions also sparked heavy criticism from Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, who negotiated funding package.

“This looks like an execution. There must be an investigation. There must be accountability,” Murray said on X. “Joining ICE does not give you license to murder. The President is escalating the situation—and I have no faith he will stop. The Republican Congress must join us to end this. Enough.”

The legislation funds ICE at current levels, but without the guardrails and restraints that Democrats had demanded on how immigration officers may carry out enforcement.

“I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a statement. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe.”

The non-DHS funding measures are less controversial and include various provisions that Democrats count as victories, including money for child care, mental health, housing assistance and Pell Grants. Some Democrats, including Cortez Masto, are calling for DHS money to be decoupled and voted on separately.

But there’s no indication that GOP leaders will do that. A spokesperson for Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said they will come up as one bill.

Another complication for Democrats is that Republicans passed a one-time infusion of $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including ICE, which would be legally available for the Trump administration to spend even if DHS funding lapses.

Republicans will need at least seven Democrats — probably eight, if Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., continues his streak of voting against appropriations bills — to pass any measure.

Additional Democrats who said they’ll oppose the DHS funding bill include Sens. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Mark Warner of Virginia.

Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) in a statement Saturday. “These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe.”

Schatz helped advance a funding bill in March, and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), who voted to end the 43-day shutdown in November, also both said Saturday that they will oppose the DHS funding bill.

“I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen said on X. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

The DHS bill passed the House Thursday 220-207, with only seven Democrats voting for it. But Republican House leaders merged it with five other bills funding the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services and State, among others, sending it to the Senate as one package.

More than half of the 47-member Democratic caucus has already vowed to oppose the package, many before Saturday’s shooting. And that number is growing as Democrats’ re-evaluate the legislation in the wake of the shooting and as they face pressure from House Democrats and their Senate colleagues, not to mention outside voices close to the party base.

Abdul El-Sayed, a Democratic candidate seeking a Senate seat in Michigan, said in an interview Saturday he saw no way for any Democrat to justify a vote for DHS funding.

“How many more people do they need to shoot?” he asked.

A group of senators, including Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), have been whipping colleagues for days to oppose the DHS bill, according to two aides granted anonymity to discuss their private effort. And two people familiar with the plans said House Democrats are scheduled to hold a private caucus call Sunday morning to discuss a response to the shooting.

Cortez Masto, in a statement, suggested dropping the Department of Homeland Security bill from the larger package, noting there is a “bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget.”

“Let’s pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans’ constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement’s essential role to keep us safe,” she said.

Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said he would agree to “immediately pass” the other five bills while providing “short term funding for DHS so the Senate can fully debate and vote on common sense reforms to ICE that bolster the rule of law.”

But stripping out the DHS bill before the Friday deadline would require every senator to agree — something Republicans aren’t likely to be able to get. Any changes to the package, meanwhile, will require sending it back to the House, which has already left town until after the shutdown deadline.

Instead, Republicans believe it’s up to Democrats to decide whether or not to vote against the funding package and avoid a partial shutdown. GOP leaders aren’t currently expected to bring the House back early from its break, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy.

Democratic aides, meanwhile, privately acknowledged Saturday that the odds of a shutdown were rising, though some questioned what alternatives are available if Democrats block the pending six-bill package.

Heading into the weekend, some Democrats acknowledged they were conflicted — including Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a senior appropriator who has championed Congress’ ability to use the spending bills to reverse many of Trump’s foreign aid cuts.

“I don’t know the details of exactly what the language is in the Homeland Security bills in terms of trying to hold ICE accountable and trying to minimize their misconduct, and I don’t know whether it is worse to have a continuing resolution and how that might be misused,” Coons told reporters Friday.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F47%2F26%2F1beb046d49468116fc0a3e55f93f%2Fu-s-congress-30162.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 20:57:41.714199

US President Donald Trump on Saturday urged Minnesota officials to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to operate freely, warning that the state would face more severe consequences if it is not cleared of undocumented immigrants.

“Let our ICE patriots do their job! 12,000 illegal alien criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. He warned that those still in the state would create “something far worse than you are witnessing today.”

Trump’s comments came hours after a US Border Patrol officer shot and killed an armed individual wanted for “violent assault” during a targeted operation in Minneapolis.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara identified the man as a 37-year-old white American citizen with only traffic violations on record. Authorities said he was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.

Trump said federal agents were deployed to Minnesota because of what he described as “massive monetary fraud, with billions of dollars missing” under Democratic border policies.

He questioned why local police failed to protect federal officers and accused Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of “inciting insurrection” through their public statements. Trump described the unfolding events as a “cover-up” for what he alleged were stolen public funds.

Vance, Bondi blame Minnesota officials

US Vice President JD Vance and Attorney General Pam Bondi also placed blame on Minnesota’s leadership for the fatal shooting, saying state and city officials refused to cooperate with federal authorities.

“When I visited Minnesota, what the ICE agents wanted more than anything was to work with local law enforcement so that situations on the ground didn’t get out of hand,” Vance said. He added that Minneapolis leadership “has so far refused to answer those requests.”

Bondi told Fox News that the Justice Department sent Gov. Walz “a very strong letter” demanding that he “better support President Trump.”

She claimed the shooting occurred because Minneapolis officials had declared the city a sanctuary jurisdiction, alleging that undocumented immigrants were drawn there for protection.

Tensions have escalated in Minnesota amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, following allegations of large-scale fraud linked to publicly subsidized day care centers. State and local officials have denied the claims.

The situation further deteriorated after the ICE-related operation resulted in the fatal shooting of an American citizen.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) wrote on the social platform X.

“Trump’s endless empowerment of federal immigration agents has resulted in yet another senseless killing,” Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) wrote on the social platform X. “This brutal crackdown has to end. I cannot and will not vote to fund DHS while this administration continues these violent federal takeovers of our cities.”

On Saturday morning, a Minneapolis resident was shot and killed during an alleged “armed struggle” with Border Patrol agents, just a block from where 37-year-old Renee Good was fatally shot in her SUV by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer Jonathan Ross. In another incident, a Venezuelan migrant was shot in the leg after federal officials claimed he struck an officer with a “shovel or broom stick.”

Days prior, seven House Democrats joined with nearly all Republicans to pass a sweeping $64.4 billion funding bill, which includes roughly $10 billion for ICE. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was the lone GOP congressman to vote against the measure.

It passed over the objections of Democratic leaders, who argued it did not do enough to rein in ICE operations and the conduct of officers.

The measure did contain a few targeted reforms, including a reduction in funding for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, a decrease in ICE detention beds and a cut in Border Patrol funding, in an attempt to placate Democrats.

But following Saturday’s shooting in Minneapolis, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) stated bluntly she was a “hell no” on the bill.

“I’m a hell no — not a penny more for ICE. We should not fund this terror,” she wrote on X.

The senators’ comments came after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) urged her Democratic colleagues on Saturday to oppose the bill when it comes to the floor for a vote next week.

“We have a responsibility to protect Americans from tyranny,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on X.

“DHS just shot a man in broad daylight two weeks after they shot a mother in the face without consequence. They need our votes to continue. We cannot give it to them. Every Senator should vote NO,” she continued.

Anger has already been growing over the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics in the wake of several shootings involving federal agents in Minnesota this month, which have sparked widespread protests.

Saturday’s incident comes as senators are set to decide next week whether to send a package of funding bills, including the DHS bill, to President Trump’s desk as they race to avert a partial government shutdown.

That effort now seems more fraught amid an impending winter storm that has canceled votes for Monday and signs of opposition from Democrats.

Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) also said Saturday she would not support the measure, arguing it was time to “fight back.”

“As a member of the U.S. Senate, I have the responsibility to hold the Trump Administration accountable when I see abuses of power — like we are seeing from ICE right now,” Rosen wrote. “That is why I’ll be voting against any government funding package that contains the bill that funds this agency, until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) joined the fray, writing on X that he will vote against funding DHS “until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable.”

“These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory, and making all of us less safe,” he concluded.

A Democratic National Committee (DNC) X account aimed its ire at White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who earlier in the day accused critics of defending a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/warnermark_010626gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-24 21:57:34.437949

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, described the man who was shot Saturday as a “gunman” and suggested a cover-up by Minnesota Democrats.
OF MINNESOTA!” Trump wrote in a separate post.
“If you obstruct a law enforcement officer or assault a law enforcement officer, you are in violation of the law and will be arrested,” he added.
During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face.","“A would-be assassin tried to murder federal law enforcement and the official Democrat account sides with the terrorists,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller wrote on X Saturday, referring to a tweet from the Democratic National Committee about the shooting that stated “Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW.”

Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota focused her anger on ICE, posting on social media: “This appears to be an execution by immigration enforcement. I am absolutely heartbroken, horrified, and appalled that federal agents murdered another member of our community.”

In Saturday morning’s shooting, a 37-year-old man was shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis who claimed he approached federal officers with a 9 mm gun but didn’t specify if he was holding or brandishing the weapon. Various videos of the incident appear to show the man holding a phone.

Minneapolis has emerged as the epicenter of the debate over the Trump administration’s immigration actions and deployment of federal agents. It came to a head after a federal agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman, Renee Good, earlier this month in an incident that has sparked weeks of demonstrations in the city and fights between the White House and state officials over who would investigate the shootings.

Trump, in a post on Truth Social, described the man who was shot Saturday as a “gunman” and suggested a cover-up by Minnesota Democrats. The Justice Department has subpoenaed several Democratic Minneapolis state officials, including Gov. Tim Walz, who called the DOJ’s subpoena a “partisan distraction.”

“AMONG OTHER THINGS, THIS IS A ‘COVER UP’ FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE ONCE GREAT STATE (BUT SOON TO BE GREAT AGAIN!) OF MINNESOTA!” Trump wrote in a separate post.

Trump also assailed Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, and Walz in the first Saturday post, accusing them of “inciting Insurrection, with their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”

U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino told reporters at a Saturday press conference that the incident “looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,” though he didn’t provide any evidence for his claim.

“If you obstruct a law enforcement officer or assault a law enforcement officer, you are in violation of the law and will be arrested,” he added. “Our law enforcement officers take an oath to protect the public.”

Video of the shooting, posted on social media and verified by The New York Times, shows the 37-year-old man appearing to film agents in Minneapolis on Saturday before they push him and several others back. The videos don’t appear to show the man drawing his weapon, but not all angles are accounted for. During a struggle with the man on the ground, an agent fires several shots, then the group of federal agents back away.

The man, identified by the Minneapolis Star Tribune as Alex Pretti, had a legal permit to carry a firearm, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara, who spoke during a press conference Saturday.

Bovino told reporters that “an individual approached U.S. Border Patrol agents with a nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun. The agents attempted to disarm the individual, but he violently resisted. Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, a border patrol agent fired defensive shots.” But when asked by a reporter when the individual drew his firearm, Bovino said the shooting is still under investigation.

The latest POLITICO Poll illustrates just how sharply views of ICE — and its presence in cities across the country — diverge along partisan lines. A majority of voters who backed Trump in 2024 — 57 percent — say risks to the lives of anti-ICE protestors are a price worth paying to carry out immigration enforcement, compared with just 15 percent of voters who backed former Vice President Kamala Harris.

By contrast, nearly three-quarters of Harris voters — 71 percent — say it is not worth risking the lives of anti-ICE protesters to conduct immigration enforcement, a view shared by just 31 percent of Trump voters, the poll, conducted from Jan. 16 to 19, found.

The divide extends to perceptions of public safety: 64 percent of Trump voters say ICE agents make U.S. cities safer, while 80 percent of Harris voters say the opposite, that their presence is making them more dangerous.

Democrats also used heated language to describe the shooting. During a Democratic Senate primary debate in Texas on Saturday, state Rep. James Talarico raised the Minneapolis shooting, saying: “ICE shot a mother in the face. ICE kidnapped a 5-year-old boy. ICE executed a man in broad daylight on our streets just this morning. It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

His opponent, Rep. Jasmine Crockett, also weighed in: “This is the fifth-highest funded military force in the entire world. And what are they doing? They’re killing people in the middle of the street.”

Walz on Saturday urged the federal government to allow Minnesota officials to take control of the probe into the shooting. He told reporters that he said to the White House in an early morning call that “the federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period.”

“As I said last week, this federal occupation of Minnesota long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement,” Walz said at a press conference Saturday. “It’s a campaign of organized brutality against the people of our state. And today, that campaign claimed another life. I’ve seen the videos from several angles. And it’s sickening.”

When asked for comment, the White House referred POLITICO to Trump’s Truth Social post and to a post on X from the Department of Homeland Security, which claimed, “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted.”

They did not respond to requests to questions as to what evidence showed the man who was shot was a “terrorist.”

Vice President JD Vance also placed the blame of Saturday’s shooting at Minnesota leaders’ feet, saying their unwillingness to work with immigration enforcement agents was the primary reason for the shooting.

The National Weather Service’s Winter Storm Severity Index on Saturday afternoon displayed expected “extreme impacts” in northern Mississippi and “major impacts” in Washington, D.C., and surrounding states.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser implemented a state of emergency for the district on Friday, which went into effect on Saturday at noon. Several state governors also issued emergency declarations at the end of the week in preparation for the winter storm.

In her emergency order, Bowser noted an expected snowfall rate of 2-3 inches per hour and low temperatures “expected to have serious widespread effects.”

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced Friday afternoon that federal offices in the Washington, D.C., area will be closed on Monday, with “maximum telework” in effect.

“We hope that everyone stays safe (and warm) over the weekend,” OPM Director Scott Kupor wrote on X.

Up on Capitol Hill, the Senate postponed its first votes until Tuesday due to the storm, narrowing the already-tight deadline to negotiate and pass a minibus funding bill to avert a government shutdown.

The House approved the Republican-backed funding package on Thursday with the support of seven House Democrats.

The funding measure consists of six separate spending bills and needs the support of at least eight Democrats in order to pass in the Senate. Legislators have until Friday to pass the legislation or face the government shutting down.

Snow delays on Capitol Hill are rare but not unprecedented. The “Snowmageddon” blizzard in February of 2010 dumped feet of snow on D.C. and the surrounding states, grinding congressional activity to a halt for multiple days because lawmakers could not physically get to the U.S. Capitol.

Outside of D.C., the White House has also begun preparations for responses from federal agencies to the winter storm’s impact across several states.

President Trump approved emergency declarations for an additional 10 states to receive assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Saturday. The included states are Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana and West Virginia.

The Trump administration had previously approved South Carolina and Virginia’s requests.

“We are working closely with FEMA, Governors, and State Emergency Management teams to ensure the safety of everybody,” Trump, who is expected to remain in the District, posted on Truth Social on Saturday. “Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!”

FEMA said in a Saturday morning report that its National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) has currently categorized conditions at a “Level 3,” the lowest-level disaster response, which requires “a moderate amount of direct federal assistance.”

Additionally, the agency said in the report that the departments of Energy, Health and Human Services (HHS) and Transportation are preparing to assist with the federal response.

The unjust death of the 37-year-old man is yet another example of an extremely disturbing violent pattern associated with the Trump administration’s lawless and aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

This killing comes a little over two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Good, whose family has yet to be delivered justice, answers or accountability. Sadly, these two deadly incidents are not isolated. Back in December, Keith Porter, a 43-year-old father, was also killed by an off-duty ICE agent in Los Angeles, California.

In response to this horrific incident, Voto Latino issued the following statement:

“What happened in Minneapolis today is unacceptable. Another life has been lost during a reckless federal immigration operation. Two people, both 37 years old, have been killed within weeks of each other in the same city. We are witnessing an unprecedented pattern of excessive and deadly force being used against our own communities.

Instead of tamping down the chaos and state of uncertainty, the Trump administration continues to double down on its excessive and deadly use of force, distortion of facts, and the weaponization of the justice system. When federal agents are deployed into residential neighborhoods with little oversight and sweeping authority, people are put in harm’s way.

The people of Minneapolis have the right to demand ICE out of their neighborhoods, and accountability from the leaders who’ve led us to these conditions. We demand that there be an immediate and independent investigation into what happened today. The Trump administration has failed to protect another human life, and we urge Congress to impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem immediately.”

Judges decline to order lower court to approve charges

Defendants allege retaliation amid Trump's immigration crackdown

WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.

The ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.

A federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants for five proposed defendants, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.

DEFENDANTS ACCUSE ADMINISTRATION OF RETALIATION

The case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed to protect Christian services.

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.

The Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing a risk of similar church disruptions.

The chief U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request as ""unheard of in our district"" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.

All three judges on the 8th Circuit panel agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.

The Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.

Rights watchdog warns International Protection Bill ‘still riddled with gaps’

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC) has delivered a sharp critique of the International Protection Bill 2026, published earlier this month. In a submission released last night, the Commission says the draft law ""lacks clarity on access to legal advice, vulnerability assessments and safeguards for victims of trafficking.""

IHREC welcomes the Government’s aim of cutting average asylum decision times to six months but argues that speed cannot trump fairness: mandatory interviews conducted in ‘integrated reception centres’ will, it fears, pressure applicants who have not yet secured legal representation. The body also questions proposed restrictions on applicants’ freedom of movement, warning that any de-facto detention must meet strict proportionality tests under EU law.

More information is available at https://www.visahq.com/ireland/.

For employers, the Bill’s promise of faster decisions could ease uncertainty when recruiting asylum-seekers who later become eligible for work permits. Yet NGOs caution that rushed procedures risk higher appeal rates, prolonging cases and clogging courts.

Justice officials insist the text transposes the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum and that “all applicants will continue to receive free legal aid.” The Bill is expected to reach second stage in the Dáil next month; mobility teams should monitor amendments closely, as final provisions will determine time-lines for labour-market access and potential reporting obligations for sponsors of protection applicants.

International law is unequivocal on this point.”","It’s a dubious distinction for a country long rooted in democracy.

As the world marks the Day of the Endangered Lawyer today, the coalition behind the observance has designated the United States as the focus country for 2026.

Every year, the International Coalition for the Day of the Endangered Lawyer, made up of legal associations, bar associations, and networks of legal defenders, selects a country to concentrate attention on the specific challenges lawyers there face and build awareness of the serious risks they’re confronting simply for doing their job.

In its annual report, released Thursday, the Coalition said this year’s selection is “grounded in serious concern over the documented and escalating pattern of interference with the independence of lawyers, law firms, bar associations, prosecutors, and judges in the United States.”

These developments raise profound questions regarding compliance with international legal standards governing the role and protection of lawyers, as well as the functioning of the justice system, it noted.

The United States now joins the ranks of dictatorships and autocracies like Belarus, China, Iran and Afghanistan, which have been countries of focus in the past.

“Let that sink in,” Nancy Hollander, an internationally recognized US criminal defence lawyer, said in November at the International Bar Association conference in Toronto. She was part of a panel discussing the assault on independent lawyering around the world.

“We’re in a terrible situation. We have an authoritarian fascist dictatorship. There’s no getting around it. No one can say that’s not where we are.”

‘A climate of fear’

Since the Trump administration took office in January 2025, it has targeted lawyers and firms it perceives to be opposed to its agenda based on their current or past legal representation, or pro bono work.

This has involved executive orders naming firms and exerting pressure on them through “compliance arrangements,” raising concerns about coerced alignment and the erosion of professional independence.

There have also been threats to revoke security clearances and cancel federal contracts, as well as questioning and harassment of lawyers at border crossings and attacks on bar associations. Further, there’s been a chilling effect on legal representation in sensitive areas such as immigration, civil liberties and LGBTI+ rights.

Judicial independence is under attack amid a barrage of politicized criticism of judges, including threats of removal, calls for impeachment, and efforts to delegitimize unfavourable rulings. On top of the creeping executive interference, politicized criticism has led to increased threats of physical violence against judges and their families.

“Taken together, these measures do not constitute isolated incidents. They form a pattern that creates a climate of fear, uncertainty, and anticipatory self-censorship within the legal profession, discouraging lawyers from taking on cases, clients, or arguments that may attract political or administrative retaliation,” the Coalition said in its report.

Members were alarmed by the “sustained and co-ordinated campaign aimed at undermining the independence of the legal profession and the judiciary.”

The Coalition noted that this year’s focus on the United States does not suggest that attacks on lawyers are new or unique there. However, there is a “troubling pattern of political intimidation and institutional destabilization unprecedented in the modern history of the US.” The Coalition said this escalation in pressure demands collective international attention.

It also underscores the fact that no matter how entrenched the rule of law may be, no jurisdiction is immune to backsliding.

The work of Margaret Satterthwaite, the UN special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, influenced the Coalition’s decision to focus on the United States. An independent monitor of how legal professionals are treated around the world, she’s raised concerns about what’s been happening south of the border.

“What happened after the second Trump presidency began was that I started to see some emblematic signs of what I would call autocratization,” she told the CBA’s Verdicts & Voices podcast in November.

Hollander, who has represented Chelsea Manning and several Guantanamo Bay detainees, said the Trump administration has turned the Department of Justice into the Department of Retaliation.

That’s seen scores of government lawyers fired for being a part of prosecutions against Trump over the January 6 attack on the Capitol and other alleged crimes.

“They’re taking the brunt of this,” she said.

“It’s (now) his personal law firm.”

Among those targeted in what’s been described as a “campaign of retribution” are Jack Smith, former special counsel and New York attorney general Letitia James.

“This is only the beginning,” Hollander said, noting many lawyers can no longer even get into public buildings and courtrooms.

“I’ve represented a lot of people who’ve had their clearance taken away.”

What’s unfolding has seen lawyers mobilize south of the border. Hollander pointed to the newly formed Lawyers for the Rule of Law.

“We are a national network of volunteer attorneys committed to defending democracy and the rule of law—especially when those in power fail to do so,” the group says on its website.

In addition to pro bono representation, members are providing amicus advocacy, holding leaders and public officials accountable for unethical and illegal activities, providing public education, and organizing peaceful protests.

Beyond borders

Often, it’s not the government in the country where they practice that a lawyer has to worry about.

Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, an Irish barrister specializing in human rights and civil liberties, told the IBA panel that authoritarian regimes seek to silence critics wherever they are in the world through transnational repression.

Increasingly, the law is used as a systematic tool to shut down the rule of law and freedom of expression through direct, online and remote threats, the cancellation of passports, co-opting other countries to join them, coercion, and physical surveillance.

She’s been followed around the United Nations, and as a result of her representing jailed Hong Kong pro-democracy activist and media mogul Jimmy Lai, she’s been targeted by China. This has included surveillance, threats on her life, and threats of rape. The latter extended to her children.

Gallagher said that more lawyers are being killed than journalists in the Philippines for the work they’re doing. And as soon as a lawyer takes on a case against Iran or Saudi Arabia, they’re targeted.

“It’s an anywhere in the world problem,” she said of the length of a state’s arm.

“Nowhere is safe if you’re a lawyer.”

Here in Canada, Irwin Cotler knows this all too well.

The former MP and justice minister has long been an outspoken critic of the regime in Tehran, and started campaigning in 2008 to have the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps listed as a terrorist entity (which didn’t happen until 2024). His work as a human rights advocate and lawyer, representing Iranian dissidents, put him in Iran’s crosshairs.

“I remember the date exactly, November 14, 2023, because I was flying back from Washington. We landed at Trudeau airport in Montreal, and we received notice from the RCMP as soon as we landed: ‘Don't leave, wait for us at the baggage counter.’”

Officers met him, took him to a room and told him they had evidence of an “imminent and lethal threat” on his life.

From then on, he had 24/7 protection — four armoured cars outside his house at all times and armed RCMP officers with him everywhere he went.

Cotler says the threat wasn’t surprising. He’d had issues with Iran for 20 years at that point, and knew from friends there that the regime characterized him as an enemy of the people.

In October 2024, he was informed of a plot to assassinate him within 48 hours. He was supposed to attend the 60th anniversary of his McGill law class that evening, and in the morning, the RCMP told him all seemed okay. Later in the day, they told him he couldn’t go.

“I said I'd really been looking forward to this. And they said, ‘No, we have new information about an imminent threat of assassination on your life within the next 24 to 48 hours. So you can't go.’ And I didn't go.”

In recent months, Cotler’s level of protection has been reduced, as the threat was perceived to not be as great as it had been.

“I laughed,” he said.

“I told them I’m happy to have it lowered because it was a little cumbersome to have so many people around when there are other people who need protection. But I follow Iran very closely, and it’s the other way around. Iran has been intensifying its transnational repression and assassinations. CSIS came out with a report recently that said exactly that.”

While no longer under 24-hour protection, he still has security accompanying him everywhere he goes.

So what have the last few years been like, knowing he’s at risk?

“You just factor it in to your lifestyle. You know that if you want to go somewhere, you have to notify the RCMP and give them two hours' notice so they can come pick you up and take you where you need to go. And after a while, you just know that that’s the reality you live with it.”

Cotler said his situation should be seen as a wake-up call. Iran has sleeper cells in Canada, along with a critical mass of repression and targets, including journalists, lawyers, dissidents, and leaders of the diaspora. While Russia and China also engage in transnational repression, he says Iran takes it a step further with assassination.

“The phenomenon of transnational repression and assassination means that we have to take the necessary measures here,” he said.

“This is a standing threat to our national security, and we have to take it seriously.”

A wide and well-documented trend

Cotler is the international chair of the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, one of 13 organizations worldwide that are expressing deep alarm at the growing repression of lawyers for the legitimate exercise of their professional duties.

“Attacks on lawyers strike at the very heart of the rule of law, deny victims meaningful access to justice, and enable wider assaults on human rights and democratic institutions,” the groups said in a statement marking the International Day of the Endangered Lawyer.

From state capture of bar associations, systemic government oppression, politically motivated prosecutions and imprisonment for defending state opponents, reputational smears through propaganda, and forced disappearances, authoritarian regimes are deliberately targeting lawyers. The groups are calling out Russia, China, Iran, Afghanistan, Tanzania, and Turkey, among others, for what’s become a wide and well-documented trend.

“Lawyers are disbarred, disciplined, arbitrarily detained, prosecuted, forced into exile, subjected to surveillance and harassment, and in some cases killed, precisely because they seek to uphold the rights of their clients, including human rights defenders, opposition leaders, journalists, women, minorities, and other marginalized communities,” the statement said.

“Despite this, lawyers continue to perform a crucial function. Even in countries without an independent and impartial judiciary, where judicial outcomes are largely predetermined, lawyers document abuses, create records of testimonies and verdicts, and preserve evidence that can one day support accountability.”

While justice is never won easily, it cannot be won at all if those who defend it are left defenceless, the group says, which is why it is calling on states to end all forms of persecution, retaliation and harassment against lawyers for their professional activities, and immediately release all lawyers detained or imprisoned for representing clients or peacefully exercising their own rights.

In May 2025, after a decade of work, the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe introduced the first international treaty aimed at safeguarding lawyers from threats, harassment, and undue interference in their work.

The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of the Profession of Lawyer currently has 25 signatories.

“It’s the first internationally binding instrument to defend the legal profession,” Thierry Wickers, past president of the CCBE, told the IBA panel in November.

“It’s a recognition of the place and role we play in a democratic society.”

He noted that any country in the world can sign it, and that there is monitoring to ensure it’s correctly applied in countries that have added their names.

Of course, the convention is only effective if governments give it force. That’s why the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and other organizations are calling on countries to sign, ratify, and fully implement it.

“We encourage states in other regions to develop complementary binding standards so that protection of the legal profession becomes a universal norm.”

After all, as the Coalition makes clear in its report, the independence of the legal profession is not a professional privilege.

“It is a cornerstone of the rule of law and a prerequisite for access to justice, fair trial guarantees, and the effective protection of human rights. International law is unequivocal on this point.”",https://nationalmagazine.ca/MediaGallery/NM/NationalMagazine/Banners/Big%20Box/desktop_cotler.png?ext=.png,N,,2026-01-24 19:58:41.012577

A 5-year-old boy and his father who were detained by immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota are now being held at the South Texas Family Detention Center in Dilley, roughly 70 miles southwest of San Antonio, according to attorneys and members of Congress.

The transfer has drawn growing national attention, with lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates calling for the child’s release while federal officials defend the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

San Antonio Congressman Joaquin Castro said his office has been pressing federal authorities for information and urging ICE to release the boy.

“My staff and I have been working to make sure that this young boy is safe and to demand his release by ICE,” Castro said in a video posted to social media. He also criticized what he described as a lack of transparency from immigration officials.

Concerns about transparency intensified this week after U.S. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he was denied entry to the Dilley facility while attempting to conduct congressional oversight. Murphy said federal authorities blocked his visit despite providing advance notice.

“Members of Congress have a constitutional right to inspect these facilities, and a clear statutory right as well,” Murphy said in a statement. “The fact they denied me access even with 24 hours’ notice should make everybody deeply fearful of what is happening inside this facility and facilities like it.”

School officials and community leaders in Minnesota have also raised concerns about the circumstances surrounding the boy’s detention, saying the incident caused distress among children and families in the community.

The Department of Homeland Security rejected claims that the child was targeted or used as part of an enforcement tactic. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE agents were attempting to arrest the boy’s father, not the child.

“ICE did not target a child,” McLaughlin said in a statement posted on X. She said agents approached the father, who then ran, leaving his son behind. According to McLaughlin, one officer remained with the five-year-old “to ensure his safety” while other agents apprehended the father.

McLaughlin also disputed claims that the child was used to lure anyone from the home, calling those accounts “categorically false.” She said ICE officers are instructed to prioritize child safety during enforcement actions and that parents are typically given options during custody decisions.

“Parents are given the choice to remain with their children or designate a safe caregiver,” McLaughlin said, adding that keeping families together in detention is intended to avoid separation during immigration proceedings.

DHS officials have said the boy’s mother was not detained during the enforcement action. Advocates, however, say separating a child from one parent and transferring the family hundreds of miles away still raises serious concerns about trauma, access to legal counsel, and the well-being of young children.

Demonstrators demanded the withdrawal of 3,000 federal officers sent by the Trump administration.

Separate protests at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport and a federal building led to over 100 arrests.

Tens of thousands of Minnesotans marched in downtown Minneapolis Friday, Jan. 23, in a negative 30 degree windchill to protest the federal government’s continuing surge of immigration enforcement — demanding civil rights and a withdrawal of the 3,000 officers sent here by the administration of President Donald Trump.

The demonstration took place on “ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth & Freedom,” a general strike supported by Minnesota unions, progressive faith leaders and community activists. Proponents encouraged all Minnesotans to stay home from work, school and refrain from shopping — disruptions of normal orders of business to protest the presence of federal immigration agents in Minnesota.

The massive protest began at The Commons Park at 2 p.m. in Minneapolis. The march ended with a rally at Target Center.

Natasha Dockter, the first vice president of the Minneapolis Federation of Educators’ teachers chapter, handed out hand warmers to demonstrators at The Commons alongside other teachers.

“I’m out here today because what’s going on in our city is completely and totally unacceptable. It’s impacting the lives of our students and their families that we serve,” Dockter said.

Sergey Goro and Ben Daniel were visiting the Twin Cities from San Francisco and Seattle for the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships, which was delayed due to the extreme cold.

Goro said that he’d been to No Kings protests — demonstrations against the Trump administration’s authoritarian policies — in San Francisco, but that they weren’t as large as the Minneapolis protest.

Daniel agreed: “We can really feel that everyone’s on board here — that this is ridiculous and it’s gotta stop.”

Daniela Morales, 16, carrying a Mexican flag, said her parents are both Mexican immigrants and that she attended the protest on behalf of people who can’t speak out.

“I’m really glad to see everybody come out and support each other and our neighbors and fight against the administration,” Morales said.

Other ICE protests in Minneapolis led to arrests

A morning protest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport led to the arrests of roughly 100 clergy by MSP and Bloomington law enforcement Friday, according to a statement from protest organizers.

Demonstrators at the airport were standing or kneeling on the roadway outside Terminal 1’s departures area and led away by law enforcement.

Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said in an email that the airport “worked in advance with event organizers to best accommodate their right to freedom of expression while also ensuring uninterrupted operations.”

“When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1,” Lea wrote. Lea confirmed there were around 100 arrests.

At least one demonstrator was also arrested at the nearby Whipple Federal Building, where federal agents deployed chemical irritants into a crowd of protestors, the Star Tribune reported. Around noon, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had given three dispersal orders for protestors to unblock an access road at the building. The Whipple Building, now a base for federal immigration operations, has been an ongoing site of protests.

Over 700 businesses closed Friday to support the “ICE Out” day, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the demonstration’s website states.

Over a dozen churches across Minnesota announced prayer vigils to “mourn, pray and plant seeds of hope with one another,” according to ISAIAH, the nonprofit coalition of Minnesota faith and community groups.

Dozens of school districts across the state closed Friday because of the dangerously cold temperatures. Minneapolis Public Schools were already planned to be closed Friday for a teacher record-keeping day.","https://www.sctimes.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/24/PSTC/88328580007-mega-ice.jpg?crop=2047,1153,x0,y191&width=2047&height=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-24 15:58:48.899659

""She has asked for answers about the legal bases for these actions and about how ICE is prioritizing its activities to target what it calls ‘the worst of the worst.’”

DHS agents have arrested more than 100 people on a target list of 1,400 immigrants since the ICE surge began on Tuesday, the agency said, focusing on metropolitan Portland and Lewiston, the state’s largest and most diverse cities.

Neither DHS nor ICE have explained why individuals are on the Maine immigrant target list, including whether they have outstanding deportation orders or pending criminal charges, if they are suspected of entering the country illegally, have pending asylum applications, have applied for or received work permits, or other reasons.

RELATED: DHS confirms ICE activity in Maine, launches 'Operation Catch of the Day'

DHS has described its ""Operation: Catch of the Day"" as “an immigration enforcement effort across the state of Maine targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.”

Collins has asked for “an explanation of ICE’s reported policy change allowing agents to enter residences with only an administrative warrant, though we have not yet seen reports of this occurring in Maine,” according to Kernen.

Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told reporters on Thursday that an internal ICE memo that purportedly justifies warrantless home searches is “blatantly unconstitutional.”

Gov. Janet Mills, a former county district attorney and state attorney general, told reporters on Thursday she has asked for warrants.

“What I've asked for, if they have warrants, show the warrants. In my experience, you've got to get a judicial warrant to arrest somebody,” she said.

Collins believes that “people who are in this country legally should not be targets of ICE investigations,"" according to Kernen.

Collins has also previously stated this.

Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said a proposed annual funding bill for DHS scheduled for Senate debate next week includes $20 million for body cameras and $2 million for de-escalation training, which she supports.

Citing the funding to supply Border Patrol and ICE agents with body cameras and train them in de-escalation tactics, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), whose 2nd Congressional District includes Lewiston, was one of seven Democrats to vote for the $64 billion DHS budget in the House of Representatives when it passed 220-207 on Thursday.

“Failure to fund DHS would undermine public safety and emergency response services. To me, that was never an option,” Golden said in a written statement. “By engaging in the process, rather than blocking it, we secured funding for body cameras and de-escalation training — two proven tactics embraced by law enforcement agencies across the country — that I believe will support responsible law enforcement and begin to restore trust.”

Besides ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), the bill also funds the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard, and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Golden has offered qualified support for the ICE operation in Maine.

“Federal law enforcement agencies have the right and responsibility to enforce federal laws, including immigration laws, and a targeted law enforcement operation focused on individuals who have engaged in criminal activity serves the public interest,” Golden said in a written statement after the first three days of stepped-up ICE activity. “Immigrants with legal status should not be targeted, court authorities should be obeyed, and due process must be followed.”

Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), whose 1st Congressional District includes Portland, voted against the DHS budget and is denouncing the ICE activity and demanding “a full accounting” from the agency.

“Enforcement actions that result in hundreds of individuals being abducted, serious and numerous apparent violations of due process rights, and widespread fear in immigrant communities require immediate, forthright answers,” Pingree wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday.

“I am also outraged by multiple reports from Maine indicating that ICE agents engaged in brazenly intimidating and threatening behavior toward bystanders and local residents,” Pingree continued. “You state that you are no longer allowing American citizens to be terrorized, yet that is exactly what your agents are doing: terrorizing everyday Americans for practicing their legal rights.”

Pingree also said to Noem that branding the ICE surge as ""Operation: Catch of the Day"" is “dehumanizing, offensive, and wholly inappropriate for a federal law enforcement action involving real people, families, and communities.”

King told also told reporters Thursday that the “DHS budget is on the docket for next week in Washington, and I know that there are discussions going on right now and negotiations about what is going to be in that bill and how it will either facilitate or restrain the activities of ICE.”

King, Pingree, and Mills, who is running to unseat Collins in this year’s Senate race, have expressed frustration that DHS is keeping them in the dark about the ongoing ICE operation.

“Susan Collins could pick up the phone and get some answers, I am sure,” Mills said in an interview on MSNOW on Friday night. “I call upon Susan Collins to use her seniority and her power, of which she brags so often, as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, to put a hold, to curtail further funding for ICE and Homeland Security until questions are answered, until they put a stop to this abusive behavior towards Maine people, towards Americans who are here lawfully present and just doing their job—paying taxes, contributing to our communities, raising families here.”

Videos of confrontations between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Minneapolis residents have flooded social media, showing some of the 3,000 officers who are deployed in the city stopping, questioning and detaining residents.

In one case, immigration agents escorted a U.S. citizen who is a grandfather of Hmong ancestry out of his house in his underwear in freezing weather. In another case, a father of a 5-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a U.S. citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a 5-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.

The events have sparked protests and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain you? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public versus a private space, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?

Legal experts weighed in on the public's constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.

What rights do people have when approached by ICE?

Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone — including immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment.

""All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,"" said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specializing in immigration cases.

The Fourth Amendment doesn't stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.

WATCH: Thousands brave frigid cold in Twin Cities 'ICE Out' protest

For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions — such as a brief detention that's not a formal arrest — require a ""reasonable suspicion"" that someone has committed a crime or is in the U.S. illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.

Reasonable suspicion ""has to be more than a guess or a presumption,"" said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed or would be committed.

Agents must meet an even higher bar to arrest someone. They need ""probable cause,"" which generally requires enough evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.

What is a ""Kavanaugh stop""?

Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.

In the 2025 case Noem v. Perdomo, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favor of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. Kavanaugh wrote that ""apparent ethnicity"" could be used as a ""relevant factor"" in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.

Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had ""often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they 'looked like an immigrant' or were in a high-crime area,"" Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh's guidance, ""it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile.""

Critics of Kavanaugh's opinion ""argue that the 'relevant factor' language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling,"" said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.

But Kavanaugh's opinion was not co-signed by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court ""has not made a definitive ruling on 'Kavanaugh stops' and their permissibility,"" said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump v. Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

Do people's rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?

The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.

""This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,"" Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as if an officer encounters a violent crime in progress, or someone needing medical care.

Securing a judicial warrant is time consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. ""It's much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,"" she said.

WATCH: Migrant families allege children held by ICE face unsafe and unsanitary conditions

In the past, federal immigration officers typically would not forcibly enter homes if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE itself, without a judge's approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.

Specific ICE officials have authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require ""probable cause to believe"" that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.

A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press reported Jan. 22.

The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and ""those still in training are being told to follow the memo's guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo.""

The May 12, 2025, memo, signed by ICE acting director Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security ""has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence"" but added that ""the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.""

If this policy were to be challenged in court, it's unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.

What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?

If you believe that your rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, your options for suing for compensation are limited.

Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil lawsuits against federal officials for violating people's rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions, before tightening them again.

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley's law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, ""In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.""

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: ""It's not an easy path, and most people can't afford to retain a lawyer.""",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-15T111949Z_1207688221_RC241JADSQZL_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-POLL-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:56.830162

Any attempt to assault, stop, block, or otherwise hinder any law enforcement officers from doing their jobs will not be tolerated.","ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. — A protester was arrested in Orange County after tensions escalated outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Orlando.

The arrest happened as demonstrators gathered outside the ICE facility on Delegates Drive.

Channel 9 had a crew on the scene that witnessed the arrest. Dozens of law enforcement officers, who had staged nearby for the protest, responded within seconds to a call for backup.

Video from the scene shows whistles, sirens and protesters chanting as a person was handcuffed on the ground outside the facility. Another angle shows dozens of state troopers surrounding the protester and blocking the street.

The Orange County Sheriff’s office said the protest was almost exclusively peaceful until a woman approached a federal agent who was in a car and struck the law enforcement vehicle. She was arrested on charges of Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer and Resisting Arrest.

Protesters said the arrest followed a verbal exchange with a federal agent who was inside their car.

Just hours earlier, Channel 9 witnessed the arrestee peacefully protesting alongside others. Demonstrators said they were opposing what they described as an escalation of aggressive ICE tactics.

Many protesters said they were responding to a story Channel 9 broke earlier this month about ICE considering converting a warehouse in Orlando into a detention center. They also told Channel 9 they were responding to what they called “aggressive tactics” used by ICE in Minneapolis and in Central Florida.

“They need to block the acquisition of that warehouse. And we need to make it very clear that our jails are not a holding point for these nonviolent immigrants,” said John Held, who was part of the protest before the arrest.

The protest began at noon and was peaceful for several hours. During that time, law enforcement’s presence was visible with officers on bikes and in vehicles circling the area about every 30 minutes.

At least one counterprotester stood roughly 200 yards away, holding a Trump flag and yelling at demonstrators.

Orange County Republican Party Vice Chairman Kevin Kelly said he was supporting ICE’s mission.

“I just hope that people put more effort into positive actions like solving the absolute evil human trafficking problem that we have here and work together to solve those problems rather than running interference for folks that have broken the law,” said Kelly.

He also told Channel 9 he would support the detention center if ICE needed it to pursue law enforcement.

“We wanna be known as a safe, clean, fun place to bring your family on vacation. And if that means that there needs to be a detention center so they could adequately and safely process not only these offenders, but deal with again with these victims of human trafficking, then that seems like a necessary tool,” said Kelly.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Office released the following statement about the arrest:

“At the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, our top priority is the safety and security of our residents and visitors, and the safety of our deputies.

Earlier today, during what was almost an exclusively peaceful protest at the ICE facility, a woman approached a federal agent who was in a car and struck the law enforcement vehicle. She was arrested on charges of Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer and Resisting Arrest.

The right of all people to peacefully assemble or protest is fundamental, and a cornerstone of every American’s First Amendment right to free speech. What is not protected, however, is the destruction of property or violence against any member of our community. Any attempt to assault, stop, block, or otherwise hinder any law enforcement officers from doing their jobs will not be tolerated. I want to assure everyone in our community that our deputies will always respond to ensure the safety of those who are exercising their rights peacefully.”

Dozens of eateries, attraction sites and other businesses shuttered as part of a day of coordinated action to defy the weeks-long federal immigration operation underway in Minnesota.

Images of an apparently terrified pre-schooler, Liam Conejo Ramos, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father have rekindled public outrage at the federal crackdown, during which an agent shot and killed a US citizen.

The superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a preschool student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias – both asylum seekers – were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on Tuesday.

Ramos was then used as ""bait"" by officers to draw out those inside his home, superintendent Zena Stenvik added.

One protester, who declined to be named, said he was marching ""because if we don't fight, we don't win. If we don't fight, fascism wins.""

The local man held a sign reading ""five-years-old, dude,"" a reference to Ramos.

Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants across the country.

On a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed Ramos was among those detained. But he argued that agents were protecting him after his father ""ran"" from officers.

""What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?"" he said.

UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the ""harmful treatment of migrants and refugees"".

Arias, the father of the boy, was at a Texas detention facility, according to an ICE database that does not list the whereabouts of under-18s.

'Experts in dealing with children'

Border Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers' treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: ""I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children.""

ICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday ""my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family"" and alleged that Ramos's family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.

They would be detained ""pending their immigration proceedings"", he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were ""deportable"".

Ramos's teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him ""a bright young student"".

In Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted ""ICE out"" as part of a broader anti-ICE day of action.

Separately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis-St. Paul airport over the facility's use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids.

Methodist pastor Mariah Furness Tollgaard said in a statement that 100 members of clergy were arrested and charged with trespassing and disobeying a peace officer on Friday, while demonstrating at the airport.

""As a faith leader in Minnesota, my tradition teaches that every person bears the image of God and is worthy of dignity and safety, and in this moment, all people of faith and moral conscience must stand up,"" she said.

'Just a baby'

Former US vice president Kamala Harris said she was ""outraged"" by Ramos's detention and called him ""just a baby"".

Ramos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, administrators said.

Minneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.

An autopsy concluded that the killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.

The officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.

Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Children have been caught up in immigration enforcement under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Minnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application Monday.

What happened today is exactly why so many people in Tucson are living in fear: Fear of detention, deportation, and criminalization simply for existing.""","State Rep. Alma Hernandez sharply criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for stopping a car and arresting three members of a Venezuelan family near an elementary school just south of Downtown Tucson on Friday morning.

A woman who had been riding in the car told Hernandez that her husband had been driving her to a doctor's appointment, when he noticed a car was tailgating them. The ICE agents activated lights on a black SUV and pulled the family over, and said they were just conducting a ""routine operation"" and that they simply were ""just checking,"" the Democratic legislator said she was told.

""All of this happened in front of an elementary school while children were outside playing,"" Hernandez said in a prepared statement. ""This kind of recklessness is unacceptable.""

Hernandez represents District 20, which covers part of Midtown Tucson, and extends west of Interstate 10 toward the Pascua Yaqui.

Hernandez posted a video of the incident on Friday, showing three ICE agents standing outside the school. As one agent spoke with a woman, another argued with a small crowd, telling one man, ""you love your job, I love mine.""

Another man criticized the agents for making the stop near the school, telling him the children can't go to recess because the agents are nearby.

""This family was not breaking any law. In fact, this family is currently in their asylum process as they are from Venezuela, they all had proper documentation to show they are legally here while their case is being processed, and her husband the driver has already been granted asylum,"" Hernandez said. ""ICE was made aware of this and still took them.""

""This puts families, children, and entire neighborhoods like mine at risk, and demonstrates a blatant disregard for public safety,"" Hernandez said.

The stop was one of three reported incidents in Tucson involving ICE agents. ICE agents also detained a group of city of Tucson workers at a QuickTrip convenience store on Irvington Road on Friday.

ICE has accelerated operations in the Tucson area in January, including multiple incidents near El Super, a grocery store near South Tucson.

For weeks, activists in Tucson have waited for a push by ICE, especially after two high-profile raids in early December. One raid devolved into chaos as agents with the Department of Homeland Security used tear gas, pepper balls and smoke grenades against protesters.

Among those hit by pepper spray were this Tucson Sentinel reporter and U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva. Another reporter had his camera sprayed.

This worry has only increased after immigration agents surged into Minneapolis, and an ICE agent shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good.

Last week, Tucson city officials sent out a statement on potential ICE raids in the city.

""Federal actions are spreading fear and chaos in cities across our country,"" said Mayor Regina Romero. ""The actions that we’ve seen ICE take are hurting innocent people and not making us any safer. The city of Tucson will prioritize community safety and protect the legal and constitutional rights of every Tucsonan regardless of status,"" Romero said, adding city staff created an informational website

City officials added there have been ICE operations in the city.

""While the mayor and city cannot prevent ICE from legally operating in Tucson, the city also does not condone the behavior demonstrated by ICE agents towards members of our community and in other communities,"" city officials said. ""This includes the wearing of masks and other actions intended to intimidate and confuse the public. The city understands that ICE raids create fear that negatively impact families, schools, and local businesses.""

However, the Tucson City Council unanimously asked staff to draft an ordinance barring ICE agents from using city-owned property to launch operations.

While the Trump administration has framed the large-scale crackdowns by ICE as way to remove the ""worst of the worst,"" available data shows ICE operations largely fall on immigrants who have not committed crimes, and those following the legal immigration processes created by Congress or under the Biden administration.

Data from ICE compiled by the nonpartisan Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse shows there were nearly 66,000 people in immigration detention on Nov. 30, and of those nearly 74 percent had no criminal convictions.

And, there are around 3.4 million immigration cases on the court docket, including around 2.3 million asylum cases.

Further, though the Trump administration has targeted immigrants throughout the U.S., the administration has a particular animus for Venezuelans.

In 2023, President Joe Biden issued TPS for Venezuelans in the U.S., deciding conditions in the country were too deleterious to deport people. As part of this decision, Biden extended TPS for Venezuelans who already had sought those protections, and he allowed those who arrived after 2021 to apply for TPS for the first time and receive a 18-month reprieve, wrote the American Immigration Council.

However, just days after January's inauguration, the Trump administration moved to cancel TPS for around 3,500 people from Venezuela.

""TPS holders sued the administration over the bait-and-switch,"" wrote AIC. However, while a federal judge postponed the cancellations and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration what it desired in May.

Since Trump's inauguration last year, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, the Arizona Mirror reported.

Experts said these moves created the ""most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history"" after the Trump administration slashed TPS for nearly 1 million and ended humanitarian parole for half a million more.

Further, in March, the Trump administration rendered about 240 Venezuelans to El Salvador's notoriously brutal CECOT prison, igniting a legal fight over their renditions without due process.

""Our community will not be complicit in systems that dehumanize our residents or erode public trust,"" Hernandez said Friday. ""We deserve safety rooted in dignity, accountability, and humanity, not fear.""

""These actions do not make our communities safer,"" Hernandez said. ""They terrorize neighborhoods, tear families apart, and undermine public trust—especially when carried out by masked agents operating with no transparency or accountability. What happened today is exactly why so many people in Tucson are living in fear: Fear of detention, deportation, and criminalization simply for existing.""

Tim Walz. The shooting appeared to be captured on video, which shows federal agents wrestling someone to the ground and shooting them multiple times. The story below was originally published on January 23.

America’s immigration debate has often centered on the morality of mass deportation. Progressives have argued that exiling law-abiding families is inherently wrong — no matter their immigration status. Conservatives have insisted that vigorous internal enforcement is necessary for deterring chaotic inflows of migrants, upholding America’s laws, and preserving our nation’s culture.

This is an important dispute. And yet, as masked US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents run amok in Minneapolis, it also feels increasingly beside the point.

President Donald Trump’s approach to immigration enforcement doesn’t only threaten the welfare of the undocumented but also the basic rights of American citizens. The question posed by Trump’s agenda is not merely whether noncriminal immigrants should be deported, but whether the Constitution should be shredded in service of that aim.

Voters are starting to recognize this reality. In a recent New York Times/Siena poll, Americans approved of Trump’s deportations of people living in the country illegally by a 50 percent to 47 percent margin. Yet, over 60 percent nevertheless disapproved of the way that ICE was handling its job, saying that the agency had “gone too far” in its tactics.

It is important for Americans to understand that they don’t need to accept the left’s moral assumptions to reject the president’s immigration regime. They simply need to value their own freedom.

Below, I detail six ways that Trump’s immigration policies are eroding all Americans’ liberty.

Key takeaways

ICE is forcibly entering Americans’ homes without warrant.

The Trump administration is using immigration enforcement to punish speech it doesn’t like.

The White House is shielding ICE officers from accountability.

All this threatens US citizens, not just undocumented immigrants.

1) ICE is nullifying the Fourth Amendment

The Fourth Amendment bars government agents from forcing their way into a US resident’s home without a warrant. This protection from unreasonable search and seizure is among Americans’ most basic civil liberties — and ICE has decided to ignore it.

In an internal memo leaked this week, the agency informed its deportation officers that they can forcibly enter the homes of suspected undocumented immigrants without obtaining a warrant from any judge. ICE decreed that its agents could break into anyone’s house, so long as they had an administrative warrant, a type of warrant that ICE itself can issue at will.

This is a blatant subversion of constitutional government — and one that harms undocumented immigrants and US citizens alike. If ICE doesn’t need to establish probable cause before storming into a residence, then it will inevitably march into some American citizens’ homes.

Indeed, last Sunday, in St. Paul, Minnesota, ICE agents broke down the door of a house, put a gun to the head of a US citizen, and dragged him out of his home in just his underwear — all without presenting any judicial warrant.

2) The government is shielding ICE officers from accountability

A core democratic freedom is protection from abuse by armed agents of the state. The Trump administration has undermined such liberty by insulating DHS officers from legal accountability.

It has done this in ways both large and small.

Most conspicuously, when ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Renee Nicole Good three times on video — twice while standing safely to the left of her vehicle — Trump immediately rallied to Ross’s defense. And the Department of Justice swiftly declined to investigate the shooting, opting instead to launch a probe against Good’s widow.

This conduct would be alarming even if Good’s killing were legally justified. By embracing Ross’s cause — before any investigation had been conducted — the president signaled that he will reflexively defend any use of force by ICE agents, no matter how grave or legally ambiguous.

Even before Good’s death, however, the administration had already demonstrated that it wished to immunize ICE from accountability. Upon taking office, Trump’s White House shuttered the DHS’s internal watchdog offices — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — which sought to protect detainees against abuse and unfair treatment. The latter office investigated more than 11,000 complaints in 2023.

Meanwhile, the administration condoned the decision of many ICE agents to operate in masks and plainclothes. This policy enables abuse by making it harder for the mistreated to identify abusive officers, and thus hold them to account.

Critically, all this is consistent with Trump’s own stated beliefs about how law enforcement officers should be allowed to operate. Speaking of his federal takeover of the Washington, DC, police in August, Trump touted that, on his watch, police would be “allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” He has also specifically said that when protesters throw rocks at ICE vehicles, the officers become entitled to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS” using “whatever means is necessary to do so.”

3) Trump is using immigration enforcement to deter free speech

Trump sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.

This is not conjecture but a description of the administration’s official policy.

Earlier this year, Trump declared, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” further promising to “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”

This stance would be illiberal, even if the president were referring exclusively to genuine supporters of Hamas; the government should not revoke legal status from people on the basis of speech, no matter how reprehensible.

In reality, though, the administration’s complaint was with any immigrant who advocated for a staunchly pro-Palestinian point of view.

In March 2025, Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national residing in the US on a student visa, co-authored an op-ed in her university’s newspaper, calling on it to divest from Israel and acknowledge the “Palestinian genocide.” This speech act put Öztürk on the radar of pro-Israel activists.

Upon taking office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Öztürk’s visa. Six masked, plainclothes DHS agents proceeded to abduct her off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, and send her to an ICE processing facility in southern Louisiana.

The ostensible rationale for this was that Öztürk had engaged in pro-Hamas activities. But internal State Department documents, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed that the government possessed no evidence that Öztürk had ever publicly advocated for Hamas or participated in anti-semitic activities.

The administration has similarly sought to revoke legal status from two lawful permanent residents — Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — who participated in pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University.

Federal courts have disputed the legality of all these actions, although Khalil presently faces a deportation order.

4) The administration is openly flouting due process

Even those who favor strict immigration enforcement should support immigrants’ due process rights. After all, it is due process that prevents the government from deporting lawful US residents (either by mistake or design).

Yet Trump has explicitly called for ending due process in immigration cases and taken various actions consistent with that authoritarian ambition.

During his first term, Trump declared that the government should be able to deport undocumented immigrants “with no judges or court cases.” Since taking office a second time, the president has sought to curtail legal protections for those accused of being in the country illegally.

First, his administration has expanded the use of “expedited removal” — a process that allows immigration authorities to deport the undocumented rapidly, without a full hearing. Historically, this process was used in a narrow set of circumstances: when an immigrant is intercepted near the US border without a valid visa, credible asylum claim, or proof that they have been in the US for longer than two weeks.

The idea here was that migrants who have just crossed the border do not possess the same legal protections as longtime residents. In some sense, they are still seeking admission into the country, rather than permission to remain in it. Therefore, Congress and the judiciary concluded that the government could deny such migrants a full court hearing, in the interests of administrative efficiency, particularly when border agents were overwhelmed by large inflows of asylum seekers.

But Trump has sought to authorize expedited removal throughout the United States. Under his guidance, DHS has proposed a rule that would empower ICE to summarily deport any suspected immigrants who can’t immediately prove that they’ve been in America for two years.

The risks of this policy to lawful US residents isn’t merely theoretical. Even in the absence of such broad authorities, ICE and the Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) have wrongfully detained or deported legal residents, including American citizens. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and removed 70.

Courts have intervened to block Trump’s expanded use of expedited removal, but the administration is appealing those rulings.

Meanwhile, the president has sought to corrupt the independence of the immigration court system. Since taking office in January, 139 immigration judges have been fired, nudged from the bench with an early retirement offer, or involuntarily transferred. The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump’s enforcement agencies.

Finally, and most appallingly, Trump has infamously deported longtime US residents — who’d been convicted of no crime — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where inmates are reportedly subject to torture and indefinite dentention. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration deported a resident unlawfully, and then claimed that it was powerless to reverse its mistake, since Garcia was now in the custody of a foreign power. The judiciary eventually forced the administration to return Garcia to the US. But his case illustrates the extremity of Trump’s contempt for due process.

5) Trump is normalizing the use of the military for civil law enforcement

Trump has also deployed federal troops to oversee immigration enforcement operations, in defiance of local political authorities.

This is a severe breach of liberal democratic norms. Immigration enforcement is a civil authority. And in the United States, responsibility for upholding civil laws is supposed to lie with civilian officials — not the military — except under the most extraordinary circumstances. This division of powers is codified in the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of armed forces for domestic policing absent explicit congressional authorization.

The administration has flouted this convention by invoking an obscure 1903 law, which authorizes the president to call up the National Guard if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Yet Trump has effectively defined such a rebellion as any public protest — even nonviolent ones — against immigration enforcement. In a June memorandum, Trump authorized the Guard’s deployment to any “locations where protests against” ICE functions “are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.” In other words, he asserted the authority to send the military anywhere in the US where a protest against his immigration policy is happening — or where his administration thinks a protest against its policy could happen.

The danger that this poses to democracy is straightforward. Unlike civilian police forces, the armed services operate at the president’s command. If his use of the military for civilian functions isn’t tightly constrained, there is a risk that he could exploit his martial authorities to insulate his regime from democratic control. Today, Trump is asserting the right to deploy troops to Democratic cities, to preempt protests he does not like. Tomorrow, he could do the same to obstruct the election of politicians he opposes.

Of course, that catastrophic outcome is far from guaranteed. But it is important to maintain institutional obstacles to it. Instead, Trump’s immigration agenda is eroding them.

6) The pursuit of indiscriminate, mass deportation imposes inherent costs to civil liberties

To this point, I’ve been outlining reasons why one should consider Trump’s immigration policies anti-democratic, even if one regards mass deportation as legitimate.

But it’s also true that any attempt to deport millions of noncriminal, undocumented immigrants is bound to impose costs on Americans’ civil liberties.

The case for concentrating immigration enforcement on law-breakers is not just humanitarian. Undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes are already known to the government and typically in its custody. As a result, DHS can remove them from the country without conducting sweeps that ensnare legal US residents.

Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America’s 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can. And that has led them to embrace tactics like going door to door in a Chicago apartment building, demanding families prove their legal status in the middle of the night; storming car washes and throwing senior citizens to the ground; and fining legal immigrants for not carrying proof of their status on their person at all times.

To refrain from these tactics, and set narrower enforcement priorities, is not to nullify America’s immigration statutes. The rule of law has never depended on perfect enforcement. Most crimes committed in the United States go unpunished, including nearly half of murders. We should obviously try to change that. But the only way to push the rate of unpunished criminality to anywhere near 0 percent would be to embrace gross violations of civil liberties: The government would need to surveil more or less all citizens more or less all of the time.

Most Americans would regard such enforcement as authoritarian. And so we instead accept that the police will prioritize the prevention and punishment of certain crimes, while acquiescing to a great deal of uncensured lawbreaking. Immigration enforcement entails similar trade-offs.

That doesn’t mean that any enforcement regime broader than Joe Biden’s is fascism. But I would encourage those unmoved by humanitarian objections to mass deportation to consider the inherent, civil libertarian costs of such a policy.

In any event, reasonable people can disagree about exactly how the government should balance the objectives of enforcing borders and honoring civil liberties. What should be beyond dispute, however, is that eroding Americans’ most basic constitutional rights is never legitimate. And it has never been more clear that Trump’s immigration agenda does precisely that.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2256434210.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.723165084465%2C100%2C78.55366983107&w=1200,N,,2026-01-24 14:58:12.512493

Rather, according to some legal experts, a likely outcome would be a narrow decision that could return the matter to a trial court for more fact-finding without the justices resolving ​big questions involving whether Trump has proper cause to oust Cook or whether a president has the power to fire Fed officials. In such a scenario, the case could return later to the Supreme Court.

Trump's attempt to fire Cook and ‌a separate criminal investigation launched by his Justice Department against Fed Chair Jerome Powell together represent the biggest challenge to the central bank's independence since its founding in 1913.

A 'MINIMALIST' DECISION

""The Supreme Court clearly seems to be looking for a way to get the case back to the lower courts with as minimalist of a decision as possible,"" said law professor Peter Margulies of Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, ""rather than a broad pronouncement.""

Trump's Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to block U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb's September preliminary injunction that halted his attempt to fire Cook the prior month. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied the administration's subsequent request to lift Cobb's order.

A narrow Supreme Court ruling against Trump would leave Cobb's injunction in place and provide instructions to the judge about how to move the case toward a final judgment on the merits of Cook's legal challenge to the Republican president's bid to remove ‌her.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has backed Trump in numerous other cases decided on an emergency basis since he returned to office 12 months ago, including letting him remove officials from other federal ​agencies.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law that included provisions meant to insulate it from political interference, allowing a president to remove central bank governors only ""for cause."" The law does not define ""cause"" or establish procedures for removal.

Trump, who has taken a broad view of presidential powers under the U.S. Constitution, is the first president to try to fire a Fed official.

Economists view central bank independence as indispensable to prevent interest rate decisions from being dictated by the short-term whims of politicians at the expense of long-term economic stability.

'A HURRIED MANNER'

During the arguments on Wednesday, some of the justices ‍noted that Cook's case moved quickly to them, with little time for weighing evidence and resolving complex legal questions.

Conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked: ""Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody - by the executive branch, by the district court, by the D.C. Circuit - in such a hurried manner?""

Cook sued Trump days after he posted to his Truth Social platform a letter informing her that she was ""hereby removed.""

Trump said he had proper cause to fire Cook, citing unproven allegations made by one of his political appointees that she had falsified documents to obtain loans on two different properties she listed as her primary residences. Cook has called these allegations ⁠of mortgage fraud a pretext to remove her over monetary policy, as the Fed has resisted Trump's persistent demands for fast and big interest rate cuts.

Alito said he did not think Cobb had created a full evidentiary record of Trump's basis for removing Cook.

""No court has ever explored ‍those facts,"" Alito said. ""Are the mortgage applications even in the record in this case?""

The justices ""are wary of the relative paucity of the material for them to go on,"" said law professor Jane Manners of Fordham University in New York.

'IRREPARABLE HARM'

The burden is on Trump to show he is entitled to a stay, or halt, ‌of Cobb's preliminary ‌injunction. The administration must show Trump would be irreparably harmed if a stay is not granted. The justices must also consider whether a stay serves the public interest more broadly.

Conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted that economists had filed briefs with the court arguing that granting Trump's request to remove Cook immediately could trigger a recession, and asked whether that risk meant the court should proceed cautiously.

""The court could cite the irreparable harm factor and say the public interest isn't clearly served by allowing removal at this point, particularly because of questions about effects on the markets,"" Margulies said.

Boston University law professor Jed Shugerman said it is possible the Supreme Court's ruling could come in the form of a one-paragraph order that denies Trump's request for a stay but does not provide much if any legal reasoning. The court, for example, took that approach in an immigration case last year involving ⁠Trump that it decided on an emergency basis.

DUE PROCESS RIGHTS

The trial judge ⁠ruled that Trump's attempt to remove Cook without notice or a ​hearing likely violated her right to due process under the Constitution's Fifth Amendment and that the mortgage fraud allegations likely were not a sufficient cause to remove a Fed governor under the law.

Shugerman said Wednesday's arguments revealed skepticism among the justices toward Trump's legal arguments but a lack of consensus on how to interpret the law that created the Fed, what ""for cause"" means and how to distinguish the Fed from other government agencies.

Rather than delve into these questions in their pending ruling, the justices could kick them down the road and revisit them later with the benefit of further work by the lower courts, Shugerman said.

""I think they hinted ‍at oral argument - if not said explicitly - that they find these issues too historically complicated and too legally complicated to be worthwhile to dig into at this stage,"" Shugerman said.

Some legal experts said the justices might rule in favor of Cook in a more forceful way that brings the case to an end. The court could rule, for example, that the process afforded to Cook to challenge the accusations against her was insufficient.

But such a ruling still would be narrow in the sense that it would ""avoid the question of why independence is necessary and important for the Fed and just focus on procedure,"" said professor Andrea Katz of Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.

For ​his part, Trump said a day after the arguments that he did not get the impression that the court seemed skeptical of his bid to fire Cook.

""I didn't get ‍that impression other than they thought maybe it should have gone through a more normal court system,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

The court's ruling is expected by the end of June but could come sooner.

MINNEAPOLIS — Today, federal agents shot and killed a man in the Eat Street neighborhood of south Minneapolis after brutally beating him in front of witnesses. Video from an on-the-ground reporter reveals that multiple shots were fired, with the agents believed to be standing over the man when he was struck, apparently in his chest. The American Civil Liberties Union and ACLU of Minnesota strongly condemn this killing and demand these violent and dangerous federal agents immediately withdraw from Minnesota — and other communities across the country.

“Yesterday tens of thousands of Minnesotans from all walks of life marched through the streets in subzero temperatures to demand ICE stop terrorizing our communities, and today we wake up to the heartbreaking news that federal officials killed another person. ,” said Deepinder Mayell, executive director of ACLU of Minnesota. “This tragedy is further proof that these federal agents are out of control and critically endangering our communities. ICE and CBP must end their operations in our city before anyone else is harmed, and an independent investigation must be conducted.”

In July 2025, Congress voted to add an unprecedented $170 billion to the Trump administration’s already massive budget for immigration enforcement, which has funded these indiscriminate raids. Congress is now negotiating the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) budget for the coming year, which would fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol, enabling them to continue their lawless operations across the country without adding any serious limits on their abusive and violent tactics.

“After the horrific shooting of Renee Good, the Trump administration recklessly escalated and deployed even more heavily armed agents into Minneapolis, and, today, we are again seeing the devastating and predictable consequences,” said Naureen Shah, director of immigration policy and government affairs at ACLU. “Congress must rein ICE in before what happened in Minneapolis happens yet again. Senators must reject a DHS budget that allows these lawless agencies to continue putting our communities in danger.”

In recent weeks, the ACLU of Minnesota and its partners filed two lawsuits arising from ICE’s assault on Minnesotans, Hussen v. Noem, challenging the agency’s warrantless arrests and racial profiling, and Tincher v. Noem, a lawsuit challenging ICE violence and misconduct towards Minnesotans exercising their First Amendment rights to assemble, observe, and protest federal agents’ immigration enforcement activities in our streets. Earlier this week, a federal appeals court temporarily suspended the trial court’s order in Tincher blocking the government from retaliating against protestors and observers.

DHS alleges leaders in Minnesota ""created disorder"" by failing to cooperate with federal law enforcement.
Ellison called this ""a false statement"" and said planning for the surge of federal law enforcement had long been underway.","St. Paul, Minnesota — Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison accused the Trump administration of turning immigration enforcement into ""politics and retribution,"" describing what he called a ""surge"" of federal agents in the Twin Cities as a constitutional crisis, and said he has seen ""no evidence"" of a federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month.

""In fact, I have evidence to the contrary that the federal government is investigating the death of Renee Good at all,"" Ellison told CBS News in an interview Friday.

He added, ""Todd Blanche, who is the No. 2 at DOJ, said they're not investigating.""

At the same time, Minnesota authorities, Ellison said, are seeking a ""full, fair and joint investigation.""

""In Minnesota, if you are killed — particularly if you're killed…in connection with an action by an official federal or state, we will investigate your death,"" Ellison said.

The state agency tasked with investigating Good's killing, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, withdrew from a joint investigation with the FBI a day after the shooting. It said in a statement at the time the agency said it had been informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office that ""the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.""

When asked in a Jan. 18 interview with ""Face the Nation"" whether the ICE officer who shot Good was under investigation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the department was ""following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE, and under the Department of Homeland Security, and within the administration.""

Ellison on the apprehension of 5-year-old Liam Ramos by ICE

Ellison strongly disputed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's assertions about 5-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into ICE custody outside his home. Ramos' image has been widely circulated across the news and social media in a photo that shows him wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack. DHS said the boy had been ""abandoned.""

""I don't buy that at all. In fact, there are very credible people who know Liam who refute that. I believe them over ICE,"" Ellison said, calling DHS' claim and subsequent treatment of Ramos ""another example of atrocity"" tied to the deportation effort DHS has dubbed ""Operation Metro Surge.""

Witnesses told CBS News that ICE used the boy as bait to lure family members out.

""That is morally repugnant and nothing the federal government should ever be associated with,"" Ellison said.

Suing to stop DHS' warrantless arrests in Minnesota

Ellison's office and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop what they allege are unlawful tactics, framing the surge as a planned deployment targeting Minnesota, not a routine enforcement action. He argued the operation has been fueled by President Trump's anger over losing the 2020 presidential election.

""Mr. Trump said 'retribution.' He said he won Minnesota three times and that leaders here wrongfully denied him. So he's mad at us,"" Ellison said. Asked whether the ICE operation is about politics, rather than law enforcement, he replied, ""It's 100% about politics and retribution.""

DHS alleges leaders in Minnesota ""created disorder"" by failing to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Ellison called this ""a false statement"" and said planning for the surge of federal law enforcement had long been underway. He said he believes U.S. officials are shifting their rationale now because public opinion is turning against the operation.

At the center of the lawsuit, Ellison said, are accusations of warrantless arrests without individualized assessment — including alleged civil immigration arrests without probable cause — along with racial profiling and what he described as excessive detention.

DHS has claimed that there are a few arrest videos that were taken out of context.

""Yeah, well, they're going to have to defend their position in court, because that's not true,"" Ellison replied.

If he's successful in obtaining an injunction blocking the DHS operation in Minnesota, it's not clear whether the state could enforce it — or that it would survive appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ellison acknowledged that uncertainty but said inaction was not an option.

""The only alternative is to do nothing and hope for the best,"" he said. ""We have to do all that is in our power to insist that the federal government obey the law.""

Ellison said the DHS surge is imposing significant costs on state and local governments, with ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" spent daily on crowd control, overtime and emergency response.

He also described a stream of injury complaints tied to pepper spray, tear gas and ""less lethal munitions,"" adding that ""literally dozens every day"" are making reports, while also emphasizing the harms of what he called unlawful detention and imprisonment.

And pressed on whether the state would subpoena federal agents in its civil case to access evidence in the Good case, Ellison said legal and ethical constraints govern the boundary between civil litigation and criminal investigations, but he did not rule it out.

""We're going to do what is legal and ethical,"" he said.

ICE's new authority to carry out warrantless searches

ICE agents have seen their authority expanded — a May memo that was recently disclosed by whistleblowers said agents are authorized to use force to enter homes without a judicial warrant. Ellison called the policy ""unconstitutional"" and said he's heard reports it's being used in Minnesota. He signaled the state would challenge such actions.

Cooperation with ICE

DHS has said that Minnesota is not cooperating with ICE detainers — requests to hold detainees for an additional 48 hours so they can be turned over to ICE custody — or other requests for assistance. Ellison counters that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility — not the state's — and while Minnesota is not a sanctuary state, state laws and court orders sometimes prevent the state from assisting ICE because it cannot hold criminals beyond their sentence.

For instance, he said that if an individual sought by the federal government is arrested for driving under the influence, ""our courts don't have the legal authority to hold them once the court has said they need — they are to be released.""

He indicated that the state is following its laws as they're written: ""They're asking us to join them in breaking the law, and we can't do that. We believe in upholding the law.""

But cooperation with ICE detainers is uneven in Minnesota. In Hennepin County, where Minneapolis is located, the sheriff told CBS News that authorities do not notify ICE when detainees are released back into the community. The Department of Corrections, however, does notify ICE.

DHS says that if every county in the state coordinated with ICE, federal agents could go home and ICE would not continue to conduct raids in Minnesota.

""They're saying, 'Oh, well, if you only would tell us, do our job for us, then we could go home.' No, you didn't,"" Ellison said. He added, ""ICE needs to do its job that it is paid to do, and it has a massive budget to do.""

""Minnesota is not a sanctuary state,"" he told CBS News. ""We don't do the federal government's job, but we don't in any way obstruct them from doing their job.""

He suggested his state is at the center of a collision between politics and constitutional rights and warned that ""the only way to get along"" with the administration is to ""abandon constitutional rights.""

""We must insist upon our First Amendment right to vote for whoever we please and not be persecuted,"" he said. ""We must insist on the Fourth Amendment protection to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/24/8b7fcdd7-16df-41ed-804c-9785739b6b07/thumbnail/1200x630/b15d646828ed7ff73cb660fb5c686b15/1769221140124.png,N,,2026-01-24 16:58:59.356877

Part of the reason why recent ICE tactics have shocked Americans is because most people haven’t seen them before. Historically, the country’s militarized immigration enforcement practices have played out closer to the U.S.-Mexico border. And for decades, agents with Customs and Border Protection have carried out most deportations near the border, not ICE.

From 2010-2020, nearly 80% of all deportations were initiated at or near the U.S.-Mexico border. During the COVID-19 pandemic, that number jumped to 98%, as both the Trump and Biden administrations utilized Title 42, a public health statute that allowed the government to rapidly deport recently arrived migrants.

But Trump during his second presidency has greatly shifted immigration enforcement north into the interior of the U.S. And ICE has played a central role.

As international migration and human rights scholars, we have examined recent federal immigration policy to determine why ICE has become the main agency detaining and deporting migrants as far away from the southern border as snowy Minnesota.

And we have also explored how the transition in immigration control from the southern border to more Americans’ front lawns could be shifting the public’s views on deportation tactics.

Migration as a threat

ICE is a relatively new agency. The 2002 Homeland Security Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, created the Department of Homeland Security, known as DHS, by merging the U.S. Customs Service – previously under Treasury Department control – and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, formerly under the Justice Department.

DHS has 22 agencies, including three that focus on immigration: Customs and Border Protection, ICE and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which manages legal immigration and naturalization.

There is no inherent reason that immigration enforcement should fall under homeland security. But immigration was deemed a national security matter by the George W. Bush administration after 9/11.

In a 2002 presidential briefing justifying DHS’s creation, Bush said, “The changing nature of the threats facing America requires a new government structure to protect against invisible enemies that can strike with a wide variety of weapons.”

The U.S. government has viewed immigration from this national security perspective ever since.

The full impact of the deportations

The Trump administration in early 2025 set a goal of deporting 1 million people during its first year.

But with so few crossings, and thus deportations, at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration instead has focused its efforts on the U.S. interior.

Trump’s 2025 tax and budget bill reflected this reprioritization, allocating US$170 billion over four years to immigration enforcement, compared to approximately $30 billion allocated in 2024.

Roughly $67 billion goes toward immigration enforcement at the border, including border wall construction. But the largest percentage of the bill’s immigration funding – at least $75 billion – goes toward arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants already living in the U.S.

The Trump administration did not initiate deportations from the U.S. interior. They have formed part of other administration’s policies, both Democratic and Republican.

Interior border enforcement increased under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s with the introduction of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which widened the criteria for deportations. And former President Barack Obama was referred to as the “Deporter in Chief” after his administration carried out more than 3 million deportations over his two terms, with roughly 69% of deportations occurring at the border.

But the astronomical growth of government funding toward migration control – at the border and in the U.S. – got the country to where it is today.

Between fiscal year 2003 and 2024, for example, Congress allocated approximately $24 toward immigration enforcement carried out by ICE and CBP for every $1 spent on the immigration court system that handles asylum claims.

The new money allocated under the 2025 budget bill, and the reprioritization of immigration enforcement from the border to the interior, partly explains why Americans are now seeing the long-term consequences of border militarization play out directly in their communities.

Americans may not know about the experiences of migrants who are quickly deported near the border, but it is harder to ignore recent images of people snatched up within their own neighborhoods.

Now the visible targets of border enforcement are increasingly immigrants who have built their lives in the U.S. – neighbors, friends, co-workers – as well as anyone who opposes ICE’s tactics, like Renee Good.

Changing political attitudes

In fact, the violence of Trump’s mass deportation campaign may be changing how Americans view immigration.

Just before the 2024 presidential election, a Gallup Poll found that 28% of Americans believed that immigration was the most important problem facing the nation – the highest percentage since Gallup began tracking the topic in 1981. This number dropped to 19% in December 2025, reflecting how more Americans see immigration as a routine issue that the government can manage rather than a crisis that needs to be dealt with.

This is supported in the academic literature. Migration scholars have shown that voters often support strict immigration policies in the voting booth but resist and protest when governments attempt to implement those policies in organized immigrant communities.

In 2002, for example, migration scholar Antje Ellermann documented that immigration officers reported it was more difficult to detain and deport people in Miami – because of resistance by a politicized immigrant community – compared to relatively conservative and less organized communities in San Diego.

But in both places, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were influential in intervening in individual cases to prevent deportations. This is because senior immigration officials, Ellermann noted, were influenced by media attention and pressure by members of Congress to grant relief.

Support for Trump’s handling of immigration is trending downward. Only 41% of Americans approved of Trump’s approach to immigration as of early January 2026, compared to 51% in March of last year, according to CNN polling.

This declining support for Trump’s tactics comes as Republican senators such as Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Joni Ernst of Iowa have criticized ICE and its operations in Minnesota.",https://www.bakerinstitute.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/file-20260123-66-q7nd0h_ICE%2BTactics-Conversation.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:15.029113

The protesters were calling on airlines, particularly Delta Air Lines and Signature Aviation, to stop cooperating with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minnesota, organizers stated.

At the airport, clergy members prayed together, sang hymns, and shared stories of people detained by ICE, organizers said. Faith in Minnesota reported that the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport has deported an estimated 2,000 people. Union members also reported that ICE has arrested 12 airport workers.",https://nagalandtribune.in/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UN-human-rights-chief-condemns-abuse-in-US-immigration-enforcement.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:57:57.903985

Mayor Solomon Signs Expansive Executive Order Protecting Jersey City's Immigrants

Executive Order Expands Training, Restricts Use of City Property for Immigration Enforcement, and Builds Legal Support Infrastructure

JERSEY CITY, NJ (January 23, 2026) – Mayor James Solomon today, at the historic Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal that welcomed millions of immigrants into the United States of America, signed a comprehensive Executive Order strengthening Jersey City's immigrant protections and ensuring immigrant families can live, work, and belong in the city without fear. The Order builds on Jersey City's existing protections by modernizing training protocols, prohibiting the use of City-owned property for federal immigration enforcement operations, and expanding access to know-your-rights resources and legal support.

""Jersey City has always been America's Golden Door. This city is a place built by immigrants, for immigrants,"" said Mayor James Solomon. ""More than 40% of our residents were born abroad. They are our neighbors, our co-workers, the parents at our kids' schools. When the federal government escalates tactics that terrorize families and undermine trust in local government, we have a responsibility to use every tool we have to protect our people.""

The Executive Order operationalizes Mayor Solomon's campaign commitment to defend and expand the city's immigrant communities through three concrete actions:

Citywide Training and Protocols for Encounters with Federal Immigration Authorities

All City employees will receive standardized training on their obligations under Jersey City law, including the legal limits of cooperation with federal immigration authorities and protocols for responding to requests for access to City property or resources. The Jersey City Division of Police will issue formal written guidance governing encounters with federal immigration authorities, including protocols for verifying judicial warrants, documenting interactions, preserving body-worn camera footage, and referring affected residents to City services.

""Our residents need to know that when they call 911, report a crime, or access City services, they're interacting with Jersey City employees, and not federal immigration enforcement,"" Mayor Solomon said. ""This training makes that clear.""

Prohibition on Use of City Property for Immigration Enforcement

The Order establishes a categorical ban on the use of City-owned or City-controlled property like parking lots, vacant lots, and garages - as staging areas, processing locations, or operational bases for immigration enforcement. City Departments will post clear signage on relevant properties and implement physical access controls where appropriate.

""City property exists to serve the people of Jersey City, not to facilitate federal operations that undermine community trust,"" Mayor Solomon said. ""We've seen what happens when local governments allow their resources to be commandeered for immigration raids. That won't happen here.""

Community Partnerships for Know-Your-Rights Outreach and Legal Support

The City will partner with immigrant-serving nonprofit organizations to conduct multilingual know-your-rights outreach and develop legal support infrastructure, including virtual legal clinics, referral pathways to qualified immigration counsel, and protocols for assisting residents whose family members have been detained. The City will explore immigration defense funding models used by other municipalities during prior periods of heightened federal enforcement.

The Executive Order preserves compliance with federal law and does not obstruct lawful immigration enforcement activities conducted independently of City property, personnel, or resources. It does not limit the City's cooperation with criminal judicial warrants.

Mayor Solomon emphasized that the Order reflects Jersey City's values and its practical interest in public safety and effective governance.

""Fear is a tax on all residents,"" said Mayor Solomon. ""When immigrant families are afraid to report crimes, access healthcare, or send their kids to school, everyone in this city is less safe. This Executive Order is about protecting our residents and ensuring that Jersey City remains a place where everyone can thrive.""

The Executive Order takes effect immediately.

""Jersey City is a proud and diverse community that has been made better by generations of immigrants,” said Congressman Rob Menendez. ""At a time when Trump is deploying ICE agents across the country to intimidate and terrorize our communities, it is more critical than ever for our allies and partners at all levels of government to take every step necessary to protect our residents. We must all work together to keep our residents safe and ensure that our friends, family members, and neighbors are treated with dignity and respect. I thank Mayor Solomon for his leadership and partnership on the critical work of protecting our communities from Trump’s extreme deportation agenda.""

“Jersey City was built by immigrants who came here looking for dignity and safety. Trump tried to target us for our sanctuary status, but we are not backing down. We won’t hand over our power to ICE. We will not sell out our neighbors,” said Congresswoman LaMonica McIver. “That’s why I am proud to fully support Mayor Solomon’s orders to keep Jersey City a sanctuary city. Our government is meant to protect our communities, not terrorize them.”

“Jersey City is taking action to protect our immigrant communities because trust between residents and local government makes all of us safer,” said Assemblyman Gabriel Rodriguez. “This Executive Order ensures families can access services, engage with their community, and live without fear.”

“These policies protect the rights and safety of Jersey City residents while respecting the rule of law,” said Assemblyman Jerry Walker. “By setting clear standards for City employees, prohibiting the use of City property for immigration enforcement, and expanding access to legal resources, Jersey City is strengthening transparency and community trust. I will continue to stand with the residents of the 31st Legislative District to ensure all families feel safe accessing City services without fear.”

“Welcome Home is a community-based organization that fosters successful long-term integration of immigrants who have resettled in Jersey City. We know from the lived experience of our friends that integration is not merely a process of survival, but a pursuit of meaning, dignity, and contribution,” said Dave Mammen, Welcome Home Jersey City. Immigrants are our neighbors and contributors to community life whose successful integration is a shared civic responsibility, but it cannot be achieved without legal safeguards that are the foundation for agency, safety, trust, and participation. We therefore applaud Mayor Solomon’s efforts to protect Jersey City’s immigrant residents through his Executive Order, and we stand ready to assist.”

The groups sued the Trump administration in March over its “ideological-deportation policy” after the arrest and attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the anti-Israel protest movement at Columbia University.
“Alone I have nothing but my sense of duty,” Young wrote in reply, in a space above the listed plaintiffs that is usually left blank.
“The court recommends that an advisory jury be empaneled to assist the court in deciding factual issues,” Young wrote.
They do not apply to any such members who were convicted of a crime or whose immigration status expired.","A federal judge ruled on Thursday that academic groups suing the Trump administration to halt the deportations of students and faculty who engaged in anti-Israel protests will be granted a blanket presumption that their activity is protected free speech under the First Amendment.

The ruling from judge William Young, a Reagan appointee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, shifts the burden to the government to prove that any change in the immigration status of members of the American Association of University Professors and the Middle East Studies Association is justified.

“It shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.

The groups sued the Trump administration in March over its “ideological-deportation policy” after the arrest and attempt to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a leader of the anti-Israel protest movement at Columbia University.

“While President Trump and other administration officials have described pro-Palestinian campus protests as ‘pro-Hamas,’ they have stretched that label beyond the breaking point to encompass any speech supportive of Palestinian human rights or critical of Israel’s military actions in Gaza,” the plaintiffs wrote.

“They have left no doubt that their new policy entails the arrest, detention and deportation of noncitizen students and faculty for constitutionally protected speech and association,” they added in the complaint.

Young ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in September.

At a hearing earlier this month, Young described the actions of the Trump administration as “an unconstitutional conspiracy to pick off certain people” for their protests, Politico reported.

“I find it breathtaking that I have been compelled on the evidence to find the conduct of such high-level officers of our government—cabinet secretaries—conspired to infringe the First Amendment rights of people with such rights here in the United States,” Young said. “These cabinet secretaries have failed in their sworn duty to uphold the Constitution.”

Young’s rulings in the case have raised eyebrows over his unusual commentary and suggestions.

In September, Young attached a hand-written postcard from an anonymous sender asking, “Trump has pardons and tanks … what do you have?” to the top of his ruling.

“Alone I have nothing but my sense of duty,” Young wrote in reply, in a space above the listed plaintiffs that is usually left blank. “Together, we the people of the United States—you and me—have our magnificent Constitution.”

Young’s ruling on Thursday includes more unusual remedies and commentary on the case.

“The court recommends that an advisory jury be empaneled to assist the court in deciding factual issues,” Young wrote. “The moral effect of a jury verdict cannot be overstated. The American jury is the most robust and vital expression of direct democracy extent in the world today.”

“The people’s participation in this act of government is long overdue,” he added.

The protections extended to the plaintiffs include only non-citizens, who were members of AAUP or MESA between the time the plaintiffs brought suit and Young’s decision on the case in September. They do not apply to any such members who were convicted of a crime or whose immigration status expired.

In an appendix to Thursday’s ruling, Young mused about potential applications of his decision involving situations not directly related to the case, including the hypothetical revocation of temporary protected immigration status to Venezuelans and comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

“If it’s just speech—it may be repulsive speech or disgusting speech, but if it’s just speech, well, the Department of State can’t do that,” Young wrote. “Again, this is a hypothetical. But let’s say that happened, we’ll assume that happened. And then the person comes in and says, ‘I’m a member of this class. You can’t do that to me.’”

“Well again, the government’s going to have to prove that their reason was not in fact in retribution,” he said, “and in addition, my second, that it’s an appropriate exercise of governmental power.”

The Trump administration can appeal Young’s ruling.",https://me.jnsi.org/uploads/2025/08/Mahmoud_Khalil_2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:58:05.776008

Janet Mills on Thursday demanded the federal government provide arrest numbers, warrants and basic information about who is being detained.
The corrections officer’s car was also left after ICE detained him in Portland’s Bayside neighborhood.
Additionally, Maine organizers are helping loved ones get connected with legal counsel, as detention presents inherent challenges for due process.
In the U.S., there is no right to appointed counsel for immigration proceedings because they’re civil, not criminal, matters.","A retail worker arrested at a routine immigration check-in. A mother and a student, both asylum seekers, taken into custody. A civil engineer on a work visa and a corrections officer recruit, whose boss said he has a “squeaky clean” record and permission to work, both picked up during their commutes.

These are a few of the people U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have detained so far during their operation in Maine, which the agency said targets “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have terrorized communities.” Accounts from family members, employers and background checks of those five people failed to show evidence of criminal records. Meanwhile, the incomplete list of arrests that the federal government has shared so far included 13 people with criminal records of the nearly 100 ICE said it has arrested.

“The administration is taking 100% a dragnet approach to their operations,” said Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union.

Part of that, Mehta said, is that cruelty is the point, designed to cause suffering and fear as a deterrent. But, it’s also happening because the government has the most information about immigrants who are already in proceedings, she said.

With the Trump administration’s stated goal of 1 million deportations per year, the easiest people to go after are those the government already has personal identifying information about, Mehta said — “people that are checking in at their immigration interviews, people that are going to immigration court proceedings, people that have temporary protected status, people that are, again, lawfully here.”

Available data underscores that. Not only has the number of people in detention surged during Trump’s second term, but also the percentage of ICE detainees with no criminal record. During the first nine months of Trump’s presidency, ICE arrested more than 74,000 people with no criminal record, amounting to more than a third of the total ICE arrests over that period, according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project through a lawsuit against ICE.

Those figures don’t include arrests made by Border Patrol, which has reported record apprehensions in Maine, or people referred to ICE by other agencies.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, does not have complete information on all of the people who have been arrested in the first days of the operation in Maine but confirmed that several are asylum seekers following a lawful process.

Maine leaders demand warrants, information about ICE arrests

On Tuesday in Maine, ICE detained Yanick Joao Carneiro of Portland at a routine immigration check-in at the agency’s Scarborough field office without a warrant, according to the petition filed by his lawyer. An asylum seeker from Angola, Carneiro was waiting for an immigration court hearing in 2027. Asylum seekers are typically allowed to live in the United States while their case proceeds.

Carneiro was the first person to challenge their detention after ICE began its increased enforcement in Maine, what the agency is calling “Operation Catch of the Day.”

“While some of the door-to-door and apartment building raids may be targeted, it is clear the overall operation is anything but targeted,” Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project Executive Director Sue Roche said. “People are being racially profiled on the streets and in their cars. As is their playbook, ICE is doing everything they can to inflict maximum cruelty and chaos.”

Arrests have become quicker and quieter, as opposed to the large workplace raids seen in Los Angeles last year. ICE is also reversing longstanding policy, according to an internal memo, by asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant.

“This is not the law as I understand it,” said Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney who now lives in Maine, “and it is not the law that [the U.S. Department of Justice] has historically applied.”

In Minnesota, where a federal agent’s fatal shooting of Renee Good sparked protests and subsequent deployment of thousands more agents, the federal government is re-examining the cases of refugees, who have gone through a robust screening process and are on a path to citizenship. During Trump’s second term, there have also been instances of judges tossing out asylum cases only for people to walk outside to find ICE waiting to arrest them.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills on Thursday demanded the federal government provide arrest numbers, warrants and basic information about who is being detained. DHS told reporters on Thursday that 100 people have been arrested in the operation so far, up from the 50 reported by Fox News two days prior.

When asked whether she has any reason to doubt the numbers provided by DHS, Mehta said, “I think it’s more that I don’t have any reason to trust the information.”

Mehta also said general arrest numbers don’t truly reveal what’s happening.

“What does arrest mean?” Mehta questioned. “They’ve also arrested a ton of U.S. citizens, arrested lawful permanent residents.”

Jean-Pierre Obiang, an 18-year-old student at the University of Southern Maine, was detained after being involved in a minor traffic accident outside of Market Basket in Westbrook on Tuesday. He and his mother are asylum seekers from Gabon and have lived in Maine for three years.

In Portland on Wednesday, agents detained Micheline Ntumba after she dropped off one of her four children at Portland High School, her daughter told the Maine Monitor. Her daughter said Ntumba, who is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has a pending asylum claim and has been in the U.S. for nearly 10 years.

Then Wednesday night, ICE agents arrested a Cumberland County corrections officer recruit, whose name has not been shared — leading County Sheriff Kevin Joyce to publicly question the agency’s priorities.

Every corrections hire has to fill out documentation that proves they’re legally allowed to work in the U.S. and undergo background checks including on criminal history. The recruit had a “squeaky clean record,” as Joyce described it.

“The book and the movie do not line up,” Joyce said, referring to ICE’s claims that they’re focused on criminals. He later added, “We’re being told one story, which is totally different than what’s occurring.”

On Thursday, agents took Juan Sebastian Carvajal-Munoz, a civil engineer, in Portland while he was on his way to work. Carvajal-Munoz, who is from Colombia and in the U.S. on a work visa, has since been released, according to one of his colleagues.

DHS and ICE have not responded to questions about the basis for any of these detentions.

Agents smashed Carvajal-Munoz’s car window and left the car running after taking him. Portland police officers went to the area after a report of a disturbance but identified no public safety concerns and did not take custody of the car, said spokesperson Brad Nadeau. The corrections officer’s car was also left after ICE detained him in Portland’s Bayside neighborhood.

“They left it right on the side of the street,” Joyce said. “Folks, that’s bush league policing.”

Across the country, federal agents have also left people’s vehicles and other personal belongings behind. The city of St. Paul paused the towing of abandoned vehicles due to the ICE surge in Minnesota.

In Maine, the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and community organizers are mapping out a plan for a more coordinated system to return items to the family members of those detained. That type of grassroots effort to create de facto middle men has been seen in other states, too.

Additionally, Maine organizers are helping loved ones get connected with legal counsel, as detention presents inherent challenges for due process.

In the U.S., there is no right to appointed counsel for immigration proceedings because they’re civil, not criminal, matters. People in detention are less likely to get an attorney because facilities are often located in remote areas and because there are few places where attorneys can meet with their clients while they’re in custody, even by phone.

In turn, Mehta said, that means people are left trying to navigate the complex system themselves and often unable to make claims.

“You have people going through a faster, much more unfair process, where they are functionally being processed by the immigration court and expedited into a deportation system,” she said. “I think it would be absurd to pretend that it is a benefit for someone to be going through the proceedings while they’re in detention.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/no-ice-sign-3-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:58:17.649973

Want this delivered to your inbox? Sign up for future newsletters.

This week, The Associated Press revealed an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo issued in May 2025. It authorizes agents to enter a private home to make an arrest without first obtaining a warrant signed by a judge. The guidance — which numerous legal experts say likely violates the Fourth Amendment — represents just the latest flashpoint in a dizzying year of efforts by the Trump administration to expand the enforcement of immigration law.

Those efforts have included attempts to stretch the use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act, the controversial transfers of some detainees to a violent prison in El Salvador, and a rapid push to expand U.S. detention capacity — first with tents, and, as recently reported, into industrial warehouses as well.

These intensified enforcement efforts have led to record-setting numbers of people in immigration detention — about 73,000 as of this week — and to sustained media coverage and public outcry.

But even as immigration actions have dominated the spotlight, the administration has also moved quickly in other areas of the criminal justice landscape.

Nowhere has that been more apparent than at the Justice Department, where under President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi, the department has seen one of its most tumultuous periods in modern history. Earlier this week, legal analyst Chris Geidner called the “destruction” of the department over the past year “hard to overstate.” Over 6,400 employees (out of about 108,000) have left, with hundreds presumably fired for having worked on investigations that Trump considered illegitimate, including probes into the rioters at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and inquiries into criminal conduct by Trump during his first term.

The exodus has hit divisions across the Justice Department, including career national security and counterterrorism prosecutors, as well as the section that handles sensitive public corruption cases. But the brain drain has been especially pronounced at the Civil Rights Division. As of August 2025, about three-quarters of the lawyers there had either resigned or been fired, according to Bloomberg News. Many left as the department turned against its historical task of addressing discrimination against marginalized groups, and instead, urged its lawyers to pursue cases against what Bondi described as illegal Diversity, Equity and Inclusion mandates.

Not only has the division abandoned much of its traditional remit, like investigating local police departments for civil rights abuses, it has also taken on new, unfamiliar work, like a Second Amendment unit focused on “expanding gun rights.”

In response to criticism of this new direction, a Justice Department spokesperson said that Bondi and Civil Rights division chief Harmeet Dhillon have helped restore the division to its “original mission” of protecting the rights of all Americans. It’s worth noting that Congress created the division as part of the 1957 Civil Rights Act, aimed at fighting racist Jim Crow segregation and disenfranchisement.

The first year of the administration has also been characterized by retreat from the Justice Department’s historic pledge of independence from the White House. Bondi issued a “zealous advocacy” memo nearly a year ago, declaring in essence that the department lawyers are, in fact, Trump’s lawyers. Since then, many of the department’s most visible moves have been in service to Trump’s political conflicts as much as to traditional enforcement priorities. A growing list of the president’s antagonists, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have found themselves under investigation or indictment. In several of those cases, courts have thrown out charges or issued sharp rebukes of DOJ behavior.

At least one federal judge has also taken aim at the department's decision to cut more than half a billion dollars in Office of Justice Programs grants. The money had been allocated to local governments, law enforcement agencies and nonprofits for everything from police training and equipment, to services for crime victims, community violence interruption programs and justice research. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta called the cuts ‘shameful,’ even as he ruled challengers were in the wrong court to try to stop it.

The Justice Department defended the cuts by arguing the awards no longer fit department priorities, alongside broader cost-cutting efforts.

My colleagues Sophia Nabours and Geoff Hing found that the cancellations created immediate disruptions for recipients who had to pause or scale back work, leave positions open, or lay off staff. In Shreveport, Louisiana, a victim-support nonprofit called Moms on a Mission, which works to support victims of gun violence, described having to pull back on trauma counseling and grief support groups after the cuts.

Similarly, Daphne Duret and I found how the cuts affected a program in rural Alabama that paired sheriff’s deputies with mental health professionals when responding to certain calls. The cuts led to staff departures, and forced officers back to handling mental health calls alone.

The effects of funding cuts for research go beyond what happens at an individual department or agency. The Brennan Center, a liberal-leaning criminal-justice think tank, noted that ending research “make[s] it harder for policymakers of all political stripes to fix shared problems.”

Some also worry that the cuts may imperil some of the dramatic decreases in crime rates the country has seen over recent years. In places like Baltimore, local officials have directly tied improved crime rates to nonprofit work that was cut after DOJ grants were eliminated.

Then there is clemency, the most direct presidential tool in the criminal justice system. Trump began his second term with an unprecedented mass pardon covering roughly 1,500 people charged or convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Since then, the White House has continued to use clemency power in ways that depart from the Justice Department’s traditional review process — a shift underscored by the administration’s dismissal of pardon attorney Liz Oyer, after she declined to fast-track a pardon for actor Mel Gibson, a personal friend of the president. Oyer has since written that Trump is making a “mockery” of the clemency process.

The White House has generally defended its pardons because recipients were “overprosecuted by a weaponized DOJ” under then-President Joe Biden.

The result has led to an informal process that allows wealthy and politically connected people to skip the line, reported The Wall Street Journal. The president’s clemency docket now has a striking appearance of quid pro quo patronage. In several high-profile cases, Trump has granted pardons immediately after the recipient (or their close relatives) poured money into Trump-aligned political committees. In one characteristic example, Trump pardoned former nursing home executive Paul Walczak of tax crimes just weeks after Walczak’s mother attended a $1 million-per-seat fundraiser at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Because Trump’s clemency efforts have been focused on wealthy people convicted of white-collar crimes, he has also erased a historic amount of restitution owed to crime victims and fines owed to the U.S. government. This week, NBC News reported that Trump’s year-one pardons wiped out nearly $300 million owed by people convicted of crimes. By comparison, over the 12 years of the Obama and Biden administrations, just over $3 million in restitution and fines were eliminated.

But while Trump has used clemency aggressively for a select set of well-connected recipients, the broader thrust of the administration’s criminal justice agenda has been toward harsher — and in some cases — more violent punishment.

The Trump Justice Department signaled early in his second term that it would lean back into the federal death penalty, after authoring an execution spree late in his first term. In between the two Trump presidencies, Biden commuted nearly all federal death sentences, leaving Trump without a long list of prisoners awaiting execution. In response, the administration is now pushing several states to file charges against those same people, which could lead to executions under the authority of state laws instead.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/iTWJ-RQMlxHa_VAzhERxIvS34pATQvOIYXMieZLKYZg/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC8zNHpiYTZhczhy/ODhuNzdud2hxZHlv/YW04MzBhLzI2MDEy/M19HRVRUWV9DQUVT/U0FZMDEyNF9zb2Np/YWwuanBn,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:19.286095

Thousands of demonstrators who oppose the crackdown on immigration crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave.","Federal officers shot and killed a person in Minneapolis on Saturday as the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continues across the area, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

DHS described the suspect as an illegal immigrant, while Minneapolis police said he was a 37-year-old white man who was a U.S. citizen.

DHS said the man was wanted on violent assault charges, adding that he was armed with a gun and two magazines.

The agency said the suspect approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun ahead of the deadly shooting.

""The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted,"" DHS wrote on X.

""Fearing for his life and the lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. Medics on scene immediately delivered medical aid to the subject but was pronounced dead at the scene,"" DHS added.

DHS said the suspect ""wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement."" The agency added that about 200 rioters arrived at the scene and began to obstruct and assault law enforcement.

""Crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement,"" DHS said. ""This situation is evolving, and more information is forthcoming.""

At a news conference, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino identified the suspect as an ""illegal alien,"" who has a criminal history. He said the man's death was a result of ""an attack on law enforcement.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara later spoke at a separate news conference with Mayor Jacob Frey. O'Hara's information about the person who was killed conflicts with DHS's report.

“Based on the information that we have, which is very limited, this is a 37-year-old white male who is a U.S. citizen,"" O'Hara told reporters.

O’Hara said the man's only previous interaction with law enforcement -- as far as he knew -- was for traffic tickets.

""And we believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry,” he said.

Gov. Tim Walz criticized DHS for sharing the information, as well as a photo of a gun, on social media. He said the information was unrelated to the deadly shooting.

""It's nonsense, people,"" he said. ""It's nonsense and it's lies.""

The City of Minneapolis said it is aware of reports of another shooting involving federal law enforcement, adding that the city is working to confirm more details.

""We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,"" the city wrote on X.

Frey addressed President Donald Trump directly during the news conference, telling the president to ""act like a leader.""

""How many times must local and national leaders plead with you, Donald Trump, that this is not creating safety in our city?"" Frey said. “What exactly are you accomplishing? If the goal was to achieve peace and safety, this is doing the opposite.”

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar expressed outrage at the shooting of a man during an immigration operation.

“Donald Trump and all your lieutenants who ordered this ICE surge: watch the horrific video of the killing today. The world is watching. Thousands of citizens stopped and harassed. Local police no longer able to do their work. Kids hiding. Schools closed. Get ICE out of Minnesota,” Klobuchar said on X.

Walz said he has been in contact with the White House following the shooting.

""I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning,"" Walz, who is a Democrat, wrote on X.

""Minnesota has had it,"" he added. ""This is sickening.""

Walz also also demanded that Trump end the the ongoing operation in Minnesota.

""Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now,"" he wrote.

Trump addressed the deadly shooting on Truth Social. He also shared the same photo DHS posted on X.

""This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off?"" Trump wrote, in part.

""LET OUR ICE PATRIOTS DO THEIR JOB! 12,000 Illegal Alien Criminals, many of them violent, have been arrested and taken out of Minnesota. If they were still there, you would see something far worse than you are witnessing today!"" he added.

The details surrounding what led up to the shooting weren’t immediately clear.

Thousands of demonstrators who oppose the crackdown on immigration crowded the city’s streets in frigid weather, calling for federal law enforcement to leave.

Protesters started gathering in the Twin Cities since January 7 after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.

The agent, who has been identified as Jonathan Ross, fired his gun after Good allegedly tried to ram him and other officers with her SUV. Ross reportedly suffered internal bleeding when he was hit by her vehicle.

Images circulated on social media Friday of work trucks being stopped by ICE agents, including one such stop at 22nd and Swan Friday morning, though it's not clear if ICE made arrests at the time.
Around 6:40 a.m., ICE agents approached the employee and asked him for identification.
She also would not comment on whether there are, or will soon be, more ICE agents operating in Tucson or Phoenix.
Responding to Friday's ICE activity, Tucson Mayor Regina Romero urged Tucsonans to remain peaceful if they protest immigration-enforcement activity.","Immigration agents in Tucson made multiple arrests Friday in operations spanning the city, from Barrio Santa Rosa to an east-side sushi restaurant, and even briefly questioned a city employee before noticing the logo on his truck, city officials said.

Three people from Venezuela — all with pending asylum cases, a relative said — were arrested after masked agents pulled over their vehicle in front of the Drachman Montessori Magnet School, on 22nd Street and South 10th Avenue, according to witnesses and Arizona Rep. Alma Hernandez, a Tucson Democrat.

Drachman Principal Jesús Celaya said agents, apparently with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, arrested three of four people who were in the vehicle they'd pulled over in front of the school's playground around 11 a.m. Friday.

Dozens of children were on the playground at the time, he said. Celaya brought those children inside and decided to delay the planned physical-education class for kindergarten students until ICE left.

""I didn’t want children to witness it,"" he said, adding he was also concerned for students' safety.

""One of the ICE agents had a pepper spray can in his hands,"" he said. ""The fumes of that could definitely travel through the wind to children who are trying to go to school. ... The choice of the location didn’t seem logical or safe for the public, including just kids trying to go through their school day.""

A 29-year-old female passenger in the vehicle, who was not detained, said she was in the car with her husband, brother and sister-in-law. At first, agents only took her husband and brother into custody.

But then, ""my sister-in-law was asking the officer a lot of questions,"" she said, speaking in Spanish. ""And the officer felt offended, and he arrested her there, too.""

All have pending asylum cases, said the woman, who asked the Star to identify her by her second name, Patricia. The family has been checking in with ICE every three months and hasn't had any problems until now, she said.

Patricia, who arrived in the U.S. in October 2023 with her husband, said she pleaded with an ICE officer to let her family members go.

""I simply started crying and I said to him, 'Please, may God touch your heart, you are a human being. Please, I beg you. We are people, we are not criminals, we are honest people. Don't do this to us.' I spoke to him, I cried, but they didn't care, they simply took the three of them,"" she said. ""Why didn't they take me? I don't know — God's mercy.""

Hernandez, the state lawmaker, said arresting a family in front of an elementary school is ""reckless,"" particularly because the family has an active asylum case.

""They all had proper documentation to show they are legally here while their case is being processed,"" Hernandez said in a news release. ""ICE was made aware of this and still took them. This puts families, children, and entire neighborhoods like mine at risk, and demonstrates a blatant disregard for public safety.""

Images circulated on social media Friday of work trucks being stopped by ICE agents, including one such stop at 22nd and Swan Friday morning, though it's not clear if ICE made arrests at the time.

One city worker, a male employee in the Department of Transportation and Mobility, was questioned briefly by an agent at a convenience store on Irvington Road near Benson Highway on Friday morning, said City Manager Timothy Thomure in a written statement late Friday.

Around 6:40 a.m., ICE agents approached the employee and asked him for identification. As the man returned to his work vehicle, an agent noticed the City of Tucson logo and pointed it out to another agent. All three agents then turned and walked away, Thomure said.

Thomure said the incident is a worrisome indication that ICE isn't targeting ""the worst of the worst,"" but community members.

""It is deeply concerning that our employee seems to have been randomly selected for questioning and that the only thing that may have spared him"" was the logo on his vehicle, Thomure said. ""This encounter does not align with what federal immigration agencies have stated previously that their enforcement is driven by criminal warrants targeting the 'worst of the worst.' In fact, this encounter appears to be nothing more than the selection of a random member of our community who met an unstated profile established by the current federal administration.""

Multiple incidents this week

Friday's ICE operations seem to indicate an escalation, Pima County Attorney Laura Conover said.

""As has been widely reported, today apparently marked a significant change in circumstances with increased ICE activity throughout many of our neighborhoods across the County,"" she said in a written statement late Friday. ""Some of the activity observed today looked nothing like what we are familiar with from our local law enforcement. ... I will continue not to rush to judgment. But neither will I tolerate illegal conduct if proof of it comes to me.""

Conover encouraged members of the public to submit any photos or videos they believe show ""improper or illegal conduct"" to the County Attorney's Office website at pcao.pima.gov.

""I remind the community again to use your constitutional rights, to use your voice, to make yourself heard, to join and support each other in solidarity, and to protect one another. And I need you to do all of this peacefully and from a distance so each one of you goes home safe and sound each night.""

Also on Friday morning, apparent ICE officers detained an employee at Sakura restaurant, 6534 E. Tanque Verde Road. They arrested an employee before doors opened, which resulted in other employees not showing up for work and off-duty employees being called in, said chef Isaiah Gamez.

Video from the scene shows a group of masked agents wearing uniforms that said ""POLICE ICE"" taking one man.

""They took one of our group; the rest are at home,"" Gamez said.

ICE's media team said they would not have time Friday to respond to the Star's 12:30 p.m. query about how many people ICE arrested in Tucson on Friday, and whether they were ""targeted"" arrests of people known to ICE.

""There are about a dozen or so ahead of your queries so your deadline will not be met,"" ICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe said in a 1 p.m. email.

In the email, Pitts O'Keefe said she could not share any information about people ICE arrests unless the Star provides the person's name and ""alien number,"" a unique identification number assigned by the Department of Homeland Security.

She also would not comment on whether there are, or will soon be, more ICE agents operating in Tucson or Phoenix.

""For OP Sec (operational security) reasons, we don’t give out the number of officers and agents in field,"" she said in the Friday email.

ICE breaks truck window

Also, on Sunday, Jan. 18, on Tucson's south side, ICE agents broke a driver's side truck window while questioning the man inside, before taking him into custody, according to video of the incident shared with the Star.

Steven Davis, the Rapid Response Network volunteer who shot the video, said he watched an ICE agent first use a device to break the driver's-side window before breaking the rest of it using his elbow and fist.

Another officer on the passenger side of the vehicle then opened the passenger side door and reached across to open the driver's-side door for the other agent, who took the man into custody, the video shows.

ICE did not respond to the Star's queries about why the man was detained and why agents had to break his window.

Davis said he noticed ICE following the man from the El Super grocery store to a gas station across the street, so Davis followed the ICE agents to act as a witness.

After the man's arrest, Davis said he noticed the man had work tools in the back of his truck, bags of groceries in the front seat of the car and a half-eaten croissant on the armrest.

Observing ICE activity is emotionally painful, but necessary, Davis said.

""It's difficult to watch,"" he said. ""Our job is to be there for our neighbors and whatever this is for me, it's so much worse for the ones who are detained and the family and friends they leave behind.""

Local advocates worry the flurry of activity indicates a real surge in ICE activity in Tucson, even as the number of unverified or false reports has also increased in recent weeks.

Responding to Friday's ICE activity, Tucson Mayor Regina Romero urged Tucsonans to remain peaceful if they protest immigration-enforcement activity.

""You have the right to protest and document these activities. It's very important to remain peaceful while you do so,"" Romero said in an Instagram post. ""The Trump administration wants to create fear and chaos in our community. Please stay safe and do not physically engage with federal agents or damage property.""

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes is also encouraging observers to document federal agents' activities through photo and video, in response to the fatal shooting of Minneapolis mom Renee Good on Jan. 7 by an ICE agent. Mayes has created a website for members of the public to report ""potential unlawful activity by federal agents or personnel,"" including immigration agents.

Patricia, whose Venezuelan family members were arrested Friday, said her family doesn't have an attorney, nor money for one. She's deeply anxious over what she's read about how the U.S. government treats ""Latinos.""

""It's something that has me worried,"" she said. ""I thought that here in the United States I was going to have a better life, a more peaceful life, and it turns out that now I live in agony with the government here.""

It is worth remembering that immigration enforcement is a civil procedure and that most people detained by ICE do not have criminal records.
Back in 2024, I argued that Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportation was an atrocity in the making.
And when the architects of mass deportation are themselves motivated by racial contempt for their targets, then — as my friend Adam Serwer once wrote — the cruelty will inevitably be the point.
What I Wrote I wrote about the madness on display in President Trump’s letter to the president of Norway.","The public face of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a brutal, paramilitary force of masked men who hunt immigrants and terrorize American cities on behalf of the president of the United States.

The not-so-public face is somehow even worse.

ICE operates detention facilities across the country, holding tens of thousands of people arrested on immigration charges. President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill included $45 billion for the construction of new detention space, including facilities with tent-like structures meant to house a growing influx of people seized by ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents.

These facilities, human rights researchers and former detainees report, are cramped, squalid and dangerous. “The food they gave us was not edible,” according to one woman initially detained at a Chicago airport along with her 5-year-old daughter. “We didn’t eat anything for days. They didn’t even give us water to drink.” Eventually, the woman and her daughter were transferred to the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Dilley, Texas, which the woman “described as a living hell.”

“Sometimes my daughter doesn’t want to leave our room because she is so sad and just wants to leave this prison so badly. She cries and cries about all of this. I am so worried that I barely eat,” the woman said.

After conducting two oversight visits to Camp East Montana — an ICE detention facility on the grounds of Fort Bliss in El Paso, which served as an internment camp during World War II — Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas warned of “dangerous and inhumane” conditions in a letter to the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem:

It is increasingly clear that it is not a safe nor professionally managed facility. Continuing to detain people at Camp East Montana means continually exposing people to risks from bad water, unhygienic conditions, poorly built facilities and a general lack of security and reliable management.

A separate letter to Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, sent by the American Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups, described hellish abuse at the facility: “Detained immigrants are held for weeks at a time with no access to the outdoors in cramped, squalid soft-sided tents with 72 people per unit, where toilets and showers flood eating areas with raw sewage.” Detainees allege that they were threatened, beaten or sexually abused as punishment for conduct ranging from simple requests for basic necessities to refusing to sign deportation orders. Based on interviews with more than 45 detained immigrants, the groups wrote that “Officers have beaten detainees and used threats of violence, criminal charges and imprisonment in attempts to coerce people held at Fort Bliss to leave the United States and cross the border into Mexico, even if they are not subject to a removal order to Mexico.”

One Cuban man detained at Fort Bliss reported that officers crushed his testicles with their fingers, slammed him against a wall and beat him such that he couldn’t touch the left side of his head without pain for about a month, all because he wouldn’t accept deportation to Mexico.

Officers at the same facility beat one detainee, a teenager, so badly that he “sustained injuries across his body, lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital in an ambulance.” His offense? He had switched off the overhead light in a housing unit.

At least 32 people died in ICE custody in 2025, making it the agency’s deadliest year since 2004. In just the first ten days of 2026, four people died in ICE custody. One of these deaths — of a Cuban migrant held in solitary confinement at Camp East Montana — was ruled a homicide.

It is worth remembering that immigration enforcement is a civil procedure and that most people detained by ICE do not have criminal records. In the main, these are not violent people threatening the safety and integrity of the nation; they are ordinary men, women and children who have been caught in an authoritarian dragnet. Their treatment is less a necessary part of immigration detention than it is a punishment — deliberate pain inflicted on migrants in order to force them out of the country, whether or not they have a legal right to be here. (And it should go without saying that people found guilty of criminal offenses have an absolute right to fair and humane treatment.)

Back in 2024, I argued that Donald Trump’s plan for mass deportation was an atrocity in the making.

Imagine the conditions that might prevail for hundreds of thousands of people crammed into hastily constructed camps, the targets of a vicious campaign of demonization meant to build support for their detention and deportation. If undocumented immigrants really are, as Trump says, “poisoning the blood of our country,” then how do we respond? What do we do about poison? Well, we neutralize it.

I also noted that any mass deportation effort would involve a “mass campaign of racial and ethnic profiling” that would almost certainly stoke “strife and pervasive civil conflict.”

There is an idea, among those sympathetic to the president’s efforts to reduce illegal immigration, that you could have a more humane program of mass deportation and accomplish the overall goal of increased removals without a surfeit of brutality. This is a fantasy. Mass removal is itself inhumane. There is no way to accomplish it without subjecting countless people to the treatment we are seeing now in the streets and in the jails. And when the architects of mass deportation are themselves motivated by racial contempt for their targets, then — as my friend Adam Serwer once wrote — the cruelty will inevitably be the point.

What I Wrote

I wrote about the madness on display in President Trump’s letter to the president of Norway.

There is no need to go on about the lunacy of this letter. Not even the president’s most eager apologists could spin this as anything other than what it is: a disgrace. The letter is an astonishing glimpse into the mind of a man who rejects the core duty of his office, faithful representation of the American people. The only thing he cares about — the only thing that motivates him — is the immediate satisfaction of his every impulse.

I also joined my colleagues Kathleen Kingsbury and Ross Douthat in Los Angeles to discuss the first year of the Trump administration.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/Newsletter-6973f026-qcgm/Newsletter-6973f026-qcgm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:58:16.513042

The White House has pressured immigration officials to fulfill the president’s goal, an effort that requires targeting immigrants well beyond violent criminals.

But Americans broadly do not support such a sweeping approach. In the poll, 38 percent of Americans said the federal government should prioritize deporting immigrants who have committed serious crimes, while 21 percent said the administration should only deport serious criminals.

“ICE should focus on the bad hombres. The bad hombres, that’s it, not the cleaning ladies,” said Rep. Maria Salazar (R-Fla.). “One thing is the gardeners, another thing is the gangsters. One thing is the cooks, the other thing is the coyotes.”

The White House, so far, has maintained its heavy enforcement presence in Minneapolis, betting that the issue is messaging, not its policies. The president said this week that his administration needs to do more to highlight the criminals they’ve arrested during the Minnesota crackdown.

A person close to the White House, granted anonymity to speak candidly, said Republicans have to keep the focus on criminal arrests, public safety and the Trump administration’s success in securing the southern border, which are more popular with voters across the board. Otherwise, the person worried, the GOP is losing support with moderate Republicans, independents, Latinos and young voters.

“Do I think we have to be a little bit smarter about it? I don’t think there’s any question about it,” the person said of the party’s messaging. “The reason why crime is down across the country, especially in these Democratic states and these blue cities, is because of one thing — the only thing that changed is President Trump’s policies.”

Most Trump voters do support his mass deportations campaign, with 55 percent saying the actions, including his widespread deployment of ICE agents across the U.S. are “about right,” the POLITICO Poll with Public First finds. But there is a notable split between Trump’s strongest 2024 voters and those who are more malleable: Among the 2024 Trump voters who do not identify as MAGA, a more moderate group of Trump supporters, 29 percent say his campaign is too aggressive. Seventeen percent of these voters say it is not aggressive enough.

And a 43 percent plurality of non-MAGA Trump voters say they support the goals of Trump’s deportation agenda but not how he is implementing it, compared to 28 percent of MAGA Trump voters — his strongest supporters — who say the same.

The poll results suggest Americans are uneasy with the Trump administration’s approach, and that even many Trump voters who support increased immigration enforcement oppose the president’s sprawling deportation campaign.

“They are going to be worried about, OK, is ICE using excessive force? Are they going after, you know, moms and dads that have a clean record?” said Brendan Steinhauser, a GOP strategist in Texas. “I don’t think that plays well with independents and moderates. I don’t think it plays well with center-right Republicans. It does seem to play well with a smaller subset of the Republican Party. But I don’t think that’s where, nationally, the people who swing elections are on this.”

Some battleground Republicans, worried immigration enforcement could become a political albatross in an already tough election year, are trying to walk a tightrope of showing support for ICE in general while also calling for restraint in their actions.

“ICE exists to carry out laws passed by Congress, and in that sense, its role is absolutely necessary, but at the same time, enforcement must be professional and targeted and humane,” said Republican candidate Trinh Ha, a Vietnamese immigrant running in Washington’s eighth district, a seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier. “What’s happening right now underscores why enforcement must always be paired with restraint and accountability.”

A White House spokesperson said the president’s mass deportations agenda was a central campaign promise and argued that the administration’s enforcement — and its message — has and will continue to focus on the “worst of the worst,” including people with convictions for assault, rape and murder. The official said the administration won’t allow criminals to remain free in cities where “Democrats don’t cooperate with us,” adding that there “wouldn’t be a need for as much of an ICE presence if we had cooperation.”

The president has expressed concerns about how ICE is being perceived. He posted Tuesday on Truth Social that the Department of Homeland Security and ICE needed to do more to highlight the “murderers and other criminals” they’re detaining, arguing that it would help boost Americans’ support of ICE. He then took to the podium during a White House press briefing and spent the first 10 minutes sifting through photos of immigrants who had committed crimes.

“Because Minnesota is so much in the fray, and I say to my people all the time — and they’re so busy doing other things — ‘they don’t say it like they should,’” Trump said. “They are apprehending murderers and drug dealers, a lot of bad people. … I say why don’t you talk about that? Because people don’t know.”

Vice President JD Vance traveled to Minneapolis on Thursday, where he said he wanted to “lower the temperature.” Flanked by immigration agents, Vance empathized with community members’ concerns, while blaming state and local officials’ lack of cooperation and far-left agitators for fueling chaos in the city.

“We want to be able to enforce the immigration laws on the one hand, while on the other hand, we want to make sure the people in Minneapolis are able to go about their day,” he said.

It remains to be seen whether the administration’s message will be enough to tame the concerns coursing through the party. While many Republicans remain confident that they are still most trusted on immigration and border security — and that Democrats will ultimately be seen as too extreme in their response — others warn that Trump’s base won’t be the voters who swing races in 2026.

Immigration still ranks far below economic concerns for voters, according to The POLITICO Poll. When asked to select the top three issues facing the country, just 21 percent cited illegal immigration, compared with half who said the cost of living. But as the White House continues to make immigration a policy priority, crucial swaths of swing voters and soft Trump supporters are expressing discomfort with some of the administration’s tactics.

“I’d reframe the ‘raids’ narrative,” said Buzz Jacobs, a Republican strategist and White House immigration policy director for former President George W. Bush. “The reality is that most enforcement activity is routine and never becomes a headline.”

About the survey

Under new guidance for 2026, field offices for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services are being asked to provide between 100 and 200 denaturalization cases a month. “We look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Justice,” a USCIS spokesperson said, “to restore integrity to America’s immigration system.”

Since President Trump’s first term, he has embraced denaturalization as part of his crackdown on immigration. However, this latest move is misguided and unwise. Stripping away citizenship from foreign-born Americans raises serious legal, practical and ethical concerns.

To be clear, “denaturalization” is the revocation of citizenship of a naturalized immigrant by the government. It potentially applies to the roughly 26 million people in the U.S. who were born abroad and have gone through the process of becoming Americans.

Under existing law, the grounds for stripping a person of their citizenship are narrow. A person can be denaturalized if it is found that they concealed disqualifying facts in their application, or if they obtained citizenship illegally. It’s a long and complicated procedure, which is one reason why it’s rare. Between 2017 and 2025, the Justice Department filed just over 120 such cases.

Now the administration wants to examine several hundred cases a month, which would amount to the largest increase of denaturalization efforts in modern U.S. history.

This expansion of denaturalization efforts runs counter to Supreme Court precedent. In 1943, the high court emphasized that citizenship should not be taken away lightly, noting, “We believe the facts and the law should be construed as far as is reasonably possible in favor of the citizen.” In case after case, the court has rejected attempts by the government to revoke citizenship as inconsistent with First and 14th amendment protections. In 2017, the court found that, in cases based on alleged fraud, the government must prove that any misrepresentation directly affected the citizenship process. So the administration will face high legal hurdles as it seeks to ramp up denaturalization cases.

Logistically, increasing the number of denaturalization cases will result in a waste of government resources. Each case requires an investigation, a civil or criminal proceeding, and then a judicial order. This takes time, money and manpower. Instead of poring over past citizenship decisions, USCIS would be better off dealing with its record backlog of 11.3 million pending immigration cases.

On a broader level, going after people who have already followed the process for obtaining citizenship sends a disturbing message. It will signal to naturalized citizens that they are second-class Americans, subject to investigation by the government at any time. It will contribute to confusion and anxiety in immigrant communities and erode public confidence in the value of American citizenship itself.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said in December that “Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization.” She’s not wrong. Nor is denaturalization new — it is a longstanding procedure used by administrations of both parties.

Yet the danger of setting denaturalization targets or goals is that cases will be brought to meet arbitrary quotas, rather than on their own merits. This opens the door to denaturalization being used improperly as a political weapon or as an immigration enforcement mechanism. The administration can do a great deal of harm to naturalized citizens merely by launching a case against them. This should alarm all Americans, including those conservatives who say they are against intrusive big government.

Congress should not be afraid to demand oversight and compliance with the law, especially given Trump’s sagging poll numbers. In December, an AP poll found that only 38 percent of Americans approved of his handling of immigration. Targeting U.S. citizens seems like a long way from the president’s campaign pledges to go after criminal undocumented immigrants, the people that McLaughlin has called the “worst of the worst.” This expansion of denaturalization efforts cannot go unchecked.

Prioritizing denaturalization is divisive and does not make our country stronger or safer. It is an action that should be reserved for egregious cases, like war criminals and terrorists — not ordinary Americans.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/GettyImages-2233441251.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-24 11:58:42.514873

Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an “abject lie.” It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family’s attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

School officials say ICE used the boy as ‘bait’

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,” she said.

The father told the child’s mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn’t leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

“Why detain a 5-year-old?” the superintendent asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

Other adults at the scene wanted to care for the boy

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

ICE denies what school officials and neighbors said

“ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as ‘bait,’” said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ”

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.”

The officers, she said, “abided by the father’s wishes to keep the child with him.""

Bovino and ICE officials criticize media coverage

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the “false media narrative” about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and “did everything they could to reunite him with his family.”

“Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

Where are the father and son now?

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children’s Rights, who visited the facility last week.

“The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,” Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

“I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,” Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers “get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.”

The family’s lawyer was unable to reach them

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,” he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch’s office said he was unavailable to comment.

What is the Trump administration's policy on detaining children?

The child’s immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn’t, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

“This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,” Homan said last year on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

The Trump administration last July issued a “Detained Parents Directive” that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE “should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.” The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

“If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child’s immigration status,” said Neha Desai, managing director at Children’s Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. “When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child’s care.”

Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected.

Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system — and privately run holding facilities — expected to grow even larger.

“Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up,” he told The Marshall Project.

On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department — though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Contractors like GEO Group and its primary competitor, CoreCivic, welcomed the news. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes.

At the beginning of 2025, the companies had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group, based near Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s home in Florida, seemed particularly well-suited.

“This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments — in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring — to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” George Zoley, the Greek-born founder of GEO Group, said during a quarterly earnings call in February.

By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement.

Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America.

“Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst.

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport 1 million people a year. In December, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, claimed it had deported 605,000 people since Trump was elected and that an additional 1.9 million people self-deported. The department dangled financial carrots like a “free flight home for Christmas and $1,000.”

Immigrant arrests climbed. In December, ICE detained 68,000 people nationwide, up from about 40,000 at the beginning of the year. That’s more than ever before on record, yet only a quarter of those people had been convicted of a crime, including low-level offenses. Another 25% had criminal cases pending.

Detention capacity is still far from ICE’s stated goal of having access to more than 100,000 beds at a time to detain immigrants.

Early last year, GEO Group said it expected to provide 32,000 beds for ICE, more than double the amount at the end of the Biden administration. In doing so, the firm told investors that it was likely that all of its idle prisons would be activated by the end of the year.

GEO Group resumed admitting immigrants at its 1,940-bed Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California after a COVID ban was lifted. On the East Coast, in Newark, New Jersey, GEO Group’s 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility opened with the help of an ICE contract valued at $1 billion. In the Midwest, North Lake Processing Center, a notorious 1,800-bed facility in Baldwin, Michigan, also opened.

As of Dec. 15, GEO Group had idle facilities with nearly 4,700 empty beds in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas, according to its report to investors.

CoreCivic also ramped up, but not as quickly as investors expected. Notably, in March, the Tennessee-based firm said it resumed “operations and care” for up to 2,400 people, including families, at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in South Texas, a contract expected to generate $180 million in annual revenue.

“Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger, a former correctional officer himself, said during an earnings call in May.

At the end of September, CoreCivic reported that it had idle facilities with more than 7,000 empty beds.

Adding pressure to stock prices, the federal government apprehended fewer people at the U.S. southern border, lowering the number of new arrivals to detain or monitor. Still, in December, GEO Group touted that the “alien population” in the United States holds strong at 16.8 million, citing a figure from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit seeking to reduce immigration. GEO Group also said that 182,000 people were being monitored in the community for ICE’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (down from about 370,000 under the Biden administration).

Zoley said GEO Group subsidiary BI Incorporated could scale up its monitoring contract to serve millions of people for ICE.

The Trump administration is also still ramping up. And investors and observers expect the system to keep growing this year.

“As they expand their infrastructure — that includes officers, buildings, fleets, buses, planes, technology — then that’s when we are probably going to see more people, more numbers captured into all of this,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a national human rights nonprofit that monitors the prison industry.

The Department of Homeland Security recently signed a $140 million contract to buy planes from Boeing for deportations. Thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents are being recruited, with others offered $50,000 signing bonuses to come out of retirement. More local police and sheriff departments have formal agreements to support national immigration enforcement efforts.

The White House and ICE see publicly traded private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic as “allies and assets” to their ongoing efforts to deport many more people, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“The contractors are the consequence of the policy choice made by this administration,” he said.

And as a libertarian, he said he views illegal immigration as the consequence of a broken immigration system. He described the Trump administration’s immigration policy as “indiscriminate mass deportation.”

“If you go down the list, it’s hard to find a right that they haven’t violated in the Constitution,” he said. “I find it incredibly troubling that they are getting away with it so far.”

He said trying to open 100,000 ICE detention beds nationwide is an “absurd goal” that has required the government to arrest people for a far broader set of reasons than previous administrations have used.

“There aren’t enough criminal immigrants in the United States that they can catch to fill those facilities, so this is all about caging a bunch of peaceful people who aren’t bothering anyone,” Bier said.

He expects the Trump administration to surpass its detention bed goal.

“They could easily be at 200,000 by the end of this term,” he said. “The main limitation would just be the personnel to man that. You have to find actual people willing to do this work. But in terms of just paying for it, they got way more money than they could possibly spend on this.”

Gomes, the analyst, said that as ICE brings more people into work, it could improve the financial results of GEO Group and CoreCivic.

“As those employees come on, you will see the number of detentions increase,” he said.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/uploads/station/2095/fbShare.png?r=57652,N,,2026-01-24 15:58:43.572055

The case, Barbara v. Trump, challenges President Trump’s executive order denying citizenship to children born in the United States if neither parent is a citizen or lawful permanent resident. While every court that has reviewed the policy has blocked it as unconstitutional, its legal journey has been fraught, involving a fight over nationwide injunctions, litigation pivots, and fundamental questions about the 14th Amendment.

If the administration prevails, it would do more than determine who gets citizenship going forward. It would overturn 125 years of settled precedent and fundamentally reinterpret what it means to be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States under the 14th Amendment.

Trump’s order

On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order declaring that children born in the United States do not automatically receive citizenship if their parents lack a sufficient connection to the country. The order specifically denies citizenship documents to babies born after February 19, 2025, in two scenarios:

First, if the mother is unlawfully present in the United States and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

Second, if the mother’s presence is lawful but temporary — for example, on a tourist visa, student visa, temporary work visa, or any other nonimmigrant status — and the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

That second category affects the potential children of roughly 3 million people legally present in the United States. A baby born to two H-1B workers from India, or to a graduate student from China, would not receive U.S. citizenship under this policy.

Such babies would be denied Social Security numbers, passports, and other citizenship documentation. They could become stateless if their parents’ home countries don’t grant citizenship by descent.

Why it’s been blocked

So far, the policy has been blocked at every turn. Multiple federal district courts issued preliminary injunctions, concluding that the executive order directly contradicts the 14th Amendment, which states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”

The phrase “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is key. The Trump administration argues it means something like “complete political allegiance” or “not subject to any foreign power.” Under that interpretation, children of non-citizens wouldn’t qualify because their parents owe allegiance elsewhere.

Challengers argue this interpretation is historically wrong and functionally unworkable. The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868 to overturn the Dred Scott decision and ensure that formerly enslaved people were citizens. The debates at the time make clear that “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to exclude only people who have immunity from U.S. law.

But courts have consistently rejected the argument that illegal immigrants are also excluded, pointing to the Supreme Court’s 1898 decision in United States v. Wong Kim Ark. That case involved a man born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrant parents who could not become U.S. citizens under the Chinese Exclusion Act. The Supreme Court held that he was a U.S. citizen anyway because he was born on U.S. soil. The court interpreted “subject to the jurisdiction” to mean everyone except children of foreign diplomats with immunity and children of foreign soldiers during a hostile occupation — both groups that are not subject to U.S. law.

Barring those two exceptions, it has been understood for more than a century that every person born in the United States, regardless of their parents’ citizenship or immigration status, is a U.S. citizen. Now, conservative justices who claim to follow originalist methodology will have to decide whether to claim to believe the original public meaning of the 14th Amendment supports Trump’s position, or whether 125 years of settled practice should continue.

The procedural journey

When Trump’s executive order was first challenged in January 2025, multiple district courts across the country issued nationwide injunctions blocking the policy from being enforced anywhere. This is a common pattern in immigration litigation, in which plaintiffs file in friendly jurisdictions, judges issue sweeping injunctions, and the policy is blocked everywhere while appeals work their way through the courts.

But in June 2025, the Supreme Court handed down a decision in Trump v. CASA that significantly limited the power of district courts to issue nationwide injunctions. The court held that preliminary injunctions should generally be limited to providing relief only to the plaintiffs in the case, not to everyone in the country. The administration claimed this as a major victory and declared that the nationwide blocks on its birthright citizenship order were now invalid.

What happened next turned the outcome on its head. The A.C.L.U., which represented plaintiffs in one of the cases, pivoted to a class action strategy. Rather than seeking a nationwide injunction to protect everyone, the organization sought class certification to represent all babies affected by the policy. In a savvy bit of litigation strategy, they argued that if they couldn’t get a nationwide injunction, they should be able to represent a nationwide class.

A federal judge agreed and certified a nationwide class of all babies born in the United States after February 19, 2025, who would be denied citizenship under Trump’s executive order. With the class certified, the judge then issued a preliminary injunction protecting everyone affected by the policy.

The practical effect was essentially the same as a nationwide injunction, reached through a different procedural route.

So the administration’s win in the nationwide injunction case turned out to be something of a hollow victory. The policy is still blocked, and now the Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case on the merits.

What happens if Trump wins

If the Supreme Court sides with the Trump administration, accepting the administration’s interpretation of “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” it would mean the 14th Amendment never guaranteed birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens in the first place. The practical implications would force a fundamental shift in how American society runs.

Hundreds of thousands of babies born in the United States each year would be denied citizenship. The Migration Policy Institute projects that an average of about 255,000 U.S.-born children would not have U.S. citizenship each year due to their parents’ immigration status.

Many of these children could become stateless. Not all countries grant birthright citizenship, and if neither the United States (based on birthplace) nor the parents’ home country (based on descent) recognizes the child as a citizen, the child would have no citizenship at all.

Implementation would be a nightmare. Who would be responsible for determining whether a newborn’s parents have the right immigration status? Would hospitals need to verify parents’ legal status before issuing birth certificates? Would state vital-records offices be required to collect immigration documentation?

It would create two kinds of birth certificates. Some birth certificates would prove citizenship, and others wouldn’t. This would introduce uncertainty and potential discrimination into all sorts of contexts where proof of citizenship is required.

It would change the relationship between the federal government and the states on citizenship questions. Currently, states issue birth certificates, and if you are born in a state, you are a U.S. citizen. Under the new administration, the federal government would decide who gets citizenship based on parental immigration status, potentially creating situations in which someone is recognized as a citizen in one state but not another.

The Trump administration's immigration crackdown and ICE surge in the Twin Cities drew large protests today.

Amna Nawaz:

It was part of a general strike and walkout backed by labor leaders and faith groups.

Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro begins our coverage with this report from Minneapolis.

Protesters:

ICE out! ICE out! ICE out!

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Thousands of people braved bone-chilling temperatures this afternoon for a rally in downtown Minneapolis, protesting what they call a siege of the Twin Cities by federal agents.

For many here and throughout the Twin Cities, Renee Nicole Good has become an icon. The 37-year-old mother of three was shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis two weeks ago. Her image now appears widely throughout the Twin Cities.

Annie Rose co-owns the Lost Fox, a downtown St. Paul cafe that's a quiet refuge from all the tension outside.

Annie Rose, Co-Owner, Lost Fox:

Renee Good is the face of it. It's a face that people can feel comfortable with. She's a woman. She was a mother. She was white. And it's something that we can come back to and say, oh, they came from my neighbors and then they came from me. Well, that is something that we can all like resonate with.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Today, she closed the place, even though it's tough to lose a Friday evening's revenue in the slowest month of the year, she says.

Annie Rose:

It's already hard out here. Every January, I take out a no-interest credit card to make sure I can make payroll. This year, I'm going to probably have to pay interest on that credit card.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Across the metro area, hundreds of small businesses, especially restaurants, Heeded a call to observe a general strike, many in sympathy with immigrant-owned shops where business has plummeted sharply amid fears of ICE patrols.

Schools in the area also closed today. Labor unions led the call for the general strike, but the decision was made easier by today's life-threatening low temperatures.

Still, Annie Rose said she felt compelled to brace them.

Annie Rose:

It's all fear-based. You're afraid to go to rallies, whether it's cold. You're afraid to go to rallies because you don't want to be shot. You're afraid to stand up for things because of fear, and how can you live your life if you're constantly in fear? It's important to show my kids that, no, you can stand up for what you believe in.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

Protesters marched about a mile through downtown Minneapolis to the indoor basketball arena. The DHS gave no signs today of easing up on its surge in the Twin Cities in the days ahead. On Thursday, Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino was asked if there's a number of arrests agents were targeting.

Greg Bovino, Border Patrol Commander:

There is a number, and it's called all of them.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said 10,000 -- quote -- ""criminal illegal aliens"" have been arrested here, a sharp spike from the start of the week, when the agency put the figure at 3,000. But the department has released details of far fewer cases, which it calls the worst of the worst.

All this comes at a time of rising public scrutiny. ICE officers detained a 5-year-old boy on Tuesday during an immigration enforcement operation. At a press conference today, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said the boy was being cared for.

Marcos Charles, ICE Associate Director:

We do everything in our power not to separate families. So they took him back together to Minneapolis, to the city, to the ICE facility for processing. And now they are being well cared for at a family residential center.

Fred de Sam Lazaro:

On Thursday, three prominent civic activists were arrested after an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church. The White House later posted an A.I.-manipulated image of one woman to its social media account.

When asked about the image, Kaelan Dorr, the White House Deputy Communications Director, wrote: ""Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.""

At a separate anti-ICE rally today, roughly 100 people, including members of clergy, were arrested after protesting outside a terminal at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.

Annie Rose:

I am slowly losing hope, and that is a problem, and that's what keeps me up at night. But then I go to rallies. Like, you asked me. I'm going to go to the rally, and that is to see hope in process.

The massive demonstration in subzero temperatures was a central part of an economic shutdown that included strikes, arrests and civil disobedience, hundreds of businesses closing their doors, and rallies. The call for ​“no work, no school, no shopping” was put out publicly roughly 10 days ago by a coalition of unions, faith groups and community organizations.

“It was bigger than I was expecting, much bigger. I was kind of worried about the weather, but everybody showed up.""

The idea was to ​“suspend the normal order of business” as a way to protest the unprecedented federal deployment of thousands of masked, armed federal agents on Minnesota.

Organizers estimated the crowd was at least 50,000, with some guessing higher, around 100,000. The big turnout is stunning because it was -9 degrees when the march began, temperatures that can quickly cause frostbite to exposed skin.

“Oh my God, today is amazing, overwhelming, and very powerful,” said Feben Ghilagaber, an airport food service worker and steward for UNITE HERE Local 17. ​“It was bigger than I was expecting, much bigger. I was kind of worried about the weather, but everybody showed up.”

According to Ghilagaber, ​“a lot” of airport workers in her union didn’t go to work Friday in order to support the shutdown, with many of them calling in sick.

""I mean, ICE is just deplorable,"" he said. ""And I mean, anyone could get in the path of the ICE agents. It just infringes on our own civil rights.”

It is too early to assess how many workers withheld their labor as part of the day of action, which organizers refer to as a ​“Day of Truth and Freedom.” But workers and unions were central to the day’s events. A commercial electrician and member of IBEW Local 292 who was holding a sign reading ​“General Strike is a Path to Justice,” told me during the march that he was ​“out here to support immigrant rights, support every American.”

“I mean, ICE is just deplorable,” he said. ​“And I mean, anyone could get in the path of the ICE agents. It just infringes on our own civil rights.”

Another Minnesotan, who requested anonymity to protect her from retaliation by ICE, told me, ​“I’m here today to stand up for everyone, stand up for myself. I am impacted. I came here when I was two years old. My parents brought me here from Mexico. All I know is America, so seeing everything that’s going on, seeing my family ripped apart, seeing kids being snatched, an innocent woman shot for standing up for what’s right, it’s all surreal.”

“I’m speaking out for those who couldn’t be here today,” said the 29-year-old, ​“who are hiding, who every time the doorbell rings their heart stops.”

Earlier that morning, about 100 faith leaders blocked a key road outside of Terminal 1 departures at the Minneapolis – Saint Paul International Airport in an act of civil disobedience against ICE.

“I’m speaking out for those who couldn’t be here today,” said the 29-year-old, “who are hiding, who every time the doorbell rings their heart stops.”

With thousands of supporters behind them, they sang ​“before this campaign fails, we’ll all go down to jail — everybody has a right to live.” They held signs showing abducted members of UNITE HERE Local 17.

The crowd — including striking workers and union members, some of whom work at the airport — stayed outside in the subzero temperatures to cheer on the civil disobedience. Supporters passed around hand warmers and snacks to help sustain the crowd.

Katrina Zabriskie, 22, watched her mother, a Minnesota-based chaplain, get arrested. ​“It was really emotional,” she told me. ​“When the crowd started chanting, ​‘We love you,’ I started to cry. Mostly I’m just really proud.” Many of the faith leaders prayed in the moments before they were arrested by police.

Tens of thousands of protesters braved freezing temperatures in Minneapolis on Friday, January 23, 2026, to make their voices heard and demand ICE end its violence on their communities and leave the state. Sarah Lazare

“We care about the safety of our neighbors,” Zabriskie added. ​“We believe it is deeply unjust taking people from their homes and deporting them, brutalizing them, and keeping them in detention centers. It’s not something that should be happening.”

Those roughly 100 clergy, according to a news release from the ICE Out of MN coalition, were arrested for their part in ​“the statewide shutdown ICE Out of Minnesota: A Day of Truth & Freedom.” The clergy’s demands focused on Delta and Signature Aviation, which they said have been complicit in and have helped facilitate the deportations of Minnesotans.

The faith leaders want Delta and Signature Aviation to publicly call for ​“an immediate end to the ICE ​‘surge’ into MN and for ICE to leave the state.” They also urge the companies to ​“join Minnesotans” in demanding that the ICE agent who killed Renee Good be held ​“legally accountable,” and ​“call for Congress to stop funding ICE.”

Good, a poet and mother of three who lived in Minneapolis, was shot and killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on January 7. Public outrage over the murder energized organizers and residents throughout Minnesota and across the country, and was a rallying cry throughout the day.

The civil disobedience at the airport was significant because the site has become a flashpoint in the federal assault on Minnesota.

The coalition added that ""an estimated 2,000 people have been deported through MSP, and many people who work at MSP have been abducted by ICE while at work or commuting to and from the airport.”

“Delta relies on MSP as a major hub, and Signature Aviation provides logistical support for ICE operations,” the ICE Out of MN coalition said in a statement released after the arrests of clergy.

​“The MSP Airport serves tens of millions of travelers each year and is now used as the key site in DHS’s operations to abduct and rush out Minnesotans to detention centers,” the statement said. The coalition added that ​“an estimated 2,000 people have been deported through MSP, and many people who work at MSP have been abducted by ICE while at work or commuting to and from the airport.”

But while the airport is the site of abductions, it is also the site of struggle. Some of the protesters, workers and faith leaders outside the airport could be heard chanting ​“We are the workers, the mighty mighty workers!” A sign read, ​“We are under reacting,” and another person with a bullhorn loudly emphasized: ​“We are here to tell corporations to stop being complicit with ICE.”

Earlier on Friday morning at the airport, Nick Benson, an organizer with the grassroots and non-partisan group MN50501, told me ​“This airport is the narrow end of the funnel where our neighbors are getting shipped off to God knows where.”

The strike and actions across the state — as well as solidarity actions across the country — also come on the heels of harrowing news that a 5-year-old was taken by ICE agents from the driveway of his home in the Minneapolis area on Tuesday. The preschooler and his father are now reportedly being held in a detention center in Texas.

For weeks, federal agents have been stalking and abducting people at schools, daycares and from their homes — and unleashing violence on people trying to protect their neighbors. That violence has been extreme and deadly.

The broad coalition that came together to help organize Friday’s work stoppage also had specific demands that include ICE immediately leaving Minnesota and that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot and killed Good, be ​“held legally accountable.” They’re also calling for ICE not to receive any ​“additional federal funding … in the upcoming congressional budget, and ICE should be investigated for human and constitutional violations of Americans and our neighbors.”

For the throngs of those participating in the shutdown on Friday, the stakes were not academic. SEIU Local 26, which represents more than 8,000 of the state’s janitors, window cleaners and other property service workers, has ​“lost over 20 members to these abductions by federal agents, often without warning, often without due process,” said union president Greg Nammacher at a January 19 press conference.

The federal agents’ strategy, he added, is ​“to break up families, to disappear loved ones who for hours and days often don’t have any idea where their family members are and often have no access to legal counsel.”

But it’s not just immigrant workers who are harmed. Nammacher emphasized that ​“if the declared purpose is to help U.S.-born workers get higher wages, which is sometimes what we are told, it has had the opposite effect.”

A window cleaner who led a strike four years ago to win improved safety measures on the job was recently detained at a routine immigration check-in, Nammacher said. He had lived in the United States for 30 years, yet agents have already deported him to Mexico, away from his family.

“His sacrifice made all window cleaners in the Twin Cities safer, no matter where they were born, no matter what their citizenship status,” Nammacher said.

About 16 members of UNITE HERE Local 17 (which represents more than 6,000 hospitality workers in the Twin Cities metro area) have been abducted, and the Minneapolis – Saint Paul International Airport has become a site of repeated kidnappings of both union and non-union workers.

“Uber drivers are continuously harassed and snatched away, leaving abandoned cars behind, their families completely unaware of where they are,” Sheigh Freeberg, Local 17’s secretary-treasurer, said at a January 9 press conference inside Terminal 1. ​“UNITE HERE Local 17 members who work at the airport have been taken away behind TSA, and ICE flights have increased — sometimes twice daily.”

Since the call for a shutdown went out, the list of unions and community and faith-based organizations joining the effort grew substantially. In addition to SEIU Local 26 and UNITE HERE Local 17, the Minnesota Nurses Association, another heavy-hitting union, joined the effort.

Local and regional labor councils also joined and on January 20, the executive board of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, a federation of more than 1,000 unions representing more than 300,000 Minnesota workers, voted to endorse Friday’s work stoppage.

The union mobilizations are not limited to urban metro areas. AFSCME Council 65 – Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, for example, represents workers in public services, nonprofits and health care across the state and issued a statement supporting the coalition, even if it fell short of calling for a work stoppage.

Building trades unions tend to skew more conservative, making it significant that IBEW Local 110 sent a statement to members reading, ​“These federal agents have shown up to schools, day cares and churches. They have dragged people from their cars, broken down doors and taken people from their workplaces.”

Solidarity actions took place across the country, from Massachusetts to New York to Chicago. Some labor and community leaders, organizers and supporters also traveled to Minnesota for the shutdown, including members of the group Rabbis for Ceasefire, who joined with clergy, and Chicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates.

“Every time this country has had a debate on the sustainability and expansion of our democracy, workers have settled that debate,"" Gates said, ""and I'm looking for workers to do the same thing this time.”

“I’m sick of wiping tears, I’m sick of hugging people, I’m sick of saying I’m sorry. Today, we saw people who are sick of doing the same thing,” Gates said in an interview. ​“I think it was glorious, and I think everyone is going to have to do that — and at the same time.”

“Every time this country has had a debate on the sustainability and expansion of our democracy, workers have settled that debate,” Gates said, ​“and I’m looking for workers to do the same thing this time.”

Gates also pointed to one key reason why Minneapolis was able to undertake such a shutdown: they’ve practiced.

“People here have been practicing going on strike and beating the boss. They’ve been practicing coalition work that helps them beat the boss, they’ve been maintaining their structures that they’ve had since George Floyd. These are things that have been in practice,” she said.

“People have to be in practice, in community, resisting and reimagining.”

Meanwhile, more than 700 Minnesota businesses pledged to close January 23 in solidarity with the strike, many of them because they were pressured by workers and other members of the community.

Many workers in Minnesota would already not be at work on Friday because they are hiding from federal immigration agents. Those who do come out are ​“a voice for people who are hiding,” Ghilagaber of UNITE Here Local 17 told me.

Speaking earlier this week, Freeberg told me, ​“In my mind, it is already successful. We’ve seen scores of businesses shutting down in a large part due to community pressure. There will be people in the street, but 10 times that will be staying home, not working that day. The people not shopping, the people not showing up for work, that stuff really matters too.”

“This doesn’t have to be perfect for it to be impactful,” Freeberg said. ​“There are likely tens of thousands of people who are doing the first ever workplace action that they’ve ever done, ever thought about doing, and they are going to realize that they can do this.”

He added, ​“We can all do this.”",https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/in-these-times/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GettyImages-2257850872.jpg?mtime=1769236963,N,,2026-01-24 10:58:42.021923

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has backed down from a fight to unmask the owners of Instagram and Facebook accounts monitoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Pennsylvania.

One of the anonymous account holders, John Doe, sued to block ICE from identifying him and other critics online through summonses to Meta that he claimed infringed on core First Amendment-protected activity.

DHS initially fought Doe’s motion to quash the summonses, arguing that the community watch groups endangered ICE agents by posting “pictures and videos of agents’ faces, license plates, and weapons, among other things.” This was akin to “threatening ICE agents to impede the performance of their duties,” DHS alleged. DHS’s arguments echoed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who has claimed that identifying ICE agents is a crime, even though Wired noted that ICE employees often post easily discoverable LinkedIn profiles.

To Doe, the agency seemed intent on testing the waters to see if it could seize authority to unmask all critics online by invoking a customs statute that allows agents to subpoena information on goods entering or leaving the US.

But then, on January 16, DHS abruptly reversed course, withdrawing its summonses from Meta.

A court filing confirmed that DHS dropped its requests for subscriber information last week, after initially demanding Doe’s “postal code, country, all email address(es) on file, date of account creation, registered telephone numbers, IP address at account signup, and logs showing IP address and date stamps for account accesses.”

The filing does not explain why DHS decided to withdraw its requests.

However, previously, DHS requested similar information from Meta about six Instagram community watch groups that shared information about ICE activity in Los Angeles and other locations. DHS withdrew those requests, too, after account holders defended their First Amendment rights and filed motions to quash their summonses, Doe’s court filing said.

To defeat DHS’ summonses, Doe shared all his group’s online posts with the court. An attorney representing Doe at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, Ariel Shapell, told Ars that Doe’s groups posted “pretty innocuous” content, like “information and resources about immigrant rights, due process rights, fundraising, and vigils.”

It’s possible DHS caved due to lack of evidence supporting claims that Doe’s groups’ posts carried implicit threats to “assault, kidnap, or murder any federal official,” as DHS had argued. But it’s also possible that DHS keeps trying and failing to unmask ICE critics due to strong First Amendment protections working to preserve the right to post anonymously online.

DHS faces spiking ICE criticism

The attempt to unmask Doe’s accounts came as criticism of ICE is mounting nationwide, and a win could have given ICE broad authority to attack that growing base of critics if DHS had dug in and its defense actually held.

DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses could signal that the argument the agency tried to raise—weirdly using a statute tied to the “importation/exportation of merchandise” to seize “unlimited subpoena authority” of ICE critics online—is clearly not a winning one.

Meta did not immediately respond to Ars’ request for comment. But Meta did play a role in challenging DHS’ summonses, initially by seeking more information from the agency and then notifying account holders to provide an opportunity to quash the summonses before information was shared.

So far, the playbook for community watch groups on Facebook and Instagram has been to follow Meta’s advice in order to block identifying information from being shared. But it remains unclear if Meta may have complied with DHS’s requests if account holders were not able to legally fight to quash them, perhaps leaving a vulnerable gray area for community watch groups.

For Doe and any others involved in “MontCo Community Watch,” DHS’s withdrawal of the summonses likely comes as a relief. But this wasn’t the first time DHS tried and failed to unmask online critics, so it’s just as likely that fears remain that DHS will continue trying to identify groups that are posting footage to raise awareness of ICE’s most controversial moves.

ICE critics have used footage of tragic events—like Renee Good’s killing and eight other ICE shootings since September—to support calls to remove ICE from embattled communities and abolish ICE.

Tensions remain high as US citizens defend both their neighbors and their own constitutional rights. Most recently, shocking footage of ICE using a 5-year-old boy as bait to trap other family members intensified calls to defund ICE. Public backlash also raged after videos showed ICE removing a US citizen from his home in his underwear. That arrest happened while ICE was conducting a warrantless search that a whistleblower warned is becoming the new ICE norm after an internal memo said that agents can enter homes without a judicial warrant.

Some politicians are starting to take up the call to diminish ICE’s power. On Thursday, the majority of House Democrats voted to defund ICE, which Politico noted was a “remarkable shift from when dozens of them voted to expand the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement authority just one year ago.” Of course, the ICE budget bill passed anyway, since Republicans control the House, but with public approval of ICE tanking, any ongoing pushback could hurt Republicans in midterms and eventually even doom ICE if momentum is sustained.",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257128839-1024x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 07:57:20.340082

Avoiding Supreme Court oral arguments can also reveal a strategy.
For others, attending their Supreme Court oral arguments is a no-brainer.
And next thing you know, we’re at the Supreme Court in Washington, suing the administration.","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Fed board of governors member Lisa Cook faced a choice ahead of this week’s Supreme Court oral argument: show up, or sit it out?

They chose visibility, forming part of a crowd of economic and legal heavyweights in the justices’ lines of sight as they mulled the future of the Fed’s protections from the executive branch.

Some others involved in recent high-profile Supreme Court cases have stayed away for their own strategic reasons.

But on Wednesday, Cook and a crowd of supporters became the latest to show up, hoping to persuade the justices that ruling for President Trump in her lawsuit would effectively end the Fed’s longstanding independence to run the nation’s monetary policy.

It was a physical display of the institutional stakes. Trump became the first president to try to fire a sitting Fed governor in its 113-year history when he fired Cook in August over mortgage fraud accusations, which she denies.

Cook watched the arguments from the center section of the public gallery, which spans the back half of the grandiose, column-lined room. She sat among a line of others who chatted as they waited for the justices to take the bench.

Rep. Joyce Beatty (Ohio) was one of several Democratic lawmakers who made it inside. They were part of a rally outside opposing Trump.

On the other side of the center section was Ben Bernanke, who led the Fed through the 2008 financial crisis. Now more than a decade removed from the role, he and other former top economic officials are backing Cook.

Bernanke sat with a larger group, most of whom scribbled notes throughout the two-hour session. Bernanke, however, appeared to doze off at points. By the time Justice Clarence Thomas had asked the first question, Bernanke’s eyes were closed, chin against his chest.

Inside, Powell wasn’t near any of the others. The Fed chair sat on the far-right side of the courtroom with his wife, nearly against the wall and close to the seating for Supreme Court clerks and staff.

He looked ahead toward the bench for most of the argument, his chin slightly raised, appearing to listen intently. Afterward, he quickly left the building through a side door, away from the swarm of cameras.

Powell plays a unique role in the case.

He has increasingly pushed back vocally on Trump’s attempts to influence the Fed and the Justice Department’s criminal investigation into him over his congressional testimony concerning the overbudget renovations at the Fed’s headquarters.

In Cook’s case, Powell is a named a defendant alongside the Federal Reserve itself and Trump, meaning that Solicitor General D. John Sauer at the argument was technically representing Powell, not just the president.

Powell didn’t take Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s advice not to go.

“I actually think that’s a mistake,” Bessent told CNBC Tuesday while in Davos, Switzerland, after reporting surfaced of Powell’s expected attendance.

“Because if you’re trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale is a real mistake,” Bessent continued.

Bessent himself attended Supreme Court oral arguments in November, when the justices considered the legality of Trump’s sweeping tariffs. Several other administration officials came as well.

As Bessent left the courtroom that day, he gave The Hill a thumbs up when asked how the argument went.

Even Trump himself had floated attending.

“I have an obligation to go there,” he told reporters in the Oval Office in October.

It wasn’t the first time Trump toyed with going to the Supreme Court. As he campaigned for his second term, he wanted to see oral arguments on his assertion of broad criminal immunity as a former president. But the New York judge overseeing Trump’s then-ongoing criminal trial rejected his request, ordering Trump to stay in Manhattan.

When the tariffs argument at the court came around, Trump ultimately passed on going, writing on social media, “I do not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.”

The next month, the Supreme Court moved to its next major battle involving Trump: his firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter.

Slaughter sat in the gallery with two other agency leaders sacked by Trump: National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox and U.S. Copyright Office head Shira Perlmutter. Their lawsuits could be impacted by the justices’ decision.

Avoiding Supreme Court oral arguments can also reveal a strategy.

At last week’s sessions on the constitutionality of transgender athlete bans, one of the two student athletes suing attended. The other did not.

Both decisions came with little surprise.

Becky Pepper-Jackson, the 15-year-old discus thrower and transgender girl challenging West Virginia’s ban, sat in. Her lawyers have stressed West Virginia’s law is all about their client.

In the first paragraph of their opening brief, they note she is the only person whom West Virginia’s law has been known to apply. And Pepper-Jackson long ago shoved aside the protections that enable minors to maintain privacy when they sue, making herself available to the press and posing for photos in front of the high court.

Lindsay Hecox, the other athlete suing, who is challenging Idaho’s ban, took the opposite approach.

She steered clear of the courtroom and did not conduct a press tour. The American Civil Liberties Union represents both students, but the post-argument press release only contained a statement from Pepper-Jackson. Not Hecox.

Hecox has been attempting to drop her lawsuit. She says negative public attention has caused her to give up trying to play college athletics, so the Supreme Court shouldn’t issue an opinion, but Idaho accuses her of trying to manipulate the court’s docket.

In the courtroom last week, Justice Sonia Sotomayor appeared the most sympathetic to Hecox. The liberal justice scoffed at Idaho’s lawyer for disagreeing that being a plaintiff in a blockbuster Supreme Court case “makes your infamy live forever.”

“Have you studied your law cases? Students do all the time,” Sotomayor bristled.

For others, attending their Supreme Court oral arguments is a no-brainer.

Victor Schwartz, the CEO of VOS Selections, the wine importer leading the fight against Trump’s tariffs, always planned to go to November’s arguments.

“I don’t get opportunities to appear at the Supreme Court as a plaintiff too often,” Schwartz told The Hill at the time.

In fact, he would’ve gotten more tickets if he could. But Schwartz only got one. It left his daughter spending hours waiting in the public line to try to get a coveted seat.

“For us, it’s amazing,” Schwartz said. “We toil away in our little importing business. And next thing you know, we’re at the Supreme Court in Washington, suing the administration.

“That’s kind of momentous.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/cooklisa_lowellabe_012126gn04_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-24 10:59:02.367726

Thousands and thousands of people in Minnesota came out in frigid temperatures and hundreds of business were closed in protest to support getting “ICE Out!” of the state.","Every week thus far in this young, very old year, has illustrated the lengths to which the Trump administration will go to operate in bad faith with inhumane cruelty and ignore the laws and Constitution, particularly to harm, punish, and retaliate against their chosen targets and perceived opponents.

This week — at least outside of the U.S. Supreme Court — President Donald Trump’s harsh immigration enforcement tactics were front and center.

On Wednesday, the Associated Press broke the news — via a whistleblower complaint — that senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security decided last May that they were in charge of the Fourth Amendment, secretly adopting a policy that erased longstanding Fourth Amendment rights for those people subject to deportation orders.

From the explosive May 2025 memo authored by Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement:

Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence, the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose. Accordingly, in light of this legal determination, ICE immigration officers may arrest and detain aliens subject to a final under ut removal issued by an immigration judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), or a U.S. district court judge or magistrate judge in their place of residence.

Although we haven’t seen that DHS Office of the General Counsel determination, DHS’s acting general counsel at the time was Joseph Mazzara.

Mazzara was most recently in the news for acknowledging that he was the person who gave DHS Secretary Kristi Noem legal advice about whether or not to turn around the Alien Enemies Act flights the night of March 15 after Chief Judge James Boasberg ordered the administration to do so. (They did not turn the flights around.)

Sometime less than two months later, per Lyons, Mazzara’s office took on the Fourth Amendment as well.

The news is horrifying, not the least of which because it was the position of DHS for the past eight months — and it wasn’t public during any of that time.

In the best piece I’ve read on this Stanford Law School professor Orin Kerr — a Fourth Amendment expert — concluded on Thursday:

[I]f I had to summarize my current thinking, it seems to me that the DHS policy is likely wrong in light of [a 1971 Supreme Court decision], [a 1972 Supreme Court decision] and [a 1980 Supreme Court decision], although the DHS position is not frivolous in light of [a 1960 Supreme Court decision] as interpreted in [a 2021 district court ruling] — and the trickier issue may be actually getting a merits ruling on the issue in court in light of the absence of remedies due to the Supreme Court’s gradual cutting back on Bivens remedies. Or at least that’s my tentative take without actually getting to see the DHS legal analysis, and with the caveat that I don’t know the administrative law remedies that may be available.

If you want to dive in, go check out his piece.

Mazzara, meanwhile, is now the deputy commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. (Incidentally, before going to DHS, Mazzara was at the Texas Attorney General’s Office. In one notable case, he argued at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit one month before the 2024 election — in favor of nationwide injunctions.)

The church protest arrests

As that news spread, Attorney General Pam Bondi began live-tweeting arrests of Minnesota activists involved in a protest at a Minnesota church where one of the pastors is the acting head of the Minnesota ICE field office — and the man who submitted a declaration defending ICE’s tactics in Minnesota in litigation before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez alleging that the Trump administration has been violating the First and Fourth Amendment rights of protesters in the Twin Cities.

As for the three arrests carried out in response to the protest at the church where Easterwood is a pastor, DOJ unsuccessfully sought to keep the protesters detained after their arrests. As to the first two people arrested — Nekima Levy-Armstrong and Chauntyll Allen — that request was rejected both by Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko and U.S. District Judge Laura Provinzino. The third person arrested — William Kelly — was ordered released by Micko.

And yet, the three face charges in a case that appears to have been prompted largely by right-wing outrage over Don Lemon’s livestreamed coverage of the protest. The Washington Post, moreover, reported on Thursday that DOJ sought to charge Lemon as well but a judge rejected the effort.

When the criminal complaint — signed by Timothy Gerber, OHS-ICE Special Agent — was unsealed Friday as to Levy-Armstrong, Allen, and Kelly, it was clear that others — whose names were redacted — were at least initially sought to be included in the complaint.

The complaint alleges a violation of the FACE Act — an abortion clinic access law that includes a religious worship protection section — and a related conspiracy charge.

Gerber’s supporting affidavit, which strongly supports the claim that Lemon was initially one of those targeted by the effort, frames the entire complaint with Lemon’s coverage.

As the affidavit continues, Gerber’s claims veer further and further from constituting any sort of professional assessment. Here is how Gerber disgustingly described the killing of Renee Good by an ICE agent in a section in which Allen was discussing what chants the group preferred:

In one parenthetical sentence, Gerber:

Did not mention that ICE killed Good;

Asserted that Good was involved in an “illegal protest” (Cc: Judge Menendez);

Used the exonerative “officer-involved shooting” terminology; and

Presented to the court as fact that Good “assault[ed] … an immigration officer,” contrary to The New York Times review of available video.

This is Trump administration. Charges like this — backed up with false and misleading claims like this — will continue.

That wasn’t all this week

There are the enraging, heartbreaking stories about Liam Ramos and other children arrested by ICE.

The lawless boat-strike murders continue.

As The New York Times noted in its report, this was the “first known boat strike in the eastern Pacific since the capture of Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela“ — bringing ”the known death toll“ from the strikes “to 125 since early September.”

Also Friday night, there was still more news about Geraldo Lunas Campos — one of three people who have died at ICE’s El Paso Camp East Montana this year and whose autopsy led to a homicide finding earlier this week. The Washington Post reported that ICE staff at the facility “told [911] dispatchers the detainee had tried to hang himself — an account that appears to conflict with the medical examiner’s recent finding of a homicide while being restrained by guards.”

It’s all horrible, yes.

And yet, I don’t want to leave this on that note.

In spite of it all, the people remain my strongest reminder that the Trump administration is isolating itself and will, eventually, fail.

Thousands and thousands of people in Minnesota came out in frigid temperatures and hundreds of business were closed in protest to support getting “ICE Out!” of the state.

Judges this week also pushed back against overreach, and individuals targeted by the administration did the same — with support from lawyers willing to stand up for the law.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bBad!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b54b31b-99e8-4efc-b945-32ef06fd06a4_922x594.png",N,,2026-01-24 10:59:05.862687

Hanover officials announced Thursday that they received a communication from the federal Department of Homeland Security expressing interest in the 43-acre property at 11525 Lakeridge Pkwy., south of Interstate 95.

The 552,587-square-foot building in Ashland, known as the Lewistown 95 Logistics Center, is owned by Jim Pattison Developments. The Canada-based developer previously advertised the warehouse as a potential office and distribution center.

Federal immigration officials intend to use the property “in support of ICE operations,” the letter reads. Proposed site improvements may include installing, tentage, a guard shack and additional security access controls.

The move comes amid increasing ICE activity in the state, including an uptick around Democratic Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s inauguration on Jan. 17. Henrico County Supervisor Misty Roundtree has warned on social media about reports of door-to-door ICE sweeps in the county.

Spanberger signed 10 executive orders on her first day in office, one of which rescinds an order by her Republican predecessor, Glenn Youngkin, that directed state and local law enforcement agencies to enter into cooperation agreements with ICE for federal immigration enforcement.

(The order does not void the agreements themselves, only the statewide directive to enter 287(g) arrangements.)

Republican Congressman Rob Wittman said in a statement to VPM News that he’s been contacted by DHS officials about their interest in Virginia’s first Congressional district.

""Public safety and the rule of law are imperative in our communities, and our law enforcement officers work diligently to uphold these values,” Wittman said in a statement. “Decisions regarding federal facilities should be made thoughtfully, and I have been in contact with the Department of Homeland Security about these recent reports. I will continue to monitor the situation as more information becomes available.""

Wittman was one of several Virginia representatives who voted in favor of a federal bill that would provide funding to DHS — and ICE by extension. Every single one of Virginia's Democratic representatives voted against the bill.

Democratic Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan issued a statement regarding the DHS funding and ICE’s activities following the vote.

“This past year has seen alarming and horrific breaches of fundamental constitutional rights at the hands of ICE,” McClellan said. “Overly aggressive agents have entered homes without a warrant; detained people — including citizens — without due process, some in horrendous conditions; terrorized immigrant communities and shed the blood of American citizens.”

She added that in her district — which includes all of the City of Richmond and parts of Petersburg City and Chesterfield and Henrico counties — ICE agents are escalating their tactics.

“None of this has served to make us safer, and this disturbing pattern of behavior demands drastic action,” McClellan said. “I stand alongside all those who have continued to sound the alarm on ICE’s lawlessness and will continue to advocate for measures that will restrict and end this Administration’s heightened campaign of terror.”

Federal lawsuits challenge Las Vegas police tactics against protesters

A newly filed motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction seeks to prevent Metro police from using excessive force against peaceful protesters.

The legal action comes after body camera footage revealed officers targeting individuals who posed no threat, including Emanuel Beltran, who was shot with pepper balls while simply leaning against a light pole, wearing pink shorts and a black shirt.

""He was no threat, committed no crime, was directly targeted by SWAT, and was shot with three pepperballs,"" Beltran's lawsuit states.

His attorneys say they're filing the motion ""to remedy the enormous chilling effect on First Amendment activities that LVMPD has created.""

Another case involves protester Kathleen Cavalaro, who was shot in the back with pepper balls after following police instructions to turn away.

""What am I under arrest for? Because I called you a fascist?"" Cavalaro said during her arrest.

The June 11 protest drew hundreds who came out to oppose federal immigration enforcement policies. The lawsuit alleges Metro police, under direct supervision of Undersheriff Andrew Walsh, ""far exceeded their legitimate police powers, completely disregarded the First Amendment rights of the protesters, illegally shot hundreds of pepperballs with no threat of harm to officers or others, and improperly used their arrest powers, all with the goal of stopping the protest and extinguishing the protesters' First Amendment protected activities.""

The filing calls Metro's behavior ""eerily similar"" to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, including people shot in the back with pepper balls as they complied with orders to leave.

In a 2020 court case, U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro found ""Metro's use of pepperballs and tear gas to control crowds during the 2020 protests have likely chilled speech"" by peaceful protesters. However, Navarro denied a similar injunction request because Metro told the court it had made substantial policy changes after evaluating ""mistakes made to ensure lessons learned are not lost.""

The judge found future excessive force actions were unlikely, calling Metro's previous conduct ""uncharacteristic.""

But body camera footage from the 2025 ICE protests shows Metro using many of the same tactics five years later. Beltran's motion claims ""LVMPD either never implemented the substantial policies and changes or wholly ignored them,"" calling ""excessive use of force with pepperballs very characteristic.""

Attorneys argue Metro ""will not act on its own and Court intervention is needed.""

As protests continue nationwide following Rachel Good's shooting death by ICE in Minneapolis, the Las Vegas Federal Court is being asked to prevent Metro from enforcing dispersal orders outside specific zones after protesters comply, and to stop officers from shooting pepper balls without evidence of physical threat or serious criminal behavior.

Many demonstrators later gathered indoors at the Target Center, a sports arena with a capacity of 20,000.

Organisers and participants said dozens of businesses across Minnesota closed for the day as part of the “ICE OUT!” show of defiance that organisers billed as a general strike.

Workers headed to street protests and marches, which followed weeks of sometimes violent confrontations between US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and protesters opposed to Trump’s surge.

“It is 23 degrees below zero but the stores are closed and these demonstrators are out braving the coldest day on record since 2019 all to send a simple message to ICE: Get Out,” Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said, reporting from Minneapolis.

Just a day earlier, US Vice President JD Vance visited Minneapolis in a demonstration of support for ICE officers and to ask local leaders and activists to reduce tensions, saying ICE was carrying out an important mission to detain immigration violators.

In one of the more dramatic protests, local police arrested dozens of clergy members who sang hymns and prayed as they knelt on a road at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, calling for Trump to withdraw the 3,000 federal law enforcement officers sent to the area.

Organisers said their demands included legal accountability for the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Good, a US citizen, in her car this month as she monitored ICE activities.

They ignored commands to clear the road by officers from local police departments, who arrested and zip-tied dozens of the protesters, without resistance, before putting them onto buses.

Organisers said about 100 clergy members were arrested.

‘Largest strike’

Faith in Minnesota, a nonprofit advocacy group that helped organise the protest, said the clergy were also calling attention to airport and airline workers, who they said had been detained by ICE at work. The group asked that airline companies “stand with Minnesotans in calling for ICE to immediately end its surge in the state”.

Across the state, bars, restaurants and shops were closing for the day, organisers said, in what was intended to be the largest display yet of opposition to the federal government’s surge.

“Make no mistake, we are facing a full federal occupation by the United States government through the arm of ICE on unceded Dakota land,” said Rachel Dionne-Thunder, vice president of the Indigenous Protector Movement.

She was one of a series of Indigenous, religious, labour and community leaders to speak, calling on ICE to withdraw and for a thorough investigation into Good’s shooting.

Trump, a Republican, was elected in 2024 largely on his platform of enforcing immigration laws, with a promise to crack down on violent criminals, saying his predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, was too lax in border security.

But Trump’s aggressive deployment of federal law enforcement into Democratic-led cities and states has further spurred political polarisation in the US, especially since the shooting of Good, the detention of a US citizen who was taken from his home in his underwear, and the detention of schoolchildren, including a five-year-old boy.

Despite grueling cold temperatures, demonstrators filled Monument Square just after 5 p.m., chanting, holding signs, and later marching down Congress Street. Their message: ICE is not welcome here.

Among those in the crowd was Ella Bornstein, a local high school student who said she came out to support her classmates.

“My school has a bunch of new immigrants, and I think it’s really important to show support for them even if I don’t know them,” Bornstein said.

Ella stood alongside her mother, Sheila Bornstein, who echoed the urgency of showing solidarity with Maine’s immigrant communities.

“It’s pretty terrifying what’s happening in our community right now. I’m here to support our New Mainer population and honestly everyone in our community that is being affected,” she said.

While other demonstrations have taken place throughout the week in other parts of the state, they've been smaller in comparison. Friday night’s protest was one of the largest since ICE began ramping up operations statewide, according to organizers.

Lindsay Walsh, who traveled from Cumberland to attend, said ICE’s actions have sown fear in communities across the region.

“People have a right to be here. Children have a right to go to school safely. Parents have a right to go to work,” Walsh told NEWS CENTER Maine. ""We’re here to protest the terrorizing of our community.”

Protesters began marching down Congress Street around 6 p.m. Many chanted slogans like, “No justice, no peace, get ICE off our streets.”

Ryan Murphy, one of the event’s organizers, said marching into the street was planned in direct response to what he called a spike in ICE arrests this week.

“This was planned in order to meet the moment,” Murphy said. ""Very pleased with the turnout, very pleased with the reception. People couldn’t be more positive.”

No arrests were made, according to the Portland Police Department.

The Cumberland county sheriff, Kevin Joyce, said that on Wednesday evening one of his corrections officer recruits was arrested by ICE agents.","Three days into its immigration crackdown in Maine, the Department of Homeland Security said Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had arrested “more than 100 illegal aliens”.

In a statement to the Guardian on Friday, the DHS assistant secretary of public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, said some of those taken into custody were “the worst of the worst” and had been “charged and convicted of horrific crimes”, but cited the same four examples it released earlier in the week.

Speaking to Fox News, Patricia Hyde, deputy assistant director of ICE, said the agency had compiled a list of 1,400 individuals in Maine it intends to target.

Immigrant rights groups have been on alert as ICE concentrates its operation on Maine’s two largest cities, Portland and Lewiston. Organizers say agents have been targeting African nationals from Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Angola, many of them asylum seekers who have made the coastal state home in recent decades.

On Wednesday, a local ICE sighting hotline – organized and run by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition – said they received more than 1,100 calls, a 35% increase in calls from the previous day. Immigrants in Maine represent only about 4% of the state’s total population, most of whom have legal status to live and work in the US, according to a recent report by the Migration Policy Institute.

At a press conference in Portland on Thursday, Janet Mills, the state’s Democratic governor, said the Trump administration had not returned her calls since the operation began. She added that her office had received reports of people with no criminal record being detained and urged homeland security to be transparent in its actions, saying she would be “shocked” if federal law enforcement located 1,400 individuals with criminal backgrounds.

“If they have warrants, show the warrants,” she said. “We don’t believe in secret arrests or secret police.”

Mills also described widespread fear in schools, workplaces and businesses that are losing employees who have either been detained or are not showing up, despite living in the state legally.

Earlier this week, a video by 28-year-old Cristian Vaca – an Ecuadorian immigrant living in Maine with valid immigration status – went viral online. In the footage, federal agents appear outside Vaca’s home in Biddeford, 18 miles south of Portland, where he lives with his wife and young son. In an interview with the Associated Press in Spanish through a translator, Vaca said that he approached the officers when they were taking pictures outside his house.

When Vaca refused to go outside, the video shows one of the agents telling him that they will “come back for your whole family” through Vaca’s screen door.

“I have been in this country since September 2023,” Vaca, who works as a roofer, told the AP. “I have immigration status … the judge postponed my court date to another day. Now I have a new court date. I have my work permit. I have my social security number [sic].”

Local authorities also decried the scope of the federal immigration dragnet this week. The Cumberland county sheriff, Kevin Joyce, said that on Wednesday evening one of his corrections officer recruits was arrested by ICE agents.

“This is an individual that had permission to be working in the state of Maine. We vetted him,” the sheriff said of the unnamed recruit.

Joyce was one of more than 100 national sheriffs who met with Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, last year. “The book and the movie do not line up,” Joyce told reporters on Thursday. “We’re being told one story, which is totally different than what’s occurring.”

Later, Joyce said that ICE officials contacted him to say all detainees held at the Cumberland county jail were being moved on Thursday. In an interview with the Portland Press Herald, he said “about 50” people were removed from the jail. The DHS did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment about where detainees are being held as Maine does not have a dedicated immigration detention facility.

The Maine Immigrants Rights Coalition’s advocacy and policy manager, Ruben Torres, said that family members are now finding it “extremely difficult to be able to find their loved ones once they have been picked up”.

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project (ILAP), Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization said it had received several fearful calls as the crackdown continues. This includes a pregnant woman who reached out to ILAP because she was “terrified to leave her home to go to a medical appointment”. Another person called and said someone had “pulled the fire alarm in her building, desperately trying to save people from ICE”. ILAP said that they received reports of teachers escorting immigrant children home from school who had agents follow them and push their way into an apartment building lobby.

“It is clear the overall operation is anything but targeted,” said Sue Roche, ILAP’s executive director. “People are being racially profiled on the streets and in their cars. As is their playbook, ICE is doing everything they can to inflict maximum cruelty and chaos.”

In Lewiston, it was “hard to overstate the level of fear within the community”, according to the Democratic congressional candidate Jordan Wood, who is running to replace the outgoing US representative Jared Golden. “I have heard that as many as 20% of students at certain schools did not show up,” Wood, who was born, raised and lives in the area, told the Guardian.

He added that the community response to the ICE surge – from ensuring immigrants know their rights to sharing where agents have been spotted – has been hugely encouraging. “It’s important to just know the community that they’re coming after won’t stand idly by while our neighbors are terrorized,” Wood said.

At her press conference in Portland, Mills still wanted more information about the decision to target the Pine Tree state. “Why Maine? Why now? What were the orders that came from above? Who’s giving the orders?,” she said, adding that state officials have reached out to the Trump administration but still “have no answers”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b89dad30b93631251acae781be1db651c329543e/2114_1008_3003_2403/master/3003.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c94a3bddc10eb5d34e69832e00f90417",N,,2026-01-24 02:57:50.120723

Labor organizers, clergy leaders and immigrant rights groups gathered at La Placita Olvera to march down to the federal detention facility where Immigration and Customs Enforcement holds detainees. They came together less than a month after a Minneapolis woman, Renee Good, was fatally shot by an ICE agent, and protests have roiled the city as raids have continued.

L.A. City Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez made an appearance and reiterated the common refrain to “abolish ICE.”

“Look at all the people around you. This is what’s going to save us from authoritarianism,” she said, addressing the hundreds that had gathered in La Placita, a historical site of Latino organizing. “I’m a council member, but the government will not save you. It’s the people that are standing arm in arm with you that are going to save our families, keep our families whole and repair the harm that the federal government is doing.”

The protest was one of several across the country as immigration raids have continued. This time, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and CLUE, a clergy organization, came together to organize a march to the detention center.

Organizers recognized the death of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who was shot multiple times by an ICE agent in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. She had dropped off her son at school when she came upon ICE agents during a raid.

Federal officials have defended ICE agent Jonathan Ross’ actions as self-defense and have accused Good of weaponizing her vehicle in “an act of domestic terrorism.”

Local and state officials, citing video evidence, have rejected that claim, and calls to rein in ICE have escalated as her death has resonated across the country.

Among the speakers was a fast-food worker at McDonald’s, who said she feared going to work every day last summer when ICE raids were intensifying in Los Angeles. Another fast-food worker spoke of organizing in response to the fear, and said that Minnesota’s fight was also L.A’.s fight.

“From the West Coast to the Midwest, we are united with one voice to say: ICE out,” Julieta Garcia said to big cheers.

Cesar Sandoval Cruz, a sophomore at Wilson High School, said young people today are “witnessing history before our very own eyes.”

“We are seeing as our neighbors, families, strangers and everyday hardworking people are getting kidnapped off our streets,” he said. “We are here to say that enough is enough. We are not going to stand by and watch as this is taking place in our city.”

State Sen. Sasha Renee Perez, a Democrat who represents Altadena, spoke about her efforts to pass legislation that would force ICE agents to be unmasked and identify themselves. The Trump administration is challenging it in court.

Passing legislation in this moment, she said, was not enough.

“We are going to need one another as we fight this fascist administration,” Perez said. “Direct action works. Do not let anybody tell you otherwise — the people of Minnesota are proving it right now.”

Beata Landes, 23, held a sign she wrote herself: “Keep your hands off my family.”

“So many of my friends and family members are undocumented,” she said, “and the fear is palpable.”

Landes said she drove from the Westside because it was important to share solidarity with those opposed to ICE actions.

“Being around like-minded people is hopeful and inspiring,” she added.

Despite the obvious dangers of trailing and recording ICE agents, residents have continued to show up in large crowds in Minneapolis. Videos online show residents blasting whistles as they warn neighbors that ICE agents are in the area. In Los Angeles, rapid response network groups have also continued their efforts to track agents’ movements across the city.

The interactions have at times turned violent. On Wednesday, a federal agent shot at a suspect during a raid in South L.A. The Department of Homeland Security said the agent opened fire after the suspect rammed federal law enforcement with his vehicle.

As the air filled with the scent of incense and music, L.A. resident Leneta Antoine-Wood held a sign that read “ICE out of Tovaangar,” a reference to the Indigenous people of the Los Angeles Basin. Antoine-Wood, who is part Native, said she felt it was important to advocate against the raids. She said she knows someone who is being held in the Adelanto facility outside of L.A., and conditions there are worse than a prison.

“Immigrants have more rights to be here,” she said. Her shirt reading “No one is illegal on stolen land” echoed that sentiment.

Antoine-Wood and her husband, Rob Wood, have been part of several protests against ICE and government overreach. They participated in the Standing Rock demonstration against an oil pipeline through tribal land in North Dakota.

Despite acknowledging that little may change while Trump is in office, Wood said it was important to be out there to show the strength of opposition to the administration’s actions.

“His administration doesn’t follow any of the laws,” he said, and Trump himself has “no good interest in this country.”

“Everybody’s just gotta make sure that they vote,” he said. “You gotta protest.”

As the crowd prepared to march Friday to the detention facility a few blocks away, they held a moment of silence for those who have died or gone missing while in ICE custody. People held photos of those who have died — including Johnny Noviello, a 49-year-old Canadian who died in a Miami detention facility, and Brayan Rayo-Garzon, a 27-year-old Colombian who died in Missouri.

The mood lifted as the crowd began to march south. They called for “ICE out of L.A.” and for several moments stopped traffic as they spilled into the street.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0ad6ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7843x4118+0+471/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2F8e%2Fee2144c64d289e9c73fbb1e4855b%2F1539213-me-rally-to-protest-ongoing-raids-in-minnesota-gem-03.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 02:57:53.520827

They may have views, but they don’t let it affect their shopping decisions, not for these kind of things.”","On Jan. 8, immigration officials detained two Target employees, who are U.S. citizens, during their shift in Richfield, Minnesota. Videos of the arrest quickly spread on social media.

The recent events have caused renewed backlash against Target, nearly a year after boycotts began over the company rolling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

Target CEO Brian Cornell was once an outspoken supporter of DEI initiatives following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, and the company was seen as a strong advocate for Black and LGBTQ+ businesses and customers.

But Target eliminated its three-year DEI goals and stopped participation in external diversity surveys, after the election of President Donald Trump, who opposes such policies.

In April, Cornell met with civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton and Jamal Bryant, an Atlanta pastor. Bryant shared his demands for Target to open locations on the campuses of 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), complete its 2020 pledge to spend $2 billion on Black small businesses, reinstate its original DEI hiring and promoting goals, and invest $250 million into 23 Black-owned banks.

Target has not committed to these specific demands, but the company has continued to work with organizations such as the Russell Innovation Center for Entrepreneurs, which supports Black small business founders with education, mentorship, and access to retail opportunities. The company also supported HBCU programs under its “HBCU, Always” series, an effort to connect graduates with Target’s mentorship network.

Boycotts coincide with lower profits and foot traffic

“I think what Target didn’t do very well with the whole DEI situation was management of the situation and communication,” said retail analyst Neil Saunders, who is managing director at GlobalData, citing Target’s work helping business founders, communities, and charities. “None of that has gone away, and I think it probably should have been brought to the fore more in the conversation.”

The boycott over Target’s DEI rollback coincided with a major downturn in foot traffic and sales for the company.

Still, Saunders says there is more to the company’s 19% profit slide to $689 million in the three-month period ending Nov. 1.

“Target is currently grappling with how to create a better experience for customers, because over the past few years, the experience in store isn’t as good as it used to be,” he said. “There are issues like out of stocks on some products, and that’s really just putting customers off going to Target as much as they once did, or spending as much there as they once did.”

Over the Fourth of July weekend, Saunders visited a Target and posted 15 photos on LinkedIn that documented shelves that were understocked (or completely empty) and in disarray.

“There’s too much friction from the experience,” he said, adding that consumers are more cautious about spending on discretionary items and are weighing shopping with other retailers. “Target seems to be aware of this, and it says that it is taking action, but certainly over the past year, it has been a real problem.”

In its Q3 earning call in November, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, who will take over as CEO, told analysts the company is investing in resources to improve in-store stock, such as using machine learning to optimize movement between suppliers and stores.

“It’s helping us move inventory more efficiently, improve our reliability for everyday frequently purchased items, and further improve in stocks,” he said.

New crisis, new approach

Now Target is facing a new crisis, this time over ICE.

The company has not issued any public statements about ICE operations in their stores or about the two employees who were detained. Target told Fortune it has no comment on the strike in Minnesota or the backlash against the company.

On Thursday, Chief Human Resources Officer Melissa Kremer said in a memo to employees that the company’s security teams are increasing communication with Minneapolis-based workers about expected disruptions near its locations, Bloomberg reported. Senior leaders are engaging with government officials, community partners, faith leaders and other stakeholders, Kremer said in the memo.

Bloomberg reported that employees are sharing frustration over the company’s silence on internal Slack channels. Some have sent a letter to Target’s ethics team expressing concern about the lack of a statement from the company and seeking guidance on how to handle law enforcement operations. Staffers from at least two stores have told managers they’re too afraid to come into work, sources told Bloomberg.

On Jan. 15, more than 100 clergy and community members gathered at Target’s downtown Minneapolis store to present demands and ask to speak to the CEO. They urged the company to call for an immediate end to the ICE operations in the state, to deny ICE agents entry into stores without a signed judicial warrant, and to call for Congress to stop funding ICE.

Cornell agreed to meet with representatives from the protest on Thursday, according to the organizers. Clergy members involved in the meeting did not respond to a request for comment.

Saunders said Target often sees itself as a community retailer, so it’s important for the company to give community leaders a space to air their views.

He added that Target’s messaging to employees about ICE was reasonable but that everyone is hoping for a change in operational strategies and customer experience.

“It’s not going to be enough for some people,” Saunders said. “The vast majority of customers are very much in the middle. They’re interested in politics. They may have views, but they don’t let it affect their shopping decisions, not for these kind of things.”","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256549172-e1769208584737.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-24 02:57:57.036639

Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.

The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an “abject lie.” It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.

The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power — and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.

The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.

Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.

The family’s attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.

Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.

An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.

Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:

Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,” she said.

The father told the child’s mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.

School officials said the agents wouldn’t leave Liam with other adults.

A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.

“Why detain a 5-year-old?” the superintendent asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.

“ICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as ‘bait,’” said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. “ICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. ”

McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. “Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.”

The officers, she said, “abided by the father’s wishes to keep the child with him.""

At a news conference Friday, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino criticized what he called the “false media narrative” about the case.

Marcos Charles, acting executive associate director of ICE enforcement and removal operations, faulted the father for “abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.” He told reporters one officer stayed with the child while others arrested the father. He said his officers then got food for the boy, and “did everything they could to reunite him with his family.”

“Tragically, when we approached the door of his residence, the people inside refused to take him in and open the door. ... Fortunately, Conejo Arias eventually requested that his child stay with him,"" Charles said.

And Charles said he didn't know what had become of the child's mother.

They're at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas, where families have reported that children are malnourished, ill and suffering from prolonged detention. Conditions there are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counsel at Children’s Rights, who visited the facility last week.

“The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,” Welch said.

Bovino pointed out that when U.S. citizens anywhere in the country are arrested and jailed by their local police, they get separated from their children.

“I challenge any other law enforcement agency anywhere nationwide to show me the fantastic care that ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol provide children,” Bovino said.

If Liam wasn't with his father, Bovino said, he could have ended up in the custody of social services without a parent instead.

Charles said people at the family centers “get top-notch care. They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation.”

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumed Liam and his father were in a family holding cell but that he did not have direct contact with them.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,” he said at a news conference Thursday.

On Friday, Prokosch’s office said he was unavailable to comment.

The child’s immigration status may be a critical factor, and it is unclear if the 5-year-old was legally in the United States. If he wasn’t, he may be subject to deportation with one or both parents. Charles, the ICE official, said Friday that the family entered the United States together, suggesting the he was not a U.S.-born citizen.

Trump border czar Tom Homan has repeatedly said parents of U.S.-born children have a choice to take their children with them when deported or leave them with someone else.

“This is parenting 101. You can decide to take that child with you or you can decide to leave the child with a relative or another spouse,” Homan said last year on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”

The Trump administration last July issued a “Detained Parents Directive” that if minor children are encountered during ICE enforcement actions, ICE “should under no circumstances take custody of children or transport them.” The directive includes exemptions for when people could lose their immigration status.

The directive says that ICE should allow parents and guardians to make alternate care arrangements for the children before their detention.

It does not specify what happens when the parents say that they want their child to stay with them.

“If a parent is arrested while with their child, the government is not required to arrest the child, regardless of the child’s immigration status,” said Neha Desai, managing director at Children’s Human Rights and Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law. “When ICE detains a parent, its own policy requires them to allow time for arrangements to be made for the child’s care.”

“I’ve seen plenty of videos on social media of Ice agents just cherry picking outside of Target doors,” said Lucas Fagan. “Waiting puppy guarding for people who have any bit of color in their skin, just waiting for them to come out and get their identification.”

At least one incident involving two Target employees being detained by ICE outside of a store in Richfield circulated online, resulting in that community demanding the company stand up for its workers.

Friday’s protestors in Rochester echoed the sentiment.

The protesters faced temperature around -12 degrees.

Despite organizers suggesting people move to a car-based protest, many chose to line the sidewalks with signs and whistles instead.

Meanwhile, others provided support from the sidelines, handing out hand-warmers and other supplies to help keep people warm.

“We’re not the only ones that are handing out hand warmers,” said Annie Jurrens, who along with her three kids were providing hand-warmers, whistles, and snacks to protestors. “People are dressed for the weather. People are, doing what they can. And right now they can be here and they can be loud. So, if it’s one small thing that we can do to help everybody, then we’re going to do it.”

1:45 p.m - MN Queer Caucus condemns DOJ refusal to investigate fatal shooting of Renee Good

The Minnesota Queer Legislators Caucus condemned U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's announcement that the Department of justice will not investigate ICE agent Jonathan Ross for the fatal shooting of Renee Good.

The Caucus shared a statement that partially said the following:

""Renée Good should still be alive today. Her death is a tragedy that was completely avoidable. Renée, her wife, and her children deserve a full investigation into the circumstances of her killing. Instead, the federal administration has callously blamed Renée for her own death.

""This is a deplorable abuse of power. Under any other circumstance where a life is taken, an investigation is conducted, and the judicial system guarantees due process. To deny an investigation is to deny justice. It ensures that the perpetrator, Johnathan Ross, is never held accountable for his actions.

""The Minnesota Queer Legislators Caucus demands the arrest of Jonathan Ross for the killing of Renée Good, a US citizen exercising her First Amendment right.""

When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1.""

10 a.m. - ICE and Border Patrol leaders speak at Whipple Federal Building

Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Marcos Charles gathered at the Whipple Federal Building to share an update on Operation Metro Surge.

They began by touting the arrests made in recent days, saying they will ""not be deterred"" in their operations. The border patrol commander then displayed the booking photos of several convicted criminals who they say are in the country illegally.

Bovino then spoke about crimes encountered at the U.S. Southern Border and chastised media outlets for a perceived lack of reporting on crimes committed by people in the United States illegally.

He then addressed the crimes against children and spoke about the 5-year-old boy, Liam Ramos, who was seen in ICE custody earlier this week.

Assistant ERO Director Charles said ICE agents stayed with Liam after Liam's father fled from them, and that family members refused to take him when they approached their home in Columbia Heights. They then claimed that the family came into the country illegally.

Lawyers for the family dispute this claim, saying they came to the U.S. the ""right"" way.

READ MORE: 5-year-old detained by ICE in Columbia Heights: Family came into US the 'right' way

School staff said during a news conference on Wednesday that an adult in the home ""begged"" agents to let them care for Liam, but that ICE agents refused. They add that Liam was ""essentially used as bait"" when he was told to approach the home.

Liam is now with his father in a detention facility in Texas, which Charles said is ""better than social services.""

They were then asked to respond to the data discrepancy between the Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) and federal immigration enforcement.

Charles said it is true that the Minnesota DOC honors ICE detainers, but that issues arise when other counties and municipalities do not.

""When I say the State of Minnesota, I'm not talking about just the Department of Corrections, I'm talking throughout the state, counties, any municipalities that are holding people,"" Charles said. ""Our stats are detainers for the ones that we count. We don't go into DOC data and count their data.""

The men then spoke about the arrest of three people involved in a protest at a church in St. Paul, where activists called for the resignation of the pastor for his ICE leadership ties.

""Federal law protects the freedom of religion and the right to worship without interference,"" Marcos said. ""What theses agitators did was not a peaceful protest.""

FOX 9 reported on Thursday night that the activists were still in custody after a judge ordered their release.

9 a.m. - Renee Good shooting death ruled a homicide

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner released a report on Thursday, Jan. 22, that ruled Renee Good's death a homicide.

Her cause of death was officially listed as ""multiple gunshot wounds"" after she was ""shot by a law enforcement officer.""

7:30 a.m. - DHS calls for state and local cooperation

The Department of Homeland Security said in a post that Minnesota Gov. Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey must work with the federal government to ""make America safe again.""

The post refers to a suspect who ICE agents say they were looking for when they raided the home of an elderly Hmong man in St. Paul. Agents were seen detaining the man, who was only wearing Crocs, shorts and a blanket over his shoulders, when they brought him outside in freezing weather.

It was later found that the suspect ICE was looking for had been in state custody the whole time.

According to Rodríguez, deported migrants are typically processed in Reynosa, just across the border from McAllen, Texas.
Meanwhile, U.S. deportations to Venezuela continue While thousands of migrants remain stranded in southern Mexico, the U.S. has been sending others directly back to Venezuela.","Human rights organizations in southern Mexico are raising alarms about what they call dangerous conditions for migrants who are being deported from the United States and left in remote regions with little guidance or support.

Among them is a 22‑year‑old Venezuelan mother who spoke with NBC6 on the condition that her name not be used for safety reasons. She says she never imagined her path would lead her to a secluded city in southern Mexico.

The woman says she was deported on Jan. 1, along with her 3‑year‑old son. She told NBC6 she had been living in the United States with a deportation order, was apprehended in Pennsylvania and subsequently sent to Texas before being deported to Mexico.

“It took two and a half days,” she said of the journey from the U.S.-Mexico border to Southern Mexico.

A growing hub for deported migrants

Human rights groups say that southern Mexico — particularly the city of Villahermosa — has become a landing place for migrants being expelled from the U.S.

July Rodríguez, founder and director of Apoyo a Migrantes Venezolanos, a nonprofit that provides legal guidance to newly arrived migrants, says the recent deportation routes are long, exhausting, and often dangerous.

According to Rodríguez, deported migrants are typically processed in Reynosa, just across the border from McAllen, Texas. After being given food and held for about two hours, they are transported on bus by Mexican authorities approximately 14 to 16 hours south to Villahermosa. With traffic, she says the trip can exceed 24 hours.

But Rodríguez says the most troubling issue is what comes next.

Although migrants are supposed to be taken directly to Villahermosa’s immigration processing center, she says that “the reality is that it doesn’t always happen.” Some migrants report being dropped off in unsafe areas—sometimes overnight.

“We can’t cover the sun with one finger,” Rodríguez said. “These are places with very high levels of insecurity.”

Her organization has heard from engineers, architects, accountants, educators, and others who lived in the U.S. for many years — some for almost a decade — before suddenly being returned to a country they do not know.

Shelters seeing an increase in Venezuelans

In Villahermosa, shelters are feeling the impact.

Josue Martinez Leal, who works at the Amparito Shelter, says they’ve seen a noticeable rise in Venezuelan nationals arriving after deportation from the U.S. Many of them are families — women traveling with young children, like the young mother NBC6 spoke with by video conference.

In 2025, Martinez says the shelter also received Cuban, Honduran, Salvadoran, Colombian and Haitian migrants.

He believes Villahermosa may be intentionally chosen because of its proximity to Guatemala — potentially to encourage migrants to continue south and leave Mexico.

Meanwhile, U.S. deportations to Venezuela continue

While thousands of migrants remain stranded in southern Mexico, the U.S. has been sending others directly back to Venezuela.

Human Rights First reports that between February and December, nearly 80 deportation flights carried more than 14,000 Venezuelans back to their home country — including children.

Martinez says he worries about what lies ahead for migrants who now find themselves in a “third country” —neither the U.S. nor their homeland — without an immediate support network.

For the young mother NBC6 interviewed, returning to Venezuela is not an option. She says she fled an abusive relationship and hoped to build a safer future for herself and her son.

NBC6 reached out to both state and federal Mexican authorities to ask why Villahermosa is being used as a deportation destination, but received no response.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to questions about its policies regarding Venezuelan deportations.",https://media.nbcmiami.com/2026/01/vz-deported-to-mx.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-24 00:57:41.226914

In an interview with Keizertimes, Merkley said immigration enforcement and health care are two of the top concerns he is hearing from Oregonians.
The third is “authoritarian overtaking of our democratic republic.” During the town hall, Merkley criticized the Trump administration for using illegal and “aggressive” immigration enforcement tactics and other actions.
“Risk of it turning into a strongman authoritarian state.” On immigration enforcement, one audience member asked what actions Merkley is taking over constituents’ concerns.","Concern over Trump administration actions and policies was the focus of many attending U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley’s town hall in Salem on Thursday, Jan. 22.

Marion County residents pooled into Chemeketa Community College’s auditorium for the town hall, filling most of the seats. The Oregon Democrat rescheduled the event from earlier this month due to the shooting of two people by federal agents in Portland.

Several attendees spoke against immigration enforcement actions under Trump. Others expressed concern over health care and Trump actions in Venezuela. One person told Merkley that Congress impeach Trump.

In an interview with Keizertimes, Merkley said immigration enforcement and health care are two of the top concerns he is hearing from Oregonians. The third is “authoritarian overtaking of our democratic republic.”

During the town hall, Merkley criticized the Trump administration for using illegal and “aggressive” immigration enforcement tactics and other actions. He referenced a booklet handed to attendees, which he said details “the ten rules of Trump’s authoritarian playbook.”

Examples listed in the book include placing “loyalists” in powerful positions over those who are qualified and overriding Congress authority to determine funding allocations.

Merkley also criticized a “rubber stamp” Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court for failing to stand up to Trump over separation of powers, taxation authority and more.

“We are in a moment of dire risk for our democratic republic,” Merkley said. “Risk of it turning into a strongman authoritarian state.”

On immigration enforcement, one audience member asked what actions Merkley is taking over constituents’ concerns. The speaker expressed worry that Immigration and customs enforcement is becoming “paramilitary” and noted a report from the Associated Press on a federal agency memo giving agents permission to enter homes without a warrant.

Merkley said he has proposed legislation to require agents to wear identification, remove face masks and allow access to attorneys.

“None of those bills are getting heard right now,” Merkley said.

When asked if he would support abolishing ICE, Merkley responded that he doesn’t believe the immigration enforcement agency can be “rehabilitated.”

“I think ICE has to be dismantled and we have to start from scratch,” Merkley said, to applause and a standing ovation from some.

In the interview, Merkley said that in Oregon ICE has primarily focused on Woodburn, and does not inform his office of its plans.

A speaker who described herself as a health care worker of 35 years said she personally saw how the Affordable Care Act benefited people like her daughter with chronic health issues. Now that Congress failed to extend ACA tax credits, she said she is witnessing “terrible damage” to the lives of those who relied on it for health insurance.

“It grieves me. It grieves me deeply,” she said.

Merkley responded that the U.S. is “the only country where families go bankrupt over health care,” and noted that hospitals lose income when families can’t pay.

“So it’s absolutely going in the wrong direction,” Merkley said. “And so I’d like to see us have a better health care system.”

Merkley said he had previously proposed a bill extending tax credits for one year, which didn’t pass. He said the House recently passed a three-year extension, and he will push for a Senate vote after returning to Washington D.C. next week.

Looking forward to the fall elections, Merkley said in an interview that he sees “tremendous blue energy.”

“I’m seeing it in the town halls, the folks being absolutely infuriated with the attack on America’s freedom and basic system of checks and balances,” Merkley said.

The jail holds about 60 ICE detainees on any given day.
Neither Joyce’s office nor ICE and other federal agencies responded to questions about the moves on Friday morning.

It is unclear whether the federal government or Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce’s office initiated the removals. U.S. Attorney Andrew Benson’s office requested permission Thursday to move a detainee being held there to an ICE facility in Boston. It was granted by District Court Judge John Woodcock Jr., who said in a decision that the jail had no more bed space.

News of the moves came shortly after Joyce held a Thursday news conference criticizing agents for their arrest of a county corrections recruit. He was ripped from his vehicle and detained a day earlier as part of ICE’s surge into Maine.

The removals appeared to be sudden. The jail holds about 60 ICE detainees on any given day. Some of the detainees have been moved to federal prisons in New Hampshire and Rhode Island, said Anna Welch, a University of Maine School of Law professor who runs a legal aid clinic working with detainees at the jail.

“We work closely with immigrants at [the jail] and are quite surprised by this turn of events,” she said.

Neither Joyce’s office nor ICE and other federal agencies responded to questions about the moves on Friday morning. A spokesperson for Benson’s office pointed a reporter to the court filing.

Welch did not know when detainees started to be moved, describing the process as “very chaotic.” The people held at the Portland jail have typically been arrested by ICE outside of Maine.

Joyce’s office faced protests last year for holding inmates for ICE. Several people arrested in Maine in recent days have been sent to a jail in Massachusetts.

On Thursday, Joyce condemned ICE agents for “bush league” policing in the arrest of his recruit, whose car was left running on a Portland street. He described the actions of ICE agents as being in stark contrast to what he was told by Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar,” who said ICE’s priorities were securing borders and getting criminal immigrants off the street.

“Clearly, their motives are a little different than what we’ve been told, or at least in this case,” Joyce said Thursday.",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Kevin-Joyce.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 02:58:19.392551

As always, it will be worth watching how embattled lawmakers in tough seats talk about these subjects — if they do at all.","I just got back from Louisiana, where I talked with Republican voters about the state’s wild Senate primary contest and sampled a few too many beignets. (More on that race below.)

One thing that struck me as I chatted with voters in the Baton Rouge area: Even in deeply conservative Louisiana, there were hints of uneasiness with the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

“He thinks he’s picking up criminals, but he’s picking up too many U.S. citizens, as far as I’m concerned,” said Wayles Bradley, 69, who said he had voted for President Trump but didn’t consider himself “far right.”

“I wasn’t excited about the fact that the previous administration let so many people in illegally, and that was a very big concern of mine,” said a man who identified himself only as Craig T., 61, and called himself a “die-hard Republican.”

But he added, “it just seems like we’ve kind of gone 180 degrees in the other direction. I was OK with that, but it just seems like there’s a lot of — maybe it’s a little bit of overreach.”

Turns out, that sentiment is not merely anecdotal. A new poll from The New York Times and Siena University found that 61 percent of voters overall said the tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement had “gone too far,” including nearly one in five Republicans, as my colleagues Jennifer Medina and Ruth Igielnik reported today. Seventy-one percent of independents said the same.

It is possible the backlash may grow as the Trump administration expands its immigration operations, pushing this week into Maine — a critical Senate battleground state.

Already, crackdowns in other cities have left indelible images, like the photograph of a 5-year-old boy in an oversized blue hat who was detained with his father by immigration authorities in the Minneapolis area this week.

Some Republicans now seem to be trying to tread a bit more carefully, with Vice President JD Vance on Thursday saying the administration was seeking to “turn down the temperature” in Minneapolis. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who faces a difficult re-election contest, raised concerns about what she called “excessive” ICE tactics in an interview with Reuters.

And other Republicans, including Senator Jim Justice of West Virginia, have called for more training for ICE, Politico reported recently, even as they often stop short of criticizing the agency.

“They need to show more balance in enforcement and more compassion and empathy in enforcement,” Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate Pennsylvania Republican, told the outlet.

Of course, few Republican lawmakers are eager to voice opposition to Trump’s crackdown. And immigration — especially how to talk about enforcement — remains a challenging and divisive topic for Democrats.

The subject more broadly divides the country, too. The Times/Siena poll found that roughly half of voters support Trump’s deportations and his handling of the border with Mexico. Protest politics can also be complicated for Democrats to navigate.

Two months ago, Trump’s lawyers called on the court to uphold a new Republican-friendly election map in Texas, arguing that it was a partisan gerrymander, not one driven by race.

“Plaintiffs bringing a racial-gerrymander claim have the heavy burden to show that race was the predominant factor motivating” how the map was drawn, Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer said then.

The Supreme Court agreed by a 6-3 vote and lifted a judges’ order that had blocked the Texas map, which was drawn to win five more House seats for Republicans.

Voting rights advocates had sued, noting Gov. Greg Abbott said the goal was to eliminate four “coalition districts,” which had a combined majority of Black and Latino voters and elected Democrats.

In a brief opinion, the justices said they presume state officials acted in “good faith” in drawing the maps of congressional districts.

“It is indisputable that impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple,” wrote Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.

The justices also said it was too late in the election-year calendar for reshuffling the districts again.

Undeterred, Trump’s lawyers now stake out the near opposite view to support the GOP’s attack on the California map, which was upheld by the voters in November.

“California’s recent redistricting is tainted by an unconstitutional racial gerrymander,” Sauer wrote.

He pointed to past comments from Paul Mitchell, the designated map maker, who said he hoped the Latino districts in the Central Valley could be “bolstered in order to make them most effective.”

Trump’s lawyer said District 13 in Merced County has an odd-looking “northern plume” that brings in Democratic voters near Stockton.

“California’s motivation in adopting the Prop. 50 map as a whole was undoubtedly to counteract Texas’s political gerrymander,” Sauer said. “But that overarching political goal is not a license for district-level racial gerrymandering.”

He advised the justices to declare the new California map unconstitutional and require the state to return to the former map.

The political impact of such a ruling is obvious. It would likely cost Democrats five seats in the House of Representatives.

Justice Elena Kagan, who oversees appeals from the West Coast, asked for a response from California by Thursday. That would suggest the justices may act on the GOP’s appeal in the first week of February.

Election law experts have been skeptical of the Republican arguments in the California case.

“I don’t think Republicans are likely to prevail here,” UCLA law professor Rick Hasen wrote on his Election Law Blog.

He said the legal challenge “comes too late,” the proposed remedy is too broad, and it ignores the fact that the California’s voters were focused on partisanship, not race. It’s their intent that counts, he said.

Then, Hasen added, there’s “the optics. It would be a terrible look for the Court ... to allow Texas’s Republican gerrymander to go forward but stop California’s, especially if it’s a party line vote. That might be too much even for this Court.”

There is also a key legal difference in how the appeal arrived at the court.

In Texas, a three-judge panel heard the evidence, wrote a 160-page opinion and ruled against the state in a 2-1 decision.

In the California case, by contrast, a three-judge panel heard the evidence and rejected the racial gerrymandering claim in a 2-1 decision.

In December, Kagan dissented in the Texas case and argued the court should be reluctant to overturn the factual findings of the three judges who heard the case.

The two judges in the majority in the California case said they did not see evidence of a racial gerrymander.

“We find that the evidence of any racial motivation driving redistricting is exceptionally weak, while the evidence of partisan motivations is overwhelming,” said U.S. District Judges Josephine Staton and Wesley Hsu.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d6bac8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8667x4550+0+609/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F51%2F3d%2Faf3d2b2449cb91ead60cc6d47806%2F2245723072.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 01:57:18.264388

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers.
Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025.
The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024.
“So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said.","WASHINGTON -- Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.

“I would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,” Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.

A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China’s Xinjiang region.

The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.

Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said “there was no help from the outside world” and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.

He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.

“We are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,” said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “It’s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.”

Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.

“This illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,” she said in a written response to a request for comment. “All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.”

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.

In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan's case, the Illinois Democrat called for “careful adherence to due process and America’s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.”

Immigrants can apply for asylum when there’s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.

Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That's about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.

The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked “abandoned” when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group’s chief operating officer. He said it's not yet clear what caused the rise.

In cities across the country, some immigrants have stopped showing up for routine hearings after agents began making arrests right in the courtrooms, turning them into deportation traps.

Guan in 2020 secretly filmed detention facilities in Xinjiang, adding to a body of evidence of what activists say are widespread rights abuses in the region, where as many as 1 million members of ethnic minorities, especially the Uyghurs, have been locked up.

The Chinese government has denied the allegations, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts.

Beijing tolerates little dissent, especially on issues such as Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and Communist Party rule, and has largely silenced dissent through a range of coercive means, including detention and “forced disappearances.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Guan's case and his fears about being deported to China.

With the footage in hand, Guan knew he had to leave the country if he was to publish it. He went first to Hong Kong without a further plan. “I played it by ear,” he said.

From Hong Kong, he flew to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could then travel without a visa, and then on to the Bahamas before sailing to Florida in October 2021. By the time he arrived, he had released most of his video footage on YouTube.

Guan settled in Queens, a borough in New York City, and said he tried to live a “stable” life. Once he had a work permit, he worked as an Uber driver and did deliveries. He cut off contact with nearly all of his relatives back in China so they would not be harassed by the police.

He said he cherished the freedom from fear he enjoyed in the U.S. Then Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched his mass deportation campaign.

Guan said he understands why Trump has taken such a radical approach.

“It's because the past immigration policy was too lax and caused resentment from many people,” Guan said, adding that he considers such fluctuations to be “normal” in a democratic society.

“No matter what it is, any issue gets both support and opposition,” he said. “I also have come to know that people in all parts of the country are protesting the government's too aggressive behavior.”

Local residents who don't know him personally have shown their support, Guan said. “So these things, in total, have allowed me to experience the social atmosphere under the U.S. democratic system,” he said. “At the same time, I've felt the warmth of the U.S. society.”

Should he be released, he said he would cherish the opportunity to stay in the United States.

“I would like to do meaningful things,” Guan said. “I hope to establish some connections with others so that I can help others.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/d884f0fd-936e-4fba-aa1c-509d05d41bd7/wirestory_a63ab1448c2d719523c75269095f3c0a_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-23 21:58:32.320180

""There are rules and I know them,"" said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution's Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government's forced entry into someone's home.

As a result, immigration officers have had to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people's homes without a judge's warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

The change comes as immigration arrests nationwide soar under a mass deportation campaign by President Donald Trump's administration that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

""But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,"" he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

""Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,"" Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the ""physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.""

The waiting game

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn't leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called ""knock and talks"" to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Not answering the door is a key part of know-your-rights trainings

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They've held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School's Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo ""quite disturbing.""

""Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it's sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,"" he said. ""They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.""

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

""They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,"" he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump's border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

""They call it 'know-your-rights,'"" he said last year on CNN. ""I call it 'how to escape arrest.'""

Experts warn barging into homes could put all at risk

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they're at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a ""reasonable chance to act lawfully."" But if that doesn't work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-18T214723Z_1338556290_RC2W3JACU5AU_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 21:58:50.818220

And anybody who lays a hand on you or tries to stop you or tries to obstruct you is committing a felony. You have immunity to perform your duties. And no one, no city official, no state official, no illegal alien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist, can prevent you from fulfilling your legal obligations and duties. And the Department of Justice has made clear that if officials cross that line into obstruction, into criminal conspiracy against the United States or against ICE officers, then they will face justice.” What do you make of that? I make of that that Miller is trying to communicate to ICE, and to these new members of ICE in particular, that they will not face consequences for use of force specifically. I think he’s speaking to the ICE officer who shot Renee Good in Minnesota last week and killed her, but also to officers who’ve used tear gas, who’ve pushed and shoved and arrested protesters who’ve claimed that people who are filming them are impeding arrests and using that as a pretense to either take those people into custody or have some violent altercation with them. It is very striking. I was talking to one former ICE official who told me that you would always fear discharging your weapon in an interaction, even a potentially violent and a dangerous one. Usually the concern was that officers would be too unwilling to use their gun because they worried about potential repercussions. And there were all these layers of investigation that would take place after a shooting. And so his fear when he was in ICE for 30 years was that he wouldn’t use his gun in a moment when he needed to. And now it’s almost as if the opposite fear is true. And we’ve seen within ICE people losing their jobs. High-level officials losing their jobs because they’re not delivering enough deportations. They’re not being aggressive enough. And so I think Miller is just underscoring that argument that you’re not going to get in trouble for being too aggressive.

“The safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system depend on restoring law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime rather than simply turning the federal government into an immigration enforcement machine.”

Text of Letter (PDF)

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), along with Representative Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) led 27 lawmakers in writing to the Inspectors General for the Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of State (State), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), and the Office of Tax Administration (TIGTA), asking the watchdogs to investigate the impact of the Trump administration’s diversion of law enforcement resources away from white collar and corporate crime and in favor of immigration enforcement.

“The Trump Administration is letting white collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing. Instead of protecting American families from fraud and predatory behavior, the Administration is diverting resources to pursue its inhumane immigration agenda,” said Senator Warren. “Nobody is above the law, and the Trump Administration needs to stop treating white collar criminals with kid gloves.”

“The Trump Administration’s diversion of critical resources and personnel away from white-collar crime undermines our country’s ability to combat fraud schemes, market manipulation, and corruption—seriously threatening the security of American families and leaving them vulnerable to predatory practices. These staff and resource diversions exemplify this Administration’s reckless decision-making in service of Trump’s brutal, ruthless immigration enforcement agenda. I call on the Inspectors General to fulfill their duty as nonpartisan watchdogs and illuminate this Administration’s abuse of power,” said Senator Blumenthal.

“Trump is letting white collar criminals run rampant without consequences so he can shift law enforcement to violently attack immigrants - the overwhelming majority of whom have no criminal record,” said Representative Goldman. “Having 25,000 fewer law enforcement personnel investigating and prosecuting white collar crime enables fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and other crimes that hurt the American people. Federal Inspectors General must conduct a thorough investigation of the impact of these diversions.”

Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) joined in signing the letter, as did Representatives Yassamin Ansari (D-Ariz.), Wesley Bell (D-Mo.), Lou Correa (D-Calif.), Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), Suzan DelBene (D-Wash.), Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), John Garamendi (D-Calif.), Henry Johnson (D-Ga.), Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), Dave Min (D-Calif.), Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.).

“When white-collar criminal enforcement is neglected, the American public pays the price. Ordinary people are left more vulnerable to fraud schemes, market manipulation, predatory financial practices, and corruption…while the wealthiest bend the rules and exploit a weakened enforcement system that no longer holds them accountable,” said the lawmakers.

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has reportedly diverted over 25,000 law enforcement personnel to immigration enforcement. Many of those agents had been dedicated to combating white-collar crimes—including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and more.

Those diversions include:

Nearly one quarter of FBI agents nationwide;

More than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation employees;

Around 300 State Department Diplomatic Security Service agents;

More than 90 percent of the Homeland Security Investigations workforce;

Dozens of career prosecutors from DOJ’s Public Integrity Section and National Security Division; and

Even members of the US Postal Inspection Service.

“Taken together, these moves represent a massive diversion of specialized law-enforcement talent away from criminal financial investigations and prosecutions and toward civil immigration enforcement,” wrote the lawmakers.

Several agencies are experiencing the consequences of these diversions. For example, the mass reassignment of HSI agents to immigration removal operations means that “critical threats could go uninvestigated.” Diverting State Department resources to ICE weakens cross-border investigations into corruption, fraud, and international financial crimes. The diversion of FBI and DOJ personnel from white-collar units has caused delays and the deprioritization of complex financial crime cases such as public corruption, corporate fraud, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prosecutions.

These diversions “undermin[e] the federal government’s ability to hold powerful actors accountable,” said the lawmakers.

In 2024 alone, for example, the IRS Criminal Investigations team helped recover more than $9 billion in fraudulent proceedings—acting on a budget of just $800 million. It’s unclear how the diversions are affecting agencies’ ability to investigate fraud, but the moves remove the federal government’s dedicated team to tackle white-collar crime.

“In practice, these diversions also undermine deterrence: when white-collar criminals believe that federal enforcement units lack the resources or continuity to pursue long-term cases, they may become more emboldened to take risks that endanger markets, taxpayers, and public institutions,” wrote the lawmakers.

“The safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system depend on restoring law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime rather than simply turning the federal government into an immigration enforcement machine,” the lawmakers concluded.

The lawmakers asked the IGs to provide the information below as a part of their investigation:

A breakdown of how many law enforcement personnel have been reassigned from each agency for immigration enforcement;

A breakdown of how many white-collar crimes cases (including but not limited to financial fraud, corruption, FCPA, and money-laundering cases) have been opened, closed, or suspended since the start of the second Trump administration;

Any internal assessments conducted by agencies to determine the impacts of diverting law enforcement resources; and

An accounting of complaints or whistleblower disclosures received about these diversions;

A list of the safeguards that exist to ensure each agency still meets its statutory white-collar criminal investigative obligations despite these diversions.

The homicide finding adds to intensifying controversy over deaths involving ICE, following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.
This marks the highest figure since 2004, and there have already been a further six deaths reported in ICE custody so far this year.
More than 65,000 people are currently in ICE custody, a two-thirds jump since Trump took office.","US immigration enforcement faced mounting scrutiny Friday from international officials as well as congressional Democrats after a detainee death ruled a homicide by a county medical examiner in Texas. The disturbing development comes amid record deaths in Homeland Security custody.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk called on the US to ensure that its immigration policies comply with international law, citing reports of arbitrary detentions, family separations, and dehumanizing treatment. And Democratic lawmakers demanded that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem answer for a growing death toll in immigration detention since President Donald Trump took office for his second term.

The medical examiner in El Paso County found this week that Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old Cuban migrant held at a local Homeland Security detention camp, died of asphyxiation on January 3—a homicide. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) initially said Campos died after staff “observed him in distress.” The Washington Post reported witness testimony that camp guards had choked him to death.

The homicide finding adds to intensifying controversy over deaths involving ICE, following the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an ICE officer in Minneapolis.

The UN’s Türk said that individuals are being detained “sometimes violently” at hospitals, places of worship, schools, and homes, “often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants.” He noted that children are missing school and medical appointments out of fear of family separation.

“States have the authority to establish their national migration policies, but this needs to be carried out in full accordance with the law,” Türk said. “Adhering to due process is crucial to the legality and legitimacy of any policy.”

Türk’s statement comes amid declining public support for ICE. A New York Times/Siena University poll of 1,625 registered voters conducted Jan. 12-17 found that 61 percent of voters believe ICE tactics have “gone too far,” including 71 percent of independents and 19 percent of Republicans. Across the political spectrum, just 26 percent of voters thought the enforcement tactics used by ICE were “about right.”

In Friday’s statement, Türk also called for an independent investigation into deaths in ICE custody, adding that 30 people are reported to have died in ICE custody since President Donald Trump took office for his second term on Jan. 20, 2025. This marks the highest figure since 2004, and there have already been a further six deaths reported in ICE custody so far this year.

The ICE detainee death reporting website lists only 18 deaths for fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, but the page has not been updated since October and does not yet include figures for fiscal year 2026. More than 65,000 people are currently in ICE custody, a two-thirds jump since Trump took office.

“We cannot abide living under this federal occupation of Minnesota,” Tollgaard said.

Protesters demand ICE leave Minnesota

The Rev. Elizabeth Barish Browne traveled from Cheyenne, Wyoming, to participate in the rally in downtown Minneapolis, where the high temperature was minus 9 degrees Fahrenheit despite a bright sun.

“What’s happening here is clearly immoral,” the Unitarian Universalist minister said. “It’s definitely chilly, but the kind of ice that’s dangerous to us is not the weather.”

Protesters have gathered daily in the Twin Cities since Jan. 7, when 37-year-old mother of three Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer. Federal law enforcement officers have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.

Sam Nelson said he skipped work so he could join the march. He said he’s a former student of the Minneapolis high school where federal agents detained someone after class earlier this month. That arrest led to altercations between federal officers and bystanders.

“It’s my community,” Nelson said. “Like everyone else, I don’t want ICE on our streets.”

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses statewide have closed in solidarity with the movement, from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

“We’re achieving something historic,” said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 participating groups.

DHS confirms the detention of a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old

A 2-year-old named Chloe was detained with her father as they drove home from a grocery store in South Minneapolis on Thursday, according to a GoFundMe page created by Minneapolis City Council member Jason Chavez.

Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Border Patrol arrested Elvis Tipan Echeverria of Ecuador and that the toddler’s mother refused to take her so she was reunited with her father at a federal detention facility.

According to an emergency petition filed in federal court, a district judge granted an emergency injunction ordering Chloe’s release into the custody of her lawyer. The child, a citizen of Ecuador who was brought to Minneapolis as a newborn, has a pending asylum application and is not subject to a final order of removal.

DHS repeated its allegation Friday that the father of 5-year-old Liam Ramos abandoned him during his arrest by immigration officers in Columbia Heights on Tuesday, leading to the child being detained, too.

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Liam was detained because his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, “fled from the scene.” The two are detained together at the Dilley Detention Center in Texas, which is intended to hold families. McLaughlin said officers tried to get Liam’s mother to take him, but she refused to accept custody.

The family’s attorney Marc Prokosch said he thinks the mother refused to open the door to the ICE officers because she was afraid she would be detained. Columbia Heights district superintendent Zena Stenvik said Liam was “used as bait.”

Prokosch found nothing in state records to suggest Liam’s father has a criminal history.

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative away from Liam’s detention by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

Details from Good’s autopsy

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner posted an initial autopsy report online for Good that classified her death as a homicide and determined she died from “multiple gunshots wounds.”

A more detailed independent autopsy commissioned by Good’s family said one bullet pierced the left side her head and exited on the right side. This autopsy, released Wednesday through the Romanucci & Blandin law firm, said bullets also struck her in the arm and breast, although those injuries weren’t immediately life-threatening.

Antonio Romanucci, an attorney for the family, said in a statement that the family is still awaiting the full report from the medical examiner and “hope that they communicate with Renee’s family and share their report before releasing any further information to the public.”

The massive protest began at The Commons Park at 2 p.m. in Minneapolis. The march ended with a rally at Target Center.

Natasha Dockter, the first vice president of the Minneapolis Federation of Educators’ teachers chapter, handed out hand warmers to demonstrators at The Commons alongside other teachers.

“I’m out here today because what’s going on in our city is completely and totally unacceptable. It’s impacting the lives of our students and their families that we serve,” Dockter said.

Daniel agreed: “We can really feel that everyone’s on board here — that this is ridiculous and it’s gotta stop.”

Daniela Morales, 16, carrying a Mexican flag, said her parents are both Mexican immigrants and that she attended the protest on behalf of people who can’t speak out.

“I’m really glad to see everybody come out and support each other and our neighbors and fight against the administration,” Morales said.

Other protests led to arrests

A morning protest at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport led to the arrests of roughly 100 clergy by MSP and Bloomington law enforcement Friday, according to a statement from protest organizers.

Demonstrators at the airport were standing or kneeling on the roadway outside Terminal 1’s departures area and led away by law enforcement.

Jeff Lea, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Airports Commission, said in an email that the airport “worked in advance with event organizers to best accommodate their right to freedom of expression while also ensuring uninterrupted operations.”

“When the permitted activity went beyond the agreed-upon terms, MSP Airport Police began taking necessary action, including arrests, to protect public safety, airport security and access to Terminal 1,” Lea wrote. Lea confirmed there were around 100 arrests.

At least one demonstrator was also arrested at the nearby Whipple Federal Building, where federal agents deployed chemical irritants into a crowd of protestors, the Star Tribune reported. Around noon, the Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office announced that it had given three dispersal orders for protestors to unblock an access road at the building. The Whipple Building, now a base for federal immigration operations, has been an ongoing site of protests.

Life stood still Friday for many Minnesotans. Over 700 businesses closed Friday to support the “ICE Out” day, according to Bring Me The News, which is keeping a running list.

In March 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 14224 that declared English as the official language of the United States and revoked EO 13166, a 25-year-old mandate that required agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide critical language access to individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). The Trump administration's Department of Justice issued new guidance that minimizes multilingual services and redirects resources towards English language education and assimilation.

These policy changes threaten language access for the over 25 million individuals in the United States—eight percent of the U.S. population—with limited English proficiency. Asian Americans have among the highest language access needs of any racial group, with 32 percent having LEP. 12 percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders also have significant language access needs. And while Spanish language speakers make up the majority of those who speak another language in the United States, nearly 40 percent report speaking English “less than very well” in the most recent U.S. Census.

The Language Access for All Act of 2026 modernizes and strengthens the federal government’s approach to language access by codifying EO 13166 and establishing a coordinated, accountable framework to ensure meaningful access for individuals with limited English proficiency. The legislation promotes consistency across agencies, increases transparency and public engagement, and updates federal language access policy to reflect evolving technologies.

“For more than 25 years, both Democratic and Republican presidents have supported language accessibility across the federal government. Trump’s roll back of these protections is simply wrong. In my district, translation services are essential for parents applying for a home loan, seniors accessing Medicare, immigrants starting a small business, and disaster survivors accessing the FEMA’s resources. That is why I’m proud to co-lead the Language Access for All Act to ensure no one is denied health care, housing, or disaster assistance because English is not their first language. Language access is a civil right and rolling back these services is an attack on our immigrant communities,” said Congressmember Judy Chu (CA-28).

“Every American deserves equal access to federal services and programs in a language they can understand. Language access is essential to ensure individuals are able to access small business loans or receive the right medical care,” said Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), Chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. “I am proud to introduce the Language Access for All Act alongside my colleagues to safeguard translation services for individuals with limited English proficiency, including millions in the Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community. We will continue to fight against the Trump administration's attacks on immigrants and the essential services that our communities rely on and deserve.”

“For decades, federal language access services have helped millions of people file taxes, get emergency alerts, apply for loans, and access health care. Trump’s decision to designate English as our country’s official language and attempt to scrap these critical services is dead wrong,” said Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-51). “No one should be locked out of federal programs because of the language they speak. This legislation is critical as we fight to push back on Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda and keep in place the services our communities rely on.”

“In my district, in the most linguistically diverse city on earth, language access mandates across the federal government helps ensure that everyone has meaningful access to housing loans, health care, workforce programs, and life-saving emergency alerts. Trump's attempt to roll back language access is just one of his many xenophobic attempts to attack immigrant communities, and it is completely unacceptable. I am proud to be introducing legislation to restore common sense requirements and ensure information about basic government services is made available to all,” said Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10).

The Language Access for All Act of 2026:

Requires federal agencies to ensure that individuals with LEP can meaningfully access the federally conducted programs and activities of the agency, including through translation and interpretation.

Creates a public complaint system to track complaints regarding barriers to meaningful access at agencies.

Requires agencies to develop and maintain language access plans consistent with EO 13166, with public notice and comment, and to submit plans to Congress and publish them on LEP.gov.

Establishes language access technical standards that allow individuals with LEP to access agency content. This applies to all agency communications, including AI and automated language assistance services.

Ensures AI-assisted language services do not replace qualified translators and interpreters, comply with federal privacy requirements, and are continuously tested for bias, discrimination, and errors.

Creates an interagency language access working group to provide guidance, coordination, and technical assistance.

Requires each agency to designate a language access coordinator to lead implementation and serve as a point of contact.

Together, these reforms aim to improve service delivery, reduce barriers to access, and ensure federal agencies are equipped to meet the language needs of the public.

This bill builds upon Congressmember Chu’s longstanding commitment to ensuring language accessibility, beginning with her work as a City Councilmember, fighting against an ugly “English-only” movement in her hometown of Monterey Park. On August 15, 2025, Reps. Chu, Meng, and Vargas led 58 House colleagues in a letter to President Trump and the Department of Justice, on the administration’s rollback of language access across federal agencies and its impact on LEP communities. On April 11, 2025, Rep. Chu also led an oversight letter with Rep. Meng and 54 other House Democrats opposing the initial release of President Trump’s EO 14224.

Friday’s walkout includes small businesses, unions, faith groups, and educators across the city, which has become a focal point of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency’s aggressive actions. The call, organised by a coalition of community groups, also urges a suspension of consumer spending.

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN,” the group organising the protest wrote on its website.

There are solidarity marches in cities across the US, including New York City, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Seattle, among others.

At the Minneapolis protest, the group is also planning a march that begins at 2pm local time (20:00 GMT) and ends at the Target Center — an arena in downtown Minneapolis.

Eyes on Target

The big-box retailer, in particular, has been in the crosshairs of organisers because of the company’s close ties to Minneapolis, where its headquarters are located, and it is the state’s fourth-largest employer.

The group is calling for Target stores to exercise protections under the Fourth Amendment, which would mean federal agents do not have the legal authority to enter a residence or place of business without a warrant signed by a judge.

In a document shared with organisers, the group pointed to two incidents of concern. One on January 8, when Customs and Border Patrol aggressively forced two US citizens onto the ground and subsequently detained them while working at a store in Richfield, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, and another three days later in nearby St Paul, where Customs and Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino entered a store with other agents.

“Where Target leads, others follow. Our state is under occupation from federal agents, and they are attacking Minnesotans quite literally inside of Target stores. We need Target to stand with Minnesotans against these attacks,” the document said.

Target has been quiet about the protests and calls from its workers to take a stance. The company sent a memo to staff, according to Bloomberg News, warning of potential disruptions.

The pressure by anti-ICE protesters is the latest in a wave of pushback against the retail giant by progressives in the past year. There was a call for boycotts after the company rolled back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which the company later attributed to a reason for a downturn in sales in early 2025.

The looming tensions have not made a dent on Wall Street, as the company’s stock is up 1.3 percent in midday trading.

Target did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

The political response

“The Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement operations have resulted in countless dangerous criminal illegals being removed from the streets – including rapists, murderers, burglars, drunk drivers, and more. Making American communities safer will create an environment in which all businesses can thrive in the long term and their customers can feel safe. Joe Biden and Democrat leaders should’ve never let countless dangerous criminal illegals enter our country to begin with. And now the Trump Administration is cleaning up the Democrats’ mess,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Al Jazeera in a statement.

When pressed for a response to this reasoning and asked whether ICE would commit to holding accountable agents who break the law, the White House declined to provide additional comment.

The allegations concerning the agency’s conduct have led to the protests, including claims that ICE’s actions violated First and Fourth Amendment protections and threats towards protesters.

Among them are the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a case that has drawn scrutiny from civil liberties advocates, and the Department of Justice’s decision not to investigate the agent behind the shooting, which has invoked further outrage. One of the economic blackout’s calls is to hold Jonathan Ross, the agent who shot and killed Renee Good, legally accountable.

“I understand why people are choosing to participate in the January 23 blackout, and I support those decisions. At the same time, our small businesses, especially immigrant-owned businesses, are under a lot of pressure right now, and they could really use our support. However you choose to show up, I hope we keep our neighbours and local businesses in mind,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement provided to Al Jazeera.

LEADER JEFFRIES: As Members of the New York delegation, as Members of the Florida delegation, we understand how important the Haitian American community has been to vitality and prosperity in our states and, of course, we also understand that many Haitians who have been here for years pursuant to TPS have been contributing to communities all across the country in ways that have improved the livelihood of those communities.

I stand in strong support of Congresswoman Clarke’s resolution, particularly as it relates to the protection of women, children, girls and families. The situation in Haiti right now is not conducive to women or girls, children or families returning to a safe environment. There’s still a significant amount of progress that needs to be made with respect to an environment that has far too much gang violence, sexual violence and gender violence. And it is inhumane to send hundreds of thousands of people back to an environment that the Trump administration knows objectively places them at risk. And so, I joined the call for the extension of TPS beyond the expiration that is pending in early February and also support the effort to come to a comprehensive solution.

By the end of November 2025, ICE was using 104 more facilities for immigration detention than at the start of the year, a 91% increase.
With release on bond no longer an option for many people seeking relief, and deleterious conditions inside facilities, immigrants are increasingly giving up.
As of November 2025, 14.3 people were deported directly from detention for every one person released from ICE detention pending a hearing.
Inside ICE detention itself, the conditions that have resulted from this rapid expansion for those caught up in the detention system have increasingly worsened and become more inhumane.","When President Trump took office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was holding roughly 40,000 people in a national network of detention centers on any given day. In just one year, this number has increased by over 75%, with a record 73,000 people being held in detention as of mid-January.

A new report by the American Immigration Council details the unprecedented growth of ICE detention over President Trump’s first term, which has been fueled by a staggering $45 billion in funding for ICE detention included in the signature “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The report chronicles how the ICE detention system has grown larger, more abusive, and more opaque than ever as the Trump administration rushes to detain ever-greater numbers of immigrants as part of its mass deportation push.

What the report finds:

The number of people held in ICE detention on any given day increased by over 75% in one year.

By the end of November 2025, ICE was using 104 more facilities for immigration detention than at the start of the year, a 91% increase.

The Trump administration has dramatically changed the profile of who is being arrested by increasing the use of “at-large” arrests in American communities by 600%, leading to an unprecedented deployment of federal law enforcement.

With the funding provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, ICE has enough funding to operate upwards of 135,000 detention beds through the end of FY 2029.

These changes in arrest practices have led to a 2,450% increase in the number of people with no criminal record being held in ICE detention on any given day.

President Trump’s executive order calling for the maximum use of detention has created a “no release” system where increasingly few individuals are able to seek release on bond. By the end of November 2025, discretionary releases from detention fell by 87%.

With release on bond no longer an option for many people seeking relief, and deleterious conditions inside facilities, immigrants are increasingly giving up. As of November 2025, 14.3 people were deported directly from detention for every one person released from ICE detention pending a hearing.

How the detention and enforcement system has changed under Trump

The changes that have occurred in detention go beyond basic questions of infrastructure and development of the capacity to detain. As immigration enforcement has become the top priority of federal law enforcement, major shifts have occurred in the profile of who is arrested, and therefore who is detained.

T These changes have resulted from the expansion of “at-large” arrests in American communities, worksite raids at farms, construction sites, factories, and other businesses, and new “re-arrest” policies at ICE check-ins and immigration courthouses. American communities are now seeing a level of immigration enforcement utterly unprecedented in modern history, leading to a rising backlash and clashes between protestors and DHS officials.

Once people have been arrested, changes in policy have kept them locked up in detention centers for longer or indefinitely, including the establishment of an official no-release policy and the expanded use of “mandatory detention” laws to deny the right to seek bond. People who would have been released by any past administration are now being pressured into giving up their day in court. Immigration judges have been directed to deny bond to thousands of people who were previously eligible, and ICE officers have been told that only high-level officials can approve humanitarian releases.

As more people are detained, those held by ICE are suffering the consequences of the rapid expansion of detention infrastructure. ICE has signed extensive new contracts with private prison companies to reopen shuttered prisons and detention centers or expand existing facilities. At the same time, the agency has begun experimenting with new models for immigration detention of people arrested inside the country, including partnering with Florida on an unprecedented state-based detention center (the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” and the opening of a tent camp on a military base in El Paso).

New plans suggest that the administration may even purchase unused commercial warehouses and convert them into jails to hold thousands of people at a time. This expansion has come alongside the reduction of both internal and external oversight into conditions on the ground, making it harder than ever to track what is going on inside facilities or ensure that contractors are following the law.

Inside ICE detention itself, the conditions that have resulted from this rapid expansion for those caught up in the detention system have increasingly worsened and become more inhumane. With more arrests than detention beds to hold people, ICE facilities saw significant overcrowding in 2025, worsening and substandard medical care, growing complaints of abusive conditions, and documented extensive violations of detention standards. As the system expands before officials ensure there are enough staff or infrastructure in place, people have been “disappearing” for days as ICE’s detainee locator system has become unreliable and access to phones uncertain. Sadly, 2025 was the deadliest year for ICE detention on record, and 2026 is looking to be worse.

A system of detention, which did not fully take off until the mid-1990s, is now on track to rival the entire federal criminal prison system by the end of President Trump’s second term in office. With the Trump administration hoping to get over 100,000 detention beds or more online in 2026, ICE detention and the ongoing abuses inside these facilities will only grow more numerous. As the report documents, it will ultimately be on Congress to rein the agency back in. But until that happens, the system is likely to grow even larger for now; and unfortunately the consequences may be deadly.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-impact-report-detention.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:57:56.937561

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.","SAN DIEGO -- Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said U.S. immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door.

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day laborer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Over the decades it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government’s forced entry into someone’s home.

As a result, immigration officers have been forced to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

The shift comes as President Donald Trump's administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that's the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo's directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man's home in Minneapolis on Jan. 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorizing its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed.”

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he didn’t leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations.

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They’ve held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing.”

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it’s sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,'” he said last year on CNN. ""I call it ‘how to escape arrest.’”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they’re at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6 a.m. and before 10 p.m. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully.” But if that doesn’t work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of U.S. citizens.

Arulanantham said agents' aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court's order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you're not safe even in your own house.”

And now there are new questions being raised about ICE's warrants to enter homes.

A whistleblower group leaked an internal memo from ICE, suggesting federal agents can rely on administrative warrants to make arrests instead of judicial warrants.

That would mean a judge does not have to sign off for agents to enter a suspect's home.

The whistleblower group argued this violates Department of Homeland Security's own policy.

They also said it violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches and seizures by the government.

Here at home, the latest turn of events is alarming civil rights advocates.

The Aloha State is known as a melting pot with generations of immigrants and multiethnic people.

Some of them are now worried federal officers may be allowed enter a home without a judge's warrant.

""It is very terrifying and scary that they could potentially just target homes,"" said a Hawaii resident who asked to remain anonymous because her family member was deported. ""We're very worried for communities, we are a state made up of immigrants.""

""Raised here, there's a sense of community, there's a sense of belonging, respect for the host culture as well as respect for the diversity of culture,"" she added. ""I just hope that that survives.""

The latest immigration policy is alarming advocates at the ACLU of Hawaii.

""This policy puts everybody at risk because we know that there are mistakes that are getting made and that any immigration officer can sign one of these administrative warrants,"" said Emily Hills, the ACLU's senior staff attorney.

She said the Fourth Amendment is all about checks and balances and making sure that the government is operating appropriately and within constitutional limits.

""It makes you question, 'Is it going to be me next, right?' For me personally as a naturalized US citizen from the Filipino community, those are things that that come to mind,"" said Sergio Alcubilla, the ACLU's director of community engagement.

And the uncertainty is widespread.

""You're pitting immigrant communities against each other—legal, illegal—making folks wonder 'Is my neighbor here, you know, legally?' And those are things that don't sit well with people here in Hawaii,"" Alcubilla said.

Why it matters: For the 2028ers, voting ""no"" on a bill that's likely to pass the Senate next week is an easy way to signal their outrage at a president whose actions and policies they detest.

But for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), it's another reminder that funding a government controlled by President Trump can quickly inflame his base, especially if his colleagues are fanning the flames.

The intrigue: Schumer hasn't said how he'll vote on the minibus the House passed Thursday, but, earlier this month, he took the idea of another government shutdown off the table.

Last March, Schumer was filleted for supporting a short-term funding bill.

In September, he course-corrected and touted his willingness to shut down the government.

On its own, the 2028ers' opposition wouldn't be enough to derail plans to prevent a government funding lapse after Jan. 30, but that could change if more Democrats join them.

What they are saying: Many of the Democratic senators weighing a run for the White House in 2028 have been vocal on the issue, particularly Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has consistently demanded reforms to ICE and threatened to vote against funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) was also clear on MSNOW on Tuesday night: ""I've said repeatedly that I will not support one dime of funding for Trump's lawless ICE operations. I will vote no.""

""Yeah, I am not voting to give whatever ICE has become more taxpayer money,"" Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) said on X on Wednesday.

""I will vote against this bill when and if it comes to the Senate,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said on X on Thursday.

""I will not vote to fund DHS and ICE,"" Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said on X last week.

Between the lines: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) suggested at an event in Michigan this week that she may not support DHS funding, but hasn't been definitive.

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) has not taken a public position.

The other side: House Democrats got a separate vote on funding for ICE, with 206 voting against it and only seven supporting. It passed, 220-207.

Compare that with the remaining three bills — which will fund the Departments of Defense, Labor, HHS, Education, Transportation and HUD — in the minibus. That passed 341-88, with 64 Democrats voting against it.

The bottom line: The minibus — which will include six bills in the Senate — doesn't appear in danger of failing at the moment, but the margins will be interesting.

Judge questions Trump's authority for $400 million ballroom project

Preservation group seeks injuction halting work

Ruling expected in coming weeks

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A judge in Washington on Thursday sharply questioned whether President Donald Trump's administration had authority to proceed with the construction of a $400-million White House ballroom on the site of the demolished East Wing.

At a hearing in a lawsuit brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon raised doubts whether Trump had statutory power to tear down the East Wing with plans to build a ballroom in its place without approval or oversight from the U.S. Congress.

Leon snapped, ""Come on, be serious"" after a lawyer for the administration drew parallels to the erection of a pool during the Gerald Ford administration in the 1970s and other smaller renovations.

Leon said he would aim to issue a ruling in the coming weeks on the National Trust's request for a preliminary injunction to stop work on the 90,000-square-foot (8,361-square-meter) ballroom.

The National Trust sued Trump and several federal agencies in December, arguing the project has proceeded without required approvals, environmental review or congressional authorization.

The group says federal law bars construction on federal parkland in Washington without the express authority of Congress. It also argues the National Park Service violated federal law by issuing an environmental assessment instead of a full impact statement, and by releasing it after demolition began on the 120-year-old East Wing.

Leon in December declined to issue a temporary restraining order in the case. The White House and other federal defendants have urged the court to deny a preliminary injunction, which would force an end to construction while the lawsuit proceeds.

The administration has defended the legality of the project, arguing it followed in a long line of presidential renovations, including Franklin D. Roosevelt's construction of the East Wing itself.

The ballroom is needed for state functions, its design is still evolving, and above-ground construction is not planned until April, making an injunction unnecessary, the administration said in a court filing.

Justice Department lawyer Jacob Roth asserted at Thursday's hearing that the ballroom plans advance the public interest.

The National Capital Planning Commission held a hearing earlier this month about the ballroom plans, the first time plans for the ballroom had been discussed in a public forum. The White House submitted an application for the project to the NCPC and the Commission of Fine Arts last month.

Human Trafficking Prevention Month presents an opportunity for DHS and DOJ, through Homeland Security Task Forces (HSTF), to intensify operational efforts, raise public awareness, and strengthen partnerships across federal, state, and local agencies to disrupt trafficking networks, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure traffickers are brought to justice.

“Through the Homeland Security Task Force, President Trump is taking the fight directly to human trafficking networks and disrupting their modern-day slave trade while seizing their assets and arresting their kingpins and foot soldiers. The American people should not have to live in fear of cartels, gangbangers, and foreign terrorists preying upon the most vulnerable among us,” the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in a statement. “The Homeland Security Task Force is the largest coordinated campaign against transnational criminal organizations in U.S. history, and I’m proud to co-lead it with Attorney General Bondi.”

“This Department of Justice is working tirelessly alongside our partners to dismantle human trafficking networks, help survivors, and protect vulnerable populations from being exploited,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “Under this administration we have seen an increase in human trafficking prosecutions, and during Human Trafficking Prevention Month we reaffirm our commitment to prosecuting traffickers and encourage Americans to report instances of human trafficking in their communities.”

“During Human Trafficking Prevention Month, the FBI reiterates our work with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies and national victim-based advocacy groups in joint task forces to protect our communities across the country,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “The horrifying reach of human trafficking spreads far and wide. Homeland Security Task Forces are fighting back to disrupt these perilous networks and put a stop to that reach. The FBI will continue our investigations and bring justice to those exploited by human traffickers.”

In January 2025, President Donald J. Trump signed Executive Order 14159, Protecting the American People Against Invasion. Section 6 of this order directed the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly establish HSTFs in every state nationwide. The HSTF objective is to end the presence of criminal cartels, foreign gangs, and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) throughout the United States; dismantle cross-border human smuggling and trafficking networks; end the scourge of human smuggling and trafficking, with a particular focus on such offenses involving children; and ensure the use of all available law enforcement tools to faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States.

In January 2026, DHS and DOJ are surging resources to fight and raise awareness about human trafficking, including:

Identifying ongoing investigations and prioritizing featured operations across 45 federal locations and 10 state locations with an emphasis on border states.

Coordinating with FBI Human Trafficking Squads and multi-agency Human Trafficking Task Forces to conduct victim recovery.

Partnering with AMTRAK and FAMS to increase law enforcement resources and distribute posters with QR codes for reporting human trafficking in all station bathrooms and trains.

Running advertisements related to $250 million recovery from Backpage to distribute to victims and additional victim restitution efforts by DOL-OIG.

Organizing Human Trafficking seminars and outreach events with DHS Center for Countering Human Trafficking at high schools and colleges to highlight the role of HSTFs in addressing human trafficking.

On August 25, 2025, HSTF officially launched its effort to protect the Homeland with a September Surge encompassing 400 operations nationwide. In just 43 days, HSTF nationwide operations resulted in 3,266 arrests and seizures including:

1,041 Sinaloa members,

856 Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (“CJNG”) members,

641 MS-13 members,

456 Tren de Aragua members,

1,067 weapons,

More than $3,250,000 in currency,

Approximately 91 metric tons of narcotics.

In 2023, no habeas corpus cases related to alien detainees were filed, and in 2024, only one.
Nationally, information clearinghouse Habeas Dockets LLC reports more than 9,500 immigration-related habeas corpus filings are pending in federal district courts.
“We didn’t even do habeas cases until this (Trump) administration took over.” What is habeas corpus Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “you should have the body.” In short, it means a judge must have any person who has been detained brought into the courtroom so that the legality of his or her detention can be reviewed.
This spring, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump’s administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus for immigrant detainees, pointing to the “invasion” aspect of the clause.","As changes in the immigration court system create uncertainty for detainees, immigration attorneys are now turning to a 200-year-old American legal doctrine to get their clients released from detention facilities across the country.

That doctrine, known as a writ of habeas corpus, has typically been used as a last-ditch effort to give those behind bars a chance to present their case before a federal district judge and force the government to explain why a person’s detention is legal.

Now, attorneys are using it as a fast-pass ticket to seek a district court order that forces immigration judges to grant detainees a bond hearing or order their release.

“We have no choice. We have to file a habeas,” Constance Doyle, an Illinois-based attorney representing a recently released immigrant detainee, said in an interview with The Indiana Lawyer last week.

Without a habeas corpus filing, immigration courts now routinely deny bond hearings for detainees’ potential release.

“Things have changed a lot,” Doyle said.

How it works

The legal strategy worked for Doyle’s client, Jorge Garcia Ortiz.

After nearly two months in custody, he won a court order in late December releasing him from the Indiana Department of Correction’s Miami Correctional Facility, which has a contract with the federal government to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees.

Ortiz was detained on Nov. 5 after the vehicle he was driving on I-90 near Rockford, Illinois, was struck by an ICE vehicle, according to his attorneys and court documents.

Once Ortiz’s vehicle was forced to the side of the road, ICE officers drew their weapons and broke Ortiz’s window to forcibly remove him from the vehicle.

Ortiz was detained and taken to Broadview, Illinois, to be processed. He was then transferred to Miami Correctional Facility near Peru, Indiana.

According to court documents, Ortiz, now 38 years old, came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2000. His attorneys say he has never left the U.S. since arriving here, and he now has five children—all U.S. citizens. Ortiz also has a minor criminal record, with a burglary conviction from more than 10 years ago.

In the past, most immigrants who entered the country without inspection and were later arrested by immigration authorities were typically eligible to request a bond hearing. The immigration judge had discretion to grant bond for release if the immigrant could show they were not a danger or a flight risk.

That practice changed last fall.

On Sep. 5, the Board of Immigration Appeals, or BIA, ruled in Matter of Yajure Hurtado that individuals who entered the U.S. without inspection are not eligible for a bond hearing before an immigration judge.

Much of the debate in that case, and in the pending federal cases, was based on the interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which details rules regarding the inspection, detention and removal of noncitizens.

Specifically, the discussion hinges on which noncitizens receive mandatory detention: those actively entering the country who have not been properly admitted or those who have been living in the country for a time who were not properly admitted.

In Hurtado, the BIA concluded that both categories of noncitizens warrant mandatory detention and are exempt from bond hearings.

In that case, Hurtado, who entered the U.S. without inspection, conceded that he is an “applicant for admission” under INA § 1225. Under that section, an applicant for admission is “an alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters).”

Hurtado also argued that because he lived inside the U.S. for almost three years, he cannot be considered as one “seeking admission,” a specific category of applicant for admission in § 1225 who “shall be detained.”

The BIA determined in its Sep. 5 ruling that Hurtado’s argument creates a “legal conundrum.”

“If he is not admitted to the United States (as he admits) but he is not ‘seeking admission’ (as he contends), then what is his legal status?” BIA stated. “The respondent provides no legal authority for the proposition that after some undefined period of time residing in the interior of the United States without lawful status, the INA provides that an applicant for admission is no longer ‘seeking admission,’ and has somehow converted to a status that renders him or her eligible for a bond hearing under section 236(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C.A. § 1226(a).”

Because of the BIA’s conclusions in Hurtado, when noncitizen detainees come before an immigration judge to consider bond hearings, the judge must deny jurisdiction in the matter. This means the detainee must remain in custody while their removal case proceeds.

Some federal district court judges in Indiana have consistently disagreed with the government’s stance and are overturning immigration judges’ rulings on denying bond hearings.

James Hanlon, a district court judge for the Southern District of Indiana, ruled in a recent habeas case that § 1225 applies to “arriving” noncitizens attempting to enter the country and not those undocumented immigrants who have lived in the interior of the U.S. for years.

He said the government’s interpretation of the statute “disregards” the plain meaning of § 1225 and is “inconsistent with decades of prior statutory interpretation and practice.”

A surge in filings

The BIA is an administrative body within the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review that reviews immigration judge decisions and determines precedent that is binding on all immigration judges—unless overruled by a federal court.

(The Executive Office for Immigration Review declined to comment on litigation-related matters for this story.)

The board shrank earlier this year from 28 to 15 members, following an April 2025 DOJ order. Nearly all of the board’s current members were appointed by conservative attorneys general. William Barr, President Donald Trump’s attorney general from his first administration, appointed five of the current members, and current Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed eight.

Since the BIA’s Hurtado ruling altered the course for many detainees, the country, and specifically Indiana, has seen a surge in habeas cases.

Although the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana declined to comment on the surge in habeas petitions, citing active and pending litigation, it did provide data detailing the number of petitions filed in the court over the last three years.

In 2023, no habeas corpus cases related to alien detainees were filed, and in 2024, only one. However, from Jan. 14, 2025, to Jan. 14, 2026, there were 93 cases filed.

An official with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana did not respond to requests for comment.

Nationally, information clearinghouse Habeas Dockets LLC reports more than 9,500 immigration-related habeas corpus filings are pending in federal district courts.

To Doyle, there is a clear reason why habeas filings are racking up now.

“We never had to do this before,” she said. “We didn’t even do habeas cases until this (Trump) administration took over.”

What is habeas corpus

Habeas corpus is a Latin phrase meaning “you should have the body.” In short, it means a judge must have any person who has been detained brought into the courtroom so that the legality of his or her detention can be reviewed.

A writ of habeas corpus, or a judicial order instructing law enforcement to produce a detainee, has been embedded in U.S. legal doctrine for over 200 years and is protected under the U.S. Constitution.

“The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it,” Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution states.

This spring, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said President Donald Trump’s administration was “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus for immigrant detainees, pointing to the “invasion” aspect of the clause.

Habeas corpus has been suspended four times in the country, all of which were related to wartime; it was most recently suspended in Hawaii in 1941 by President Franklin Roosevelt, following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The current administration has made no formal attempts to suspend the statute—which can only be done through congressional approval—so federal courts are reviewing these petitions and sometimes ordering immigration judges to allow detainees bond hearings or be released from custody.

Ongoing challenges

“All parties must play by the rules. The same wisdom that requires immigrants and noncitizens to follow the law equally requires the government to follow the law,” U.S. District Judge Damon Leichty of Northern Indiana wrote, in a Dec. 30, 2025, order granting Ortiz’s writ of habeas corpus and ordering his release from ICE custody.

Nearly two months after he was detained, Ortiz was released from the Miami Correctional Facility. But not every case moves at the same pace as his.

Vincent Olson, a lawyer in Doyle’s law office, said they had one client who was detained in Illinois at 9 a.m. and had filed a habeas petition in an Illinois federal court by 3 p.m. that afternoon.

But by that time, the client was already in transit, going through Iowa to Texas—one example of how difficult it is to track the whereabouts of some detainees.

“It’s been a little bit over a month, and we’re not even in the court yet,” Olson said. “So we’ve been trying to expedite the process by trying to do things as soon as they happen.”•",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-23 15:58:45.974793

Under Minnesota law, the state’s Department of Corrections must notify ICE officials when an immigrant convicted of a felony is set to be released.
How do other Minnesota county jails handle ICE?","The Trump administration’s immigration crackdown has resulted in more than 3,000 arrests in Minnesota and clashes between federal agents and residents.

But swirling beneath the surface of the tense, sometimes chaotic scenes playing out across the state is a political dispute over how local officials handle the cases of immigrants who are being held in state prisons and county jails.

Federal officials have suggested that they might wind down their campaign if Democratic leaders like Gov. Tim Walz and Mayor Jacob Frey would give them access to the people subject to deportation in Minnesota’s prisons and jails.

“Let us in the damn jail,” Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, said recently. “Frey and Walz could fix this today.”

The Department of Homeland Security has asserted that Mr. Walz and Mr. Frey are shielding 1,360 immigrants charged with crimes who are subject to deportation, though it did not explain how it came to that conclusion. But state and local officials dispute the claim.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections said the number of incarcerated people that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has identified as being subject to deportation was slightly over 300 as of last Monday. The department also says the Trump administration is misrepresenting how Minnesota jails and prisons assist in immigration matters.

In Minnesota, officials say that state prisons have long released inmates subject to deportation to federal immigration officials after their sentences end. Mr. Frey has no authority over Minnesota’s county jails, which have a patchwork of policies on the issue. Some counties explicitly cooperate with federal authorities, and at least one, Hennepin, the state’s most populous county, refrains from assisting ICE agents as a matter of policy.

Nationally, the degree to which local law enforcement officials overseeing prisons and jails are willing to cooperate with immigration enforcement has long been a thorny issue.

Under Minnesota law, the state’s Department of Corrections must notify ICE officials when an immigrant convicted of a felony is set to be released. The agency, overseen by Governor Walz, says that it has long coordinated with ICE agents to transfer custody of those who are subject to deportation.

Last year, prison officials turned over to ICE 84 inmates who had finished sentences and were leaving the state prison system, according to the state agency.

Paul Schnell, the commissioner of the state’s Department of Corrections, said he and other state officials had struggled to get clear answers from the administration about the specific steps the White House would like them to take.

“We would certainly like to be in a place where we could offer things that may be useful and relevant and serve the interest of ICE,” Mr. Schnell said.

He said that some of the people federal officials have publicly highlighted as having been arrested during the crackdown were actually transferred directly from prisons with assistance from the state.

Does Minneapolis cooperate with ICE?

Minneapolis, the state’s largest city, has a policy barring municipal officials, including police officers, from asking residents about their immigration status, with rare exceptions. City officials said the policy was aimed at building trust between the police and immigrants.

“I recognize that the fear of deportation prevents some people from calling police in times of need or to report crime,” Chief Brian O’Hara of the Minneapolis police said in a statement explaining the policy.

Mayor Frey said that the city’s policy has no effect on inmates. “At the city level, we do not have authority over jails and prisons — period,” he said.

What about the jail in Minneapolis?

That partnership ended after Rich Stanek, a former Hennepin County sheriff who ran the jail for 12 years, was voted out of office in 2018. His successor, Dave Hutchinson, gradually ceased sharing information with ICE, meeting a campaign promise he had made.

Mr. Hutchinson contended that close cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE undermined public safety because it made undocumented immigrants reluctant to report crimes. Mr. Stanek maintained that his approach had kept dangerous criminals from being released from custody back onto the streets.

“Our job is to keep communities safe,” Mr. Stanek said. “That was, pure and simple, keeping communities safe.”

The newer policy — to refrain from cooperating with ICE — has continued since the 2022 election of the current sheriff, Dawanna Witt. Sheriff Witt declined a request for an interview.

How do other Minnesota county jails handle ICE?

Sheriffs in at least seven of Minnesota’s 87 counties have signed agreements to collaborate with ICE on immigration enforcement.

Under those partnerships, jail officials are trained to identify people who are in the country unlawfully and to share that information with federal agents to help facilitate deportations.

A few jails in the state have contracts providing beds for immigrants in ICE custody.

But most Minnesota sheriffs lack explicit policies on the issue, said Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who specializes in the intersection of criminal and immigration law. The extent to which jail officials help transfer people into ICE custody varies widely and relies mainly on individual relationships between local and federal officials.

“From my understanding, only a few sheriff offices even have a policy written down,” Mr. Chan said. “They like to have that flexibility.”

Why are some sheriffs reluctant to help ICE?

ICE routinely asks jail officials to notify the agency about the imminent release of a person subject to deportation by issuing a document known as a detainer. Detainers request that jail officials continue to hold inmates for up to 48 hours beyond the time they would ordinarily be released.

Questions about the legal authority local officials have to detain people at the request of ICE have led to two lawsuits in the state in recent years.

Anoka County, a suburb of Minneapolis, was ordered to pay $30,000 in 2021 after a federal jury found that local officials had exceeded their authority when they detained a woman from Mexico for several hours after she was involved in a collision.

The following year, Nobles County agreed to pay a $200,000 settlement after a class-action lawsuit brought by individuals who accused the local sheriff of holding them unlawfully based on ICE requests.

“Sheriffs are generally worried about liability and wanting to follow the law,” said Sandra Feist, a Democratic state lawmaker who is also an immigration lawyer.

Still, several sheriffs say they regularly provide ICE with information about inmates the agency intends to take into custody. Some say ICE agents are not always available to pick up someone on short notice after an inmate has posted bail or been released by a judge for other reasons.

“Sometimes they don’t make it here on time,” Dakota County Sheriff Joseph Leko told a local news station this week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22nat-ice-detainers-fpzk/22nat-ice-detainers-fpzk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 18:58:40.207223

Roughly $67 billion goes toward immigration enforcement at the border, including border wall construction.","Over the past year, images of masked, heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting men, women and children – outside of courts, at schools and homes – have become common across the United States.

The video of an ICE agent shooting and killing Renee Nicole Good – a U.S. citizen – in Minnesota on Jan. 7, 2026, is one example of the brazen, sometimes deadly tactics that the agency employs.

Part of the reason why recent ICE tactics have shocked Americans is because most people haven’t seen them before. Historically, the country’s militarized immigration enforcement practices have played out closer to the U.S.-Mexico border. And for decades, agents with Customs and Border Protection have carried out most deportations near the border, not ICE.

From 2010-2020, nearly 80% of all deportations were initiated at or near the U.S.-Mexico border. During the COVID-19 pandemic, that number jumped to 98%, as both the Trump and Biden administrations utilized Title 42, a public health statute that allowed the government to rapidly deport recently arrived migrants.

But Trump during his second presidency has greatly shifted immigration enforcement north into the interior of the U.S. And ICE has played a central role.

As international migration and human rights scholars, we have examined recent federal immigration policy to determine why ICE has become the main agency detaining and deporting migrants as far away from the southern border as snowy Minnesota.

And we have also explored how the transition in immigration control from the southern border to more Americans’ front lawns could be shifting the public’s views on deportation tactics.

Migration as a threat

ICE is a relatively new agency. The 2002 Homeland Security Act, passed in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, created the Department of Homeland Security, known as DHS, by merging the U.S. Customs Service – previously under Treasury Department control – and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, formerly under the Justice Department.

DHS has 22 agencies, including three that focus on immigration: Customs and Border Protection, ICE and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which manages legal immigration and naturalization.

There is no inherent reason that immigration enforcement should fall under homeland security. But immigration was deemed a national security matter by the George W. Bush administration after 9/11.

In a 2002 presidential briefing justifying DHS’s creation, Bush said, “The changing nature of the threats facing America requires a new government structure to protect against invisible enemies that can strike with a wide variety of weapons.”

The U.S. government has viewed immigration from this national security perspective ever since.

The full impact of the deportations

The Trump administration in early 2025 set a goal of deporting 1 million people during its first year.

But with so few crossings, and thus deportations, at the U.S.-Mexico border, the administration instead has focused its efforts on the U.S. interior.

Trump’s 2025 tax and budget bill reflected this reprioritization, allocating US$170 billion over four years to immigration enforcement, compared to approximately $30 billion allocated in 2024.

Roughly $67 billion goes toward immigration enforcement at the border, including border wall construction. But the largest percentage of the bill’s immigration funding – at least $75 billion – goes toward arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants already living in the U.S.

The Trump administration did not initiate deportations from the U.S. interior. They have formed part of other administration’s policies, both Democratic and Republican.

Interior border enforcement increased under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s with the introduction of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which widened the criteria for deportations. And former President Barack Obama was referred to as the “Deporter in Chief” after his administration carried out more than 3 million deportations over his two terms, with roughly 69% of deportations occurring at the border.

But the astronomical growth of government funding toward migration control – at the border and in the U.S. – got the country to where it is today.

Between fiscal year 2003 and 2024, for example, Congress allocated approximately $24 toward immigration enforcement carried out by ICE and CBP for every $1 spent on the immigration court system that handles asylum claims.

The new money allocated under the 2025 budget bill, and the reprioritization of immigration enforcement from the border to the interior, partly explains why Americans are now seeing the long-term consequences of border militarization play out directly in their communities.

Americans may not know about the experiences of migrants who are quickly deported near the border, but it is harder to ignore recent images of people snatched up within their own neighborhoods.

Now the visible targets of border enforcement are increasingly immigrants who have built their lives in the U.S. – neighbors, friends, co-workers – as well as anyone who opposes ICE’s tactics, like Renee Good.

Changing political attitudes

In fact, the violence of Trump’s mass deportation campaign may be changing how Americans view immigration.

Just before the 2024 presidential election, a Gallup Poll found that 28% of Americans believed that immigration was the most important problem facing the nation – the highest percentage since Gallup began tracking the topic in 1981. This number dropped to 19% in December 2025, reflecting how more Americans see immigration as a routine issue that the government can manage rather than a crisis that needs to be dealt with.

This is supported in the academic literature. Migration scholars have shown that voters often support strict immigration policies in the voting booth but resist and protest when governments attempt to implement those policies in organized immigrant communities.

In 2002, for example, migration scholar Antje Ellermann documented that immigration officers reported it was more difficult to detain and deport people in Miami – because of resistance by a politicized immigrant community – compared to relatively conservative and less organized communities in San Diego.

But in both places, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were influential in intervening in individual cases to prevent deportations. This is because senior immigration officials, Ellermann noted, were influenced by media attention and pressure by members of Congress to grant relief.

Support for Trump’s handling of immigration is trending downward. Only 41% of Americans approved of Trump’s approach to immigration as of early January 2026, compared to 51% in March of last year, according to CNN polling.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/714192/original/file-20260123-66-q7nd0h.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C288%2C3450%2C1725&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-23 15:58:03.318850

Roughly 75 people rallied outside the building for about an hour, holding signs and making banging noises.

A NEWS CENTER Maine crew at the scene observed Portland police arrive and warn protesters that anyone making noise would face arrest. At about 10:50 p.m., police gave four warnings, and one male individual was arrested.

Her daughter said agents followed Ntumba to her apartment, took her phone and wallet, and put her in a vehicle without showing ID or explaining why. Ntumba has no criminal record and has a pending asylum application.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion and Maine U.S. independent Sen. Angus King held a press conference on Thursday, calling for more transparency from ICE regarding the identities and reasons for arrests. Cumberland County Sheriff Joyce also spoke Thursday, questioning ICE's priorities, calling the agency's tactics ""bush league policing.""",https://media.newscentermaine.com/assets/NCM/images/be7d08bf-e5fb-471e-8bda-f7dbf4c118f8/20260123T044855/be7d08bf-e5fb-471e-8bda-f7dbf4c118f8_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:58:08.503403

Jeannie Norris says it's hard to see El Paso at the center of recent events.","EL PASO - Once a flashpoint in the heated debate over high immigration flows, this city is now a hub for detentions and deportations – with more mega-facilities in the works as the Trump administration tries to ramp up massive deportations.

This week, the El Paso County Medical Examiner ruled the Jan. 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, a Cuban immigrant at a tent camp, was a homicide, a finding bound to intensify calls for a shutdown at what's become the nation's largest immigration detention facility.

In total, in just the last six weeks, three men have died at the $1.2 billion privately operated Camp East Montana located at Fort Bliss army base. The average daily population at the end of November was nearly 2,800 people and is likely higher now. The Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, did not respond to a request for the current number of people detained at the camp. Immigrants picked up by the DHS agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, across the country are held at the tent facility pending deportation.

The medical examiner's findings shed a broader light on issues of oversight and return a harsh focus to El Paso.

""Witnesses claim staff killed the detainee; DHS must preserve all evidence - including halting their effort to deport the witnesses,"" said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso. ""I reiterate my call for Camp East Montana to be shut down and for the contract with the corporation running it to be terminated.""

The federal government has consistently denied abuse allegations and says ICE is committed to ensuring all those in custody reside in a ""safe, secure and humane environment.""

Testing Ground

El Paso has long served as a testing ground for everything from facial recognition biometrics to drones to license plate readers - tactics now seen throughout the country, from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis. The El Paso region, not new to the U.S. long history of deportations, was also the location of other controversial tent camps, including a notorious site that held minors. In 2018 and 2019, a migrant camp in Tornillo for children swelled to more than 2,500.

But the political theater, as locals refer to the whims of Washington, is back. Until recently, immigrant raids were rare. In recent days, however, several videos on social media platforms show ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents picking up workers in construction sites, putting a city that's more than 80 percent Hispanic, on edge.

Controlled explosions near Mount Cristo Rey, with its towering and iconic sculpture of Jesus Christ on the cross, have gone off as the Trump administration prepares the foundation for a new 1.3-mile wall. Despite the construction, crossings of migrants have dropped significantly.

Now a new detention center is planned in El Paso County, with funds from Trump's tax and spending package that includes an estimated $45 billion for ICE detention centers and tens of billions more for additional law enforcement.

""What we are seeing with the system right now is truly unprecedented,"" said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a lawyer and senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, at a recent webinar on detentions. ""It's expanding more quickly. There is no sense of basic humanity of the people going through the system, and the basic underlying rules of due process are being tossed out.""

Reichlin-Melnick called the El Paso County medical examiner's finding probably the first-ever homicide in ICE detention.

Escobar and 122 Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation last December to create enhanced oversight for detention centers and phase out private contractors over three years.

Rapid Expansion

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed plans to expand detention space across the country. ""These will not be warehouses — they will be very well-structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards,""a DHS spokesperson said in an emailed statement. ""It should not come as news that ICE will be making arrests in states across the U.S. and is actively working to expand detention space.""

An ICE spokesman also said they wouldn't confirm specific locations, including one in Dallas County.

Detentions have reached historic highs of 70,000 at about 200 U.S. facilities, stretching from the state of Washington to California, Texas to Georgia, according to ICE data.

""There will be more deaths, there will be more harm,"" said Marisa Limón Garza, executive director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center here in El Paso. ""This is not an anomaly. Unless ICE changes course, there's more oversight, there's more accountability and there's more protection of people in detention.""

In Dallas County, another possible detention facility off a highway could hold nearly 10,000. The prospect has galvanized Texans there against it, too.

The Washington Post reported details in December about a draft solicitation for renovating industrial warehouses to hold up to 80,000 persons. One of them is believed to be in Hutchins, a suburb of about 8,000 persons, according to Census Bureau estimates.

""We are horrified by the fact this is going to be in our backyard,"" said Rev. Eric Folkerth, a Methodist minister who leads an interfaith group defending immigrants and holding vigils at an orange-brick ICE field office in Dallas. ""We are planning resistance from our churches and have spoken to other county officials who are equally disturbed.""

Folkerth said he believes the massive ICE detention center could open based on conversations his clergy group has had with government and private officials.

The site sits sandwiched by a noisy highway and a Federal Express distribution hub and budget hotels. The empty blue and white warehouse looks like the length of a large mall and advertises its size at 1 mm square feet.

Recent Deaths

Human rights organizations and lawyers in contact with people at the El Paso tent facility have been sounding the alarm for months and documented cases of medical neglect, unsanitary conditions, lack of food and abuse at the facility.

""The medical examiners report that Geraldo's death was a homicide completely dispels the government's claim that this was a suicide,"" said Charlotte Weiss, staff attorney based in El Paso with the Texas Civil Rights Project. Weiss regularly visits people detained at Camp East Montana and says she and other partners have documented cases of ""excessive use of force.""

DHS officials have said Lunas Campos tried to take his own life and ""violently resisted security staff when they intervened to save him."" And during the struggle, a DHS spokesperson said he stopped breathing and lost consciousness.

DHS says his death is under investigation. At the same time the federal government is trying to deport two detainees quoted in news reports saying they witnessed Lunas Campos in an altercation with staff when he died. Lawyers for the men, a Salvadoran and a Cuban, are trying to extend an injunction to keep them in this country until they can give depositions.

When ICE officials reported his death they also cited Lunas Campos' criminal record. He had been convicted of driving while intoxicated, criminal possession of a weapon, petit larceny, and other crimes.

In another death at the El Paso tent camp on Jan. 14, ICE officials reported Victor Manuel Diaz of Nicaragua, died by ""presumed suicide."" The official cause of his death remains under investigation, ICE said. The man had been detained in Minneapolis, where widespread protests have been held since Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, was fatally shot by an ICE agent on Jan. 7.

A third man, Francisco Gaspar Andres from Guatemala, died in December at an El Paso hospital where he was transported for a serious medical condition.

Protests Grow

There have been multiple protests outside the detention camp in Fort Bliss since it opened in August and a vigil recently for the men who died in custody.

Jeannie Norris says it's hard to see El Paso at the center of recent events.

""I am so shocked what's happening in our country,"" she said, one of dozens of El Pasoans at a recent vigil. ""...and it's close to home and you have a big detention center right in your hometown which is an international city, which has always loved immigrants before, and we treat them so badly, it's heartbreaking.""

Rebecca Krasne, another El Paso resident, added, ""We have to voice our condemnation of these acts and our total distrust of our government, and come together and be strong and powerful in our voice to try to do what we can to stop this madness.""

Much of the trauma for immigrant families, particularly women, is unseen, said Anthony Lazon, the founder of the social justice group Dallas For Change. ""They are forcing these women to self-deport,"" said Lazon, who often assists families whose loved ones are detained. ""These tactics force these women into life-threatening situations where they have to fend for themselves….A lot of these people are following the legal process. Asylum is the legal process.""

As so many see video of violent arrests and the fatal death of Good in Minneapolis, polls show declining support for the crackdown.

Minneapolis and St. Paul have seen daily protests since Renee Good was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7. Federal law enforcement officers have surged in the Twin Cities for weeks and have repeatedly squared off with community members and activists who track their movements.

Organizers said Friday morning that more than 700 businesses across the state have closed for the day in solidarity with the protest — from a bookstore in tiny Grand Marais near the Canadian border to the landmark Guthrie Theater in downtown Minneapolis.

""We're achieving something historic,"" said Kate Havelin of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the more than 100 groups that is mobilizing. The demonstration coincides with a blast of cold air hitting the Upper Midwest and ahead of a severe winter storm that is expected to affect millions.

On Friday, Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino sought to shift the narrative from that of a 5-year-old boy taken by ICE officers in Minneapolis by attacking the news media for, in his view, insufficient coverage of children who have lost parents to violence by people in the country illegally. After briefly mentioning the 5-year-old during a news conference, he talked about a mother of five who was killed in August 2023.

On Thursday, a prominent civil rights attorney and at least two other people were arrested for their involvement in an anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a Sunday service at a church in St. Paul. They remained in federal custody Friday morning.

Organizers hope Friday's mobilization will be the largest coordinated protest action to date, with a march in downtown Minneapolis planned for Friday afternoon. Earlier Friday, the temperature in Minneapolis was minus 21 with a wind chill of minus 40.

Havelin compared the presence of immigration officers in Minnesota to the winter weather warnings.

""Minnesotans understand that when we're in a snow emergency … we all have to respond and it makes us do things differently,"" she said. ""And what's happening with ICE in our community, in our state, means that we can't respond as business as usual.""

Somali businesses, especially, have lost sales during the enforcement surge as workers and customers, fearing detention, stay at home.

Many schools were planning to close on Friday, but cited different reasons. The University of Minnesota and the St. Paul public school district said there would be no in-person classes because of the extreme cold. Minneapolis Public Schools were scheduled to be closed ""for a teacher record-keeping day.""

Clergy planned to join the march, as well as hold prayer services and fasting, according to a delegation of representatives of faith traditions, including Buddhist, Jewish, Lutheran and Muslim.

Bishop Dwayne Royster, leader of the progressive organization Faith in Action, arrived in Minnesota on Wednesday from Washington, D.C.

""We want ICE out of Minnesota,"" he said. ""We want them out of all the cities around the country where they're exercising extreme overreach.""

Royster said at least 50 of his network's faith-based organizers were joining the protest. About 10 were traveling from Los Angeles while others from the same group planned a solidarity rally in California, said one of the organizers there.

""It was a very harrowing experience,"" said the Rev. Jennifer Gutierrez of the large immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles last year.

It is designed to connect vulnerable Mainers with resources and to track the movements and actions of federal immigration agents.
“We’ve seen ICE agents separating mothers from young children without any empathy or any respect for the rule of law,” Mills said.","A wave of federal immigration enforcement in Maine that has been marked by sharp political polarization and a sense of fear in some communities entered its fourth day Friday.

Gov. Janet Mills, who has strongly criticized the actions of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, issued a call for Congress to curtail funding for the agency “until they stop their aggressive tactics.” Sen. Angus King also suggested not funding ICE’s budget going forward and said he is considering pressing for federal agents to be required to wear body cameras and remove masks.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce confirmed ICE moved all of its detainees out of the county jail after he questioned the agency’s tactics, calling officers’ actions during the arrest of a county corrections officer “bush-league policing.” York County Sheriff William King also spoke out after confirming that one of his county’s corrections officers was also detained, saying that it doesn’t appear that agents are truly targeting “the worst of the worst,” as they have said.

Meanwhile, Republican leaders have called on Democrats to temper their rhetoric. And conservative Mainers told our reporters this week that many of them welcome what the Trump administration has dubbed “Operation Catch of the Day,” though some also expressed reservations about agents’ tactics.

4:30 p.m.: Federal agents apprehend man, transfer him into a vehicle at Maine Mall

Sirens, honking and whistles sounded off in a parking lot at the Maine Mall in South Portland around 3:45 p.m. Friday as about a dozen people watched an apparent federal immigration arrest unfold.

According to witnesses, people who appeared to be federal law enforcement officers apprehended a man near the Hannaford and TJMaxx and put him into their vehicle, a minivan with out-of-state plates.

A reporter at the scene saw at least one person who appeared to be a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. Nearby, the crowd blew their whistles and honked their car horns.

The minivan drove away with the man inside, then pulled into the nearby JCPenney parking lot, where three additional vehicles surrounded it.

4:20 p.m.: Maine Med nurse says apparent ICE agent taunted her, said he would target families

Kelli Brennan, a neurotrauma nurse at Maine Medical Center, said in an interview Friday that she was driving to work Thursday morning when she noticed potential federal immigration enforcement activity on Forest Avenue in Portland. She said she saw a few cars surrounding another vehicle and what looked like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents standing around.

Brennan parked across the street and began recording the encounter with her cellphone, at which point the agents pointed their flashlights at her, indicating that they knew she was recording them. Brennan said she was driving a co-worker who is an immigrant to work, so she immediately left, not wanting to put her fellow employee in danger.

But someone she believes was an ICE agent followed her in a blue Subaru, rolled down his window and taunted her, calling her a “Karen.” Brennan said she rolled down her window and exchanged words with the man.

“I told them we didn’t want them here and said, ‘You can get the (expletive) out,” Brennan said. “He said, ‘Well, you can get the (expletive) out.’ Then he said, ‘I’m going to arrest three more families in Maine just for you.’

“It was so surreal to see that much anger,” Brennan added. “They are here just to terrorize. No police officer would do what he did.”

After the exchange, Brennan said the man left, and she continued to work.

Brennan said she’s noticed some of the housekeeping and janitorial staff, some of whom are immigrants, have called off work because they are fearful of ICE. A spokesperson for Maine Med operator MaineHealth said in a statement earlier Friday that the health system is experiencing some work callouts, as well as patient cancellations, because of the uptick in ICE activity.

Maine Med employees have been giving rides and delivering groceries to immigrant workers and their families so they don’t have to leave home, said Brennan, a union representative with the Maine State Nurses’ Association.

“ICE has no place in Maine,” said Brennan, of Saco. “These immigrants aren’t criminals. These are our friends and neighbors, part of our community.”

4:10 p.m.: U.S. Attorney’s Office says ICE violated court order by transferring detainees from Cumberland County Jail

The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maine said Friday afternoon that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement violated a federal judge’s order by moving a woman detained in Portland out of state Thursday night.

Abigail Lima Da Silva O’Leary was one of roughly 50 ICE detainees who were transferred from the Cumberland County Jail around 6 p.m. Thursday night, Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Lizotte confirmed in court records.

The transfer came hours after Sheriff Kevin Joyce criticized ICE for how it arrested a county corrections officer earlier this week, calling the apprehension “bush league.”

Lizotte said the transfer was “in violation of the Court’s prior order,” which temporarily barred ICE from moving O’Leary, who has filed a petition in federal court arguing that her detention is unconstitutional.

Lizotte said federal prosecutors, who represent ICE in court, were not made aware of the transfers until after the fact.

Almost three hours after O’Leary was moved, Lizotte said ICE had his office file an emergency motion requesting the transfer because ICE “can no longer house immigration detainees at the Cumberland County Jail, and there is no additional bed space in Maine in which to house petitioner.”

Lizotte said ICE’s decision to “no longer house immigration detainees at the Cumberland County Jail” was not known to him until Friday afternoon.

4 p.m.: Maine AFL-CIO President condemns ICE raids

The president of the Maine AFL-CIO on Friday decried recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on Maine workplaces as “an attack on all workers.”

In a written statement, Cynthia Phinney said workers of color throughout the state are afraid to go to their jobs, take their children to school or go to the store. The AFL-CIO represents more than 200 unions and 42,000 workers throughout the state.

“Everyone in this country should have the right to go to work and return safely to their loved ones at the end of the day without fear of violence, especially not violence perpetrated by their own government,” Phinney said.

Phinney said the name “Operation Catch of the Day,” as federal officials have dubbed it, is dehumanizing. She charged that ICE agents are subjecting immigrants to the “same kind of terror and violence” many of them fled in their home countries.

“We stand strongly opposed to the Trump administration’s deportation of workers to dangerous prisons, stripping workers of their citizenship and other permits, and shooting innocent people for exercising their constitutionally protected right to protest,” she said. “An injury to one of us is an injury to us all.”

3:15 p.m.: York County sheriff says ICE arrested a corrections officer outside immigration appointment

A York County Jail corrections officer was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement outside a scheduled immigration appointment in Scarborough this week, York County Sheriff William King said Friday.

The officer, who King declined to name, had passed a criminal background check and federal verification before being hired. King described him as “a contributing and valued member of the staff” at the jail, which is currently experiencing a staffing shortage.

“To the best of our knowledge this individual has never committed any type of crime that would result in the revocation of his legal status,” King said in a written statement Friday afternoon. “From York County’s perspective, it never received any notification on whether there had been a change in his status.”

King noted that York County “supports local and federal law enforcement in their various missions,” but he said ICE was falling short of its promises to specifically target violent criminals rather.

“While enforcement actions are being promoted as targeting the ‘worst of the worst’ the reality appears far more complicated,” he said. “Changes in immigration policy have redefined who is considered lawfully present in the United States.”

3:10 p.m.: South Portland Mexican restaurants temporarily closes

Tres Leches Cake’s Flor, a Mexican restaurant in South Portland, will be closed indefinitely to protect vulnerable community members, according to Rachel Gavilan, the daughter of the owner.

A lot of their customers are Latino, Gavilan said.

“We don’t want to put anybody at risk,” she said. “It’s not safe to be out right now.”

Jose Franco, the owner’s brother, and Gavilan went to check the mailbox of the business Friday.

“We want to wait and see how it’s going to be,” Franco said.

Franco has lived in South Portland for decades, but he’s started carrying his passport in his pocket, just in case. He said people are being stopped and taken regardless of status, and that’s terrifying.

“They’re looking for any excuse to take you,” he said. “The color of your skin. An accent.”

Tres Leches was also closed during its normal hours Wednesday and Thursday. A small crowd of about 20 people formed outside the restaurant Thursday morning after witnesses reported seeing a vehicle with apparent federal agents parked nearby.

3 p.m.: Lawyers march in protest of ‘unlawful’ ICE arrests

A couple dozen lawyers and other legal advocates marched through Portland’s Bayside neighborhood Friday afternoon to protest what they say have been unlawful arrests in Maine by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Advertisement

The march was organized by Maine Lawyers for the Rule of Law, a group that has organized other events to raise awareness for the ways that it believes the Trump administration has attacked the “rule of law,” the democratic principle that people are accountable to publicly enacted laws that are equally enforced and consistent with human rights. Those events have included protests across from the courthouse and a forum at the University of Southern Maine campus in September.

“Lawyers are officers of the justice system,” said attorney David Webbert, a member of the group. “This is not normal, this is outrageous, and Mainers need to know that lawyers recognize that.”

Webbert said the group is concerned by increased ICE arrests and activity in Maine, which he said has included targeting people based on their race and appearance, entering homes without judicial warrants and using excessive force. He said that he is planning to sue ICE under the Federal Tort Claims Act for alleged wrongdoing by a federal agency.

Webbert said he was also concerned by news Friday that ICE had moved roughly 50 detainees from the Cumberland County Jail in Portland, hours after the sheriff overseeing the jail criticized ICE agents who forcefully arrested a corrections officer.

Court records show that a federal judge had temporarily barred the federal government from moving at least four of these detainees out of Maine.

Neither ICE nor the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maine has explained yet in court why the detainees were moved or whether they consider this a violation of court orders.

“They don’t care about following court orders,” Webbert said. “They’re just mad at the sheriff; they want to punish him.”

The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond Friday afternoon to a request to discuss those transfers.

2:40 p.m.: Federal agents arrested 6 restaurant workers in coordinated visits to 2 locations, manager says

Federal immigration agents arrested three staff members each from Kobe Japanese Restaurant’s locations in South Portland and Biddeford on Thursday morning, according to a restaurant manager.

Immigration agents arrived at the Biddeford location as staff were just arriving for the day before 11 a.m. Thursday, said the manager on duty Friday, who requested anonymity because she was concerned for her safety. She said agents arrived at the South Portland location around that same time.

The manager said the agents requested proof of citizenship from everyone present and did not offer a specific explanation for the arrests. Among those taken were immigrants from China and Latin America, she said.

“All we know is that they are legal to work,” she said. “It’s hard to open a business right now. You’re basically targeted.”

Two kitchen staff and a hibachi chef were among those taken, leaving the businesses “severely short-staffed,” she said. On Friday, the South Portland location was closed and some of its staff moved to Biddeford — allowing one location to operate despite the staffing issues, she said. No one answered the phone at the South Portland location Friday afternoon.

At least one customer, in a post on social media, reported having a reservation canceled due to the staffing shortages.

In June, masked Border Patrol agents arrested three workers from Kobe’s Bangor location as part of what officials called a “worksite enforcement operation,” the Bangor Daily News reported.

ICE spokespeople did not immediately return emailed questions about who was arrested, why they were taken or why the agency targeted the restaurants.

2:30 p.m.: Sen. King suggests immigration agents should be required to remove masks, wear body cameras

U.S. Sen. Angus King said Friday that he is considering whether Congress could require federal immigration agents to remove masks and use body cameras as part of budget talks next week.

King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, was speaking at the Maine Outdoor Economy Summit in Portland. More than 400 people gathered to talk about the state’s outdoor recreation sector, but anxiety about the surge in federal immigration agents in the city bubbled up continuously throughout the conference.

King spent more than 45 minutes in conversation about land conservation and national parks with Carrie Besnette Hauser from the Trust for Public Land and Whitney Potter Schwartz of Outdoor Recreation Roundtable — but most questions from the audience were about ICE.

“Many of us in this room are acutely aware right now that the outdoors is not safe or accessible to a great deal of our citizenry,” one audience member asked. “And I was just wondering what you would be willing to do to protect the citizens of Maine from the great overreach by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to make it safe for our citizens.”

Applause met the question. King replied by echoing remarks he made at a news conference Thursday in Portland, saying that federal immigration agents are “terrorizing” people in Maine.

“We could perhaps not fund the ICE budget, and they still have what was passed last summer,” King said. “That’s something I’m trying to determine with the leadership of the Appropriations Committee as to what can we do.”

King also said he was still trying to get more information from ICE about its operations in Maine.

A staffer told a Press Herald reporter that the senator was not available for an interview after the discussion.

Another guest at the conference took the mic to say that he previously worked in immigration enforcement but questioned federal agents’ current tactics.

“They need to remove their masks,” he told King. “We didn’t wear masks. We didn’t dress up in combat gear. We didn’t shoot people in the face, point blank, with pepper balls, which is deadly force.”

“I’m starting to think the fear and intimidation is the point,” King said.

“It is the point,” the man replied. “It’s very intentional.”

2 p.m.: Maine ICE watchers say federal agents are threatening them for documenting activity

Greater Portland residents who have been driving around the area this week to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity and document enforcement efforts in their cities say they have been threatened by federal agents.

The volunteers in Maine say agents have started showing up at their homes and intimidating them or threatening arrest. Some of them, masked and wearing tactical gear, have issued stark warnings not to follow them.

Advocates began preparing for potential large-scale ICE activity in Maine back in September. On Tuesday, when the federal operation officially began, they started driving around the city on a daily basis.

There are similar groups in other communities all over Maine and the U.S. that are set up to monitor ICE activity, especially in the mornings and afternoons, when children are going to school or coming home.

“ This was not about law enforcement doing their job. This was about a federal agent using intimidation to discourage lawful civic activity in my own community,” said Erin Cavallaro, one of the volunteers in Maine who said officers came to her home. “What I was doing was lawful.”

Another volunteer, Bob Peck, said he followed an SUV that left the ICE detention center in Scarborough on Thursday and was confronted by the men in the vehicle, who told him he was impeding federal law enforcement. When Peck said he was only observing, they threatened to arrest him.

1 p.m.: Some MaineHealth workers are staying home because of ICE fears, but operations continuing as normal, spokesperson says

John Porter, a MaineHealth spokesperson, said in a statement Friday that the health system is experiencing some work callouts and patient cancellations caused by the ramped-up ICE enforcement this week, but not enough to disrupt operations. The largest health system in the state operates Maine Medical Center in Portland, seven other Maine hospitals, and an array of primary care and specialty clinics across the state.

“A limited number of patients have requested either to postpone visits or take advantage of our established telehealth resources, and MaineHealth is taking steps to accommodate these requests as we prioritize safety, privacy and continuity of care,” Porter said. “We also continue to experience higher than usual call-outs in some segments of our workforce. While the exact numbers can vary shift to shift, the overall trend line for these call-outs has been steady.”

On Thursday, the Maine State Nurses Association, the nurses’ union for Maine Med, released a statement about working conditions at the hospital. Meg Sinclair, an union representative and nurse at Maine Med, said “scaring people into not coming to work doesn’t make us safe. It compromises the care of our patients.”

12:30 p.m.: Hotel group CEO says he doesn’t know of any ICE agents at his properties

Freeport-based Maine Course Hospitality Group, owner of 14 hotels in Maine and 14 others from the Northeast to Florida, hasn’t been affected by increased immigration enforcement, CEO Sean Riley said.

Riley said he knew of no ICE agents staying at or arresting people on Maine Course properties, including Courtyard hotels in Portland and South Portland and the Homewood Suites in Scarborough.

He said Maine Course makes sure all staff members have necessary immigration documents and work permits, and that the company hasn’t experienced staffing issues because some employees are afraid to go to work.

Maine Course began addressing concerns about increased immigration enforcement last year, Riley said, and has taken steps to make sure associates know how to respond if ICE agents arrive at one of their hotels.

“Our hotels are open to everybody,” he said. “But we also want our guests and our associates to feel safe and comfortable, and we want to be law-abiding.”

Riley said the company recently held an online information session to update associates on the current situation.

“We wanted to give them as much information as possible because the lack of information around this carries a lot of fear,” he said. “This isn’t going away anytime soon and we want to put people at ease.”

11:30 a.m.: ICE hotline calls are up nearly 5,000%, advocacy group says

The operators of Maine’s Immigrant Defense Hotline, which allows callers to report sightings and tips regarding federal immigration activity, say they have seen a major uptick in calls since news of the Trump administration’s enforcement surge began to circulate last week.

Between Jan. 13 and Friday morning, the hotline saw a nearly 5,000% increase in calls compared to the prior 10-day period, said Hunter Cropsey of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition.

MIRC publishes daily call data on its social media accounts.

On Wednesday, the latest day for which data was available as of Friday morning, operators fielded 1,169 incoming calls — roughly 35% more than the day before. The calls have also grown longer on average, according to MIRC.

Among Wednesday’s calls were 46 from Portland, 24 from South Portland, 22 from Westbrook and 17 from Biddeford, though the group cautioned that not all calls include location details.

The group also provided a breakdown of calls by type for Tuesday. The majority referenced suspected sightings and tips about Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity, but there were also more than 100 calls for support and general information, according to MIRC.

MIRC, working with other advocacy groups, helped launch the hotline in October. It is designed to connect vulnerable Mainers with resources and to track the movements and actions of federal immigration agents.

11 a.m.: Passamaquoddy chief says ICE has ‘been in contact‘ with tribal leaders

Amkuwiposohehs “Pos” Bassett, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik, moved to assuage the concerns of tribal members in a letter to the community shared online Thursday night and said that ICE has already been in contact with the tribal government.

Bassett did not elaborate in his letter on the nature of that communication.

He encouraged tribal members to carry their tribal IDs and pledged the full support of the tribal government and its legal representation to any tribal member who is unlawfully detained or arrested by federal immigration officials.

The announcement followed a similar letter from Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis, who on Tuesday also urged members of his tribe to carry their tribal IDs. Members of federally recognized tribes in other states have been detained or arrested, Francis said, and there have been reports of federal agents refusing to accept tribal IDs as proof of citizenship.

“I’m asking you to be proud of who you are, I want you to stand out, I want you to walk down the street knowing that you have the full force of the Passamaquoddy Tribe behind you and we are willing to step up in any situation you cross paths with,” Bassett wrote.

He advised any Sipayik residents who aren’t citizens and lack legal documentation to contact an immigration attorney.

Federal agents would have a police escort if they come onto tribal territory, Bassett said.

10:55 a.m.: One summonsed during protest outside hotel where ICE believed to be staying, police say

One person was issued a summons during a Portland protest Thursday night outside a downtown hotel where protesters believed federal immigration agents were staying, police confirmed Friday.

Videos circulating on social media showed dozens of people banging drums, blowing whistles and chanting outside the Residence Inn at 154 Fore St.

Portland police spokesperson Brad Nadeau said more than 50 people gathered Thursday night, making noise and “causing disturbances inside the lobby.”

Police arrived shortly after 10 p.m. and told the group to disperse or risk being charged with disorderly conduct. One person, a 28-year-old from Brunswick, was issued a criminal summons “in lieu of arrest,” Nadeau said.

10:50 a.m.: Immigration lawyer filed late-night emergency petition to prevent client’s transfer from Portland jail

A federal judge ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement not to move at least one immigrant detainee from the Cumberland County Jail late Thursday night, when the federal agency transferred its detainees out of the facility.

Tong Qi Lu, 56, has been held at the jail in Portland for 10 months after a Maine State Trooper called ICE on him, according to a petition Lu’s attorney filed Thursday night in Maine’s U.S. District Court. Lu was living in Bangor and owned a restaurant there, according to court records.

Federal attorneys representing ICE had not yet responded in court Friday morning, but ICE’s online locator indicated that Lu is now being held at the Plymouth County Correctional Center in Massachusetts.

Sheriff Kevin Joyce, who oversees the Portland jail, confirmed Friday morning that ICE detainees had been moved out of the facility. The mass transfer came hours after Joyce criticized ICE on Thursday for its tactics when arresting a county corrections officer this week.

Lu’s attorney Oriana Farnham said in the petition that Lu left China when he was about 20 years old, and that he has called the U.S. home for more than 30 years.

ICE determined in 2020 that his removal to China “was not likely in the foreseeable future” and that he posed no risk to the community, Farnham wrote in court records. She said Lu has been complying with ICE’s conditions of release for the last five years, and that a petition for lawful permanent status is still pending.

Lu was taken into custody again in April, Farnham said, after a state trooper stopped Lu while he was searching for supplies at a scrapyard with the property owner’s permission.

“After checking Mr. Lu’s driver’s license, the Trooper informed him, ‘You’ve got trouble — ICE wants you,’” Farnham wrote.

The trooper reportedly took Lu to a restaurant he owns in Bangor to hug his family members, before Lu was transferred to ICE custody and brought to Portland.

10:40 a.m.: Avesta Housing says ICE has been active at its properties

Avesta Housing said Friday that it was aware of “ICE activity at a limited number of our properties.”

The affordable housing nonprofit manages over 3,000 units across the state, including a 52-unit South Portland property designed to serve asylum seekers experiencing homelessness. That building opened in 2023.

Avesta declined to comment on any specifics of the activity.

“Avesta employees handle any requests for resident information or property access in accordance with applicable law. To protect the privacy and safety of residents and employees, we do not disclose property locations or comment on the status of individual residents,” the agency said in an emailed statement.

“Our mission is unwavering, and we support those who have chosen to make their home in an Avesta community. We recognize that this is a time of great stress and uncertainty for many, and the safety and wellbeing of all our employees and residents is paramount.”

10:30 a.m.: Gov. Janet Mills urges Sen. Susan Collins, Congress to curtail ICE funding ‘until they stop their aggressive tactics’

Gov. Janet Mills on Friday called on Congress to curtail funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “until they stop their aggressive tactics.”

Mills, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, specifically called out Republican Sen. Susan Collins, whom she hopes to unseat this fall, in a written statement released by her campaign.

“We’ve seen ICE agents separating mothers from young children without any empathy or any respect for the rule of law,” Mills said. “Congress, including Susan Collins, should curtail funding for ICE until they stop their aggressive tactics that are just instilling fear and anxiety in people across the state.”

A surge of federal agents came to Maine this week as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation effort. Agents have been seen wearing masks and moving around Portland, Lewiston and surrounding communities in unmarked vehicles.

The administration says it is targeting “the worst of the worst,” but state officials and families say that people with misdemeanors or no criminal records are being detained and disappeared.

The U.S. Senate is expected to vote next week on a minibus package of spending bills that includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The package is the final annual appropriations bill needed to prevent a partial government shutdown at the end of the month.

Collins has said she plans to support the bill, which includes $20 million in funding for body cameras and $2 million for deescalation training — measures that she said can help protect ICE agents and the public.

“At this time of heightened tensions, these steps could help improve trust, accountability, and safety,” Collins said in a written statement this week. “I hope that Congress will adopt these measures quickly.”

The funding bill was approved Thursday by the House of Representatives, with Rep. Jared Golden, D-2nd District, one of just seven Democrats voting in support.

Mills is running in the Democratic primary against Graham Platner, a combat veteran and oyster farmer from Sullivan who has forcefully condemned ICE tactics throughout his campaign. Platner said he supports “dismantling” ICE and holding congressional hearings.

10 a.m.: ICE detainees removed from Portland jail after sheriff’s criticism

Detainees who were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement were removed from the Cumberland County Jail on Thursday night, according to the sheriff.

Sheriff Kevin Joyce said Friday morning that ICE officials called the sheriff’s office Thursday to inform staff that they were removing all of their detainees in custody at the Portland jail. He said the detainees were transferred out of the jail Thursday night.

The move came after Joyce criticized the federal agency’s practices at a news conference Thursday after agents apprehended a Cumberland County corrections officer Wednesday evening.

9 a.m.: Masked agents detain man in Portland, leave his car running in the street with a smashed window

Masked agents in police vests detained Juan Sebastian Carvajal-Munoz, a civil engineer from Colombia employed by an engineering consulting company, in Portland on Thursday morning. Carvajal-Munoz earned a master’s degree from the University of Maine, and colleagues said he was in the country on a work visa.

An unmarked dark Subaru with tinted windows cut off Carvajal-Munoz as he was driving his grey Hyundai Tucson on Pearl Street in downtown Portland at 8:46 a.m., according to Jesse Smith, who witnessed the encounter.

Agents got out and quickly began using a crowbar to try and pry open his window, Smith said. They then smashed it to pieces. Three agents pulled Carvajal-Munoz out of his car, placed him in their Subaru and drove off, he said.

Smith couldn’t hear what, if anything, the agents said to Carvajal-Munoz but said the whole encounter was very quick.

“In less than two minutes, they smashed his window and dragged him out of the car,” Smith said. “He was compliant. He wasn’t resisting or anything.”

Agents left the car running — with its smashed window — on the street, according to interviews with Smith and a nearby parking attendant. A passerby then drove the vehicle into the parking lot, the attendant said. Smith said Carvajal-Munoz’s bag and keys were left in the passenger seat, and his phone was discarded on the road behind the car.

7:50 a.m.: Homeland Security launches new website to highlight what it calls ‘worst of the worst’ arrests in Maine

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday that the agency has revamped its new website to highlight some arrests carried out this week by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

The site, which the administration is calling the “Worst of the Worst,” now features 13 people who have been apprehended by ICE agents in Maine. They are accused of committing crimes ranging from drug offenses, to failure to report a crime, to aggravated assault.

ICE officials confirmed Thursday that agents have arrested at least 100 people in Maine since its enhanced enforcement operation began. Some local and state leaders have cast doubts on ICE’s claims that agents are only arresting people with criminal records.

BOSTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) – Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit seeking to block U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

Three Ethiopian nationals, ‍along with the non-profit African Communities Together, allege in a lawsuit filed in Boston federal court on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is unlawfully putting over 5,000 people at risk of losing their temporary protected status after February 13.

It marked the latest in a series of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of Temporary Protected ‌Status, or TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home ‌countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

LAWSUIT ALLEGES ANIMUS AGAINST NON-WHITES

The lawsuit says that while Ethiopia remains a country in a humanitarian crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unlawfully terminated the Ethiopians’ legal status with ​just 60 days’ notice based on an unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants. Ethiopia’s population is predominantly Black.

“The administration’s review of Ethiopia’s TPS designation resulting in the termination decision was motivated wrongly by ‍politics and racism and ignored the rule of law, ​including the requirement to consider objective evidence of unsafe conditions in Ethiopia,” ​Amaha Kassa, executive director of African Communities Together, said in a statement.

Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, ‍in a statement said TPS “was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades.”

Numerous lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration’s moves to end similar protections for nationals from countries, including Syria, Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and South Sudan, leading to court rulings that have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration’s efforts ‍to strip migrants of their legal status.

The latest lawsuit was filed after DHS said on December 12 it was ending TPS for Ethiopia, saying conditions in the African nation no longer posed a serious ‍threat to people returning safely to ‍it and that TPS was “never meant to be a ticket to ​permanent residency.”

Former Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration granted Ethiopians already in the ​United States ⁠that status beginning in 2022, citing the need to protect citizens ‌fleeing armed conflict in their home nation.

The Ethiopian military and allies, including troops from neighboring Eritrea, had been battling forces from the northern region of Tigray in a conflict that killed thousands and displaced millions of people.

While that civil war formally ended later in 2022, the Biden administration extended TPS for Ethiopians in mid-2024, citing armed conflict in another region, Amhara, which is ongoing.

Sheriff Kevin Joyce confirmed that ICE arrested a corrections recruit with the Cumberland County Jail on Wednesday.

The man, whose name has not yet been released, was pulled over by agents just after 5 p.m. in Portland's Bayside neighborhood. Video obtained by Maine's Total Coverage shows the arrest.

ICE announced Wednesday that it launched ""Operation Catch of the Day"" in Maine on Tuesday.

It is not clear exactly how many people ICE has detained in Maine so far. Some of the charges brought against those who have been detained include aggravated assault, false imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child.

Mills said no one in her administration has been in contact with the Trump administration about the ICE operation, and all she knows about arrests or targeted arrests is what she has read in media reports.

The governor went on to say that the operations are disruptive for children and families across the state.

""I'm hearing that many of the people being detained, or on that list I think, are family members here in Maine, people who are working here in Maine, people who have children in the school system, people who have children in homes in Maine, people with no criminal record, and that's concerning,"" Mills said.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/vidthumb/images/sheriff-joyce-on-ice-arrest-of-cumberland-county-corrections-recruit-1-22-2026-69728373977e0.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-23 16:59:17.961294

Vance's comments come as outrage swelled over Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents taking into custody four students under the age of 18 in the Minneapolis suburb of Columbia Heights. School officials said Liam Conejo Ramos, a preschooler, and his father were detained in their driveway after school on Tuesday.

When an adult known to the family offered to take Liam, ICE agents refused and instead led the boy to his front door and ordered him to knock – ""essentially using a 5-year-old as bait,"" according to a news release from Columbia Heights Public Schools.

Vance on Thursday said ICE was targeting the boy's father, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, who federal officials accuse of trying to flee from immigration agents. The man’s attorney vehemently denied federal officials' account of the arrest and said the man was in the country legally, awaiting asylum.

""Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?"" Vance said. ""If the argument is that you can’t arrest people who have violated the law because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from every being the subject of law enforcement.""

The vice president gave those remarks after a closed-door meeting in Minneapolis with federal agents, business leaders, and others in an effort to ""bring down the temperature,"" Vance said. More than two weeks after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, daily protests continue to roil Minneapolis as state officials and the Trump administration square off in bitter legal fights.

Developments:

∎ The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday announced the arrests of three people accused of participating in a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. A federal magistrate judge declined to sign a complaint charging journalist Don Lemon in connection with the protest, CBS News and CNN reported.

∎ ICE has conducted stops and arrests in Maine as part of an immigration operation that was launched over the objections of state and local leaders. The mayors of Lewiston and Portland, who said the operation was unnecessary, reported a surge of federal agents and asked residents to remain calm.

'How can you justify incarcerating a child""

Marc Prokosch, a Twin Cities immigration attorney representing Liam’s family, slammed immigration authorities for detaining the 5-year-old and his father.

""How can you justify incarcerating a child,"" Prokosch told reporters on Thursday. The Minnesota attorney said the boy’s father had no criminal record according to a search of state records, and that the family was in the country legally.

The family entered the U.S. in 2024 through the border in Brownsville, Texas, said Prokosch, adding the family used an immigration authorities app to apply for asylum.

""These are not illegal aliens,"" the attorney said, responding to comments from Vice President Vance. ""They came properly and are pursuing a legal pathway.""

Prokosch said the family is currently being held at a family detention center in San Antonio. He said he has not been able to directly speak with his clients.

The attorney said he could not disclose what prompted the family to flee their home country of Ecuador. The South American nation is among the most violent in Latin America, according to Human Rights Watch.

Gov. Walz: ICE needs to turn the temperature down

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said immigration authorities in Minneapolis need to abandon their controversial tactics for calm to return to the city.

""I’m glad the Vice President agrees the temperature needs to be turned down, but actions speak louder than words,"" Walz said in a statement on X. ""We don’t need 3,000 ice agents in our streets — more than every local police department combined. Take the show of force off the streets and partner with the state on targeted enforcement of violent offenders instead of random, aggressive confrontation.""

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey criticized federal authorities for detaining the 5-year-old boy and said the child is ""not a threat of our community.""

""When the federal government treats kids like criminals, something has gone seriously wrong,"" Frey said on social media.

The governor and mayor did not respond to USA TODAY's requests for additional comment.

Teachers ask authorities to stop targeting students

Zena Stenvik, the superintendent for Columbia Heights Public Schools, said Liam was the fourth child in the school district to be detained by immigration authorities.

The first, Stenvik said, was a fourth grader who had been in the school district since kindergarten.

""All the teachers in that school were shattered,"" Stenvik said, ""and then it happened again and again and again.""

The other students immigration authorities detained were a 17-year-old girl arrested at her home and a 17-year-old boy arrested in his car on the way to school, the superintendent said.

""The kids just want to come to school, they want to be in school, we want them in school,"" Stenvik said. ""They want to be in-person learning. They thrive. They’re happy learning.""

Immigration agents have repeatedly followed school buses and made appearances in school parking lots, the superintendent said.

Minneapolis police on how it responds to ICE-related 911 calls

The Minneapolis Police Department told USA TODAY that the agency has an official dedicated to answering 911 calls related to immigration enforcement incidents and determining whether a police response is warranted.

""Calls that involve property damage and threats to life safety take priority,"" public information officer Sgt. Garrett Parten said. But ""the presence of protestors alone is not sufficient reason for MPD to respond.""

The police statement came in response to allegations that the agency ignored at least two calls for help from federal agents. According to Parten, police have no record of a call on Jan. 21 from agents asking for help recovering a gun magazine loaded with ammunition they left on a residential sidewalk in Minneapolis.

In the second incident on Jan. 19, federal agents called for help handling anti-immigration enforcement protesters.

""The agents expressed concern that the situation could become physical. MPD monitored the situation and determined that the federal agents had sufficient resources available to manage the incident,"" said Parten, adding police kept watch on a car the agents left behind.

Vance on Insurrection Act: 'We don’t think we need that'

Vance said the Trump administration doesn’t believe it needs to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, right now, amid tensions over immigration enforcement.

""We don’t think that we need that,"" Vance said. ""Now the president could change his mind, of course, things could get worse.""

In a social media post earlier this month, President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, which gives him authority to deploy U.S. troops to suppress rebellions and civil unrest or when federal laws are being obstructed.

Vance blames 'chaos' in Minnesota on state and local officials

Speaking in Minneapolis on Thursday, Vance acknowledged the prevalence of videos and reports raising concerns about the aggressive tactics being used by immigration agents.

Vance said some videos and reports suggest some federal agents ""are not doing everything right.” He added: “But if you look at the context of what’s going on, you understand that these people are under an incredible amount of duress, an incredible amount of chaos.”

Vance placed the blame squarely on Minnesota's state and local officials.

""Do we want these things to happen? Do we want these arrests to be so chaotic? No, we don’t,"" Vance said. ""But if we had a little cooperation from local and state officials, I think the chaos would go way down.""

'Incredible job' Vance backs ICE in Minneapolis

While kicking off his remarks in Minneapolis, Vance reiterated his support for ICE.

""The guys behind me are doing an incredible job,"" Vance said, speaking with uniformed individuals standing behind him, including one wearing an ICE jacket.

The vice president said he came to Minneapolis to better understand the situation so he can ""tone down the temperature a bit, reduce the chaos."" There has been a wave of anti-ICE demonstrations since an agent shot a killed a woman in Minneapolis. Vance said he sympathizes with ICE agents who are “operating in a very, very tough environment.”

“I wanted to show some support for these guys,” Vance said.

Feds announce third arrest related to St. Paul church protest

A third person has been arrested in connection with the protest at a St. Paul church that interrupted a service on Sunday, Jan. 18.

Attorney General Pam Bondi on X named the third person as William Kelly.

Earlier in the day, Bondi announced the arrests of Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen, a member of the St. Paul Public School board. Homeland Security Secretary said all three were being charged with conspiracy to deprive rights.

The arrests come after the DOJ said it was investigating the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, which protects access to religious worship under the First Amendment.

Protesters greet Vance in Minneapolis

Roughly a dozen protesters greeted Vance outside the Royalston Square event venue in Minneapolis, with two holding signs reading ""ICE out.""

Vance arrived at the Royalston and met with ICE agents before his speech. He is also held a roundtable discussion.

Minneapolis police not responding to feds' calls for help, official says

Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino said the Minneapolis Police Department has not been responding to calls from federal agents amid heated protests in the city.

“Minneapolis Police Department has been called on several situations that they have not responded to,"" Bovino said at a news conference on Thursday. He described an incident in which two off-duty agents were confronted by protesters at a restaurant. Bovino said the agents called police but had to be assisted by a federal tactical team after 40 minutes without a police response.

The Minneapolis Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The surge of immigration agents into Minnesota has strained the relationship between federal and local law enforcement. Local police chiefs have criticized the tactics employed by federal agents and accused agents of racially profiling off-duty police officers.

ICE faces backlash as agents enter homes without judge-signed warrants

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is facing intense scrutiny over its agents forcibly entering homes without a judge's warrant.

An internal ICE memo authorized agents to use force to enter residences with only administrative warrants, which are signed by ICE officers and do not require a judge's signature, multiple outlets reported, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post.

Marcos Charles, the executive associate director of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, confirmed that agents enter homes with only administrative warrants at a news conference on Thursday.

""We don't break into anybody's homes,"" Charles said. ""We make entry either in a hot pursuit with a criminal arrest warrant or an administrative arrest warrant.""

School official: Immigration agents detained 4 students

At least four students under the age of 18 have been detained by immigration agents over the last two weeks in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, the school district said in a statement.

Liam Ramos, 5, was detained with his father on Tuesday, Jan. 20, and taken to a detention facility in Texas, according to the district. On the same day, a 17-year-old was detained on his way to school after agents removed him from his car.

Last week, a 17-year-old student was taken into custody after “ICE agents pushed their way into an apartment,” according to Columbia Heights Public Schools.

And two weeks ago, a 10-year-old student and her mother were detained while on their way to class. “The father immediately came to the school to find that both his daughter and wife had been taken,” the district said in a statement. “By the end of the school day, they were already in a detention center in Texas, and they are still there.”

The school district said it is working with an immigration lawyer to get the students back.

“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our children,” the district said. “The sense of safety in our community and around our schools is shaken and our hearts are shattered.”

Vance wants more arrests after church protest

Ahead of his visit to Minneapolis, Vance touted the investigation into an anti-ICE protest at a St. Paul church. He said he wants to see more arrests after the Department of Justice announced two of the protesters had been apprehended.

“I certainly want to see more arrests,” Vance said. “Because I’ve seen the videos and there are very clearly more people who have violated the law.”

The vice president predicted more prosecutions.

“They’re scaring little kids who are there to worship God on a Sunday morning,” Vance said. “Those people are going to be sent to prison.”

DOJ announces 2 arrests in St. Paul church protest

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents arrested two people involved in a protest that interrupted Sunday service at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Bondi identified those arrested as Nekima Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Louisa Allen but did not describe any alleged charges. ""More to come,"" Bondi said on X. ""WE WILL PROTECT OUR HOUSES OF WORSHIP.""

A group of protestors entered Cities Church on Jan. 18, alleging that Pastor David Easterwood serves as the ICE St. Paul Field Office acting director. Videos show dozens of protesters changing ""Renee Good,"" and ""don't shoot,"" as some verbally confronted churchgoers.

The DOJ launched an investigation into the protest as a potential violation of the FACE Act, a federal law that prohibits the use of force, threats, or physical obstruction to block people from reproductive health care or access to religious worship under the First Amendment right to religious freedom.

Vance says he wants to 'calm the tensions' in Minneapolis

As the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement efforts continue to roil Minneapolis, Vance said he hopes his presence in the city Thursday will calm things down.

“Certainly one of my goals is to calm the tensions, to talk to people, to try to understand what we can do better,” Vance said during a speech in Toledo, Ohio, before flying to Minnesota.

At the same time, Vance blasted local officials for not cooperating with federal immigration authorities and blamed the lack of cooperation for “chaos” in the city. The vice president said he also wants to send a message to law enforcement “that we stand with them and we’re not going to abandon them.”

“We’re not going to do what the last administration did,” Vance continued. “Which is throw them under the bus to appease a bunch of left-wing radicals.”

Appeals court freezes order limiting force against protesters in Minnesota

A federal appeals court on Jan. 21 paused a lower court's order that had ordered federal immigration agents in Minnesota not to use ""intimidation tactics"" against peaceful protesters.

The move by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered a win to the Trump administration, which had vowed to appeal the lower court's order that set up guardrails around the behavior of federal agents.

In the lower-court order, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez said agents appeared to have engaged in ""chilling conduct"" and ""intimidation tactics."" She noted actions such as the ""drawing and pointing of weapons,"" the ""use of pepper spray and other non-lethal munitions,"" and ""actual and threatened arrest and detainment of protesters and observers.""

'ICE Out of Minneapolis' protest planned for Friday

Organizers in Minneapolis asked people to call out of work, skip school, and refrain from buying anything as part of a protest against the ongoing immigration operations.

""Faith leaders, business owners, workers, and concerned Minnesotans have called for a statewide day of public mourning and pause through 'No Work, No School and No Shopping' and a massive, peaceful march in downtown Minneapolis that afternoon,"" said a news release about the demonstration scheduled for Friday, Jan. 23.

In these sealed court proceedings, magistrate judges in the federal court in Minnesota have been deluged with requests from federal prosecutors to arrest and criminally charge protesters. The rise in requests comes amid increasing clashes between protesters and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after a surge of federal officers arriving in the state and in the wake of an ICE officer fatally shooting protester Renee Good on Jan. 7. But some prosecutors have fared poorly in establishing evidence of crime, said the people, who asked to speak confidentially about sensitive court proceedings.

It is exceedingly rare for judges to turn down investigators’ requests for search and arrest warrants or criminal complaints, since the standard of evidence required is so low; a federal agent or officer providing an account of events need only show a fair probability that the suspect engaged in the crime for an arrest warrant.

This spate of rejections in Minnesota would normally cause embarrassment for the U.S attorney’s office that submits the requests. But the Minnesota office has been in turmoil since the Justice Department’s decision not to investigate the officer who killed Good, which led to six senior prosecutors resigning, and more departures are expected.

In one case, a Minnesota-based judge rejected an effort to arrest and charge a protester after they had thrown an egg at a law enforcement vehicle, according to one person briefed on the case.

In another example that has not been previously reported, Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko of the U.S. District Court in Minnesota on Tuesday rejected a complaint to arrest a St. Paul school board member, Chauntyll Louisa Allen, on federal charges of seeking to threaten or intimidate people from engaging in worship. The case stems from a Sunday-morning protest outside the St. Paul service at Cities Church, where protesters chanted “ICE out” and “justice for Renee Good,” because they believed David Easterwood, acting director of the city’s ICE field office, served as a pastor there.

Micko noted in his Tuesday rejection that he found no probable cause for such a claim against Allen; he did, however, grant a separate request from prosecutors allowing them to seek to charge Allen with the separate claim of conspiracy to make threats.

Attorney General Pam Bondi had announced the arrests of Allen and others in the church protest case on Thursday but did not mention the charge the magistrate judge rejected for lacking evidence.

Micko also rejected a criminal complaint against journalist Don Lemon, who had followed protesters inside the church, which the Washington Post reported on Thursday.

Former FBI agents have publicly complained of watching ICE officers in Minnesota arrest protesters who appear only to be taunting or yelling at the officers, which they say appears to be protected free speech and not a criminal act.

Sources have also told MSNOW that Gregory Bovino, the Customs and Border Protection commander who is leading the surge of immigration officers in Minnesota, expressed frustration about the magistrate judge declining to approve arrest warrants. MSNOW asked Bovino about this report at a news conference he held Thursday; Bovino said he had not argued directly with any magistrate judges but acknowledged struggling to get some warrants approved.

“We work very hard with [the] Department of Justice, with the courts, to gather and obtain those warrants,” Bovino said, mentioning that his teams work for “several days” to get a warrant for one person. “We worked through what we needed to do to get a warrant for this individual. And you know, we’re going to, we’re going to continue to work with judges and the courts to obtain these warrants with those judges.”

Bovino’s aggressive methods have come under fire in Minnesota and other cities. He recently was filmed tossing a gas canister into a crowd of chanting protesters. In a video taken during the height of immigration raids in Los Angeles, Bovino exhorted immigration agents to be aggressive in making arrests.

“It’s our f–––ing city,” Bovino is heard saying to his officers. “Arrest as many people that touch you as you want to.”

Washington, D.C. — Today, U.S. Representative Dan Goldman (D-NY-10) and U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) led 27 lawmakers in writing to the Inspectors General for the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Postal Service (USPS), and the Office of Tax Administration (TIGTA), asking the watchdogs to investigate the impact of the Trump administration’s diversion of law enforcement resources away from white collar and corporate crime and in favor of immigration enforcement.

“Trump is letting white collar criminals run rampant without consequences so he can shift law enforcement to violently attack immigrants, the overwhelming majority of whom have no criminal record,” said Rep. Goldman. “Having 25,000 fewer law enforcement personnel investigating and prosecuting white collar crime enables fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and other crimes that hurt the American people. Federal Inspectors General must conduct a thorough investigation of the impact of these diversions.”

Since January 2025, the Trump administration has reportedly diverted over(link is external) 25,000 law enforcement personnel to immigration enforcement. Many of those agents had been dedicated to combating white-collar crimes—including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and more.

Those diversions include:

Nearly one quarter of FBI agents nationwide(link is external);

More than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation employees(link is external);

Around 300 State Department Diplomatic Security Service agents(link is external);

More than 90 percent of the Homeland Security Investigations workforce(link is external);

Dozens of career prosecutors from DOJ’s(link is external) Public Integrity Section and National Security Division; and

Even members of the US Postal Inspection Service(link is external).

Several agencies are experiencing the consequences of these diversions. For example, the mass reassignment of HSI agents to immigration removal operations means that(link is external) critical threats could go uninvestigated. Diverting State Department resources to ICE weakens cross-border investigations(link is external) into corruption, fraud, and international financial crimes. The diversion of FBI and DOJ personnel from white-collar units has caused delays and the deprioritization(link is external) of complex financial crime cases such as public corruption, corporate fraud, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prosecutions.

The lawmakers asked the IGs to provide the information below as a part of their investigation:

A breakdown of how many law enforcement personnel have been reassigned from each agency for immigration enforcement;

A breakdown of how many white-collar crimes cases (including but not limited to financial fraud, corruption, FCPA, and money-laundering cases) have been opened, closed, or suspended since the start of the second Trump administration;

Any internal assessments conducted by agencies to determine the impacts of diverting law enforcement resources; and

An accounting of complaints or whistleblower disclosures received about these diversions;

A list of the safeguards that exist to ensure each agency still meets its statutory white-collar criminal investigative obligations despite these diversions.

The full text of the letter is available here or below:

Dear Inspectors General Berthiaume, Cuffari, Hill, Baker, and Hull:

We write to express our deep concern about the diversion of critical federal law enforcement personnel and resources away from investigating and prosecuting white-collar crime and toward advancing President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda. We ask that your office conduct an evaluation of the scope of this diversion and its impact.

When white-collar criminal enforcement is neglected, the American public pays the price. Ordinary people are left more vulnerable to fraud schemes, market manipulation, predatory financial practices, and corruption that threaten their savings, retirement accounts, and financial security — while the wealthiest bend the rules and exploit a weakened enforcement system that no longer holds them accountable.

The failure to enforce the law against corporate criminals has been a hallmark of the Trump Administration. Time and again, President Trump and his administration have let convicted corporate criminals off the hook by wiping out fines and penalties, eliminating efforts to enforce consumer and banking laws, and pardoning fraudsters and con-men under the flimsiest of pretenses. According to one estimate, President Trump’s pardons have wiped away “approximately $1.3 billion in restitution and fines owed to [crime victims] and American taxpayers.”

Exacerbating this lack of accountability, since January 2025, the Trump Administration has diverted over 25,000 federal law enforcement personnel to immigration enforcement.6 Many of those agents had been dedicated to combatting white-collar crimes — including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and more.

According to reports, thousands of agents from teams responsible for white-collar criminal investigations at the Department of Justice (DOJ), Treasury Department, State Department, and more have been reassigned to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), primarily to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to execute the President’s civil immigration dragnet. For example:

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): Nearly one-quarter of FBI agents nationwide — and up to 40 percent in the largest field offices — have been reassigned to support ICE enforcement operations. These agents, once dedicated to public corruption, financial fraud, cybercrime, and complex corporate investigations, are now serving on civil immigration details and ICE facility protection assignments.

Internal Revenue Service (IRS): More than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation employees have been reassigned to ICE as of September 2025, compared to just 250 employees as of June 2025. In April 2025, the IRS and DHS formalized a data-sharing Memorandum of Understanding granting ICE access to certain taxpayer return information — including names, addresses, and tax years — to support immigration enforcement, a potentially unlawful departure from the longstanding IRS confidentiality policy, and potentially further drawing from IRS resources.

State Department Diplomatic Security Service (DSS): DSS agents traditionally focus on protecting U.S. diplomatic missions, investigating passport and visa fraud, coordinating sensitive international investigations, and investigating crimes involving foreign missions and consular services. The CATO Institute reported that around 300 DSS agents have now been detailed to ICE operations.

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI): HSI has historically led criminal investigations into international money laundering, financial fraud, cyber-enabled financial crimes, and intellectual property theft. But now HSI has reassigned a whopping 90 percent of its workforce to ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, according to CATO’s estimates.

DOJ Public Integrity Section (PIN) & National Security Division (NSD): PIN oversees the investigation and prosecution of public corruption cases involving elected officials, judges, and other government employees. Yet under President Trump, the Section has been gutted — shrinking from 36 career prosecutors to just two16 — and the head of PIN was reassigned to the DOJ’s new “Office of Sanctuary Cities Enforcement” task force. Similarly, two veteran prosecutors in NSD, responsible for investigating sanctions violations and other offenses, were also reassigned to the sanctuary cities task force. Many lawyers placed on the sanctuary cities team were sidelined, given only menial tasks and, with little else to do, “completed jigsaw puzzles and streamed television shows” after being removed from their jobs investigating serious white-collar crimes and other offenses.

US Postal Inspection Service (USPIS): USPIS, the law enforcement arm of the Postal Service, normally investigates mail fraud and other crimes. But this year, some Postal Service agents have assisted ICE in locating individuals for immigration enforcement.

Taken together, these moves represent a massive diversion of specialized law-enforcement talent away from criminal financial investigations and prosecutions and toward civil immigration enforcement.

As a result of these diversions, white-collar investigative teams are understaffed, under- resourced, and in some cases gutted. Complex, multi-year investigations into white-collar crimes depend on continuity of staff and specialized expertise. By reassigning agents who worked on white-collar crime and corruption cases to immigration, critical investigations into fraud, corruption, and cyber-financial crimes have been sidelined or shelved. For example, one DOJ investigation into a financial services firm has reportedly stalled in part because investigators were “pulled into immigration matters,” while the FBI’s white-collar crime squad in Houston was reportedly “decimated in 2025 by orders to put dozens of their agents onto immigration enforcement.” Already, we are seeing how other diversions of agents at DOJ appear to have resulted in a decline in criminal referrals for prosecution of non-immigration offenses.

Several agencies are already experiencing the consequences of these diversions. For example, the mass reassignment of HSI agents to immigration removal operations means that “critical threats could go uninvestigated,” including “Dark Web financial schemes, Iranian and Chinese nuclear traffickers, Russian organized crime, [and] trade fraud.” Likewise, diverting State Department resources to ICE weakens cross-border investigations into corruption, fraud, and international financial crimes. At the same time, the diversion of FBI and DOJ personnel from white-collar units has caused delays and the deprioritization of complex financial crime cases such as public corruption, corporate fraud, and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prosecutions — undermining the federal government’s ability to hold powerful actors accountable.

Moreover, at the IRS, the diversion of agents inflicts a double harm: it not only allows wealthy tax evaders and criminal enterprises to escape accountability but also deprives the federal government of the revenue needed to sustain broader law-enforcement operations. The IRS’s Criminal Investigation team is widely regarded as one of the most cost-effective units in federal law enforcement;28 last year, on a budget of less than $800 million, that unit recovered over $9 billion in fraudulent proceeds.29 But now, more than 1,700 IRS Criminal Investigation agents and staff have been detailed to ICE operations, severely undermining the agency’s ability to investigate tax evasion, offshore accounts, cryptocurrency fraud, and money laundering. That means less revenue to fund the federal government’s enforcement functions and a greater risk that honest taxpayers will shoulder the burden left by tax evaders. In practice, these diversions also undermine deterrence: when white-collar criminals believe that federal enforcement units lack the resources or continuity to pursue long-term cases, they may become more emboldened to take risks that endanger markets, taxpayers, and public institutions.

The safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system depend on restoring law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute white-collar crime rather than simply turning the federal government into an immigration enforcement machine. In order to carry out our legislative responsibilities regarding enforcement of the nation’s criminal laws, we ask that your offices conduct an evaluation of these diversions. This evaluation should include answers to the following questions:

1. How many law enforcement personnel at your agency have been reassigned to ICE or other parts of DHS since January 20, 2025? Please provide a breakdown by bureau, division, field office, and duration of the reassignment.

2. Excluding any work done since January 2025 on immigration matters, how many white- collar crime cases (including but not limited to financial fraud, corruption, FCPA, and money-laundering cases) have been opened since January 20, 2025? How many have been closed or suspended? How many have been charged?

Please describe what types of white-collar crime cases have been charged, opened, closed, or suspended.

Please provide the number of white-collar crime cases charged, opened, closed, or suspended in FY 2023 and FY 2024 as points of reference.

How many white-collar crime cases have been closed, delayed, or suspended due to personnel shortages, following diversions of personnel from the relevant agency to immigration-related functions?

How many white-collar crime cases have been closed, delayed, or suspended due to other resource shortages, following resource diversions from the relevant agency to immigration-related functions?

3. For Offices of Inspectors General other than the DOJ OIG: excluding any work done since January 2025 on immigration matters, please provide the number of prosecution recommendations your agency made to the DOJ, the number of investigations closed without a referral for prosecution, the information or indictments DOJ filed, and the number of defendants sentenced, in or after FY 2025 compared to FY 2023 and FY 2024.

4. What internal assessments has your agency conducted to evaluate the impacts of diversion of law enforcement resources? Has your agency taken, or does it plan to take, action consistent with the findings of these assessments?

5, Has your office received complaints or whistleblower disclosures about these diversions? If so, how many, and what issues were raised?

6. What safeguards exist to ensure that your agency continues to meet its statutory white- collar crime obligations despite these diversions?

Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Thursday joined the Department of Justice in arresting three individuals in connection with a planned riot at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota on Sunday.

On Sunday, January 18, anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agitators stormed into the Cities Church in St. Paul, shouting down churchgoers in the middle of services. Protestors targeted the church accusing one of the pastors of working for ICE.

On Thursday, Homeland Security Investigators (HSI) — alongside FBI partners — arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen, and William Kelly in connection with Sunday’s riot. The three are being charged under 18 USC 241.

Title 18, U.S.C., Section 241 makes it unlawful for two or more persons to conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person of any state, territory or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him/her by the Constitution or the laws of the United States, (or because of his/her having exercised the same).

“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States - there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” said Secretary Kristi Noem.

ICE, and other federal immigration law enforcement, have arrested more than 10,000 illegal aliens in Minnesota since January 20, 2025. In response to that robust enforcement of law and order, leftist agitators have attacked, organized riots, and attempted to thwart law enforcement daily. Even as they face a 1,300% increase in assaults against them, a 3,200% increase in vehicular attacks against them, and an 8,000% increase in death threats against them, the brave men and women of ICE will not be deterred.

Ford, Rosanne Skirble",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2026/01/23/immigration-enforcement-restrictions-take-center-stage-at-daylong-senate-hearing/,"No matter what happens with a pair of bills that would rein in federal immigration agents in Maryland, no one can say they didn’t get a full hearing.
The second bill, discussed for about three hours, would bar local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government.
“We should no longer refer our precious, critical law enforcement resources to federal immigration enforcement,” he said.
The eight counties with the 287(g) agreements have a strictly jail-based model and don’t handle street enforcement, they said.
Face coverings Before the Senate committee reviewed the federal enforcement bill, it spent nearly two hours on Senate Bill 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), that would ban face coverings on law enforcement officials.","No matter what happens with a pair of bills that would rein in federal immigration agents in Maryland, no one can say they didn’t get a full hearing.

The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee took five hours of testimony from dozens of witnesses Thursday, on one bill that would prohibit police from wearing face coverings while on duty and another that would eliminate agreements allowing local police agencies to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The hearing followed a rally by advocates late Thursday morning.

The bills are likely to be among the most emotional in this session, as increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics by federal agents flooding U.S. cities continue to dominate the news. But Thursday’s hearings were largely unemotional, with the biggest outbursts being the occasional rounds of applause from the lobby outside the hearing room, where an overflow crowd watched a livestream of the proceedings.

Senators spent nearly two hours on a bill to prohibit face coverings for law enforcement officers in the state, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who are mostly masked.

The second bill, discussed for about three hours, would bar local law enforcement agencies from entering into immigration enforcement agreements with the federal government. Sheriffs in eight Maryland counties currently has the so-called 287(g) agreements with ICE, under which the counties agree to hold criminal suspects for ICE pickup if the local agency determines the suspect is in the U.S. illegally.

Senate Bill 245, sponsored by Sen. William C. Smith Jr. (D-Montgomery), states that no local police officers or any “agent of the state” would be allowed to enter into an agreement with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

The bill, which failed in last year’s session, comes as immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump (R) is becoming increasingly aggressive and divisive, with Smith citing the case of a 5-year-old boy being detained by ICE in Minnesota.

“Immigrants have been used as this pawn for this whole political dynamic, and ICE has been used as that tool to vilify immigrants, to stoke fear, to disrupt lives and communities and to divide us,” said Smith, the chair of Judicial Proceedings.

“We should no longer refer our precious, critical law enforcement resources to federal immigration enforcement,” he said. “Instead, our law enforcement should be relentlessly focused on public safety. That’s what this bill intends to do that.”

Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) testified in support of the bill, noting that immigrants contribute millions of dollars to the state’s economy, account for about 23% of the state’s STEM workforce and the same percentage of registered nurses.

“It’s just important to recognize that policies that promote stability and trust within immigrant communities also help protect and buoy Maryland’s economy and increase our economic resilience,” Lierman said.

But Sens. Chris West (R-Baltimore and Carroll) and William G. Folden (R-Frederick) said Maryland sheriff’s departments are not engaged in rouding up immigrants, just in holding immigrants for ICE once they’re already in custody.

“These 287(g) agreements, in fact, all they do is require that after someone has been arrested and brought into a detention facility, that arrestee is screened, and if it turns out that person is an illegal immigrant, ICE is informed. That’s it,” West said.

That may be, said Smith, but he said West glossed over the fact that some people have been arrested and turned over to ICE for minor offenses, and that there is a lack of due process for them.

“If we are in the business of doing ICE’s job for them, then that frees up other resources to do that field enforcement that we find to be so egregious in many senses,” he said.

The majority of witnesses Thursday testified in support of Smith’s bill, saying the 287(g) agreements encourage racial profiling and create anxiety and fear in immigrant communities.

The agreements “lead to local residents losing trust in the very law enforcement agencies that are supposed to protect them,” said Viviana Westbrook, state and local advocacy attorney at Catholic Legal Immigration Network based in Montgomery County. “I really hope that this year we will end 287(g) since it is complicit with all the violence and chaos and fear that ICE has been sowing.”

Some opposition

But supporters pushed back against what they say are the many misconceptions about the 287(g) program.

The eight counties with the 287(g) agreements have a strictly jail-based model and don’t handle street enforcement, they said. The work done by local authorities is done by correctional officers in a detention center who handle detainers, which are written requests from ICE that a local jail or other agency detain an individual for up to 48 hours, to give ICE time to take the person into federal custody to begin removal proceedings.

Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties have agreements where they can process individuals in local detention centers and then hand to ICE. The other five counties – Allegany, Carroll, Garrett, St. Mary’s and Washington – entered into agreements last year and can serve administrative warrants in a local jail.

Carroll County Sheriff Jim DeWees, whose jurisdiction signed onto an agreement in May, said his department implemented a warrant-based model to strictly serve administrative warrants.

“You can pass this law and abolish our 287(g) agreement, but no politician or legislative body will tell me that I can’t communicate with another law enforcement agency when it comes to a matter of public safety in my community,” DeWees said.

In November, the Wicomico County Council discussed entering a 287(g) agreement, but County Executive Julie Giordano (R) suggested holding off because the General Assembly might make changes to the program. On Thursday, Giordano told the committee her county is again considering an agreement with ICE.

“This bill does not eliminate ICE. It does not stop immigration enforcement,” she said, speaking against the legislation. “What it does is that it strips counties’ and correctional officers’ and elected officials’ ability to cooperate and coordinate with federal authorities in a responsible, structured and transparent way.”

The hearing came two days after several sheriffs joined Senate Republicans in Annapolis to speak in support of the 287(g) program as an effective public safety tool in their jurisdictions, and who said they would fight any attempt to end the program.

About four hours prior to Thursday’s hearing, Smith joined members of the immigrant rights and advocacy group CASA and other community leaders at a news conference to say ICE must go. Smith rejected the argument by critics that a 287(g) ban would be unconstitutional, saying sheriffs are bound to adhere to state law.

“While they do have responsibilities and powers vested in them through their status as a constitutional officer, the legislature can curtail that,” Smith said. “The department that the sheriff resides over is also a creature of the state, and so the state can also curtail those responsibilities and those rights. So, it’s fully constitutional.”

Standing alongside Smith on Thursday was Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), sponsor of the House version of the 287(g) bill scheduled to be heard Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee.

Williams said the legislation remains necessary with what’s happening in the nation, especially under the Trump administration.

“This is one of those pivotal moments in our history as a country where what we’re seeing is unprecedented, and I think the way that we all respond is going to be in history books for our children and grandchildren to read about in the future,” Williams said.

Face coverings

Before the Senate committee reviewed the federal enforcement bill, it spent nearly two hours on Senate Bill 1, sponsored by Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s), that would ban face coverings on law enforcement officials.

The bill comes after months of aggressive immigration raids by ICE agents, who are typically masked. Augustine’s bill would prohibit officers from wearing items such as a balaclava, ski mask or neck gaiter on duty. It wouldn’t apply to an individual “actively engaged in an undercover operation” or when health-related matters are involved.

“Wearing masks is just simply not necessary for law enforcement to function. The wearing of masks undermines public trust,” Augustine said. “Masking within the normal course of duty has no tactical benefit, but does pose a risk to our collective public safety by creating fear and anxiety, particularly in situations that are already tense.”

Naureen Shah, director of immigration policy with the American Civil Liberties Union, said law enforcement agencies wearing masks represent tactics “of an authoritarian regime where people must watch what they say, lest they be disappeared by masked agents operating without accountability.”

After Augustine and Shaw spoke, several people could be heard clapping in the committee lobby area.

But Folden, who recently retired from law enforcement after slightly more than 30 years, said doxing has become a problem for officers on the job, such as during protests.

Neil Franklin, a retired Maryland State Police major who testified online, said he doesn’t see that as a problem, especially when federal immigration duties have been done for decades under other U.S. presidents.

“There’s no tactical advantage to wearing a mask outside of … normal performance of their duties,” Franklin said. “It’s actually a disadvantage in my professional opinion because again, it creates distrust in policing.”

Sen. Mike McKay (R-Western Maryland) asked why the bill includes potential criminal prosecution of officers who violate the law. Under Augustine’s bill, an officer found guilty would be charged with a misdemeanor and possible imprisonment for up to two years, a fine to not exceed $2,000, or both. In addition, the officer must waive “all immunity in a civil action.”

Augustine said the penalties are needed “to have strong enforcement mechanisms because of the damage that this practice has on the fabric of our community and human dignity in our state…. Don’t wear a mask [and] you don’t have to worry about it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sen.-William-C.-Smith-Jr.-at-Senate-JPR-hearing-1-22-2026-2048x1503.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 14:58:14.157356

ICE agents slipping on ice has become its own genre on social media and a source of schadenfreude for many opposed to their presence.","Frank has a hard time explaining to his 8-year-old daughter why they rarely leave their home in the Twin Cities. Why she can’t go to school, and why he can’t work.

“The only thing we tell her is that soon everything will be over. Everything will be over soon, and she’ll go back to school like before,” Frank said in Spanish.

The truth is, no one knows when the federal siege will end. It may not be soon.

U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who calls his officers “troops,” said “this mission is ongoing until there are no more of those criminal illegal aliens roaming the streets.”

Frank — who asked that he be identified only by his nickname to protect his identity — is originally from Mexico but has lived in the United States for more than a decade.

He has a pending application for what’s known as a U visa, which are available to victims of human trafficking, domestic abuse and other serious crimes, so they can cooperate with law enforcement without the fear of being deported.

The Trump administration has pushed to eject U visa applicants, which is why Frank’s lawyer has advised him to keep a low profile. Other immigrants in similar situations have been detained and deported, all while following the rules.

Frank knows a dozen people who’ve been deported — several in just the past couple weeks, including a co-worker on a construction job site.

His kids, three of whom are U.S. citizens, switched to online school. He stopped going to work, and he and his wife never leave the house together, lest they both be detained and separated from their children.

Frank, who has no criminal record save a couple traffic tickets, is the main breadwinner for his family. They’ve been able to live off savings, although he recently had to ask his mother in Mexico for help.

“We still don’t have enough, but we have a little bit to survive on,” he said.

‘Reckoning & Retribution’

The aggressive campaign of sweeping up immigrants has driven tens of thousands of people like Frank into hiding.

The Trump administration claims they are targeting the “worst of the worst” criminals in the country illegally in the “largest DHS operation ever” with some 3,000 federal agents in Minnesota.

Their ranks far surpass the several hundred agents sent to the Chicago area despite Minnesota having a much smaller population and far fewer immigrants without permanent legal status. Pew Research estimates 130,000 out of Minnesota’s roughly 6 million residents are undocumented, a relatively small percentage compared to states like Texas and Florida — contrary to Vice President JD Vance’s recent claim that Minneapolis has the “highest concentration of people who have violated our immigration laws.”

Launched in December under the stated goal of combating Medicaid fraud, the operation followed a high-profile state and federal investigation into social services fraud that involved mostly Somali American defendants. The case drew years of local media attention before being amplified by right-wing outlets and, eventually, by the president himself.

“Do the people of Minnesota really want to live in a community in which their are thousands of already convicted murderers, drug dealers and addicts, rapists, violent released and escaped prisoners, dangerous people from foreign mental institutions and insane asylums, and other deadly criminals too dangerous to even mention,” Trump posted to Truth Social on Jan. 13, promising the day of “RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

The Department of Homeland Security says it’s arrested some 3,000 undocumented criminals in Minnesota since December — and 10,000 in the past year — although the figures strain credulity and the agency hasn’t provided a full list of who those people are.

Instead, DHS has periodically released curated lists of mug shots including many of those who were already in custody in state prisons.

The operation has ignited fierce resistance from residents and Democratic officials that’s grown into a crescendo since an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old unarmed woman, in her car in south Minneapolis. Many Minnesotans grew further outraged when the Department of Homeland Security called her a “domestic terrorist,” while the U.S. Department of Justice yanked local investigators off the case. A week later, federal immigration agents shot a second person after a case of apparent mistaken identity, setting off clashes between law enforcement and protesters.

Gov. Tim Walz, whose office was subpoenaed by the feds for documents related to state immigration enforcement, appealed directly to Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to “end this occupation,” as has virtually every elected Democrat in the state including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey whose appeal was, “get the f*ck out.”

Neither has any influence with the Trump administration besides, and Walz has become a lame duck since announcing early this month he won’t run for a third term.

As Democrats wait for proven vote-getter Sen. Amy Klobuchar to announce a run governor, the resistance to Trump’s siege has not come from politicians but from everyday Minnesotans — practiced in protest since even before the police murder of George Floyd — using a decentralized but well-organized system for spotting and harassing federal officers and giving aid to people who need it.

Minnesotans have reacted with an unbending resistance befitting people who are accustomed to withstanding the bitter cold. The state’s Midwestern progressivism, civic activism, volunteerism and tight familial and social networks serve as crucial infrastructure of the rampart against the federal presence.

Assaults on citizens

Each day brings a new news story about a lawful resident being handcuffed, sometimes beaten, and whisked away in an unmarked vehicle, unable to reach family members.

A Minnesota-born, Somali-American woman with no criminal record was shoved to the ground by ICE agents outside her apartment in St. Paul and called a racial slur on a Wednesday morning.

Nasra Ahmed, 23, says even though she showed agents her ID, she was detained for two days, including being shackled in a hospital while undergoing an MRI after suffering an apparent stress-induced seizure.

Just a few days later, at least eight masked federal agents broke down the door of a U.S. citizen with no criminal history in East St. Paul and arrested him at gunpoint in front of his 5-year-old grandson. (The Associated Press reported this week that “federal immigration officers are asserting sweeping power to forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant.”)

Video taken by a neighbor show officers leading the man, ChongLy Scott Thao, outside in 10-degree weather wearing only a pair of blue boxer briefs, white crocs and a plaid blanket draped over his shoulders. He was detained for about an hour in a vehicle before agents dropped him back off at home.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said he matched the description of two men with criminal convictions at Thao’s address, but Thao hardly looks like either of them, save for being Asian, and said he doesn’t know either man. One of the men turned out to have been in prison since 2024.

ProPublica reported in October — months before Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota — that immigration agents have detained more than 170 U.S. citizens.

Federal agents are also targeting the roughly 5,600 refugees in Minnesota who have yet to receive permanent residency as part of “Operation PARRIS” — Post-Adminision Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening. It has entailed arresting refugees with no criminal records who are complying with the federal government’s rigorous screening process including more than a dozen health and background checks.

Countless other lawful residents have been stopped and asked to show identification just on the suspicion of looking like an immigrant.

“In every situation, we’re doing targeted enforcement,” Noem said when asked why Americans are being asked on the street to prove their citizenship. “If we are on a target and doing an operation, there may be individuals surrounding that criminal that we may be asking who they are.”

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison alleged federal agents are racially profiling people — which DHS denies — in a lawsuit filed with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seeking to end the operation.

Evidence supporting the allegation abounds.

Journalists have witnessed federal immigration agents check random non-white people’s documents outside big box stores, electric vehicle charging stations and bus stops. Agents even demanded the papers of a Latino U.S. citizen whom they rear-ended.

Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said while he has worked well with ICE in the past, his department is now receiving “endless complaints about civil rights violations” including from members of his own police force who aren’t white.

Federal agents boxed in one of his officers — a U.S. citizen — while she was off-duty and demanded to see her papers, Bruley said during a news conference with other local law enforcement leaders. The agents had their guns drawn and knocked the off-duty officer’s phone out of her hand, leaving only after she identified herself as a police officer — without comment or apology.

“Our officers know what the Constitution is. They know what right and wrong is. And they know when people are being targeted. And that’s what they were,” Brule said.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told the New York Times that federal agents have stopped police officers’ family members, though “they’re not stopping family members of folks who are Norwegian or Irish.”

Many people of color in the Twin Cities now grab their passports before leaving the house — a previously unthinkable and unacceptable necessity of life in the modern United States.

The aggressive papers checks, which a court may very well determine are unconstitutional, are driven by a perverse incentive structure that rewards officers for the number of arrests they make, even if the people they detain are later released, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Pervasive fear

The terror the federal occupation is inflicting on immigrants — regardless of their legal status — is apparent in missed school days, doctors appointments and work shifts.

Schools, hospitals and churches have traditionally been off-limits to immigration agents, but Trump lifted the restrictions on immigration enforcement actions at sensitive locations that provide essential services in one of the first immigration policy directives of his second term.

Minneapolis Public Schools canceled school for two days after federal agents came to the high school that houses the Spanish immersion program during dismissal, hours after an ICE agent killed Good. They tackled people, handcuffed two staff members and released chemical irritants outside the school. A Border Patrol spokesperson told KARE 11 the skirmish happened after bystanders interfered with federal agents making an arrest next to the school.

In St. Paul, federal agents briefly pulled over two unmarked contract vans carrying students and staff to school in mid-January. The stops ended without incident but nevertheless frightened students and parents.

In Columbia Heights, a Minneapolis suburb, school officials say federal agents have detained four students in two weeks, including a 5-year-old boy and his father after returning home from school and a 10-year-old and her mother on the way to school.

“ICE agents have been roaming our neighborhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lots and taking our children,” Zena Stenvik, the Columbia Heights Public School District superintendent, said at a news conference on Wednesday.

School districts across the Twin Cities metro have noted a drop in attendance from students from Latino and other immigrant families. In St. Paul, at least one-fourth of students from Spanish-speaking homes have missed every day of school since Dec. 12.

Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools have both responded by offering virtual learning options for students who don’t feel safe coming to school. It’s a better option than no school at all, and yet students still haven’t recovered from pandemic-era learning loss.

Medical providers have also reported many of their immigrant patients have stopped showing up to appointments. Diabetics are rationing insulin. Jaundiced babies are missing treatment. Mothers are laboring in hiding.

ICE agents have entered hospitals, including Hennepin County Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital in Minnesota, without judicial warrants to guard detainees needing medical care around the clock over the objections of medical staff.

One is Alberto Castaneda Mondragon, who suffered a life-threatening brain injury shortly after being detained by ICE, according to a lawsuit filed on his behalf. He doesn’t remember how he was injured and has been medically sedated since being hospitalized, but an agent told medical staff “he got his sh*t rocked,” according to the lawsuit.

ICE’s presence has sent a chilling effect throughout the hospital — on both patients and staff.

Medical staff, elected officials and immigrant rights activists held a news conference decrying ICE’s presence in the hospital in early January, and two days later DHS subpoenaed the hospital’s employment records to audit workers’ employment eligibility, which one Hennepin County commissioner called “retaliatory.”

Immigration lawyers have reported a surge in similar audits at businesses across the Twin Cities — including a St. Paul toy store with a handful of part-time employees — making the federal siege personally painful for business owners who might otherwise be immune from immigration operations.

Businesses that rely on immigrant workers — and customers — across the economy are all feeling the effects of the siege.

A new underground relief network

The siege on Minnesota has ignited a relief effort on the scale of a natural disaster response, albeit under the glaring eyes of the federal government.

Churches, schools and coffee shops have become pop-up collection centers for food and other necessities that are distributed to immigrant homes.

A trans-owned sex toy store in Minneapolis called Smitten Kitten has become one of the major distribution centers, with boxes of Kleenex and Kraft Mac and Cheese and Campbell’s soup piled up next to displays of leather harnesses and wooden paddles.

Anne Lehman has been working around the clock since putting out the call for donations on Jan. 10, directing volunteers and a steady flow of donations.

Lehman wears hoop earrings with 3D-printed whistles that people drop off by the bagful every couple days to arm observers with what’s become the signature symbol of resistance. One whistle says “Go home passport bro” and the other “beta male repellant” — they’ve gotten a fair amount of use, too.

“We all know that ICE is f*cking dweebs. They’re just cosplaying their ‘Call of Duty’ game, but they’re also actively terrorizing and traumatizing my city,” Lehman said.

People are welcome to come pick up donations right from the store, or Lehman sends it on to larger collection sites at churches and trusts it eventually makes it to people in need.

They don’t track where all the food and diapers and tubes of toothpaste go, which adds a layer of security for the people they’re trying to help.

Lehman says Smitten Kitten has gotten the attention of federal agents, and fears if they started making deliveries from the store they could unintentionally lead immigration agents to vulnerable families.

Eventually the supplies end up with families like Raquel’s.

Raquel and her husband, Jesus, have lived in the United States for more than 20 years. She works as a house cleaner, he as a roofer. They own a home in the northern suburbs where they’re raising their two kids.

But their deeply rooted lives in Minnesota became suddenly precarious under the Trump administration and his focus on Minnesota. Raquel and Jesus — who were granted anonymity to protect their identities — have had pending U visa applications for several years.

She stopped going to work in the cities, where ICE has focused much of their attention. It’s been a hit financially, although some of her clients have continued to pay her to help make ends meet. One brings her groceries.

But the suburbs aren’t free from ICE either. Her best friend’s brother was just deported with his son while doing construction work in the suburbs.

While her kids are still going to school, she stopped taking them to the mall or out to eat. She’s had to instruct them not to answer the door, and while she and her husband never leave together.

“Because in case we both get detained, my kids are at risk to be alone,” Raquel said. “We don’t have family here.”

Her boss has let her use her vehicle, since ICE can pull up vehicle registrations and appears to be targeting people with Hispanic last names. Her husband checks ICE activity online crowdsourced by an army of volunteer observers to try to avoid places where they’re active.

“We spend more on gas but that doesn’t matter to stay safe,” he said.

A growing resistance

Twin Cities residents have been turning out every day to monitor ICE activities. Car horns and whistles have become a constant in parts of the cities, alerting immigrants to lock their doors and citizens to come out and film.

Walz has encouraged Minnesotans to keep their phones handy to record any federal activity, creating a “database of atrocities” to serve as evidence in future prosecutions.

Bystanders have documented numerous instances of federal agents brutalizing people, including a border patrol agent kneeing a man in the face several times while others hold him down.

Some residents have taken to driving around the metro looking for ICE vehicles — tinted windows and out-of-state plates, usually — and then tailing them to observe, but also to distract them and slow them down.

“The more time they’re trying to get away from us, the less time they’re spending searching for people to abduct,” one patroller, Patty O’Keefe, told the Reformer.

Neighborhood group chats dedicated to tracking ICE movements regularly reach capacity at 1,000 members, while a group that trains people to be ICE watchers is looking for larger venues.

It’s become a cat and mouse game, but with the roles frequently changing.

Federal agents, in an effort to evade observers, have taken to switching the license plates on their vehicles — a crime in Minnesota, the state Department of Public Safety reminded Noem in a letter.

Sometimes they’ll lead the observers to their own homes — apparently using a law enforcement database to connect license plate numbers to addresses in an effort to intimidate observers.

They’ve also threatened and detained people for following them. O’Keefe was recently dragged from her car with another observer, Brandon Sigüenza, and detained for around eight hours before being released without charges.

Federal agents have responded to crowds of observers and hecklers with aggressive force — tackling people, spraying them in the face with chemical irritants and deploying enough tear gas to cause coughing fits in a several block radius.

High-ranking leaders on the ground have not just encouraged these tactics, but participated in them. Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, threw a can of gas in a melee that broke out when a crowd formed around a federal convoy driving slowly through a residential neighborhood in Minneapolis.

The show of force came just hours after the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge’s ruling in a case brought by the ACLU that sought to stop federal agents from detaining and tear gassing people engaged in peaceful protest or observation.

Resistance to ICE has gone mainstream, at least in the core cities, where businesses have plastered signs telling federal agents they’re not welcome without a judicial warrant. Scores of unions, businesses and organizations are expected to participate in a general strike on Friday.

Homeland Security posted on social media that Border Patrol agents have been struggling to find a place to go to the bathroom in Minneapolis because at each gas station they are turned away or met with groups of angry residents.

The weather hasn’t cooperated either. A steady accumulation of snow has thawed and refrozen several times as temperatures yo-yoed between unusually balmy 40s and bonechilling sub-zeros, glazing sidewalks and city streets with ice.

Federal agents have beached their SUVs and cars in slush and snowbanks across the metro, often having to call in back-up to be pushed free.

ICE agents slipping on ice has become its own genre on social media and a source of schadenfreude for many opposed to their presence.

One particularly viral moment was captured from several angles by bystanders: a Border Patrol agent in a black balaclava runs down the street before hitting a patch of ice that sends both feet skywards before he lands on his back. Observers can be seen jumping in celebration as he turns around and jogs back to his unmarked black Chevrolet Suburban.

The clip was set to praise music, mixed in ice-on-ICE compilations, and played multiple times to a cheering audience of Saturday Night Live.

Every day, protesters line the street outside the Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, which briefly appeared on a list of federal buildings to be sold last year during Trump’s DOGE era and is now serving as home base for Operation Metro Surge. The office building, which houses offices for DHS, Veterans Affairs, and Fish and Wildlife Services, now serves as a short-term detention center for immigrants and protesters, who’ve described sordid, overcrowded conditions.

On a recent Saturday, several hundred protesters yelled “Shame!” and “Get the f*ck out of here!” at the steady stream of masked agents in SUVs with out-of-state license plates coming and going.

An agent in a Kia Soul with Michigan plates blew kisses over his mask as he left the building. The masked passenger of a Hyundai Tucson with Illinois plates filmed protesters on his cell phone as they pulled into the gated compound.

Eric Lofdahl of St. Paul was there shaking a small copy of the U.S. Constitution at the agents driving by, as he had been for the past few days.

“The First Amendment, Fourth Amendment, 14th Amendment… these are things that this administration doesn’t care about,” Lofdahl said.

The atmosphere is often neighborly — people hand out slices of pizza, cups of hot coffee and handwarmers.

But the appearance of law enforcement have led to frequent skirmishes and arrests, including of a person dressed as a giraffe and another as a fox.

The federal government has delivered a forceful crackdown on protesters — who they call rioters. On Thursday, longtime civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong and two other activists were arrested for protesting during a church service where one of the pastors is an ICE field director. Attorney General Pam Bondi called it an attack on a place of worship.

The White House sent out a digitally doctored photo of Levy Armstrong that showed her crying and her skin tone a darker hue.

‘For us, it’s always been the safest state’

The federal incursion is activating residents who haven’t previously been very political as it infringes on their daily lives.

Ana Alarcon, a U.S. citizen, was at the laundromat early one Sunday morning with her kids when two ICE agents came in and started questioning her. Another time, she was leaving a Mexican grocery store with her husband, a permanent U.S. resident from Mexico, and saw ICE agents stopped in traffic, studying her license plate.

“You never think Minnesota would be what it’s like now,” Alarcon said. “For us, it’s always been the safest state.”

Her daughter turned 18 this month, but they didn’t have a big party because most of her friends didn’t want to leave home.

Alarcon now carries her passport with her all the time and doesn’t let her husband leave the house alone. He doesn’t speak fluent English, and she worries he won’t even get the chance to show his papers before being detained. Also, if there’s two of them, one will be able to record it on their phone.

“We’ve noticed that if there’s only one person in the car, the agents tend to take their phones or knock it out of their hands,” Alarcon said.

She doesn’t want to be mistaken for being afraid, however. Certainly not in front of a federal agent, because she has nothing to hide.

So, for the first time, she started going to protests.

“Being afraid … it’s like venom. It’s like a sickness,” Alarcon said. “We have to get out and not show them we’re not afraid.”

Biden administration extended temporary protected status due to ongoing conflicts

BOSTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit seeking to block U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

Three Ethiopian nationals, along with the non-profit African Communities Together, allege in a lawsuit, opens new tab filed in Boston federal court on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is unlawfully putting over 5,000 people at risk of losing their temporary protected status after February 13.

They say that while Ethiopia remains a country in a humanitarian crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unlawfully terminated the Ethiopians' legal status with just 60 days' notice based on an unconstitutional animus, or ill will, against non-white immigrants. Ethiopia's population is predominantly Black.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

SIMILAR LAWSUITS FILED FOR MIGRANTS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

The case is the latest in a series of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration's moves to end similar protections for nationals from countries, including Syria, Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and South Sudan, leading to court rulings that have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration's efforts to strip migrants of their legal status.

The latest lawsuit was filed after DHS said on December 12 it was ending TPS for Ethiopia, saying conditions in the African nation no longer posed a serious threat to people returning safely to it and that TPS was ""never meant to be a ticket to permanent residency.""

Former Democratic President Joe Biden's administration granted Ethiopians already in the United States that status beginning in 2022, citing the need to protect citizens fleeing armed conflict in their home nation.

The Ethiopian military and allies, including troops from neighboring Eritrea, had been battling forces from the northern region of Tigray in a conflict that killed thousands and displaced millions of people.

While that civil war formally ended later in 2022, the Biden administration extended TPS for Ethiopians in mid-2024, citing armed conflict in another region, Amhara, which is ongoing.

“After a year of constant, unchecked violence and militarization of our neighborhoods by the Trump administration—including the murder of Renee Good and Keith Porter, and the horrible violence against children, women, the elderly, and immigrants—that has horrified the nation, it is unconscionable that Congress would send $10 billion in funding to continue terrorizing our communities. The proposed FY26 Homeland Security Appropriations bill does nothing to rein in the abuse of power that we see every day in our streets.

Nurses demand the removal of immigration enforcement agents from communities, the abolition of ICE, and accountability for this administration’s crimes against all residents of the United States.

Make no mistake, the terror we are experiencing is being subsidized by our own government and is leading to irreparable harm to the working-class. Workers are being kidnapped at their place of work and being ripped away from their families. Families are often losing their sole source of household income and are unable to cover housing costs, food, and basic needs as a result. Children with immigrant parents are being pulled out of school for fear they might be separated from their parents, or worse be attacked by ICE in their own schools. Immigrant patients are delaying care for fear of being apprehended, and ICE is failing to provide necessary health care to detainees as required by law.

Instead of funding armed secret police to terrorize our Black and brown, AAPI, and indigenous neighbors, Congress must focus on the investments that nurses and working people are demanding to make our society safer, healthier, and more just.

The small investments to health agencies fail to reverse the destruction of our public health agencies caused by the Republican-led Congress and Trump administration, through last year’s budget bill and Reduction In Force (RIF) plans.

This appropriations bill also fails to reverse the $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other public health programs that will force patients to go without care and safety-net hospitals to close. It fails to extend the enhanced ACA subsidies needed to prevent huge hikes in premiums for millions of families. And ultimately, it fails to make the transformational reforms nurses and working people are demanding, in order to guarantee health care to every person in the United States free at the point of service.

Nurses know that our vision for a healthy society is possible and we will not stop fighting until it is a reality.”

While this comes amid U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s heightened activities in Maine, the people known to have been detained during the operation so far were not being held in local jails but instead sent out of state soon after apprehension.

“Folks are having issues with being able to locate their loved ones,” said Ruben Torres, advocacy and policy manager for the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition.

Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.

On Thursday, The University of Maine’s School of Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic, which has helped provide legal support to more than 300 people held in the county jail during Trump’s second term, began receiving frantic calls from detainees telling their counsel they were being moved.

Anna Welch, the founding director of the clinic, has heard from jail staff that there are no longer any immigration detainees in the facility as of Friday morning, though one person the clinic has helped is still showing up as in the facility, according to ICE’s detainee locator.

Based on that locator, people have since been sent to the Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin, New Hampshire; the Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility in Rhode Island and the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts. But the locations for the majority of women removed from the jail are not yet clear, and Welch said they may be sent to Louisiana, based on conversations her co-counsel has had with detainees.

This is not the first time these people have been moved, as Welch and other attorneys said the majority of those that had been in the jail had not been apprehended in Maine and were instead moved from other facilities.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Cumberland County Jail did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the removal of people from the jail nor where the federal government is otherwise holding people detained during its Maine operation.

The abrupt removal from the facility comes after Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce publicly questioned on Thursday the agency’s priorities after ICE detained one of his corrections officer recruits. Joyce said the recruit had a “squeaky clean record.”

Unclear where new detainees are being held

Since the Trump administration launched its operation in Maine on Tuesday, local organizers and legal groups have tried to gather details about who has been taken and where they’re being sent, while Gov. Janet Mills and other Democratic officials are demanding transparency from the Trump administration, which has not been communicating with Maine leaders and shared few details of its plans.

With sparse information about who has been detained overall, and up to 48 hours for detainees to be entered into the tracking system, little is known about people’s whereabouts.

As of Wednesday, Cumberland County Jail hadn’t had any new bookings this week for federal immigration detainees. Before they were moved out, there had been 64 immigration detainees in the facility, with nine total new bookings in January.

Cumberland and Androscoggin County, which includes Lewiston, are the areas that have had the most ICE activity so far, based on reports verified by community organizers, though federal agents have also been seen elsewhere in recent days.

Androscoggin County Jail has only had one person with immigration related charges booked this week, but that person was brought in on Tuesday by the Lewiston Police Department on local charges. Police told the jail upon arrival that the person also had a federal detainer, meaning he’ll be held for ICE if he makes bail.

Two Bridges Regional Jail in Bath has held the second-most immigration detainees throughout Trump’s second term, but it’s also had no new immigration-related bookings since the heightened operations in Maine, intake supervisor Corporal Aaron Smith said.

The facility has five ICE detainees, but they’ve been there for an average of 301 days, with the shortest length of time being 272 days and the longest being 318 days, Smith said. They were all transferred to Two Bridges from other facilities, so it is unclear how long they’ve been in detention overall.

A pattern of moving immigrant detainees

The Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, expects people already out of state could be moved again to more remote detention facilities. That’s the pattern that has emerged out of Minnesota. In that case often to a facility in Texas and more recently, in some cases, then to New Mexico.

Down South is where the largest detention facilities are. That was the case even before the Trump administration pumped more money into them through the spending bill passed in the summer.

It’s also more difficult to get attorneys to those sprawling, more remote areas, said Sarah Mehta, deputy director of policy and government affairs for immigration at the American Civil Liberties Union.

In Maine, someone was moved out of state this week hours before a federal judge had ordered ICE not to do so.

On Tuesday, ICE detained Yanick Joao Carneiro of Portland, an asylum seeker from Angola, at a routine immigration check-in without a warrant, according to the petition filed by his lawyer.

U.S. District Court Judge Stacey Neumann ordered ICE to explain why they arrested him. Instead, Assistant U.S. Attorney James Concannon argued in his filing that Neumann no longer had the authority to rule on Carneiro’s case because he’s in Massachusetts.

The majority of immigration detainees that had been held in Cumberland County Jail were not Maine residents and were not detained in Maine, according to attorneys providing legal assistance. Jail records don’t provide that insight, though, as records only indicate the overall agency that’s the arresting body.

But, according to attorneys, most appear to be transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.

Federal authorities may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but legal experts say regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch.

The use of Cumberland County Jail to aid Trump’s mass deportation agenda became clear in the spring when public records requested revealed the facility had increased detentions for federal immigration authorities.

The jail has since faced mounting pressure from community members to end its contract that permits such detentions. The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, Cumberland County Jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4501-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:38:51.294087

Organizers from more than 100 groups — including labor unions, progressive organizations and religious groups — urged Minnesotans to skip school and work on Friday and avoid shopping to participate in 2 p.m. marches on what they are calling “ICE Out of Minnesota Day of Truth & Freedom.” Temperatures are forecast to hover around 0 degrees throughout the afternoon.

“We really, really want ICE to leave Minnesota, and they’re not going to leave Minnesota unless there’s a ton of pressure on them,” Kate Havelin, a member of Indivisible Twin Cities, one of the groups behind the demonstration, told The Associated Press. “They shouldn’t be roaming any streets in our country just the way they are now.”

Anti-ICE protests have swept across Minnesota in recent weeks in response to the shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother who was killed by an ICE officer in Minneapolis earlier this month. Good was shot three times and grazed by a fourth bullet, according to a private autopsy report released Wednesday. The Trump administration argues the officer, Jonathan Ross, was acting in self-defense.

The protesters are demanding that ICE leave Minnesota immediately, that Ross is held “legally accountable” and that federal funding to ICE is halted. They’re also demanding that ICE be investigated for “human and Constitutional violations of Americans and our neighbors.”

“It is time to suspend the normal order of business to demand immediate cessation of ICE actions in MN, accountability for federal agents who have caused loss of life and abuse to Minnesota residents and call for Congress to immediately intervene,” the website for the protest states.

Tensions between ICE and protesters in Minnesota continued to escalate this week after a group of protesters interrupted a church service over the weekend, targeting a pastor who also holds a senior position in the regional ICE office.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Thursday that federal agents arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, a prominent attorney and one of the alleged leaders of the protest.

ICE officers have faced renewed criticism for detaining a 5-year-old boy and his father in Minnesota after the boy had just returned from preschool.

Vice President Vance visited Minneapolis on Thursday, acknowledging ICE had made some “mistakes” in how it has handled immigration enforcement in the city. But he said the main way to avoid situations with ICE is for Democrats to cooperate with the administration.

The National Weather Service has reported dangerously cold weather in Minneapolis on Friday. Havelin said Minnesotans would use their expertise in dealing with winter weather to face the challenge presented by ICE.

But we aren’t powerless against these attacks. This legislative session, the ACLU of New Mexico will fight —alongside our partners and community activists— to safeguard hard-fought protections New Mexico leaders have already won and to pass new, urgent bills that will shield New Mexicans’ from the Trump administration’s most dangerous attacks.

Here are the bills we’re championing—and those we’ll fight against.

That same unchecked system is also inflicting harm inside detention centers— including right here in New Mexico. For years, conditions in New Mexico’s three immigration detention centers have been dangerous and dehumanizing and the current administration has only intensified those risks. People held in detention facilities in Torrance, Cibola, and Otero counties have reported abysmal conditions like rotten food, sewage water in their cells, and the misuse of solitary confinement. Three people have also died in these facilities in recent years— a pattern reflected across the country in a rising death toll that reached its highest point in more than two decades last year.

While New Mexico cannot directly regulate ICE, we can refuse to enable a system that violates human rights and due process. At least eight other states have already passed laws limiting collaboration with ICE.

The New Mexico Immigrant Safety Act would do exactly that. It would bar state and local governments from entering into agreements to detain people for federal immigration violations, remove New Mexico from the business of mass deportation, and end the leasing of public land for immigration detention.

With detention conditions deteriorating and abuses mounting across the country, we’re standing with immigrant rights advocates to demand the passage of this urgent bill in New Mexico.

Law enforcement in New Mexico collects huge amounts of data on us through surveillance technology, including cameras known as automatic license plate readers (ALPRs). These devices, mounted on police cars or on objects like road signs and bridges, use high‑speed cameras to photograph thousands of plates per minute—creating a detailed record of where we drive.

While this technology has legitimate law enforcement uses and can help solve crimes, sharing this data with out‑of‑state or federal authorities carries serious risks. It has been used to track immigrant community members, people seeking abortion care, and activists. A recent ACLU-NM public records request showed that New Mexico ALPR cameras have been accessed thousands of times by out-of- state authorities for immigration enforcement, and at least once by Texas authorities to track a woman under criminal investigation for seeking abortion care.

New Mexico should join the growing number of states and cities that have enacted common-sense limits on how ALRP data can be used and shared.

The Driver Privacy and Safety Act would prohibit data sharing for purposes that violate New Mexico values, while ensuring law enforcement can continue using ALPRs for legitimate investigations. Passing this bill is critical to ensure outside authorities can’t turn our surveillance tools against us to target our families and communities.

Tech companies constantly harvest and sell personal data far beyond shopping preferences. Information about our immigration status, gender identity, or whether we’ve accessed reproductive healthcare can be purchased by anyone — including out‑of‑state law enforcement and anti‑LGBTQ+ politicians. Every time we post on social media or search the web, online service providers retain that information and may share it with the government. For non‑citizens, this data is already being used in visa screenings and could soon be used for other international entry decisions. Even something as simple as entering “Planned Parenthood” into Google Maps becomes part of a data trail that can be bought and weaponized.

Under an administration that is terrorizing immigrants, targeting protestors and critics, and dismantling reproductive and LGBTQ rights it is even more crucial that New Mexico strengthen its privacy protections.

CHISPA would require for‑profit companies serving New Mexicans to collect only the data that is necessary to provide the service requested, and to obtain explicit consent before collecting, processing, or sharing anything more—an opt‑in standard far stronger than the typical opt‑out model. Critically, the bill has teeth by giving individuals the right to sue when their privacy is violated. We’ll be working alongside the NM CHISPA coalition to pass this bill and ensure that New Mexicans — not corporations or hostile governments — control their own data.

Everyone in New Mexico deserves to live in safe communities, and we have the ability to make real progress on safety this session. What we know from experience and research is that the safest communities are those where everyone is housed, where everyone can access the healthcare they need voluntarily, and where everyone has access to quality jobs and education. Investments in these areas are investments in public safety.

This year, with our partners in the All Safe New Mexico coalition, we’re asking the legislature to make significant investments in housing services so that New Mexicans can build and maintain lasting stability in their lives. We’re also asking legislators to continue leading the country on harm reduction and a public‑health approach to substance use by studying overdose prevention centers and ensuring that people can access medication‑assisted treatment in their communities.

At the same time, we must reject proposals that expand mass incarceration or make it easier to involuntarily commit people who are unhoused—the very approach President Trump advanced in his dangerous executive order last year. Policies that increase sentences, create new crimes, target youth, or push people into locked institutions won’t make us safer. They will deepen the challenges our communities have faced for years.

We’re advocating for common‑sense, root‑cause solutions that strengthen our communities and promote real safety, not policies that criminalize people.",https://www.aclu-nm.org/app/uploads/2026/01/sean-quillen-kwNWq3FtETs-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:38:54.270749

Northfield city leaders are emphasizing their commitment to constitutional principles, public safety, and community trust as federal immigration enforcement actions continue to spark fear and disruption across Minnesota.

On Tuesday night, during the regular City Council meeting, Mayor Erica Zweifel read a prepared statement addressing concerns raised by residents about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity both locally and statewide. The statement, now posted on the city’s website, outlines Northfield’s values, clarifies the city’s limited role in federal immigration enforcement, and directs residents to local resources.

The statement, the full text of which can be read here, acknowledges the fear and uncertainty expressed by families, students, businesses, and faith communities. While emphasizing that cities do not control federal immigration policy, Zweifel said Northfield has a responsibility to speak clearly about its values and expectations.

Zweifel referenced the city’s vision of being “open, safe, and welcoming,” and noted that city council members and local officials are sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution. She also publicly recognized Police Chief Jeff Schroepfer and the Northfield Police Department, stressing that local police do not enforce federal immigration law and remain focused on professionalism, de-escalation, and serving the entire community.

“They’re stuck between a rock and a hard place,” she said.

City Administrator Ben Martig echoed those concerns, describing both operational and community impacts stemming from current ICE tactics. Martig, who oversees the police department, said there has historically been limited cooperation with federal immigration authorities in cases involving serious crimes, but current conditions are different.

He cited a recent incident reported by Brooklyn Park’s police chief involving armed ICE agents stopping an off-duty officer as an example of escalating concerns, and he said just the threat of aggressive ICE situations has already affected the city.

“As we’ve talked about, there’s been a long history of cooperation with immigration enforcement and in particular around the more serious crimes that would be occurring than trying to do enforcement with those limited individuals where that comes into play. We’re in a different world right now where there’s no communication happening, a lot of questionable use of force that we’ve observed, tactics that are happening. And so that’s really caused an impact.”

According to Martig, the situation is straining city operations, diverting staff time toward communications and crisis response, and affecting local service providers, schools, and the economy.

Zweifel’s statement calls on federal immigration officials to uphold due process, avoid intimidation, respect free speech, and operate transparently. She also urged Minnesota’s elected leaders to affirm peace and dignity and support accountability where concerns arise.

The city has expanded access to immigration-related information through its website, including recorded presentations by immigration attorneys, resources curated by the Human Rights Commission, and links to community partners such as the Community Action Center.

In her statement, the Mayor said that Northfield remains committed to the common good of all who live, learn, work, worship, and do business here, and added that city leaders will continue to lead “with care, clarity, and a steadfast commitment to our community.”",https://kymnradio.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Vertical-Lockup_3_RGB-01.png,N,,2026-01-23 12:38:57.855790

Mr. Turk said U.S. history has been shaped by the contributions that migrants have made.","Volker Turk, the U.N.’s commissioner for human rights, on Friday accused the Trump administration of launching immigration raids that don’t respect the due process rights of migrants and refugees and have resulted in violent detentions at hospitals, courthouses and houses of worship.

Speaking at a conference in Geneva, Mr. Turk said he was astounded by the acts of “now-routine abuse and denigration” carried out by U.S. immigration officials.

“Where is the concern for their dignity and our common humanity?” the Austrian said. “Those who dare to speak up or protest peacefully against heavy-handed immigration raids are vilified and threatened by officials and, on occasion, subject to arbitrary violence themselves.”

The Trump administration said its rounding up of illegal immigrants has helped secure the U.S.-Mexico border and resulted in the arrest and deportation of hundreds of thousands of criminal migrants, including drug traffickers, murderers, rapists and gang members.

The Washington Times reached out to the White House for comment.

Mr. Turk acknowledged that sovereign nations have the authority to establish migration policies but said they must be done in accordance with the law.

“Adhering to due process is crucial to the legality and legitimacy of any policy,” he said. “If these principles are not followed, it will more broadly erode public trust, diminish legal certainty, weaken institutional legitimacy and violate individuals’ rights.”

Mr. Turk also denounced what he called unnecessary or disproportionate enforcement operations.

“Under international law, the intentional use of lethal force is only permissible as a measure of last resort against an individual representing an imminent threat to life,” he said.

Mr. Turk appeared to be referring to the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Jonathan Ross.

Trump administration officials said the ICE agent acted in self-defense because she was driving toward him during an anti-immigration protest in Minneapolis. Local officials in Minnesota have challenged the federal government’s narrative of what happened, saying Good was steering away from Mr. Ross when she was shot.

Mr. Turk said U.S. history has been shaped by the contributions that migrants have made.

Increased ICE funding There is no definitive information about the proportion of ICE detentions which stem from warrantless arrests.
It is likely, however, that in 2025 at least one-third, or several hundred thousand detentions were warrantless, at-large arrests made during community sweeps.","Before dawn on the morning of October 30, a Mexican farmworker had just left her home in Woodburn, Oregon with her son and nephew. The trio were driving to work in the fields when an unmarked SUV with police flashers pulled them over.

Unbeknownst to the group, their vehicle had been flagged using a powerful new data tool, part of the government’s expanding surveillance capabilities.

An ICE officer initially yelled at the driver to roll down the window. When the driver didn’t move fast enough, the officer then smashed the window. Almost immediately, a swarm of SUVs surrounded the car. The officers did not identify themselves as ICE or provide any explanation as to why they had made the traffic stop. They detained everyone in the van.

MJMA (as the asylum seeker is referred to in court filings to protect her from government reprisals) was terrified as agents pulled her out of the vehicle. Officers broke her finger as they handcuffed her, pinning her arms behind her back. “I felt so powerless and anxious,” she later told her lawyers.

MJMA was first transported to a holding cell in Portland. She was then quickly transferred out of state to Tacoma, Washington.

Her arrest, similar in many respects to the barrage of ICE detentions in communities nationwide, stands out for one fact. It involved the deployment of ELITE (Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement).

This powerful surveillance software, developed by Palantir Technologies, comes thanks to a $60 million investment by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The investment funds the ongoing enhancement of a suite of data weapons to track, target, detain, and deport immigrants.

Track, target, detain

MJMA’s detention was part of Operation Black Rose, specifically designed to give ICE agents experience in using ELITE. The surveillance tool has been described in some detail by 404 Media, a leading news service specializing in reporting on technology advances. In essence, ELITE facilitates ICE targeting of entire areas with concentrations of immigrants. The software then allows agents to aggregate data from multiple sources to target them.

Reports from Operation Black Rose suggest the data tools need further refinement. For example, Mobile Fortify, widely used to identify individuals’ legal status mis-identified MJMA twice.

As is typical in software that incorporates AI, however, performance may improve as additional data is acquired. If ICE gains access to large administrative datasets—e.g. MedicAid or SNAP—ICE can then use AI to merge that personal data with commercially available cellphone and social media data, together with license plate data, to make surveillance and arrests still easier. This can, of course, also increase the likelihood of mistakes.

News reports in Chicago and Minneapolis, meanwhile, suggest that ICE’s ability to cross-reference disparate data sources is rapidly expanding.

‘At large’ arrests

This all means more cost-effective and indiscriminate targeting of immigrants, criminal or otherwise. The Cato Institute reported in November (based on leaked internal Department of Homeland Security data) that only 5% of all ICE detainees had been convicted of a violent crime. Some 73% had not been convicted of any crime.

In states like Oregon, where MJMA was arrested and where state law prohibits police from cooperating with ICE, tools like ELITE allow the agency to carry out wide-area surveillance. It is no coincidence that Oregon is among the states where most ICE detentions (80%) have been warrantless “at large” arrests of non-criminals.

Part of ELITE’s appeal is cost. Historically, the average cost of an individual deportation has been approximately $17,000. Reaching the administration’s objective of 1 million deportations per year would therefore run upwards of $17 billion annually.

The technology also comes as the administration has removed guardrails protecting against warrantless search and seizure. Following Trump’s 2025 Executive Order, new DHS guidelines no longer limit ICE to detaining just criminals. The agency can now arrest virtually any unauthorized immigrant.

Those now vulnerable to arbitrary arrest in community-wide ICE sweeps empowered by ELITE include DACA recipients. It also includes immigrants like MJMA, who was planning to seek asylum.

Legal aid

In her case, MJMA was able to secure her release after just two days in detention, thanks to legal aid from Innovation Law Lab. The Portland based organization filed a class action lawsuit on her behalf. The suit calls into question ICE’s increasing numbers of warrantless arrests. It also challenges how the agency uses data-weapons such as ELITE to conduct wide-area sweeps in immigrant neighborhoods.

Two other Oregon immigrants—one a middle-aged Guatemalan woman who is a small store owner and a legal permanent resident, the other a middle-aged man who has lived in the U.S. for 40 years, a U visa applicant and is lawfully present and employed—were added to the litigation as co-plaintiffs in December. Both were roughly and arbitrarily detained in “at large” arrests similar to MJMA’s.

ICE’s use of data-weapons such as ELITE broadens the digital dragnet it uses for indiscriminate arrests in what it calls “target rich” environments. The focus is not actually on detaining “the worst of the worst.” The aim is to bulk up numbers of daily arrests to meet the arbitrary quota of 3,000 set by White House advisor Stephen Miller.

Yet despite the power and financial resources available to ICE, sound legal support can make a huge difference. That is especially the case for detained immigrants like MJMA and her co-plaintiffs. Unlike immigration courts, which are controlled by the Department of Justice, federal courts remain committed to following the law. Of which ICE’s current aggressive enforcement often falls afoul.

Increased ICE funding

There is no definitive information about the proportion of ICE detentions which stem from warrantless arrests. It is likely, however, that in 2025 at least one-third, or several hundred thousand detentions were warrantless, at-large arrests made during community sweeps.

Given dramatic increases in FY26 federal funding for ICE—President Trump’s yearly budget includes a proposed $11.3 billion for the agency—and escalating enforcement, improved surveillance technology such as ELITE is a worrisome weapon. (The House on Thursday passed a spending package that includes increased funding for ICE. Seven Democrats joined with Republicans in approving the measure.)

As we saw in Los Angeles and now in Minneapolis, ICE tactics initially used against immigrants can be easily deployed and viciously used against US citizens as well.

Or have they only been arrested and not convicted?” King said.

“ICE has been operating under an internal memo from last May that essentially allows ICE agents to enter a home without a warrant,” King said.","PORTLAND, Maine — Maine independent U.S. Senator Angus King is criticizing the escalating surge of federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in his home state.

“What I have been hearing is there is terrorizing of American citizens going on, but it's by ICE, not by the people that they are arresting,” King told reporters at Portland City Hall on Thursday, three hours after Governor Janet Mills held a briefing in the same room. “If the purpose here is to stop allowing people to terrorize American citizens, they ought to look in the mirror.”

Before briefing reporters, King had met or spoken with the mayors of Portland, Biddeford, and Lewiston. “Parents are afraid to take their kids to school. They're afraid to put them on the bus,” King said. “And I'm hearing from employers who are having a fairly high level of absenteeism.”

ICE this week began a search for 1,400 immigrants it calls Operation Catch of the Day, resulting in 50 arrests in the first 24 hours, the agency said, describing only four of the detainees, one of whom had been convicted of driving under the influence.

“One of my questions is, who are the other 46?” King said. “They haven't told us. So, that tells me that there's a skunk here.”

King said he wanted to know why individuals are being sought by ICE agents. “They've said that there are 1,400 targets in Maine. We'd like to know the nature of those targets. What crimes are they charged with? Have they been convicted? Or have they only been arrested and not convicted?” King said.

King said his staff has reached out to ICE but has not gotten a response, and his request for an in-person briefing in Maine was denied.

“What bothers me about that is that this entire operation is based on the premise—and I'll read it from their press release—‘an immigration enforcement effort across the state of Maine targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.’ That's the mission,” King said. “Let's call this what it is. This is a large-scale mass deportation effort, and let's drop the pretense that somehow this is about the worst of the worst.”

King asked, “Where are these people going, where are they being held, and under what circumstances? But the damage to children, to families, the breadwinner who's being taken away, what's going to happen to that family? Are we going to see a surge in evictions in a month or so because of this?”

King blasted the agency for running afoul of the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches.

“ICE has been operating under an internal memo from last May that essentially allows ICE agents to enter a home without a warrant,” King said. “It's blatantly unconstitutional.”

King theorized some names on the ICE target list may have come from shared Internal Revenue Service data, as many undocumented people in this country pay taxes, or perhaps from a list of immigrants who have obtained or applied for work permits.

King said he supports the apprehension of illegal immigrants using normal tactics.

King said, “It's not necessarily that we are against enforcing our immigration laws; it's the manner in which it's going forward, and I have never in my experience seen law enforcement agencies with masks on, without body cams, often without identification.”

King forewarned there could be a reckoning over ICE’s activities when the budget for the Department of Homeland Security is debated next week in Washington.

When asked why he hasn’t been able to get answers from the Trump administration, King said, “I’m not sure they want sunlight into what’s going on.”

Organizers are calling for no work, no school and no shopping, and some businesses said they would close their doors as part of the civil action.

“This is a bigger thing than the weather,” said Larry Weiss, a retired resident who patrols on his block alongside his wife and noted it was supposed to be about “eight below” in the city on Friday. “They are trying to break us and we are not going to be broken,” he said.

Posters calling for statewide action and promoting the protest march and rally are pasted in the windows of businesses near the University of Minnesota. In the LynLake area, a few businesses had posted signs warning that neither Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs nor Border Patrol were welcome inside their stores without a valid judicial warrant.

“Everyone is welcome here, except I.C.E.,” reads a sign on the door to Wrecktangle Pizza.

Three weeks since 37-year-old U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer, the defiance of the city’s residents remains on full display.

Jeff Rogers, one of the Wrecktangle owners, said the pizza restaurant would be closed Friday and he’d attend the protest. The restaurant industry in the city is being suffocated by ICE’s presence, he said.

“It’s tearing our restaurant community apart … everyone’s seen all the evidence of all this bulls---. It’s horrific and not something we condone,” he said.

Beckett’s, a nearby sports bar, also planned to close, said Frank, one of the managers who declined to give his last name as he expressed concern over his co-workers.

“We have one of our head cooks who hasn’t come in for a month now because he’s afraid. We’re all just supporting him. We also have other cooks that also are worried about it, but they need to pay their bills,” he said of his immigrant co-workers.

Craig, a local businessman who did not want his last name used and did not want his business identified over fears of backlash, said he has canceled all his Friday appointments to support the protest. He said most of his clients were supportive.

One of his co-workers is of Hmong descent, Craig said, and has had a lot of ICE activity in his neighborhood.

“I don’t know how fearful he is, but I am fearful for him,” said Craig, who added he’s been locking his business' door to offer a safe place for University of Minnesota international students.

“They’ve maybe felt all week unsafe and they can come in here and maybe feel safe that maybe I’m a trusted person,” he said.

In response to a question about the planned protest and the closing of some businesses, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated in an email on Wednesday, “the fact that those groups want to shut down Minnesota’s economy, which provides law-abiding American citizens an honest living, to fight for illegal alien murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, drug dealers, and terrorists says everything you need to know.""

On Tuesday, Greg Bovino, Border Patrol's commander-at-large, and Marcos Charles, ICE’s executive director of enforcement and removal operations, touted the arrests of more than 3,000 people in the Minneapolis region since last month, including “some of the most dangerous offenders,” they said at a news conference. Bovino said the actions he’s witnessed from immigration enforcement agents have been “professional” and “lawful,” after he was asked about concerns from local law enforcement that people were being racially profiled.

In the neighborhood where Good was shot, the streets were covered by snow on Wednesday. At mid-morning, a burst of whistles and car horns broke the icy quiet as drivers and pedestrians blowing whistles started following a group of vehicles they identified as belonging to federal agents. After a few blocks, the cacophony subsided.

Despite days of bone-chilling winter weather, residents could be seen throughout the week on street corners and navigating the snow piles on sidewalks as they monitored any actions by ICE or Border Patrol agents.

Networks of volunteers have grown by the thousands, according to a person who acts as a “dispatcher” to groups, including those who respond quickly to arrest sites in order to document immigration enforcement activity. Volunteer medics and chaplains also roam neighborhoods where ICE operations play out, ready to tend to anyone impacted by tear gas or pepper spray.

“None of us want to be doing this. I don’t, but we simply cannot stand by as other Minnesotans are being hurt,” said Ben Damberg, who helps thousands of people communicate on Signal channels, coordinating responses to ICE operations around the city. “We will march, we will protest, and we will do it all peacefully above all else.”

A massive mobilization network

While some residents have been acting as rapid responders, others have been mobilizing and doing the kind of work seen in natural disasters such as floods or fires.

Earlier this month, Rogers’ business began providing free frozen pizzas to immigrant families for every pizza bought. The donation drive began in early January after a confrontation with federal agents who were refused entry to the restaurant.

The restaurant shortened its hours to have more hands to prepare the pizzas and meal kits for families and handle donations.

On Wednesday, Rogers said in a social media post that the restaurant had raised $200,000 and would put that money in a fund to support other nonprofits as it continues to give frozen pizzas and meal kits to families.

At Dios Habla Hoy church, in south Minneapolis, volunteers were stacking dozens of small bags of flour and other staples that were coming into the church. It’s the sort of relief-operation work volunteers might do after a major disaster.

Sergio Amezcua, the church’s pastor, said he has a network of 4,000 volunteers. They help him distribute food to families in need, many of them immigrants who won’t leave home for fear of being arrested by federal officers.

On Wednesday, Amezcua said the church delivered boxes to 1,500 families in about six hours. About 300 volunteers served as drivers and helped Amezcua deliver the boxes. The church is distributing about 100 tons of food weekly, the pastor said.

Last Friday, the church had run out of food and Amezcua sent a message to volunteers asking if they could do some shopping. In three hours, the church was filled with food.

“This is a humanitarian crisis in Minnesota,” he said. He said the disaster-like response honors Renee Good.

“Her life shouldn’t be forgotten. She is going to be a hero for our community,” he said.

Aside from donation mobilizations, other residents are expressing support to the city’s immigrant community in other ways. A community singing group has been performing at the site where Good was fatally shot.

“It’s such a sacred and difficult place,” said Timothy Frantzich, of the Perfection-Free Community Singing Circle, who spoke to NBC News last week. “But I think if we can bring something beautiful, then maybe we can bring something beautiful to a difficult place.”

One of the singers, who asked to be identified as Z. Brown out of fear due to the ongoing tensions in the city, described a feeling of “helplessness, and wanting to do something” after Good’s death and recent enforcement actions impacting her immigrant neighbors.

Brown said there was an uncomfortable truth about it all, which was that those who didn’t look like her, a white woman, couldn’t come out and support the community for fear of being aggressively targeted by ICE.

“It’s important as white people, we can be out here right now and we can be in this space,” she said. “It’s just, we feel like we have to do that, because there are so many people right now who are literally hiding.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260122-minneapolis-ice-vl-1127a-d5185f.jpg",N,,2026-01-23 13:38:29.551886

Meanwhile, district leaders say they’ll do more to support school staff when such reports emerge.

The accounts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity led four schools in south Seattle — Mercer International Middle School, Aki Kurose Middle School, Cleveland STEM High School, and Maple Elementary — to enact shelter-in-place protocols for several hours Tuesday, according to district officials. That means all of a school’s exterior doors are locked while normal instruction and operations continue inside.

Other schools nearby took different “precautionary measures,” the district said — including Dearborn Park International and Beacon Hill International elementary schools, which the district had earlier incorrectly said sheltered in place.

District officials previously called the reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity “credible,” but in a statement Wednesday said security staff were at each school that sheltered in place Tuesday and “did not observe any ICE presence at or near SPS campuses.”

“The district continues to monitor information closely and works to verify all reports before acting,” the district said, adding that it “remains alert to community concerns.”

Interim Superintendent Fred Podesta said Wednesday the district has strong policies in place if immigration enforcement affects a school building, and that all principals have been trained on them.

He also emphasized that ICE agents are not allowed on district property without a verified warrant or court order.

But Podesta also acknowledged that the district can do more, including by better supporting principals who have to make decisions such as whether to shelter in place on the fly with little information — unlike when other law enforcement activity happens near a school.

“Usually there are hard facts and we’re working with law enforcement agencies. In this case, there’s just a lot of information flying around,” Podesta said. “I don’t think we’ve given school leaders all the tools they need for dealing with that ambiguity, so we are going to work hard to correct that to make sure there's a bit more centralized decision-making and consensus-building before we take action.”

A spokesperson for the Seattle Police Department said it received no calls reporting ICE near schools Tuesday. ICE did not respond to KUOW’s inquiry about whether agents had been in the area on Tuesday.

Still, the incident has rattled local leaders and left Seattle school communities fearful — especially as immigration enforcement in Minnesota has led to children being physically hurt or detained, including a 5-year-old boy whose lawyers say he was used as “bait” to draw family members outside their home.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday wrote on X: “This is disturbing. We’re monitoring the situation closely.”

Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson’s team said it’s also watching the situation, but does not have “concrete information on increased ICE activity in Seattle.”

King County Councilmember Rhonda Lewis applauded the quick action taken by the schools, saying in a statement that she’s “concerned about the ongoing impacts of this kind of activity in King County, especially in historically marginalized communities.”

At a school board meeting Wednesday, half a dozen parents, teachers, and community members urged the district to take a stronger stance against immigration enforcement activity.

“There’s a lot of work being done by the community,” said one speaker, Gloria Ramirez, through an interpreter. “But we’re not getting that kind of support from the institutions — the school system, the district — that we need.”

Ramirez called on the district to provide families with more information, including through informational nights and workshops so they can better understand their rights and how to stay safe.

“The problems that we’re seeing right now — they’re big, and they're only going to get bigger down the road,” she added.

Parents and teachers also called for better communication from district officials if they receive reports of ICE near schools and decide to shelter in place.

Gela Simpson is a special educator at Aki Kurose Middle School. One of her kids attends Aki, the other Maple Elementary. Both schools sheltered in place on Tuesday. Simpson said she didn’t learn about the suspected ICE activity or shelter-in-place at Maple Elementary until a staff member texted her. Shortly after, one of her coworkers at Aki heard similar information, prompting their school to also shelter in place.

“There was a huge fracture with communication and the training that we have as educators in order to know how to respond appropriately,” Simpson said.

Simpson said most of her students didn’t attend school the following day — and those who did were frightened.

“At the end of the day, I don’t want to see my student running down the hallway screaming, ‘Miss Gela, I don’t want to be killed. I don’t want to lose my family,’” Simpson said through tears. “We have to do better.”

Jazmin Chavez, an educator at South Shore PK-8 in Seattle’s Rainier Beach neighborhood, said she’s seen an increase in families navigating ICE activity and deportation orders in recent weeks.

“Some students have already withdrawn, and others are at risk of leaving in the coming weeks or months,” Chavez told the board. “These are students who have built strong relationships and a sense of belonging at our school — and it’s heartbreaking to see that stability disrupted so suddenly.”

That fear has escalated quickly since Tuesday, Chavez said. Parents were scared to pick up their kids from school, and the situation “highlighted how vulnerable families are during moments of uncertainty, and how unprepared schools might be when fear spreads faster than accurate information.”

While the South Shore school community did its best to rally around families with support, Chavez said they need more support from district officials.

“Without clear structures, it has made coordination and collective action that much more difficult,” Chavez said.

“Our district serves a large population of families impacted by immigration policies — too many to ignore or treat as isolated cases,” she added. “Larger scale partnerships, clear guidance, or even a policy-level stance that advocates for our communities could help schools navigate these moments more thoughtfully and consistently.”",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/0776e577cbb993e7bc2aed4b5d74a4a4.jpeg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2026-01-23 13:38:34.478739

Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support.

The tied vote was the latest sign of House speaker Mike Johnson’s tenuous hold on the majority, as well as some of the growing pushback in the Republican-controlled Congress to the US president’s aggressions in the western hemisphere. A Senate vote on a similar resolution was also tied last week until JD Vance broke the deadlock.

To defeat the Democratic-backed resolution on Thursday, Republican leaders had to hold the vote open for more than 20 minutes while Republican congressman Wesley Hunt, who had been out of Washington all week campaigning for a Senate seat in Texas, rushed back to Capitol Hill to cast the decisive vote.

On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber’s procedural rules. Two Republicans –Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky – voted with all Democrats for the legislation.

The war powers resolution would have directed Trump to remove US troops from Venezuela. The Trump administration told senators last week that there are no US troops on the ground in Venezuela and committed to obtaining congressional approval before launching major military operations there.

But Democrats argued that the resolution is necessary after US troops captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month that left Congress in the dark.

Thursday’s vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the US from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.

Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House armed services committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of “spite” for Trump.

Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.

“Donald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,” Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, said during a floor debate.

Last week, Senate Republicans were only able to narrowly dismiss the Venezuela war powers resolution after the Trump administration persuaded two Republicans to back away from their earlier support.

Trump’s recent military actions – and threats to do more – have reignited a decades-old debate in Congress over the War Powers Act, which dates back to the Vietnam war era.

Trump’s insistence that the US will possess Greenland over the objections of Denmark, a Nato ally, has alarmed some Republicans on Capitol Hill. They have mounted some of the most outspoken objections to almost anything the president has done since taking office.

Trump this week backed away from military and tariff threats against European allies as he announced that his administration was working with Nato on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security.

But Bacon still expressed frustration with Trump’s aggressive foreign policy and voted for the war powers resolution even though it only applies to Venezuela.

“I’m tired of all the threats,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1789da10790428f47291efdb2b1f6e759c865d46/1078_0_7200_5760/master/7200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=945636a8bc827693e8ed803d3c7b0bd1",N,,2026-01-23 10:58:24.739842

Minutes after Good was killed on January 7, a number of UU ministers and laypeople rushed to the scene, including Rev.","Hundreds of Unitarian Universalist clergy and laypeople from around the country are gathered today in Minneapolis along with thousands of other people to participate in a day of nonviolent moral action and reflection calling for the end of ICE operations in Minnesota.

In the wake of an ICE agent fatally shooting Minneapolis resident Renée Good on January 7, and in response to targeted violence against immigrant communities throughout the country, MARCH (Multifaith Antiracism, Change & Healing), a pro-queer group of multiracial clergy and faith leaders, put out a call for multifaith clergy to gather in Minneapolis on Thursday and Friday, January 22 and 23.

“During the Civil Rights Movement, especially after Bloody Sunday, Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., put out a call for clergy to come to Selma and bear witness … You [UUs], you were there … you have a history of being there. Keep it up, keep showing up, keep doing it,” Rev. Dr. DeWayne Davis, a member of MARCH who teaches at United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities, told UU World. “Be a witness to this promise of wholeness and freedom for all humanity. It will make a difference.”

Today the clergy and faith leaders will join and support The Day of Truth and Freedom, which includes a rally and march in downtown Minneapolis. Organized by labor unions, community leaders, and faith groups, The Day of Truth and Freedom urges Minnesotans statewide to stay home from work, school, and shopping in favor of “community, conscience, and collective action,” according to ICE Out of Minnesota. The Minneapolis march begins at 2 p.m., when a temperature of –11 is predicted.

This is a developing story. UU World will be updating regularly with dispatches from the scene in Minneapolis.

On Thursday, hundreds of clergy and faith leaders of many faith groups gathered for relationship-building, spiritual grounding, and orientation to what is happening on the ground in Minneapolis.

“I am keenly aware that what is happening here is happening across the country … so I feel it is important for us to have a national witness,” Rev. Mariann Budde, an Episcopal prelate who is Bishop of Washington, D.C., told UU World. Budde gained national attention in January when she addressed President Trump directly during a prayer service for the inauguration, calling on him to have mercy on transgender children and immigrant families.

UUs “are here in large numbers relative to your size, and your faith tradition has such a history of commitment to social justice, and that is well represented here,” Budde told UU World. “I think [UUs] would feel a combination of both heartbreak at what’s happening [and] an incredible sense of honor and pride to be a part of people of faith and goodwill, who are doing lots of things, large and small, to keep the fabric of society woven together.”

Rev. Ben Atherton-Zeman, minister at the UU Church of St. Petersburg, Florida, is one who answered the call to Minneapolis. “I am here for reasons of morality and ethics. ICE, I feel, has sacrificed any moral authority in the way they have done their job so poorly, so illegally, so violently,” he told UU World. “I would say [to all UUs] to answer the call.”

Erol Delos Santos, a Union Theological Seminary graduate preparing for UU ministry, is director of congregational life at UU Society of Oneonta, New York. “Oneonta is a pretty rural congregation, and I think there’s a misconception that the presence of ICE doesn’t really reach rural congregations in a way that it reaches major cities,” Santos said. “So I really wanted to take a look at the impact myself and bring those facts and that public witness back to my congregation to let them know that this is a military occupation … And when this call came out, it seemed like a good call to follow. I feel really supported and hopeful that so many different denominations and faith traditions are coming together with a similar purpose.”

On Thursday evening, Rev. Dr. Sofía Betancourt, president of the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), gave the after-dinner prayer at a local church that hosted about 200 people for dinner. “Let us be reminded of the greater calling, the greater possibility, the greatest promise of our living tradition,” Betancourt said, adding, “We are moving and joining movements through the strength of all those who worked and fought and sacrificed and struggled for the freedom, the wholeness, the well-being of all, for that love that abides, which resides in us, as long as we are on this planet.”

At a press conference earlier Thursday, ten faith leaders stood as a group, including Betancourt and Lena Gardner, executive director of BLUU (Black Lives of Unitarian Universalism), who lives in Minneapolis. Those who spoke included Budde, who said, “A dangerous line has been crossed. Peaceful protestors are being killed. This moment calls us all to moral clarity and civic responsibility.” Jamie Beran, CEO of Bend the Arc, a Jewish social justice group, also addressed the media, saying, “When people like me from across this nation saw our neighbors in need, and heard the call from our friends here in Minnesota, we came from all over the nation to stand together … There is no holier call to action than the call to action for each other.”

Valerie Kaur, a Sikh activist and founder of the Revolutionary Love Project, also spoke at the press conference, saying, “Revolutionary love is the choice to leave no one outside of our circle of care, to risk ourselves for one another, to show up with whistles when they have guns. And that love is a force that this administration cannot defeat.”

In putting out the call to clergy, MARCH described Minneapolis as “at the center of a crisis that has been long in the making,” and a “crisis of our Constitution, federal overreach, militarized enforcement, and the erosion of civil liberties.” It added, “We therefore call on clergy and faith leaders of all faiths, representative of every part of the country, to join us for a day of witness and resistance …”

MARCH said the current crisis in the Twin Cities has “echoes of Selma [Alabama],” a reference to the Selma March of 1965, when Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., put out a nationwide call to clergy to travel there to support the struggle for civil rights. “It is in that same spirit—and with that same clarity—that we issue this call now,” MARCH added.

Rev. Terri Burnor, executive director of the Minnesota Unitarian Universalist Social Justice Alliance (MUUSJA) and a lifelong Minnesotan, is on the MARCH core planning team. “People do not understand what it is like here, what it’s like to be in an occupied territory,” Burnor said Thursday. “They don’t understand what it’s like to have helicopters flying over your head, to have whistles blowing, to have people showing up to patrol their daycare centers and their schools.”

Rev. Laura Smidzik, assistant minister of First Universalist Church of Minneapolis, helped distribute warm clothing to attendees on Thursday. “We have 3,000 ICE agents on the ground here. Restaurants are closing because they can’t keep their staff there. [Agents] are around schools and hospitals,” she said. MARCH organized the call to clergy in six days, Smidzik said, adding, “People are desperate to help and want to be part of this larger community that we’re creating here. People are standing up.”

On January 7, 2026, Good, a U.S. citizen and 37-year-old mother of three, was shot dead in Minneapolis by ICE agent Jonathan Ross, sparking immediate protests in that city and around the country. President Donald Trump and others in his administration claimed the agent acted in self-defense, while many others insist the shooting was entirely unjustified and a violation of law enforcement procedure. In one of a number of targeted immigration enforcement efforts, Trump has sent over 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota in “Operation Metro Surge.” Good’s killing has intensified national calls for the abolition of ICE, which has been involved in numerous violent confrontations and shootings during Trump’s second term.

“The ICE ‘surge’ that cost the life of Renée Nicole Good is violating the Constitutional and human rights of Americans and our neighbors,” according to ICE Out. The Day of Truth and Freedom is calling for ICE to leave Minnesota immediately, for the officer who killed Good to be held legally accountable, for the end to any more federal funding for ICE, for ICE to be investigated for Constitutional and human rights violations, and for the state of Minnesota as well as national corporations—including Target, Delta, Home Depot, Hilton, and Enterprise—to stop economic relations with, and other supports for, ICE.

Minutes after Good was killed on January 7, a number of UU ministers and laypeople rushed to the scene, including Rev. Ashley Horan, the UUA’s vice president for Programs and Ministries. Horan, who resides near the site of the shooting, livestreamed from the scene. Her footage captures ICE agents firing chemical irritants at protesters, according to a report from the Religion News Service. In a video she posted on Facebook, Horan said federal agents were attempting to “fracture and terrorize our communities,” which goes against UU values.

Rev. Jen Crow, senior minister of First Universalist Church of Minneapolis, described ICE’s presence on the scene as “an overwhelming show of force,” saying that over fifty agents were present after Good’s killing, many heavily armed. “It was a war zone,” she said.

“It’s felt hard to tell people outside of Minneapolis what is happening here. And this could happen anywhere,” Horan told UU World. “Renée Good was killed one block from my house, and I had to explain to my child what had happened, and it was devastating to me. But when we drive through my neighborhood with my children on the way to school, I can say, ‘Look, those are the people who are patrolling to keep our neighbors safe. Look at the parents standing outside the school across the street who are making sure that classmates can get in and go to school … I don’t know anybody in Minneapolis who isn’t doing something.”

In a January 14 interview with the Religious News Service, Horan, who since Good’s killing has patrolled her Minneapolis neighborhood looking for the presence of ICE, pointed to the history of UUs in the famous civil rights march in Selma. During that action, Rev. James Reeb, a UU minister from Massachusetts, was killed by white supremacists, and Viola Liuzzo, a UU and civil rights activist from Michigan, was murdered by Ku Klux Klan members as she was driving activists who were participating in the march. They were responding to a call to clergy from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to join the march.

“Those folks are very front of mind right now, particularly Viola Liuzzo and the ways in which she feels so similar to Renée Good,” Horan told RNS. “She was a mom, she was somebody who was drawn to just show up in ways that she could and ended up losing her life because of her convictions.”",https://www.uuworld.org/sites/default/files/styles/max_2400x2400_no_upscale/public/2026-01/MARCH_day1_2.jpg?itok=PWLVrE9c,N,,2026-01-23 14:04:18.821838

BOSTON (AP) — A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as “remedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs’ noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.”

During the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an “unconstitutional conspiracy” to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to “pick off certain people.”

“The big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,” said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. “There doesn’t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.”

In his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.

“Upon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,” Young wrote.

A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment

During last year’s trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.

Among the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.

The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.

But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.

The decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel. But it was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.

Another was the Tufts University student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was released in May from six weeks of detention after being arrested on a suburban Boston street. She said she was illegally detained following an op-ed piece she co-wrote last year criticizing her school’s response to Israel’s war in Gaza.

During the latest hearing in the case, Young repeatedly seemed baffled that the country’s top leaders would attempt to implement such a policy.

“How could this happen? How could our government’s highest officials seek to so infringe on the rights of people lawfully here in the United States,” he told the court. “The record in this case convinces me that these high officials, and I include the president of the United States, have a fearful view of freedom.”

Ramya Krishnan, senior staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute, which argued for relief in court, said the “administration’s lawless efforts to deport pro-Palestinian advocates has spread terror in our campus communities.”

“Students and scholars shouldn’t have to live in fear that ICE agents could seize them from their homes merely for engaging in political expression,” she said. “Today’s judgment makes emphatically clear that the administration’s campaign of intimidation must end.”",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-05T224415Z_614720175_RC2YUIAW0TXI_RTRMADP_3_USA-VENEZUELA.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 10:58:35.670972

The first week of 2026 was brutal. Reports of abuse of power, including the unwarranted use of force against civilians, have already resulted in the killing of a citizen, numerous preventable injuries and the deaths of more than 30 people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody since 2025.

Yet just as alarming is the lack of meaningful engagement and leadership from most of the Georgia delegation in Washington, D.C., in preventing further harm to their constituents and especially to the futures of millions of U.S.-citizen children.

“We will walk in below-zero degrees in one of the coldest days in Minnesota,” Emilia González Avalos with UNIDOS Minnesota, one of the groups behind the event, told CNN’s Sara Sidner.

The wind chill in Minneapolis is not expected to rise above -20 today. The march that was originally scheduled to begin and end at the city’s Commons Park will instead conclude with an indoor rally at Target Center.

“We’re asking people to march,” said González. “We’re asking people boycott today. We’re asking people to get trained as legal observers.”

The event is part of a broader Friday strike activists have called for, encouraging people to stay home from school and work and for businesses to close.

The Department of Homeland Security is calling for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey to turn over a convicted sex offender they said federal agents were searching for when they dragged a US citizen from his St. Paul home on Sunday.

“This is exactly what we have been saying: We need state and local law enforcement engagement and information so we don’t have to have such a presence on the streets,” reads a post on X from the agency.

Paul Schnell, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Corrections, told CNN yesterday he had notified DHS that the offender was in state custody.

Some context: ICE agents bashed open ChongLy “Scott” Thao’s door before detaining him and leading him outside in his underwear in frigid conditions, according to the Associated Press. The episode, captured on video, provoked anger and criticism of the ICE agents’ tactics.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Thao of living with two convicted sex offenders, the targets of the operation, and said both were still at large.

But Schnell said that one of those sex offenders is already in prison.

“He is, in fact, in prison and subject to a detainer,” Schnell told CNN yesterday. “They should know, because we did notify them that they were in our custody.”

Hundreds of Minnesota businesses are expected to close on Friday as part of a protest against immigration enforcement in the state.

The strike, organized by local faith leaders and unions, urges Minnesotans to avoid shopping and stay home from work or school, according to CNN affiliate KARE. There is also a rally planned in downtown Minneapolis uniting under the slogan “ICE out of Minnesota.”

The statewide strike comes a day after Vice President JD Vance, who visited Minneapolis, blamed a lack of cooperation from local authorities for some of the problems in the city, and suggested that is why ICE needs such a robust presence in Minneapolis.

Here’s a look at the latest:

A 5-year-old has become one of the latest children caught up in the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign, after he and his father were taken by federal agents outside their Minneapolis home. The family’s attorney said they are in the US legally after applying for asylum. The father and son are being held together at a detention facility in Texas, while the boy’s pregnant mother remains in Minneapolis.

More arrests are expected in connection with a church protest in St. Paul, Minnesota, according to acting ICE director Todd Lyons. Federal authorities have arrested three people since the protest interrupted a church service to object to a pastor who appears to serve as a top ICE official.

Vance, while in Minneapolis, acknowledged the need for investigations into the fatal shooting of Renee Good and other instances where agents have been accused of wrongdoing.

Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said agents are encountering protesters who are “stalking” them at public places and local police and elected officials have not intervened. He cited an instance where a “violent” group tried to stop ICE officers from using a gas station restroom.

ICE has arrested more than 100 people in Maine since it launched “Operation Catch of the Day” in the Democrat-led state Tuesday.

“When they boxed her in, they demanded her paperwork, of which she’s a U.S. citizen and clearly would not have any paperwork,” Bruley said.

The ICE officers had their guns drawn during the encounter, Bruley said. He noted that they eventually left without apologizing after the woman identified herself as a Brooklyn Park police officer.

“If this happens to our officers, it pains me to think of how many community members are falling victim to this every day,” Bruley said. “It has to stop.”

Bruley said he does not blame all ICE officers for incidents like this and stressed that he respects law enforcement broadly. He believes a small number of agents are engaging in inappropriate conduct.

“I don’t think the leaders in Washington, D.C., fully understand what some of their groups are doing on the street and how much damage they’re causing,” Bruley said.

Bruley, along with St. Paul Police Chief Axel Henry and Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, said the behavior of some ICE agents is eroding trust that local law enforcement has worked for years to build within the community.

They said documenting and reporting questionable encounters has been difficult because there doesn't appear to be a clear point person for the operation and many officers are masked or not easily identifiable.

Despite recent criticism, the Department of Homeland Security has defended the agents involved in Operation Metro Surge.

“The Trump Administration is letting white-collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing,” Warren, from Massachusetts, said in a statement.
Staff who once pursued public corruption cases, cyber-enabled fraud and organised financial crime are now reportedly guarding detention facilities and performing immigration checks.
The Democrats cite reports of corruption and financial-fraud cases being delayed or abandoned as investigators are pulled off long-running inquiries.
“These staff and resource diversions exemplify this Administration’s reckless decision-making in service of Trump’s brutal, ruthless immigration enforcement agenda.","Senator Elizabeth Warren and fellow Democrats have accused Donald Trump of letting white collar criminals “off the hook” by diverting crucial resources to his sweeping immigration crackdown.

In a letter to federal watchdogs, the Democrats demand an investigation into the US president for shifting more than 25,000 personnel away from investigating fraud, tax evasion and money laundering in favour of his immigration enforcement agenda.

“The Trump Administration is letting white-collar criminals off the hook for all kinds of wrongdoing,” Warren, from Massachusetts, said in a statement. “Instead of protecting American families from fraud and predatory behavior, the Administration is diverting resources to pursue its inhumane immigration agenda.

“Nobody is above the law, and the Trump Administration needs to stop treating white collar criminals with kid gloves.”

In the letter to inspectors general of the justice department, state department, homeland security, the postal service and the treasury’s tax division, the Democrats allege that the administration is “diverting critical federal law enforcement personnel and resources” away from corporate crime and into what they describe as Trump’s “civil immigration dragnet”.

The letter – signed by Democrats including Warren, senator Richard Blumenthal and representatives Dan Goldman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Madeleine Dean – demands a formal evaluation of the extent of the transfers and their impact on US financial crime enforcement.

It cites a “deep concern” that entire investigative units have been “gutted” as agents are sent to bolster Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

According to the Democrats, more than 25,000 federal agents across multiple departments have been reassigned since January 2025, including specialists in financial fraud, sanctions enforcement, money laundering and cybercrime.

The authors warn that the shift has already stalled complex investigations and risks emboldening corporate criminals who believe the federal government has in effect “stood down”.

The most dramatic allegation concerns the FBI, where the letter claims nearly a quarter of agents nationwide, and up to 40% in major field offices, have been diverted to support ICE enforcement. Staff who once pursued public corruption cases, cyber-enabled fraud and organised financial crime are now reportedly guarding detention facilities and performing immigration checks.

Other agencies appear similarly affected. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), long regarded as one of the government’s most effective financial crime units, is said to have reassigned 1,700 criminal-investigation staff, compared with just 250 last summer.

Diplomatic Security Service agents normally tasked with cross-border fraud and international corruption cases have likewise been detailed to ICE, while Homeland Security Investigations – historically the home of complex global fraud cases – has, according to one estimate, shifted 90% of its workforce to removal operations.

Even the US Postal Inspection Service, better known for policing mail fraud, has reportedly loaned officers to track down immigration targets.

The letter paints the shift as part of a broader pattern under Trump’s second administration, accusing the White House of a “failure to enforce the law against corporate criminals” and lambasting a string of controversial presidential pardons. Citing congressional analyses, the authors say Trump’s clemency decisions have erased an estimated $1.3bn in fines and restitution owed to taxpayers and victims.

They warn that the combined effect has left ordinary Americans “more vulnerable to fraud schemes, market manipulation, predatory financial practices, and corruption”.

The Democrats cite reports of corruption and financial-fraud cases being delayed or abandoned as investigators are pulled off long-running inquiries. One justice department investigation into a financial services firm has allegedly stalled because key staff were moved to immigration work, while the FBI’s white-collar unit in Houston was reportedly “decimated” in 2025.

They also highlight a dramatic shrinking of the justice department’s public integrity section, responsible for prosecuting corruption among elected officials. The unit has allegedly fallen from 36 lawyers to just two, with staff reassigned to a new “sanctuary cities enforcement” team, where some have complained of having so little to do that they “completed jigsaw puzzles” to pass the time.

The letter asks watchdogs across the federal government to disclose how many personnel have been reassigned since January 2025, how many white-collar cases have been opened, closed or suspended during the period, and how many investigations have been derailed due to staffing shortages.

The Democrats also request details of any whistleblower complaints relating to the transfers and ask what safeguards, if any, remain to ensure statutory duties on financial and corruption cases are still being met.

They conclude with a stark warning that the “safety of American families and the integrity of our financial system” depend on restoring the government’s ability to investigate corporate wrongdoing.

Blumenthal, a senator for Connecticut, said: “The Trump Administration’s diversion of critical resources and personnel away from white-collar crime undermines our country’s ability to combat fraud schemes, market manipulation, and corruption –seriously threatening the security of American families and leaving them vulnerable to predatory practices.

“These staff and resource diversions exemplify this Administration’s reckless decision-making in service of Trump’s brutal, ruthless immigration enforcement agenda. I call on the Inspectors General to fulfill their duty as nonpartisan watchdogs and illuminate this Administration’s abuse of power.”

Goldman, a congressman from New York, added: “Trump is letting white collar criminals run rampant without consequences so he can shift law enforcement to violently attack immigrants – the overwhelming majority of whom have no criminal record.

“Having 25,000 fewer law enforcement personnel investigating and prosecuting white collar crime enables fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and other crimes that hurt the American people. Federal Inspectors General must conduct a thorough investigation of the impact of these diversions.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76f110459216344ed3b8d728a00409faafa09b5/757_0_3174_2539/master/3174.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d24e24bd1ae23641e4d1a50a75b03120",N,,2026-01-23 09:58:12.258239

Although deportation data is limited because the federal government has stopped releasing it, available figures show Trump remains far below his goal of deporting 1 million people a year.

Nevertheless, the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute said in a Jan. 13 report that Trump’s actions have ""dramatically reshaped the machinery of government to target unauthorized immigrants"" and made the climate for immigrants in the U.S. illegally ""more hostile.""

Trump’s promise to prioritize deporting the ""worst of the worst"" has also fallen short. About 74% of the nearly 70,000 immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention as of December, the most recent data available, have no criminal convictions.

Trump’s deportation efforts have been less efficient and more disruptive than those undertaken by other presidents, said University of North Carolina immigration law professor Rick Su.

The deportations have been ""more sensational, intrusive, and focused on ‘low hanging fruit’ than not only past presidents, but even the first Trump administration,"" Su said.

When asked for comment about the deportation operation, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson, said Trump is ""keeping his promise and the American people are appreciative."" DHS did not respond to detailed questions about deportation data.

Here’s what the administration’s first-year efforts have encompassed.

How many people have been deported under Trump?

Unlike previous administrations, the Trump administration has not released monthly detailed deportation data. Instead, the Department of Homeland Security provides updates via press releases.

DHS said in a Dec. 10 press release that 605,000 people had been deported since Jan. 20, 2025, when Trump was inaugurated. But the lack of public data makes it impossible to know what that figure includes. For example, it could include people turned away at the U.S. border or at airports.

University of California Los Angeles researchers, through the Deportation Data Project, collect and publish immigration data received via Freedom of Information Act requests.

The project’s data shows around 350,000 deportations since Jan. 20, 2025. That number does not include people who were not arrested by ICE before being deported, such as people encountered by Border Patrol agents at the U.S. southern border.

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, another research group that uses Freedom of Information Act requests to analyze government data, said that from January through September 2025, the Trump administration deported around 234,000 people.

DHS also cites another data point: people who left the country voluntarily. During Trump’s second term, DHS says, 1.9 million people self-deported.

As with other deportation figures, DHS provided no evidence for this number. In September, Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem said 1.6 million people had voluntarily left the U.S. under Trump. But that number came from one research group’s estimate based on a survey with a small sample size and large margin of error. And the figure represented not only people who might have voluntarily left the U.S., but also people who were deported, died or whose status changed such as by receiving asylum.

How does that compare with other administrations?

Deportations are generally a three-step process, said Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. People are arrested, detained and then deported.

""In the last year, we've seen some parts of that deportation effort increase, while others have stayed the same,"" she said. For example, even though arrests and detentions increased, the administration hasn’t ""reached that increase in deportations that they're looking for.""

Overall, deportations under Trump are lower than deportations under former President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, who immigrant rights advocates dubbed the ""deporter-in-chief."" But the Trump administration’s limited data release makes it difficult to compare.

During the last full fiscal year when Biden was in office, from October 2023 to September 2024, DHS deported about 778,000 people. Biden’s figure includes people deported at the border and people deported inside the U.S. Because of the high number of people who crossed the southern border under Biden, it’s likely that a large share of the deportations happened there.

Obama deported around 962,000 people in fiscal year 2009, from October 2008 to September 2009. As with Biden’s data, that included deportations at the border and inside the U.S.

Vice President JD Vance called any comparison between Obama and Trump an ""entirely fake"" argument.

""In the Obama administration, they counted being turned away at the border as a deportation,"" Vance said in a Jan. 14 post. ""A person would show up, be sent back, and counted as a deportation.""

Vance is correct that deportation data under past presidents did include people sent back at the border. It’s likely that Trump’s data includes those numbers too. That said, under Trump, Border Patrol encounters with people trying to illegally enter the U.S. have significantly dropped, so Trump’s deportation data is likely to include fewer removals at the border.

What actions has Trump taken so far?

Among the most high-profile of Trump’s deportation efforts was his use of the centuries old Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador without due process. The law lets the president detain and deport people from a ""hostile nation or government"" without a hearing when the U.S. is either at war with that country or the country has ""perpetrated, attempted, or threatened"" an invasion against the U.S. It has been used only three times in U.S. history, each during wartime.

Trump has sent large numbers of ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents to carry out wide-ranging operations in cities including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Charlotte, North Carolina and New Orleans.

Each city has had instances of masked federal agents in military gear raiding workplaces, tackling immigrants and bystanders and releasing tear gas in crowds. Federal agents have fatally shot several people, including U.S. citizen Renee Good Jan. 7 in Minneapolis.

The administration’s actions have resulted in several ongoing lawsuits related to agents’ tactics and the legality of deploying National Guard troops.

Trump has also focused on arresting and deporting people at scheduled ICE check-ins or immigration court hearings — people who are following immigration requirements.

What will it take to reach 1 million deportations a year?

Trump has aimed to expand the administration’s immigration enforcement capacity. As part of his signature tax and spending bill, Congress allocated $170 billion in immigration enforcement funding. That includes $45 billion for immigration detention and nearly $30 billion for ICE to increase deportations and hire more immigration agents.

In the past year, DHS has hired 12,000 ICE agents. The rush to onboard more agents has led the agency to cut training for the new hires in half.

The administration has also let federal officials in other agencies enforce immigration law, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service.

Even so, deporting 1 million people a year would require even more effort.

""There would need to be a lot more door-to-door raids and checkpoints, and detention capacity,"" Su said. ""It would also require that all Americans — citizens and otherwise — to be subject to constant surveillance and checking of status.""

WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans narrowly defeated a resolution on Thursday that would have barred President Donald Trump from further military action in Venezuela without the authorization of Congress, days after a similar measure failed in the Senate.

The House voted 215 to 215, a tie that defeated the resolution which ""directs the president to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force.""

The vote was largely along party lines in the narrowly divided chamber, where Trump's Republicans have a 218 to 213 majority. Every Republican except Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky voted against the resolution. Every Democrat voted in favor.

House leaders held the vote open until Republican Representative Wesley Hunt of Texas could return to the Capitol building to cast the decisive no vote. California Republican Tom McClintock did not vote.

The close vote reflected concern in Congress, including from a handful of Republicans, over Trump's foreign policy. There is growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should have the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.

Opponents of the resolution had argued it was unnecessary because the U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela.

""We do not have anybody there in Venezuela fighting,"" Republican Representative Brian Mast of Florida said in the debate before the vote.

Republicans also accused Democrats of introducing the legislation only as an attack on Trump. ""It's about spite,"" Mast, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. ""You will condemn him no matter what he does.""

'FOREVER WAR'

Backers disagreed, saying they wanted to keep Trump from pulling the U.S. into another ""forever war,"" after decades fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.

""The American people want us to lower their cost of living, not enable war,"" said Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the foreign affairs panel.

U.S. forces swept into Caracas on January 3 and captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. A large flotilla of U.S. ships is blockading Venezuela, and has spent months firing on boats allegedly carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump recently said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that ""help is on the way"" and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.

Some Democrats also denounced Trump for leaving most of Maduro's government in place in Caracas and failing to present a plan for Venezuela after his removal.

""The machinery of repression was left in place and the Democratic hopes of Venezuelans are being left behind,"" said Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

Recent votes on war powers have been very close, with the measure failing in the Senate last week only because Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to break a tie.

""If the president is contemplating further military action, then he has a moral and constitutional obligation to come here and get our approval,"" said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a lead sponsor of the House resolution.

The Trump administration argues that Maduro's capture was a very limited judicial operation to bring him to trial in the U.S. on drug charges, not a military operation.

While awaiting his day in immigration court, Barros applied for and was approved for Special Immigration Juvenile Status.
Crayk explained that this is a protected-class designation that must be approved by a Utah judge outside of immigration court.
Because of this, during Tuesday’s hearing, his prior immigration case was dismissed by a judge.
Crayk explained that the dismissal of an immigration case typically indicates the government is no longer seeking to remove an individual.","A Colombian man belonging to a protected class was detained by ICE while leaving immigration court. His case had been dismissed minutes before his detention, and he has no criminal record.

Kevin Alexander Ortiz Barros, 21, entered the United States as a minor. He was detained by Border Patrol agents upon entry before being released on his own recognizance. He then entered the immigration proceedings process.

“They gave him what is known as an alien number and told him to be prepared because he was going to have to litigate his case,” said Adam Crayk, the lawyer now representing Barros.

Barros’ first court date in more than two and a half years was on Jan. 20. While awaiting his day in immigration court, Barros applied for and was approved for Special Immigration Juvenile Status.

Crayk explained that this is a protected-class designation that must be approved by a Utah judge outside of immigration court.

It is granted to people who crossed the border as minors and can prove they were abandoned, neglected, or abused as a child and were fleeing their country for safety.

ICE memo tells agents to enter homes without judge's warrant, whistleblower group says

“In order to get that, you have to prove to a Utah judge, not an immigration judge, a Utah judge, that you’ve been the victim of abuse or the victim of abandonment or the victim of neglect. A Utah judge in the juvenile district court here determined that he qualified and met that standard,” said Crayk.

Once this designation was approved, Barros became eligible for a green card and was waiting for his case to move forward. Because of this, during Tuesday’s hearing, his prior immigration case was dismissed by a judge.

Crayk explained that the dismissal of an immigration case typically indicates the government is no longer seeking to remove an individual.

As Barros was leaving his hearing, ICE agents detained him while he was still inside the courthouse.

“For us it’s alarming because there have been arrests [in court] before, but typically that’s because someone has an open warrant,” said Crayk. “This young man was actively engaged in showing up to court doing the things that he was asked to do.”

Crayk explained that once the case was dismissed, it left the judicial process. Because Barros does not yet have his green card and was no longer in active immigration proceedings, ICE then had jurisdiction to detain him and place him into expedited removal proceedings, despite his Special Immigration Juvenile Status designation.

“The real strategy behind what was done was to take him from what is commonly known as removal proceedings and then they transition him into what is known as expedited removal, which then keeps him in custody,” said Crayk.

During his immigration proceeding, Barros petitioned the judge not to dismiss the case out of fear ICE would detain him in the window between dismissal and when he received his green card. Crayk explained that this process can take years due to backlogs in the immigration system.

“What people also don’t know is that prior to the current administration, we had approximately 60,000 people in immigration proceedings already facing deportation consequences,” said Crayk. “So to say that we were ramping up or we were going to do this mass deportation effort, all that does is put more people into deportation proceedings.”

Crayk said arrests like this have a chilling effect on others who are following court orders and attending their immigration appointments.

“Why would I go to court? They’re going to arrest me anyways. I don’t have the ability to show up to that building and argue my position,” questioned Crayk. “But, I’m telling you that cannot be the mentality.”

Barros’s girlfriend, Jillian Nelson, described him as “kind, gentle, the perfect person.”

She said Barros went through a lot as a child, which led to his Special Immigration Juvenile Status.

“He was abandoned in his childhood. Now, I feel like he’s been abandoned trying to make a better life for himself, trying to provide for himself, truly trying to make his community better, trying to make everyone around him better,” said Nelson. “This is what his community does for him. This is what they do for him.”

Nelson said Barros was incredibly trusting and believed that because he was following the proper legal process to remain in the United States, this would not happen to him.

“He trusted that, after hearing for months that ‘we’re going after criminals, the worst of the worst,’ he didn’t fit that,” said Nelson. “He was 100% confident. He thought he was on the path to getting his green card.”

Nelson said she was able to speak with him briefly while he was being detained. He has also spoken with his roommate and his lawyer. She said they believe he is currently in Evanston, Wyoming, though ICE was unable to confirm his location to her.

2News also contacted ICE, which said Barros was in transit and they could not disclose his destination.

Nelson said she is trying to stay focused on sharing Barros’ story and speaking out on his behalf, but said she is “heartbroken.”

“It honestly makes me embarrassed to be an American. I know that is harsh,” said Nelson. “But, this is the way they’ve treated someone who has done nothing wrong? It’s embarrassing.”

2News reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement via email and phone to confirm the details of Barros’s arrest, including why he was detained. 2News also asked whether ICE is conducting enforcement operations at courthouses in Utah and whether individuals with approved Special Immigration Juvenile Status are subject to arrest.

ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

Crayk said they plan to appeal the immigration judge’s motion to dismiss Barros’ case, which would place him back into deportation proceedings.

Nelson started a fundraising account to support Kevin’s legal fees.
