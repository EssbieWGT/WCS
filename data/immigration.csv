The list has since been pulled from the website, which is usually what agencies do when a documents is totally normal.
Once again, our staff and colleagues appear on a government watch list simply for doing our jobs—defending the constitutional right to seek asylum and holding the government accountable in court.
This watch list appears to be the next disturbing step, with the government treating adversarial legal representation as suspect conduct.
The existence of the list suggests a bureaucratic culture that views immigration lawyers not as officers of the court, but as obstacles to be monitored.","Did you have immigration lawyer watch list on your 2025 authoritarianism BINGO card? If so, congrats! But for everyone else, it’s yet another sad slide into federal control to learn that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) posted what appears to be a covert roster of immigration attorneys buried on its own website.

The list was discovered by attorney Arlene Amarante, who stumbled upon the list while interacting with ICE’s website and found her own name on it. The list has since been pulled from the website, which is usually what agencies do when a documents is totally normal. Now Al Otro Lado, an immigration advocacy group, has filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding to know who created the list, why it existed, and what ICE thought it was doing cataloging attorneys in the first place.

Amarante noticed something else about the list that raised even more concerns, as she told WGNO, “One of the troubling patterns I suppose that I recognized, was that a large number of these practitioners on the list were people of color.”

Which pushes this from bureaucratic weirdness into civil liberties nightmare fuel.

Amarante continued:

“Why does the list exist? Whether it’s an innocent incursion or something that is more intentional or nefarious, we need to get to the bottom of it. It’s troubling because there’s a pattern of threats by the administration — the implication by the government is that offering support to a client is the harm in itself and the names on the list sort of seems to support that.”

Let’s not forget, this administration has not been subtle about its hostility toward lawyers in general and immigration lawyers in particular. In March 2025, the White House issued a memo titled “Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court,” which attacked the act of lawyering, accused immigration attorneys of “unscrupulous” conduct, and directed the Attorney General to take action against lawyers and firms that cross the Trump Administration.

Al Otro Lado didn’t mince words, alleging that the database raises “grave concerns of political targeting and professional intimidation at a time when the administration is openly escalating its attacks on immigrant advocates.”

Andrew Fels, a staff attorney at Al Otro Lado, put it bluntly, “There is no obvious legitimate reason for ICE to be compiling what appears to be a covert roster of immigration lawyers. We are giving ICE an opportunity to publicly explain the watch list’s purpose. Publishing the underlying policies governing the watch list’s creation and inclusion criteria will conclusively resolve this issue.”

Cassandra Lopez, Al Otro Lado’s legal director, framed the situation as a warning to all lawyers. “History may be repeating itself. Once again, our staff and colleagues appear on a government watch list simply for doing our jobs—defending the constitutional right to seek asylum and holding the government accountable in court. The pattern is unmistakable and deeply alarming.”

Lopez’s warning is particularly poignant. Since the start of his second term, Donald Trump has been aggressively attacking lawyers and the very rule of law. This watch list appears to be the next disturbing step, with the government treating adversarial legal representation as suspect conduct. That is a direct inversion of how the legal system is supposed to function.

The existence of the list suggests a bureaucratic culture that views immigration lawyers not as officers of the court, but as obstacles to be monitored. And it should concern anyone who still believes the rule of law depends on lawyers being able to do their jobs without being cataloged (or worse) by the very agencies they’re tasked with challenging.",https://abovethelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/iStock_000024610296Medium-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:57:34.094767

The U.S. Wants to Deport Him.,"Amy Qin, Chris Buckley, www.nytimes.com, amy-qin, chris-buckley",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/us/heng-guan-china-uyghurs-deportation-uganda.html,"In 2020, a Chinese citizen had heard reports about China’s mass detention and surveillance of Uyghurs.
In 2021, Mr. Guan fled to the United States, where he applied for asylum.
“It’s more likely than not for such a highly sensitive person like Mr. Guan that Uganda would send him back to China,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview after the hearing.
In recent days, word of Mr. Guan’s possible deportation set off a furor in the United States.
A source familiar with the case said that Mr. Guan had been arrested during a raid led by the F.B.I.","In 2020, a Chinese citizen had heard reports about China’s mass detention and surveillance of Uyghurs. But he wanted to see if they were true for himself.

So the citizen, Heng Guan, 38, said that he made a hugely risky decision, driving across the country from eastern China to Xinjiang, where he tracked down and secretly shot video of hulking re-education and detention centers mostly holding Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic group. The footage later became rare visual evidence of the scale and forcible nature of China’s clampdown, despite Beijing’s claims that they were voluntary re-education camps.

In 2021, Mr. Guan fled to the United States, where he applied for asylum. Then, this August, as he was living in New York, he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. His supporters and family members feared he might be sent back to China, where human rights activists say he would almost certainly face retribution from the government.

On Monday, after a public outcry, the Trump administration moved to continue deportation proceedings against Mr. Guan, but argued that he should be sent to Uganda, which has close economic ties to China.

At a virtual immigration hearing on Monday, Niles Gerry, a lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security, cited an agreement that allows asylum seekers in the United States who might face persecution in their home country to be removed to what the government calls safe third countries, where they can apply for asylum. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out mass deportations, have moved swiftly to resume third-country deportations after the Supreme Court cleared the practice in July.

Mr. Guan’s case underscores the immense breadth of Mr. Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which is ensnaring even those who would appear to have obvious claims to asylum.

The Chinese government’s wide-scale repression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang — and the extreme lengths to which officials have gone to distort or stymie any information about its efforts in the region — has been the subject of numerous international media investigations and human rights reports in recent years.

“It’s more likely than not for such a highly sensitive person like Mr. Guan that Uganda would send him back to China,” Mr. Chen said in a telephone interview after the hearing.

The Persecution of Uyghurs in China

Card 1 of 6

A History of Tension For decades, the Chinese government has treated the Uyghurs, an ethnic group of about 12 million people in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang, as a troublesome population with separatist tendencies.

Who Are the Uyghurs? The Uyghurs are a Central Asian, mostly Muslim, people, who speak their own Turkic language.

Targeting Muslims China used the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S. and Washington’s subsequent declaration of a “global war on terror” as a pretext to intensify its targeting of Uyghur Muslims.

Changing Xinjiang’s Population Chinese leaders sought to increase Xinjiang’s ethnic Han population through settlement programs, and experts estimate that tens of thousands of Uyghurs have been transferred out of the region for work.

International Condemnation The U.N. and the U.S. have condemned China’s abuses, including the use of internment camps and forced sterilization. The State Department called it genocide.

China’s Crackdown Critics of the government’s treatment of Uyghurs as well as their family members have disappeared or been detained, even abroad.

In recent days, word of Mr. Guan’s possible deportation set off a furor in the United States. An editorial in The Wall Street Journal decried his possible deportation, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democratic congressman from Illinois who is a ranking member of a House select committee on the Chinese Communist Party, called for Mr. Guan’s release.

At Monday’s hearing, Judge Charles Ouslander scheduled another hearing on Mr. Guan’s removal for Jan. 12, citing among several reasons the heightened interest in the case.

Mr. Chen said that he would file a motion on Mr. Guan’s behalf to allow him to stay in the United States and continue with his asylum application. The Department of Homeland Security said, “More information on this case is forthcoming.”

Mr. Guan was detained in August by immigration officials who had been carrying out an action against his landlord in upstate New York, according to Mr. Chen. A source familiar with the case said that Mr. Guan had been arrested during a raid led by the F.B.I. and Homeland Security Investigations, but that the man had no apparent criminal history.

On Monday, Mr. Guan joined the hearing through a video link wearing an orange jumpsuit from a jail in Binghamton, N.Y., where he is currently being held.

The detention centers in Xinjiang were part of a draconian campaign under the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to indoctrinate Uyghurs and root out what the Communist Party said were dangerous ideas fueling resistance and extremist violence. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and members of other mostly Muslim ethnic groups — some estimates said a million or more — were rounded up and held in re-education centers, detention sites or prisons.

During Mr. Trump’s first presidency, the Chinese government’s treatment of Uyghurs emerged as a major source of tension between the two sides. In 2021, on the last full day of Mr. Trump’s first term, the State Department officially declared the Chinese government’s actions in Xinjiang a “genocide.”

And Marco Rubio, then a Republican senator from Florida and now the secretary of state, was among the most outspoken members of Congress on the issue.

Recent reports show that the Chinese government has sent Uyghurs out of Xinjiang to other parts of the country on government work programs that many experts believe are forcible in nature.

The Chinese government, for its part, has rejected any accusations of genocide or human rights violations and has defended its efforts in Xinjiang as necessary to fight against terrorism. Over the years, the government has systematically quashed efforts to question that narrative. It has asserted control through the use of mass surveillance and censorship, heavy policing of the local population as well as intimidation and threats to silence Uyghurs and other critics abroad.

The government has also severely restricted independent media access to the region, which is what made Mr. Guan’s footage — which provided a rare, close-up look at the detention camps detailing their high walls, guard towers and barbed wire — so revelatory.

“It had a big impact for people to see that, wow, this is real stuff happening to people,” said Tahir Imin, a Uyghur activist based in Washington.

Mr. Guan visited Xinjiang as a tourist in 2019, when the detention campaign was at its height, and was shocked by the heavy-handed security he encountered, he told Human Rights in China, a group that is seeking his release from detention.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/15/us/politics/00nat-chinese-deport1/00nat-chinese-deport1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:57:20.269588

Agents involved in courthouse arrest were in Signal chat titled 'Frozen Water'

Mary Spicuzza

Dugan defense attorney Jason Luczak there was a “frozen water” Signal chat among members of the arrest team at the Milwaukee County Courthouse on April 18 as they gathered to arrest an undocumented immigrant.

Luczak asked FBI Special Agent Erin Lucker if they were trying to be funny by calling it the “frozen water” chat, since they were there for a case linked to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE. She noted that she was not part of the chat.

Signal, an encrypted messaging app, has not been approved by the government for classified communications.

Over objections from prosecutors, Luczak asked the agent about other high-profile cases involving federal officials using Signal.

One such case involved Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others, who mistakenly included a magazine editor in a chat about battle plans. The leak sparked fears about the potential mishandling of classified national security information.

Dugan, other judges were offered training on ICE arrests

John Diedrich

Dugan and other Milwaukee County judges were offered training on laws around immigration arrests prior to the April 18 incident in her courtroom, according to an FBI agent's testimony.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Gramling Perez circulated a training in early April from the National Judicial Network's Forum on Human Trafficking and Immigration in State Courts.

Citing emails, FBI agent Erin Lucker testified Gramling Perez told fellow judges she had two takeaways from the training: that ICE can make arrests in public areas of the courthouse, but they not target crime victims or people seeking restraining orders.

Gramling Perez is expected to testify later.

Dugan's attorneys have yet to question Lucker.

Adelman resumed court around 1 p.m. after a 45-minute lunch break. FBI special agent Erin Lucker has resumed her testimony. Prosecutors are focusing on emails regarding guidance on immigration arrests in courthouses.

Before the lunch break, Lucker testified about audio recordings from inside Dugan’s courtroom as well as surveillance video of Dugan interacting with federal agents.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Frohling played recordings from the courtroom, including the moment Dugan was told ICE agents were in the hallway.

He also played surveillance footage from the sixth floor courthouse hallway, which showed Dugan in her judge’s robe confronting the agents. At times it also showed Judge Kristela Cervera, who is expected to testify at the trial.

Frohling asked Lucker about Dugan’s gestures and demeanor as she spoke to agents.

After the break, FBI special agent Erin Lucker will continue her testimony. Prosecutors were in the middle of reviewing emails regarding a training session about ICE enforcement in courthouses and how to minimize impacts on court proceedings. Dugan replied to an email chain of county judges and indicated she would attend.

Lucker has not yet been cross-examined by the defense.

Recordings from Dugan’s courtroom could be pivotal

Mary Spicuzza

Audio recordings from Dugan's courtroom could play a key role in the trial, as they captured what the judge said the day she was accused of helping Flores-Ruiz evade federal officials.

During direct examination from First Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Frohling, FBI special agent Erin Lucker said she was able to adjust the volume on the recordings to better hear conversations from that day.

Dugan's defense team is expected to dispute the details of the off-the-record audio.

Defense stresses confusion among Milwaukee judges on courthouse arrests

Mary Spicuzza and Hope Karnopp

In his opening statement, Dugan defense attorney Steven Biskupic said there was widespread confusion among Milwaukee County judges as federal officials began making immigration arrests shortly after President Donal Trump returned to office in January.

He said that the courthouse arrests led to “anger, confusion” and even paranoia among judges.

“Does this mean Milwaukee County is cooperating with ICE?” he said. “What kind of warrant was ICE using?”

There were also calls for Milwaukee County Chief Judge Carl Ashley to set a policy on courthouse arrests, Biskupic said.

He said there was no intent by Dugan to hide the undocumented immigrant involved in the case. It is a judge's job to balance the interests of all parties, not to serve ICE, Biskupic said.

“There’s no concealment,” he said. “There’s no obstruction.”

Hope Karnopp and Mary Spicuzza

The prosecution's opening statement lasted about 45 minutes and ended just after 10 a.m. Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Alexander painted a picture that what happened in Dugan's courtroom that day was anything but normal.

One of Dugan’s lawyers, former U.S. Attorney Steven Biskupic, began the defense’s opening statement by calling this the ""most important week of [Dugan's] professional life.""

Dugan is ""on trial because the federal government wanted her to act a certain way in respect to ICE,"" Biskupic said.

He stressed that the doorway Flores-Ruiz exited through was close to the public doors of the courtroom — 11 feet and 10 inches away.

""Not even as far as your jury box,” Biskupic said. He added, ""There was a federal agent to the left and to the right.""

Protester says immigration arrests should not take place in courthouses

Vanessa Swales

Michael Pointer Mace, a member of the First Unitarian Society of Milwaukee’s Immigrant Solidarity and Action Committee, said federal immigration agents should not be allowed at sensitive locations, like courthouses, schools and places of worship. The Biden administration previously barred enforcement actions at such locations.

Pointer Mace referenced Illinois, where Gov. JB Pritzker signed a bill banning civil immigration arrests in courthouses. He believes Wisconsin could do the same.

“There are some people who criticize and say it won’t stand up in a court of law. I say let’s find out,” he said.

Dugan ‘not above the law,' prosecutor says

John Diedrich

What Dugan did the day Eduardo Flores-Ruiz appeared before her amounted to creating an escape plan for the undocumented immigrant, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Keith Alexander.

The agents expected Flores-Ruiz to try to get away but they did not expect for Dugan to help him, Alexander said.

“The judicial robe the defendant wore that morning did not put her above the law,” he said.

Dugan and Butz are whispering on the audio about sending undocumented defendant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz out of the courtroom through a hallway and down the stairs. Butz asks Dugan if she should show Flores-Ruiz and his attorney, Mercedes de la Rosa, where to go.

Dugan tells Butz: ""I'll do it. I'll get the heat.""

Alexander acknowledged some of the audio is hard to hear. Jurors are getting a transcript to help them listen, but Alexander said Adelman will remind jurors that the audio is the evidence, not the transcript.

According to Alexander, Dugan told Cervera to keep her robe on and went to approach the agents.

Alexander said Cervera’s “heart sank” when she realized they were confronting agents, but felt she couldn’t challenge Dugan because of her demeanor.

Alexander said what started as a routine morning became anything but after Dugan was told by her clerk that ICE was in the hallway outside her courtroom.

He also played audio clips from Dugan's courtroom. At one point, Dugan's clerk, Alan Freed, can be heard saying there were ""ICE guys in the hallway.""

There were initially technical issues in playing the audio for the jury. Alexander paused multiple times to apologize and said the audio was working before court began.

Nick Ramos, executive director of the political watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, spoke to a large crowd outside the courthouse.

“We’re here today because what’s happening inside this courthouse is bigger than one judge, one case or one community,” Ramos said. “We’re here because the rule of law depends on people being able to walk into a courthouse without fear.”

Also among the speakers was Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the nonprofit immigrant rights organization Voces de la Frontera.

""Entire communities live in fear and anxiety, as they are targeted by unlawful arrests, denied bond and are being moved to out of state jails to prevent families and lawyers from providing support,"" Neumann-Ortiz said. ""Naturally, they question whether our legal system will uphold our rights.""

State Sen. Chris Larson was one of several Milwaukee area politicians, including Rep. Ryan Clancy, who joined the protest. Larson said he believes the trial will go quickly because Dugan “has domain over her courtroom.”

“I think the whole trial shouldn’t exist at all. This is obviously one of the first political prosecutions of Trump’s Justice Department,” he said.

The federal courtroom where Dugan's trial will take place was nearly full shortly before 9 a.m. A mix of media, supporters and attorneys filled the courtroom, which has been described as ""one of the most magnificent courtrooms in America."" Yet to arrive are Dugan and her attorneys, as well as the other prosecutors.

U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman came out briefly to say hello to the observers. Court is expected to begin at 9 a.m.

There is no photography or recording allowed anywhere in the building, but the public can watch from an overflow room in the courthouse.

Dugan trial puts liberal federal judge Lynn Adelman in the spotlight

John Diedrich

As Dugan's obstruction trial nears, attention from across the nation will turn to an ornate courtroom on the third floor of the federal courthouse downtown.

But don't expect the atmosphere in that courtroom to be stuffy. That's not U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman's style.

The former state lawmaker-turned-federal judge is known for his casual approach, shrugging off the pomp that usually comes with his position.

Dugan known as a stern judge and advocate for the poor

Sophie Carson, Daniel Bice, Mary Spicuzza and Chris Ramirez

Before April, Dugan was mostly known as a conscientious and stern Milwaukee County judge, highly involved in the progressive community, driven by her belief in the justice system and her Catholic faith.

Then in April, her arrest by FBI agents thrust her the national spotlight, into the center of a clash between President Donald Trump and the judiciary.

It was a startling development for those who know Dugan, who is established in Milwaukee's legal and nonprofit spheres but had not been a prominent, partisan figure. Courthouse colleagues, city politicians and community leaders alike paint an image of a careful judge and a longtime advocate for the poor who takes pains to follow the letter of the law on the bench — to a point that has slowed down the justice system, and resulted in attorneys often requesting a different judge for their case.

Four key questions the Dugan trial could answer

John Diedrich

Many questions remain unanswered heading into the trial Dec. 15. What does Dugan say happened that day? What did Dugan tell Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to do? Who else saw what happened and how did they react? And will judicial immunity become a part of the case?

Reporter John Diedrich dives into the questions that may or may not get answered in the course of the trial. Read more from his analysis here.

What are the charges against Judge Hannah Dugan?

John Diedrich

Dugan, 66, was indicted on obstructing a federal agency, which is a felony, and concealing an individual to prevent an arrest, a misdemeanor.

The two charges carry a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $350,000 fine, but sentences in cases involving nonviolent offenses typically are much shorter.

The complaint and indictment allege Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz elude federal immigration officials at the Milwaukee County Courthouse after he appeared in her courtroom on April 18. Federal agents chased Flores-Ruiz down outside the courthouse and arrested him.

He has since been deported.

“I’m really, really worried that things will be very bad for him if he is made to return,” Guan’s mother, Luo Yun, told AFP in Chinese.
“If he has a chance to remain in the United States, he’ll at least be safe,” she said.
Guan left China after filming the videos, eventually entering the United States following travels through South America.
He’s still young, and has a long life ahead,” said Guan’s mother.","A Chinese man who left his country after filming at sites of alleged human rights violations against Uyghurs now faces the risk of removal from the United States, according to his lawyer and mother.

Guan Heng, 38, underwent an immigration hearing in New York on Monday after being detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August, his mother said in an interview.

The case could see him taken out of the United States and potentially landing back in China eventually.

“I’m really, really worried that things will be very bad for him if he is made to return,” Guan’s mother, Luo Yun, told AFP in Chinese.

“If he has a chance to remain in the United States, he’ll at least be safe,” she said. “I’m incredibly anxious and upset.”

On Monday, the session ended with a next hearing date set for January, said Guan’s lawyer Chen Chuangchuang.

A judge is expected to consider if Guan should instead be sent to Uganda for his asylum application, as it has agreed to accept people deported from the United States.

But Chen vowed to challenge this attempt, arguing that there is a significant chance Guan could be sent back to China from there.

A statement by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission warned on Friday on Twitter/X that Guan “would likely be persecuted” if he returned to China.

“He should be given every opportunity to stay in a place of refuge,” the statement added.

In late 2021, Guan had published a 20-minute video online, detailing his travel around the north-western Xinjiang region in China.

He was visiting places identified by a BuzzFeed investigation as detention facilities for Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities – or likely sites for such centers.

Beijing has been accused of detaining more than a million Uyghurs and other Muslims since 2017, part of a campaign that the United Nations previously said could constitute “crimes against humanity”.

China vehemently denies these allegations, saying its policies have rooted out extremism in Xinjiang and boosted economic development.

Guan left China after filming the videos, eventually entering the United States following travels through South America.

Around that time, he told his mother he did not plan to return to China.

“As for the contents of the clips that he later posted – I didn’t know about them,” his mother said.

The pair stayed in touch, and she recalls receiving a text in August from a friend of Guan’s, informing her that he had been detained during an operation by ICE.

When she managed to contact him, Luo said, “his emotional state was one of extreme panic and breakdown.”

She added that her family members in mainland China have also been questioned by authorities about their ties to Guan, shortly after he published his video.

“I’m heartbroken,” she said. “I’m not only crying for my child, but the situation that our family is facing.”

Guan’s supporters say he is being held in a Broome County facility in upstate New York. His name appears on an online page of ICE detainees.

“I just want my child to be well. He’s still young, and has a long life ahead,” said Guan’s mother.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c383590b4f0e0f0b158a5bb1b06add90241d3747/322_0_3211_2569/master/3211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b3dbdc893071684e98ef042bca7848d7",N,,2025-12-15 15:56:48.109624

Or do they want to see it happening in Bucks county?” said Ceisler, whose term starts in January.
In the lower part of Bucks county, in close proximity to Philadelphia, most immigrants are of Latin American descent.
The lower part of Bucks county is also home to thousands of Ukrainians who fled the Russian invasion in 2022.","Only 40 miles north of Philadelphia, Bucks county has gained a reputation as the “swingiest” county in the swing state of Pennsylvania and one of the most pivotal political bellwethers in the country.

Party registration in the county is almost evenly split among Democrats and Republicans. Joe Biden won it in 2020, Donald Trump triumphed there in 2024. November’s elections there were local – but a hot race for county sheriff drew much wider attention as a microcosm for America’s contentious debate around immigration policy – and the result signaled a shake-up in how the county approaches enforcement.

In the second Trump administration, incumbent sheriff Frederick Harran, a Republican, had joined many other conservative law enforcement officials across the nation and signed an agreement to work with the federal Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agency.

Those controversial arrangements, known as 287 (g) agreements, allow local and state officials to cooperate on enforcing federal immigration law to varying degrees.

The 287(g) so-called Task Force Model that Harran, 61, signed up to granted his officers the authority to question people they encountered about their immigration status and to carry out immigration-related arrests during traffic stops.

But the ties are set to be short-lived.

Danny Ceisler, a 33-year-old army veteran who worked at the Pentagon and for Pennsylvania Democratic governor Josh Shapiro’s administration, stood against Harran as a Democrat for sheriff. In his campaign, he pledged to terminate the partnership with ICE.

And Ceisler won, not even narrowly. His 23,000 extra votes was an 11% victory over Harran, who had been a law enforcement officer for more than three decades.

“I felt the office was prioritizing some kind of Trumpian politics and not the actual public safety needs of the county,” Ceisler said in an interview with the Guardian last month in Bristol, a township in south-eastern Bucks county.

He went on: “There’s convincing evidence to show that when local law enforcement starts performing immigration enforcement, it hurts public safety. First you take deputies away from their core responsibilities in order to do ICE work. But more importantly, you terrify immigrant communities who [you] rely on to report crime.”

In Bucks county, home to more than half a million people, 70,000 of them foreign-born, the agreement between the outgoing leadership and federal immigration enforcement was met with some strong criticism. Community advocates rallied outside the county’s courthouse and the county’s commissioners argued that Harran had no authority to sign the agreement.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Pennsylvania also filed a lawsuit against Harran, alleging that such 287(g) agreements “open the door to harmful and insidious racial profiling” and “other civil rights violations”.

In October, however, a ruling upheld the agreement between the Bucks county sheriff’s office and ICE. Then just a few weeks later, Harran was ousted by voters.

“I don’t regret doing it,” Harran said when asked about the agreement with ICE. “I think some people got caught in the national hysteria, a lot of people that don’t like Donald Trump and they can’t see the forest through the trees and that’s a shame because with the new sheriff you’re going to have a lot of problems in Bucks county,” he added.

But Ceisler’s victory was not an isolated case in the recent election and instead reflected a broader momentum for Democrats in Bucks county. Voters there elected their first Democratic party district attorney since 1965. In an area where certain books were banned and pride flags in classrooms were forbidden by the authorities, Democrats secured a majority on the school district board, saying people were becoming fatigued with the distracting so-called culture wars, local media reported. The Democratic victories were notable in a congressional district that has been represented by Republican congressman Brian Fitzpatrick since 2017.

And the mini blue wave in the county rippled out from other waves, such as Abigail Spanberger flipping the governorship of Virginia as a moderate Democrat, Mikie Sherrill winning New Jersey’s governor office easily in the end and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani making history as the first Muslim man elected mayor of New York City.

“People were choosing between: do they like what Donald Trump is doing with ICE? Or do they want to see it happening in Bucks county?” said Ceisler, whose term starts in January.

He added: “And in a county that Donald Trump won just a year ago, we are now sending a message to law enforcement all over the country that partnering with ICE is a losing proposition.”

Harran said the Task Force Model “wasn’t fully implemented” in Bucks county while he waited for the resolution of the lawsuit against him. He also said that 17 of his officers “have received training” through the program already. When asked how many immigrants have been detained by officers who received the training, Harran said the number was “very minimal” but did not specify.

While Ceisler reiterated he can’t stop ICE from operating in Bucks county once he becomes sheriff, he said he can keep those 17 officers trained through the Task Force Model from participating in immigration work.

The 287 (g) program was established by Congress in 1996 under Bill Clinton and it was largely discontinued by the Obama administration in 2012 due to concerns about racial profiling following a federal investigation into the Maricopa county sheriff’s office in Arizona.

The Trump administration revived the Task Force Model in January and more than 600 agreements have been signed with local or state agencies in 34 states. In Pennsylvania alone, 49 agencies have signed an agreement with ICE, according to federal data.

Most immigrants in Bucks county live in concentrated areas throughout the region, according to Heidi Roux, director of The Welcome Project, an organization that works closely with vulnerable communities across the state.

In the lower part of Bucks county, in close proximity to Philadelphia, most immigrants are of Latin American descent. Trump visited the area for a staged campaign event in 2024, during which he made fries and served pre-screened customers at a drive-through McDonald’s window in Feasterville. The lower part of Bucks county is also home to thousands of Ukrainians who fled the Russian invasion in 2022.

The county seat, Doylestown, is in the county’s central region, where the immigrant community is mixed between Asian and Latino. Despite increasing urbanization, the upper part of Bucks county is still a vibrant farming community that heavily depends on the immigrant labor force.

“When the 287 (g) program [Task Force Model] was signed, the immigrant community interpreted it as ‘you don’t trust law enforcement, you don’t call law enforcement,’” said Roux, inside the Margaret Grundy memorial library in Bristol.

“We have heard of immigrants who are domestic violence victims who are afraid to call the police because there is fear that they might end up being deported, too. Imagine you have to consider your physical safety as much as your immigration status and that’s why calling 911 is sometimes now an act of extreme courage,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10ab28062ca0cfb4094064cc1966e6fce53e5184/0_306_1179_943/master/1179.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6602d44db8b3156f60ae4b7731d83267",N,,2025-12-15 14:56:51.696088

Kris Kobach announced Wednesday he voluntarily dismissed the lawsuit, but health care for certain immigrants was stripped away more than three months ago when President Donald Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule that offered health care plans to people who migrated to the U.S. as children.

The roughly 10,000 immigrants in the United States under Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals who purchased health insurance from the marketplace were removed from their plans by Oct. 1. An estimated 525,000 people are in the U.S. under DACA.

Kobach initially filed the lawsuit involving 18 other states after the Biden administration adopted rules in November 2024 enabling DACA participants to enroll in public health insurance plans, which wasn't previously possible under the Affordable Care Act. Kobach argued in court against the policies, winning a preliminary injunction.

""This is a big win for the rule of law,"" Kobach said in a Wednesday announcement. ""Congress never intended that illegal aliens should receive Obamacare benefits.""

The lawsuit is one piece of Kobach's broad range of anti-immigration efforts. He helped Kansas earlier this year become one of the first states in the country to deputize state law enforcement agents to enforce immigration law.

He is party to another lawsuit that seeks to exclude certain immigrants from U.S. Census counts. Kobach argued counting people in the country without particular documentation or with temporary visas skews congressional district apportionment. The U.S. Constitution mandates a count of ""the whole number of persons in each state"" every 10 years.

He also spent years defending anti-immigration ordinances on behalf of cities, and, as a law professor, he helped craft controversial legislation in Arizona.

Authorities say Dugan led him out through a back door that led to a public corridor after she told immigration agents to speak with the chief judge about trying to arrest people at the courthouse.

“They did not expect a judge, sworn to uphold the law, would divide their arrest team and impede their efforts to do their jobs,” Alexander told the jury.

He said Dugan informed her court reporter that she “would take the heat” for helping Flores-Ruiz.

The government’s case is expected to run through at least Thursday, with roughly two dozen witnesses lined up to testify. Dugan faces up to six years in prison if convicted on both counts.

She has argued that she was following courthouse protocols on immigration arrests and wasn’t trying to disrupt agents. Her lawyer says Chief Judge Carl Ashley had sent out a draft policy that barred immigration agents from executing certain warrants in nonpublic areas and required court personnel to refer agents to a supervisor.

Agents followed Flores-Ruiz outside the building and arrested him after a foot chase. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in November that he had been deported after he pleaded no contest in the local battery case and was sentenced to time served.

Ahead of the trial, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman declined to dismiss the charges, saying there was no firmly established immunity for Dugan.

Democrats say Trump is looking to make an example of Dugan to blunt judicial opposition to immigration arrests. Dugan told police she and her family found threatening flyers at their homes this spring. The administration has branded her an activist judge.

DHS “Worst of the Worst” immigrants arrested

DHS reports 1,175 arrests in Florida over the past 11 months — about 6% of the state's 20,000 immigration arrests during the same time.

ICE data show about one-third of those arrested since the start of the Trump administration had no criminal history, and 88% of those detained by Customs and Border Patrol had no prior or pending criminal charges, according to DHS data from September to October.

The Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis administrations have said immigration raids target gang members and criminals. However, 28 of the nearly 5,000 Florida ""encounters"" since Aug. 1 — defined as arrests, contacts in jail, or migrants who were not arrested — were gang-related, according to the State Board of Immigration Enforcement.

That's less than 1%. Of the 27 Treasure Coast arrests DHS listed on its ""worst"" list, one was gang-affiliated.

Immigrants, especially undocumented migrants, are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, according to the National Institute of Justice. A Cambridge study also found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than U.S.-born white men.

Here are some articles about that:","https://www.tcpalm.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/14/PASH/87270225007-2243882378.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-15 13:56:45.939091

Some wore clerical collars and ministers’ stoles. Many were older, with gray hair sticking out from under winter hats. After songs and speeches, the crowd turned to face the building for a minute of silent prayer.

The Sisters of St. Joseph, Pax Christi and Casa San Jose have been hosting prayer vigils outside Pittsburgh’s ICE facility every Friday morning since August. They invited religious leaders from different faiths across the city, and plan to continue their weekly demonstrations for as long as they can.

“It has grown into such a supportive community, a very hopeful moment for me in my week,” said Sister Janice Vanderneck of the Sisters of St. Joseph.

On this particular Friday, Vanderneck prayed for her longtime friend who was arrested by ICE agents just a week before. He’s a hard worker, she said, who went to church. His kids are American citizens who attended Catholic schools.

The crowd prayed for the people who may be detained inside the Pittsburgh facility as they await transport to a nearby jail or to ICE’s Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Clearfield County. They prayed for the ICE officers, too.

“We’re praying for our country to experience a transformation,” Vanderneck said.

Sisters and nuns don’t have the kind of political authority that bishops or priests hold within the church. But local sisters said their unique position comes with more freedom to protest, and they’ve found that their presence is a powerful endorsement.

“We have no authority — just moral authority, and that we have in spades,” Vanderneck said.

Catholic sisters have long held influence in Pittsburgh communities, having built many of its hospitals, schools and other institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Today, nuns and sisters are a dwindling force, but President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has prompted many to speak out and weigh how the politics of the church and the state intersect with their changing ministries.

Drawn to ‘the margins’

Vanderneck walked up a concrete path toward an unmarked back door. She knocked, and when her colleagues welcomed her inside she greeted them with “gracias” and “buenos días.”

Vanderneck is the founder of Casa San Jose, a local Latino immigrant support organization. One November morning, she strode into a windowless room, where a handful of people chattered in Spanish and English and waved at her. After Trump’s return to office, she said the staff moved operations from their Beechview home base to an undisclosed location for fear that ICE agents would target their patrons.

The 75-year-old belongs to the Sisters of St. Joseph, an international congregation of vowed Catholic women with a community in Baden. Through her ministry as a sister, Vanderneck began working with Latino immigrants in Pittsburgh in 2003. She said she quickly learned what life was like for undocumented people facing a lack of resources and attempting to navigate a “wasteland of identity.”

She founded Casa San Jose in 2013 because, as a Spanish speaker, local Latino immigrants often sought her help. At first, it was only Vanderneck and one volunteer working out of a Lutheran church basement. Now, the organization has become an influential immigrant support network, serving families across Pittsburgh.

In January, Casa San Jose began offering new services for those immigrant families as the Trump administration called for mass deportations, spurring ICE raids that have led even documented people to be detained.

“They’re rounding up people that have status or even citizenship,” Vanderneck said. “They’re rounding up people based on what we should not believe in, what we say we don’t believe in in this country — and that is profiling people because of how they look or what they sound like.”

A representative for ICE denied Vanderneck’s claims that the agency profiles detainees based on their appearance, and said ICE only targets individuals who are “illegally in the U.S.”

“Allegations that DHS law enforcement engages in ‘racial profiling’ are reckless and categorically FALSE,” an ICE spokesperson wrote in response to questions from Public Source, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. “ICE law enforcement officers are already facing a more than 1,170% increase in assaults against them. What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S. — NOT their skin color, race or ethnicity.”

Casa San Jose created a rapid response team of volunteers who show up to ICE raids, record officer actions and get the names of people who are detained. They’ve raised money for bail bonds and held clinics to help parents draw up paperwork protecting their children, should they be arrested and separated.

Many Catholics feel their faith compels them to care about immigration issues as part of Catholic Social Teaching. Vanderneck cited a 2003 pastoral letter, a joint statement from the Catholic bishops of the U.S. and Mexico, called “Strangers No Longer.” She said the letter inspired her and other Catholics to view immigration reform as a moral issue, not just a political one.

On Nov. 12, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement urging the American public to “recognize the fundamental dignity of all persons, including immigrants.” The next day, Pittsburgh’s Bishop Mark Eckman released his own statement echoing the USCCB.

Still, there’s division among Catholics about the line between faith and politics.

Vanderneck recently spoke to a local parish about Casa San Jose’s work. While she talked, she watched a man’s face turn red. Later, he told a group of parishioners he was stunned she could advocate for the protection of people who entered the country illegally.

“He represents a large number of Catholics,” Vanderneck said. “I know that, and we know that. The bishops even know that when they speak out … they’re going to get pushback. And they do.”

Other Pittsburgh women’s congregations have been involved in advocacy, too. The Sisters of Mercy, a congregation with deep history in Pittsburgh, attended a No Kings protest in October on Fifth Avenue. The sisters, many of whom are in their 80s, packed their signs in a trunk and drove from their convent at Carlow University.

Sister Cynthia Serjak said she doesn’t think of the church itself as a political instrument.

“Although, I think it’s caught up in a lot of difficult stuff right now,” she said. “But I think we’re not afraid to speak about that.”

Serjak joined the Sisters of Mercy in 1966 when she was 18. In those days, she said, nuns and sisters typically didn’t stray from tradition — or the opinions of a bishop. But times have changed, Serjak said.

“Thank God the Sisters of Mercy have always been open to what’s happening in the world,” Serjak said. “We’re so oriented to tending to those who get pushed to the margins that we have to pay attention, we have to get involved.”

Sisters central to Pittsburgh higher ed, health care

Pittsburgh’s Catholic diocese lists 24 women’s religious communities. Some have local roots dating back hundreds of years.

In 1843, seven women immigrated from Ireland to establish the first Sisters of Mercy convent in the U.S. After five weeks at sea and 60 hours crossing the Allegheny Mountains in a stagecoach, the women arrived in Pittsburgh to find a growing industrial hub with a population plagued by illness, poverty and little access to education.

Catholic sisters built many of the city’s first schools, like Saint Mary’s Academy, established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1844. At their peak in the 1960s, there were more than 13,000 Catholic schools, many staffed by nuns, nationwide.

And in 1847, the Sisters of Mercy opened the world’s first Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh. Nuns and sisters established what is now Carlow University in 1929, and La Roche University in 1963, and they are also active at Duquesne University, founded by a male religious order, the Holy Ghost Fathers.

Sister Mary Pellegrino of the Sisters of St. Joseph said for the most part, religious women aren’t working in classrooms or founding hospitals and colleges anymore.

“Those institutions are built,” she said.

Maintaining those institutions became more difficult as sisters aged and their numbers dwindled. The population of Catholic nuns and sisters in the U.S. reached an all-time high in 1965, peaking around 180,000, according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA). Since then, that number has shrunk to fewer than 40,000 in 2022.

Why are fewer young women pursuing religious life today? Some sisters credited the rise in career opportunities and other freedoms for women over the last half century. Others said fewer women became nuns after the sweeping church reforms of Vatican II, when lay people, including women, were given more opportunities to lead within the church.

Vanderneck said she thinks the U.S. has become particularly secular and glorifies independence and financial success above all else. Pellegrino agreed, and said because sisters spend their lives in community, owning nothing and sharing everything, their existence clashes with American capitalist values.

“I actually see religious life right now as more counter-cultural than I have ever seen it,” Pellegrino said.

Nuns and sisters today have had to alter their ministries since taking their vows. Pellegrino said sisters have increasingly found that their influence lies not in their institutions but in their “social capital.” For a significant portion of U.S. women’s congregations today, modern ministry is about bringing “a moral voice into the public square,” she said.

‘Maybe not for us, but after us’: The future of Catholic women’s religious life

The average age of nuns and sisters in the U.S. is reportedly 80, and fewer than 1% are younger than 30. In 2023, CARA reported that 81% of American sisters are 70 or older.

Nuns and sisters in Pittsburgh mirror those demographics. Six local orders responded to interview requests, and none had (or knew of) members younger than 30 in the Pittsburgh area. Serjak told Public Source that, of the 30 women living in her Downtown convent, one is in her 60s, three are in their 70s and the remaining women are in their 80s or 90s. One member will be 100 in January. Pellegrino, 62, said she’s among the youngest in her community.

The absence of young members has nuns and sisters grappling with what the next generation will look like.

In October, Serjak attended a meeting of Sisters of Mercy from across the country, where, amid discussions of their future, they talked about selling property they can’t maintain because “there just aren’t as many of us anymore.”

Many older sisters today, like Serjak and Sister Sheila Carney, joined the vocation as young women, or even teenagers, and have spent practically their entire lives with the women in their religious orders.

But without younger women to care for them, it becomes more difficult for sisters to age together and in place. Serjak said when sisters are moved into nursing homes or hospitals, staff tend to defer to a woman’s blood relatives to make medical decisions, despite her fellow sisters having durable power of attorney. Normally, if a sister is dying, Serjak said they like to be with her, pray and sing over her in her final moments. People outside of the vocation aren’t used to that, she said.

“Our life, which we have always controlled entirely, is now beginning to be not necessarily controlled, but pretty much affected by other people who don’t necessarily understand who we are,” Serjak said. “So when you look at the statistics, I don’t have any guarantee where I’m going to be or who’s going to be taking care of me should I need care. And that feels scary.”

Pellegrino works with a consulting practice that helps aging religious communities prepare for their futures and support their members.

She noted that, while aging sisters might feel grief and fear about their futures, she thinks the concern that religious life will cease to exist is off base. She pointed out that today’s nun population is comparable to the numbers in the early 20th century, before the surge during the ‘60s that still lives in the American consciousness.

Religious life isn’t experiencing a death, she said, but an evolution. She’s watched modern women’s congregations become smaller and more focused on relationships and social justice. But Pellegrino said she can’t speak to what could unfold beyond that.

“There’s something going away, but there’s also something emerging,” she said.

Regardless of what religious life looks like going forward, Serjak and Carney, 80, believe the core mission of their congregation — mercy — will live on. For now, they’ll continue to pray, protest and advocate for compassion.

“We understand that God is in this mess, and we have a confidence that in the end, things will work out — maybe not for us, but after us,” Serjak said. “So you do what you can while you can.”

Other European leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, President Emmanuel Macron of France and Secretary General Mark Rutte of NATO, were scheduled to join Mr. Zelensky on Monday evening. Russia was not expected to send representatives.

The Americans and Europeans are scrambling to overcome wide divides over what concessions Ukraine should make to persuade Russia to agree to a cease-fire. The United States has proposed that Ukraine cede some territory that Russia has yet to occupy. Ukraine has said it will not give up more land, a position largely backed by European leaders, who are wary of rewarding Russia for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Ukraine raised hopes of a compromise on Sunday when Mr. Zelensky reiterated that Kyiv would suspend its goal of joining NATO, at least for now. In return, Mr. Zelensky said, Ukraine would need strong guarantees that the United States would step in if Russia attacked again.

Mr. Zelensky also met on Monday with Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, and Julia Klöckner, speaker of the German Parliament, and was expected to also attend a gathering about Ukrainian-German economic ties.

Leaders from Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, as well as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, were all scheduled to arrive in Berlin by Monday evening for a dinner at the chancellery with Mr. Merz, Mr. Starmer, Mr. Macron and Mr. Rutte.

The diplomatic gathering was put together hastily by German, Ukrainian and U.S. officials as pressure mounts to find a compromise to end the war. Mr. Trump said during his presidential campaign that he could stop the fighting in 24 hours, but the reality has proved different.

On Sunday, after receiving both the Ukrainian and U.S. delegations, Mr. Merz posted on social media: “We want lasting peace in Ukraine. Difficult questions lie ahead, but we are determined to move forward.”

The flurry of diplomatic activity comes after American negotiators presented a 28-point peace plan last month that Ukrainians dismissed as being too aligned with Russian interests. European leaders did not dismiss that plan outright, but they have supported Ukraine’s coming up with a counterproposal in which Kyiv would hold onto the territory it currently controls and receive security guarantees from Washington.

European leaders, especially Mr. Merz, Mr. Macron and Mr. Starmer, have been trying to bolster Kyiv’s position and involve themselves in the negotiations because the outcome affects Europe’s broader security as well as Ukraine’s.

Highlighting broader European efforts to restrict Russia and its allies, the European Union announced on Monday that it had sanctioned several people and companies involved in Russian oil sales. The bloc also said that it had made it easier to place sanctions on Belarus, a key ally of Russia.

The committee said the department’s leadership had encouraged categorizing certain cases of assaults with deadly weapons and burglaries as less serious charges, such as “endangerment with a firearm” and unlawful entry, citing excerpts from interviews with the district commanders. Those lesser categories were excluded from the daily crime statistics reported out to the public, the report said.

The committee also interviewed an eighth commander who was put on leave this year as the Metropolitan Police Department in D.C. investigated alleged altering of crime statistics.

Ms. Smith said last week that she was resigning as police chief at the end of the month, citing a desire to spend more time with her family. She said in an interview with a local Fox affiliate that she had not encouraged the manipulation of crime statistics and denied there was a problem. In any cases of manipulated data, “when it’s brought to my attention, we will hold those members accountable,” she said.

The Justice Department and the president have also heavily criticized Ms. Smith and the Metropolitan Police Department and claimed its data was altered. The accusations came as Mr. Trump faced resistance in declaring a crime emergency in the capital city in August.

His critics cited the trend of decreasing violent crime numbers in Washington and other major cities in recent years to question the president’s rationale for taking over D.C.’s police department and deploying about 2,000 National Guard troops. Mr. Trump called Washington’s crime statistics “phony” and suggested there was a conspiracy, despite having cited those numbers earlier to take credit for the city’s drop in violent crimes.

Representative James R. Comer, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Oversight Committee, said in a statement that Ms. Smith had “coerced staff to report artificially low crime data and cultivated a culture of fear to achieve her agenda.” He suggested that Ms. Smith’s resignation “should not be seen as a voluntary choice” but the result of her “manipulating crime statistics.”

Experts have said that while it is possible the city underreports some crime data on its public website, its official reports to the F.B.I. are still reliable and do show a decline in violent crime.

Jeff Asher, a national crime data analyst, said in an interview that the Republican-led report raised questions that the Police Department might be underreporting certain cases of crime. He said it fell short, however, of providing clear evidence of deliberate or widespread underreporting.

Mr. Asher said his own analysis of Washington’s crime data showed a mismatch between the violent crime numbers that its police department reported to the F.B.I. and the department’s public data. But the overall trend of a decline in violent crime since 2023 in Washington still holds true in the face of some discrepancies, he said.

The Metropolitan Police Department “would be well served to figure out why the underreporting is happening and what they can do to fix it,” Mr. Asher said. “But the decline is clear, well-defined and based on multiple sources.”

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser of Washington praised Ms. Smith and the city’s police officers in an emailed statement for a “precipitous decline in crime” and “their hard work and dedication.”

“I thank Chief Smith for her commitment to the safety of D.C. residents and for holding the Metropolitan Police Department to an exacting standard, and I expect no less from our next chief of police,” Ms. Bowser said. The Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

In recent months, Republican lawmakers have tried to impose stricter federal control over the capital city, especially on law enforcement, with the support of some moderate Democrats.

House lawmakers passed bills that would nullify local Washington laws such as those that gave more lenient sentencing to people younger than 25 and allowed cashless bail. Unlike other cities, the District of Columbia is subject to significant federal oversight that allows Congress to review its legislation and rewrite its laws.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Washington is also investigating whether city police officials falsified crime data, which has prompted criticism that the administration is using the levers of the criminal justice system to pursue the president’s political opponents.

Sara Guerrero, a spokeswoman for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, said her Republican colleagues in the panel were “trying to use this investigation to justify President Trump’s authoritarian power grab.”

“Democrats remain committed to reducing crime by supporting cities in hiring more police and by advancing proven policies like investing in communities and combating gun violence,” she said.

The decision by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit effectively blocked the Trump administration from using the remaining 100 or so National Guard troops in California — at least, for the moment.

But the appellate judges temporarily blocked a key part of the order by District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer that would have forced the Trump administration to return control of the troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who ordinarily commands them.

California officials celebrated the move as a partial victory in a battle that has dragged on for months.

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California. Let me repeat: For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement.

“California did not ask to be a testing ground for the president’s militarized vision of America,” he added. “There is no crisis to justify the National Guard’s continued presence, and we look forward to continuing to prove that in court.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles. State and local officials objected strenuously to the move, calling it an inflammatory overreaction to scattered demonstrations that were being ably handled by local and state law enforcement agencies.

Mr. Newsom sued over the initial deployment, but the administration argued that the troops were responding to an emergency and were needed to protect federal agents and property. In June, the Ninth Circuit ruled that conditions in Los Angeles were sufficient for Mr. Trump to take control of the state’s National Guard and direct troops to provide protection during the enforcement of immigration laws.

The administration began gradually drawing down the number of federalized troops in July as public condemnation grew and protests abated. As of last month, about 300 California National Guard members remained under the president’s command, and most were in the process of being released to their usual duties, which generally involve part-time service controlled by the state.

State officials said on Friday that the California deployment consisted of about 100 troops on federal orders that were scheduled to last into February. Last week, Judge Breyer ruled that any emergency the president might have cited as justification for the deployment had long since ended, and that all remaining troops should be released from federal orders and returned to the governor’s command.

Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the law required an emergency only at the time the president decided to federalize National Guard troops, after which he could extend the deployment as long as he deemed necessary. They also said that troops were still needed to protect federal workers from threats stemming from immigration raids that have been intensely unpopular in immigrant-heavy Southern California.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/15/multimedia/15trump-news-promo-noon-cbgz/15trump-news-promo-noon-cbgz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:57:36.201031

Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. when she was 12 after having fled Somalia’s civil war, also accused ICE of “racially profiling” her community.

An overwhelming majority of U.S. adults are satisfied with their health insurance coverage overall, including most older Americans and those on Medicare and Medicaid, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.

But there is an undercurrent of frustration in the findings, too, with nearly one-quarter of respondents saying they’d been denied coverage or faced a delay from their insurance in the last two years.

Overall, 82% of Americans said they’re satisfied with their health care coverage, including a third who said they are very satisfied with their current coverage. The group that reported being the most satisfied were older adults, with 9 in 10 Americans over 65 years old saying they were satisfied. And 42% in that age group reported being “very satisfied.”

Trump’s approval rating remains steadily underwater among adults as he nears the end of his first year back in the White House, and he has lost some ground among his “Make America Great Again” base, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.

Trump’s approval has inched down in 2025 amid concern about the economy, while Americans remain worried about inflation and costs after Trump’s campaign promises to ease those anxieties. Respondents’ concerns were apparent in everyday spending decisions like grocery shopping, holiday spending and more, the poll shows.

Other high-profile Trump decisions, including his handling of the controversy over the so-called Jeffrey Epstein files, have scored negatively with Americans. Trump initially opposed a congressional move to force the release of the files before relenting to pressure from both parties last month.

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it

When a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck on March 28 in Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, 20-year-old Kyi Noo Khin watched the walls of her family home crack and crumble. For a moment, she thought she might lose everything.

In June, while still recovering from the aftermath of the quake, another kind of shock struck her.

“It was unexpected, honestly,” Noo Khin said of the Trump administration’s ban on visas from 12 countries, including Myanmar. “I was waiting for my visa interview appointment when the announcement came out.”

In December 2024, Noo Khin was accepted by Kenyon College in Ohio through early decision, a process that allows high school students to apply to a college early, and if accepted, serves as a binding commitment to attend. She was overjoyed that she was accepted and had already applied for a student visa when she heard the news from the Trump administration. Now, her years of study and thousands of dollars invested in U.S. college applications, standardized tests, school deposit and visa fees, and other costs all seem wasted.

“All I needed was visa approval; only one final step left,” she said in an email interview with Prism, describing the emotional damage caused by the ban.

“One moment I was dreaming about how I’m gonna decorate my college dorm room, then next, I was staring at my messy room—still haven’t cleaned the dribbles and dust resulting from the earthquake that took place on March 28—just feeling numb, after hearing the news about the visa ban,” she said. “Like everyone else affected by the earthquake, the family was devastated. In those dark moments, my secured position to go to the States in August had been a good thing we could still look forward to.”

After the Trump administration’s June 9 announcement, Myanmar’s U.S. Embassy posted a statement on its website warning nationals from newly banned countries that while they could still submit visa applications and attend scheduled interviews, “they may be determined to be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States.”

For Noo Khin, the ban didn’t just close a border—it slammed shut a door she spent years trying to open.

Myanmar is still reeling from a 2021 military coup that overthrew the country’s democratically elected government and ignited an ongoing civil war. The U.S. visa ban adds yet another burden to a country already on its knees as pro-democracy fighters attempt to wrest control from the military-installed provisional government, led by Min Aung Hlaing.

Su Chit, director and founder of Royal Suchit, a Yangon-based college consulting firm, told Prism that the demand for student visas surged after the coup, overwhelming the U.S. Embassy in Myanmar and creating monthslong waitlists for interviews—waitlists that now lead to nowhere.

Severed lifeline

Trump’s Proclamation 10949 is an expansive visa ban affecting Afghanistan, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela facing partial visa restrictions. The executive order also suspended most categories of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas for citizens of these nations.

Among them, Myanmar stands out—not for national security concerns or geopolitical aggression, but for alleged administrative noncompliance.

The White House cited high visa overstay rates and noncooperation with deportations as justification for including Myanmar on the list of banned countries. However, before the ban, students from Myanmar applying for U.S. visas underwent rigorous interviews at the U.S. Embassy to demonstrate their financial resources, academic readiness, and intent to return home. Applicants were also required to provide bank statements, financial affidavits, and property deeds to show that they could afford tuition and living expenses. They also had to prove English-language proficiency and strong academic credentials.

The Trump administration’s ban sent ripples through Myanmar communities in the U.S. and abroad, and has drawn criticism for its humanitarian impact.

According to recent data, 3,744 Myanmar students are enrolled in U.S. institutions for the 2025-2026 academic year—a small number compared to other countries, but a sharp increase from 2020-2021 when just 1,698 Myanmar students were enrolled in American colleges. Effectively, the Trump administration’s ban prohibits Myanmar students from studying abroad in the U.S. Meanwhile, the country’s education system remains crippled by decades of military misrule. National exams are unreliable, university degrees carry little value, and since the 2021 coup, the situation in Myanmar has only worsened.

The junta has bombed schools, killed students, and imposed mandatory military conscription. There are also widespread reports of the military detaining young people in the streets and releasing them only after their families pay hefty bribes.

Noo Khin told Prism that the country’s political landscape and new conscription law are among the primary reasons she pursued her education overseas.

“Many youths have to leave to avoid being forcefully drafted to serve or to get killed for the betterment of the military junta,” she said. “When the perfect plan has failed at the last moment, it becomes more difficult to plan from scratch with the current political situation.”

Unlike Trump’s 2017 “Muslim ban,” which drew global rebuke for being discriminatory, the latest visa ban appears to be engineered to withstand legal scrutiny.

According to immigration attorney Helen Partlow, the ban “leans more heavily on administrative factors like visa overstays and deportation cooperation, rather than direct allegations of terrorism or religious bias, making it harder to challenge in court.”

“It is unlikely that these visa restrictions will be reversed during President Trump’s administration, especially if his first term in office is any indication. During his first travel ban in 2017, he faced immediate legal challenges and public backlash. But since then, the administration has doubled down,” Partlow said in an email.

Indeed, the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the president wide authority to restrict the entry of noncitizens deemed “detrimental to the interests of the United States.” This authority was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2018 decision Trump v. Hawaii, giving future administrations a powerful tool for sweeping immigration controls.

Across the Myanmar diaspora in the U.S., many feel the Trump administration’s approach betrays Washington’s stated commitment to supporting democracy in Myanmar.

“This ban is unjust and unsympathetic,” Steven Sanyu, a community leader in Buffalo, New York, said in text messages in Burmese. “Since the 2021 military coup, people in Myanmar have been living in terror, with killings and arrests happening daily. If the U.S. wants to be tough, it should target the generals and their cronies—not ordinary people trying to survive.”

In Myanmar’s political landscape, studying abroad is not just a luxury for youth; it’s a lifeline. According to Chit, after the 2021 military coup, a surge in visa applications made securing a visa interview appointment incredibly difficult. Now, that process is effectively meaningless. An Al Jazeera report from 2021 found that the number of student visas approved for Myanmar nationals increased more than tenfold from February to July 2021, with 652 approved in 2021 versus 64 in 2020.

Manmade misery

Despite Myanmar’s economic collapse and unstable currency, Noo Khin’s family invested heavily in her education—$6,000 in tuition and related costs alone—for her to join the Pre-Collegiate Program of Yangon (PCP), a 12-month liberal arts college preparatory course that helps students apply to international universities.

“As a child from a working middle-class background with only one breadwinner, my dad, we could still afford the family’s basic necessities,” Noo Khin explained, “yet I knew that the cost of attending PCP alone held nearly half of my dad’s monthly salary as a division sales manager in a company.”

To reduce expenses for applying to U.S colleges and taking standardized tests, Noo Khin applied for every scholarship and free resource she could find. The PCP helped cover her language education and interview fees associated with meeting admissions officers. She also received a full scholarship for English language proficiency classes.

Still, Noo Khin estimated that she and her family have spent between $12,000 and $14,000 to pursue her dream of studying in the U.S.

Ei Hlaing, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Lynchburg who also serves as co-director of PCP, said students from the most recent cohort who received admissions and scholarships lost their opportunities to attend college in the U.S. due to the visa ban. She noted that the timing could not have been worse because university application deadlines had already passed when the ban was announced.

“Emotionally, they felt crushed,” Hlaing said in an email. “They worked so hard to receive those scholarships. They revised their personal statements numerous times. They were so happy when they got admission to their dream schools in the U.S. with generous financial support. All of that got yanked away from them overnight.”

The professor explained that students now need to spend at least an additional six months in Myanmar to complete a foundation program, or prep course, for U.K. universities, or a foundation year in the U.K. or Malaysia, which adds an additional year to the start of an undergraduate course, with additional costs ranging from $5,000 to $25,000.

Noo Khin was dedicated to attending an American college; now she finds her options incredibly limited. Student visa requirements vary by country, and she doesn’t meet the educational requirements to apply to universities beyond the U.S. She said it feels like she’s “being doomed.”

Chit told Prism that the students she works with at her college consulting firm have studied for years, aced their exams, and secured college admissions in the U.S., requiring their parents to sacrifice everything.

“Now they’ve been told their dreams are over, not because they did something wrong—but because of where they were born,” Chit said in text messages in Burmese.

Equally devastating are those who were selected for the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery. The State Department program grants up to 55,000 immigrant visas each year to people randomly chosen from countries with historically low immigration rates to the U.S. In some cases, people from the countries now barred from entering the U.S. had already been issued visas when Trump’s ban was announced.

Chit said many of these people already sold their homes or took out large loans to cover the costs of flights and the medical checks required for migration to the U.S. Now, they are stuck in limbo.

For ordinary Myanmar citizens, getting a U.S. visa has always felt like winning the lottery: rare, difficult, and life-changing. It has also represented freedom, safety, and a path out of a country where the ruling military regime bombs its own people.

On social media, frustration over the visa ban has boiled for months. Some direct their anger at earlier visa holders who overstayed or sought asylum, accusing them of contributing to the statistics now used to justify the ban.

But immigration attorneys say this resentment is misplaced. Applying for asylum is a right enshrined in U.S. and international law, and it is systemic failures and the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda—not individual actions—that account for today’s conditions.

“The blame is squarely on the Trump administration for invoking a completely unnecessary, unjustified ban,” said immigration attorney David Leopold in a LinkedIn message. “The ban will do little to enhance U.S. national security and much to hurt our worldwide standing.”

For now, Myanmar’s military junta has not commented on the U.S. ban. However, junta leader Min Aung Hlaing said that it was an “honor” to receive a letter from Trump in July threatening a 40% tariff on goods imported from Myanmar starting Aug. 1. Aung Hlaing asked for a reduction in the tariff rate and for the U.S. to lift economic sanctions on Myanmar.

More recently, the Trump administration terminated Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Myanmar nationals, asserting that conditions in the country no longer warrant humanitarian protection. TPS allows nationals from certain countries to lawfully reside and work in the U.S. temporarily. Broadly, the Trump administration has terminated TPS for hundreds of thousands of immigrants. An estimated 3,969 people from Myanmar currently have TPS, which is now set to expire on Jan. 26, 2026.

Critics argue that the Trump administration’s decision to impose a full immigrant-visa ban on Myanmar citizens and end protective status undermines the U.S.’s long-standing claim to support Myanmar’s fragile democratic transition. Instead, the administration has chosen to treat the entire population of Myanmar as a security risk.

Human rights organizations such as EarthRights International argue that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) “should not be leading U.S. foreign policy in Myanmar.” The advocacy organization also called on the Trump administration to consult more proactively with Myanmar civil society groups in the U.S. and with members of Congress who are monitoring the conflict, rather than relying on the propaganda of a junta committed to using terror against its fellow citizens.

The decision to terminate TPS for citizens of Myanmar will likely translate to DHS efforts to deport these immigrants from the U.S., despite ongoing political instability, continued fighting between the military regime and resistance forces, widespread displacement, and credible evidence of torture and extrajudicial killings in Myanmar. Human rights organizations across the globe have condemned the Trump administration’s decision. Groups such as Human Rights Watch and experts with the United Nations continue to assert that Myanmar remains deeply unsafe.

Worsening conditions for refugees and asylum-seekers in the U.S., the administration announced in November that it would intensify scrutiny of immigrants lawfully in the U.S. who are from the 19 countries previously listed under Trump-era visa restrictions, including Myanmar.

Trump administration officials have instructed immigration agencies to re-review green card holders, refugees admitted since 2021, and new applicants from these countries under expanded, so-called national security vetting. This step is expected to slow immigration processing significantly, heighten the likelihood of denials, and deepen existing backlogs within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and DHS. Immigrants who have lived lawfully in the U.S. for years now also face uncertainty and fear that routine check-ins or applications may be delayed or challenged under shifting standards.

The visa ban, the rollback of TPS, and the heightened scrutiny of immigrants from visa-ban nations represent a broad tightening of U.S. immigration policy—one that disproportionately affects individuals from countries such as Myanmar who are fleeing conflict, authoritarian governments, or state-sponsored violence.

In Mandalay, Noo Khin continues to mourn her losses. But even as the visa ban remains in place, she holds on to the hope that one day she’ll walk across Kenyon’s tree-lined campus.

“Since it was an [Early Decision] acceptance, I had withdrawn from all the other schools I applied to, so I didn’t have a backup plan,” she said. “I still look at the acceptance letter mail sometimes, and it still makes me feel happy but with a hint of melancholy now.”

Noo Khin is now looking into options in other countries, but the process feels daunting.

“I hate the words: ‘This happens for the better,’” she said. “In my case, it is not because of destiny or fate. It is a man made misery.”",https://prismreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2239616201-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:57:58.098807

Country/Region

Amid the horrors of the Sudan civil war, questions are once again being raised over what role EU funds have played in the ongoing conflict and, in particular, alleged genocide in Darfur at the hands of the Rapid Support Forces militia. Statewatch is republishing a powerful 2018 article by the journalist Caitlin L Chandler for The New Humanitarian, which explains the background to and effects of the EU’s “migration management” cooperation with Sudan.

Introduction

In mid-November, two Swedish MEPs wrote to the European Commission to highlight allegations that EU migration funds had been used to support a paramilitary group accused of committing genocide in Sudan.

Jonas Sjöstedt and Hanna Gedin, both with The Left group in the European Parliament, referred to claims that some of the €200m provided to Sudan for ‘migration management’ through the Khartoum Process was channelled to the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, currently locked in a brutal civil war with the Sudanese military.

They asked the Commission – which has not yet responded – to explain what steps it had taken to investigate this allegation, and whether any wider review is planned into irregularities in the management of Khartoum Process funds.

With questions again being raised over the EU’s complicity in backing the Rapid Support Forces (in the press as well as the European Parliament), Statewatch is republishing a powerful 2018 article written by journalist Caitlin L Chandler for The New Humanitarian. It explains the background of the Khartoum Process and how little safeguards or oversight were put in place as funds were handed over.

The article remains relevant as ever: even as the EU issues statements condemning the actions of the RSF, they shy away from questions about their own involvement in funding them. One reason for their reticence to respond could be that they continue to pour billions of euros into the pockets of actors with little regard for human life or rights, with similarly little safeguards or oversight, in the name of “migration management.”

Inside the EU’s flawed $200 million migration deal with Sudan

By Caitlin L. Chandler

As millions of dollars in EU funds flow into Sudan to stem African migration, asylum seekers say they are increasingly trapped, living in a perpetual state of fear and exploitation in this key transit country.

In interviews with over 25 Eritrean and Ethiopian asylum seekers in Khartoum and the eastern city of Kassala, as well as local journalists, and lawyers working on behalf of refugees, IRIN has documented allegations of endemic police abuse, including extortion, violence, and sexual assault.

The pattern of corruption and rights violations uncovered feeds into broader concerns over whether the EU’s migration policies are making a difficult situation worse.

Across Sudan's capital, Khartoum, some 30,000 Eritrean, Ethiopian, and other African refugees are crammed into decrepit, non-descript houses, waiting for their chance to escape the country and make it to Europe.

Sudan’s previously porous northern border with Libya has become increasingly dangerous to cross after Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir deployed the former Janjaweed – a paramilitary group implicated in war crimes during the Darfur conflict – in 2015 as border guards.

This militia, re-named the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and integrated into Sudan’s army in January 2017, arrests asylum seekers and hands them over to the police, who detain, fine, and deport them for illegal entry – regardless of whether returning them to their countries will result in torture or imprisonment.

Tortured for money

The Shagarab refugee camp appears out of nowhere, a sprawling, dusty settlement in eastern Sudan near the Eritrean border, two hours by road from the main town of Kassala, through a series of tightly controlled checkpoints that require police permission to pass.

Some 40,000 refugees, primarily Eritreans, are registered at Shagarab, but it feels deserted. For many Eritreans, the camp is only a temporary stop for two or three months before the next stages of their journey, on to Khartoum, and then on to Libya or Egypt, before the final goal of Europe.

Inside Shagarab’s centre for unaccompanied minors, teenagers watch TV and stay glued to their mobile phones, eager to be in contact with the outside world. But some have experienced awful abuse at the hands of traffickers as they escaped from Eritrea – one of the world’s most oppressive states – and into Sudan.

Dawit*, 17, fled Eritrea to escape military conscription – in a country where unpaid army service can last for years – travelling first to Ethiopia and then hiring smugglers to take him into Sudan.

He couldn’t pay the smugglers up front, and so once inside Sudan was trafficked and held for ransom in Hajer, a town almost all Eritrean refugees interviewed by IRIN mentioned as a place to avoid.

“Sudanese smugglers tortured us for the payment,” said Dawit. “They stripped us naked and beat us with whips while our families were on the [telephone] line. New arrivals had two-three days after arrival to pay before being beaten.

“Those who had been there longer were beaten every day. The women fared even worse – men would come, pick them out, and take them away. When they returned, they were bleeding and crying.”

Dawit said that after being held for five days, the smugglers got a call warning them that there was about to be a police raid, and they all escaped.

The tip-off is entirely in keeping with numerous accounts of the involvement of Sudanese officials in the trafficking industry.

A history of migration

Sudan has long been a transit country for Eritreans and others on the move, as well as a country people flee from.

Sudan’s increasing criminalisation of refugees and migrants, as well as conditions in Libya, where the EU backs the Libyan coastguard to capture refugees at sea and return them to detention centres, have contributed to a steep drop in the number of people arriving in Italy.

In 2016, 40,773 refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa arrived in Italy; in 2017, only 8,688 people made it.

Yet young Eritrean men and women in Khartoum and Kassala told IRIN they had no intention of remaining in Sudan, despite being aware of the risks of using smugglers to take them through Libya and Egypt, where they can experience torture and death.

Some said they would wait for new, safer routes to open, while others were working as maids and daily labourers to raise enough money to start the journey as soon as possible.

“When I came from Eritrea, I was kidnapped for two weeks. I didn’t know where I was, and I was raped many times. So, nothing [worse] will happen to me. All of us left our families behind,” said a young Eritrean woman in Khartoum. “We’ll take the risk of going to Europe.”

Over the past two years, the EU has allocated more than $200 million in migration-related funds to Sudan, part of its broader strategy to outsource migration control to third countries.

EU financing for border management includes training and equipment for border police, capacity building for the judiciary, and legal reforms to encourage increased arrests and prosecution of traffickers and smugglers.

This support is despite the fact that the Sudanese government has for years been condemned for its human rights record – al-Bashir has an outstanding arrest warrant for crimes against humanity issued by the International Criminal Court.

The EU sidesteps accusations it is working with Sudan’s repressive security apparatus by arguing that it doesn’t fund the government directly, rather it funnels its aid through international organisations, including UN agencies.

But these EU partners are willing to work with controversial arms of the Sudanese government.

For example, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, confirmed to IRIN it has provided motorbikes in Kassala to the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) – a spy service responsible for the arrest, torture, and detention of human rights activists and the government’s political opponents.

Extortion and abuse

In densely populated Khartoum neighbourhoods like al-Geraif and al-Daim, groups of 10 to 15 Eritrean refugees live in sub-divided shanty houses. Rooms are occupied by entire families or as many as eight single young men and women at a time.

Many rely on donations from family members abroad to afford food, children’s school fees, and other basic expenses. Those without family support are destitute, eating only one meal a day, without access to proper sanitation or medical care.

Filmon, 21, arrived in Sudan in November 2016 from Ginda, Eritrea. He shares a dirty, cramped room with five other young men. Until recently, it lacked a latrine.

“Life in Khartoum is very hard. I don’t get enough money or good work and it’s not a safe area,” he told IRIN. “I’ve been asked [by the police] about my cards, my refugee card, regularly. I think about going to Europe through Libya – I have no choice,” he said.

Although Sudan has a policy that refugees must live in camps, the majority of Eritreans either stop in them just long enough to claim asylum status and collect an identification card, or head directly for Khartoum. Many have travelled with smugglers, and some have experienced trafficking, violence, and sexual assault crossing into Sudan or once inside.

In Khartoum, they find a prison of a different kind. Refugees report being terrorised by the police, who enter their neighbourhoods – sometimes in the middle of the night – and extort and detain people for not having ID cards. Cash and valuables are routinely stolen.

Sara is a bubbly young Eritrean woman who attends henna training classes. She told IRIN how she was arrested on the street for not having her refugee card, and at the police station was offered a choice: “If you want to be free, you will have sex with us.”

Sara, who was 17 at the time, narrowly avoided being raped because her 19-year-old female companion went with the policemen instead.

Feeding corruption

Each month, police funnel hundreds of refugees and migrants through courts in Khartoum, where they are charged with violating Sudan’s Passport and Immigration Act and fined the equivalent of $360.

If they do not pay the fines, they are deported to their home country, usually without having the opportunity to consult a lawyer or claim asylum, even though some may have experienced violence, torture, and other acts in Sudan or in their home countries that could qualify them.

Hundreds of Eritreans have been extradited over the past two years, including some who were registered as refugees. Deporting an asylum seeker back to the country they fled from and where they face persecution is known as refoulement, and it is a violation of the UN Refugee Convention.

Lawyers working to represent refugees in court before they are extradited describe a justice system that is just as corrupt as the police force.

“In many cases the traffickers are let go because they have police officers as [defence] witnesses,” said Khalid, a lawyer working in Khartoum. “There are trials where 250 refugees are arrested, and each one is fined. It happens so fast – the process of being arrested, the trial and the conviction – and the judge and the police force responsible get a cut of the money. These judges are the same ones who were trained by the British embassy.”

The Khartoum Process

Europe’s focus on curbing migration from Sudan began in November 2014, with the launch of the Khartoum Process – a dialogue between the EU and Horn of Africa countries to combat trafficking and smuggling. It initially emphasised protection and human rights, but in operation its focus has been a law enforcement response to migration.

In 2015, Brussels created a special pot of money – the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa – to assist the Khartoum Process in addressing the root causes of migration and fighting trafficking and smuggling.

An Oxfam analysis found that of the €400 million allocated through the fund, only three percent went towards developing safe and regular routes for migration. The bulk was spent on migration control.

Police Lieutenant General Awad al-Neel Dahiya, head of the Ministry of Interior Passports and Civil Registry Authority and a key interlocutor for the EU’s migration efforts, believes the focus is justified.

“As a matter of fact, we have very long borders – 7,000 kilometres plus,” he told IRIN. “Compared to our resources, it is very difficult to control – maybe we can be assisted by technology, so we can control the influx, as well as those going out – whether its Sudanese [people or people from] other countries passing through Sudan.”

But Sudanese specialists say the EU is operating on the flawed assumption that the government is sincere in wanting to end the lucrative trafficking business.

“There is a lack of political will from the Sudanese government to fight trafficking,” Rifat Makawi, another lawyer in Khartoum, explained. “Creating new policies and drafting laws is just done by the government to please Western countries. On the ground, nothing changes.”

A recent report from the Regional Mixed Migration Secretariat noted that despite the flurry of anti-smuggling and trafficking efforts, new smuggling routes continue to open across the Horn, with Eritrean and Sudanese smuggling networks gaining influence.

One estimate puts the profits of the smuggling business on the northwestern route from the Horn of Africa to Europe at approximately $203 million in 2016.

An uncomfortable alliance

The US State Department’s 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report concludes that Sudan “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.”

Human Rights Watch has accused the security forces, including the RSF, of colluding with human traffickers and smugglers rather than investigating them.

The EU’s interest in managing migration has precipitated a sharp shift in how member countries engage with Khartoum. For years, European governments avoided dealing with al-Bashir because of the ICC arrest warrant and his rights record, but there has been something of a sea change.

The UK is now engaged in a biannual “strategic dialogue” focused on migration, trade, and counter-terrorism. Italy has signed a policing agreement on trafficking, irregular immigration and terrorism; and Norway is discussing an agreement to facilitate easier deportation of Sudanese asylum seekers. Belgium recently allowed Sudanese security officials to vet asylum-seekers; those who were then deported back to Sudan were detained, interrogated and tortured.

Michael Aron, the UK ambassador to Sudan, said the EU can influence police behaviour through dialogue. “There are people we talk to in the police who are definitely trying to do the right thing,” he explained. “We should be helping the good guys so they can increase their influence over decision-making and gradually get the situation more under control.”

Meanwhile, over the past three years, the Sudanese government has made it clear it expects the EU to provide funds and equipment for its migration control efforts.

The head of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan, regularly boasts about the RSF’s role in assisting the EU. He recently told Al Jazeera: “[The EU] lose[s] millions in fighting migration, that's why [it has] to support us.""

The EU ambassador to the Sudan, Jean-Michel Dumond, rejects criticism of Europe’s relationship with Khartoum. “We have been accused of all the sins of the world, and it’s quite clear we have never cooperated with the RSF – we have no link,” he told IRIN. “[EU] aid is given [under] very clear conditions.”

Meanwhile, former border control officials from European countries are arriving in Khartoum as consultants, replacing development experts in some international agencies. One of the latest EU-funded projects is a Regional Command Center in Khartoum (ROCK), to be run by Civipol out of the Sudanese police training compound.

“The migration issue is becoming like the Darfur crisis, it’s a business,” said Fatima, a Sudanese journalist covering migration who also pointed to the creation of numerous new government charities that have started turning up at migration-related meetings. “Everyone wants a piece of the pie,” she added.

“Where to keep them?”

Yusef, an Eritrean refugee, tried to head to Europe in 2014 via Libya, but was returned to the Sudanese border by a militia in Libya. There, he was arrested, along with hundreds of other refugees.

The Sudanese border guards brought Yusef to the northern town of Dongola that now serves as an informal detention facility for refugees captured at the border.

On the three-day journey, Yusef alleges that over 50 people died from lack of food, water, and medical care. Their pleas for help went unanswered. “We told them our friends are dying, are thirsty, hungry, suffering. They don’t protect you,” he told IRIN.

In Dongola, Yusef was kept in a large compound along with hundreds of other people. Eight Bangladeshi men in the facility paid and were immediately released, along with a number of Somalis and Sudanese. But the Eritreans and Ethiopians were detained for a month.

Yusef said he counted nine people who died due to lack of medical care. Representatives of the UN visited – a team of four foreigners with an Eritrean translator – and told the inmates that if they had a refugee card they could go back to the Shagarab refugee camp in eastern Sudan, or else they would be deported.

Yusef had a refugee card but did not trust the UN or the Sudanese government to protect him. To avoid being sent back to Eritrea, where he could likely face torture and imprisonment, Yusef claimed to be Ethiopian. He was deported to Ethiopia, and crossed back into Sudan a few weeks later.

Monitoring from afar

The EU is now planning to work in Dongola through its flagship Better Migration Management project, a $46 million regional programme run by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), in partnership with the International Organization on Migration (IOM), Italian police and Civipol, a consulting wing of the French ministry of interior, among other organisations.

“The proposal came from us, because we have nowhere to keep people,” said Dahiya, the head of Sudan’s Ministry of Interior Passports and Civil Registry Authority. “Every month we have to intercept almost 100 or sometimes 500 irregular migrants; we have to process their return and their protection – it gives us real challenges – where to keep them?”

According to the UK ambassador, BMM will set-up a centre in Dongola to help receive the arrested refugees and migrants. But it’s not clear how human rights abuses will be monitored, especially somewhere where there are no international NGOs or observers at present.

Martin Weiss, the BMM project head in Germany, insists the programme aims to protect migrants.

“BMM is not about border surveillance, but about protecting refugees, facilitating migration, and improving conditions for people who are fleeing their homes,” he wrote in an email. “At present, many refugees are vulnerable to violence, slavery or rape. We want to provide an effective response to the problem.”

But the EU and its partners don’t appear to have a viable strategy to mitigate human rights abuses. In the case of the BMM project, the EU and GIZ claim that its steering committee – composed of the European Commission, Germany, UK, France, Italy, and the Netherlands – oversees human rights risks remotely from Brussels.

“The steering committee has a clear view of what is possible and what is not possible,” said Dumond, “and we don’t think there is a big risk [of human rights violations as a result of EU funding].”

He added that EU officials frequently go on mission in Sudan to assess conditions first-hand.

But such visits are tightly controlled by the government and the security services. When IRIN visited Shagarab, for example, police and NISS officers followed, transcribing every interview.

The EU and GIZ also declined to show country specific budgets for Sudan for the BMM programme. That opacity is a way to escape “accountability and scrutiny”, explained Giulia Laganà, a migration specialist at the Open Society European Policy Institute, via email.

Rethink needed

The situation Yusef faced in Eritrea forced him to leave. Stricter border controls did not deter him in striving for a better life, and neither did the rights abuses he encountered. Yet there is no indication the EU is open to adjusting its migration management strategy in the face of mounting criticism that its approach in Sudan is not only ineffective but also causing harm.

“The real root causes of migration are very complex,” said Dumond. “You cannot hope to address all these problems and have quick solutions in a few months.”

But a new report from the International Refugee Rights Initiative, The Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa (SIHA), and The Centre for Human Rights Law at SOAS, University of London, argues that a re-think is urgently needed.

“As barriers are created without sufficient alternatives being offered, people are taking greater and greater risks and journeys are becoming increasingly dangerous,” the study found. “The only people benefitting … are the smugglers and traffickers.”

Based on my recent research, Turkish authorities have arbitrarily assigned “restriction codes” to some Uyghurs, among other refugees and migrants, considering them public-security threats, often without evidence or any reasonable justification.
A simple complaint from a neighbour, even if deemed unfounded later, can result in the application of restriction codes in Turkey.
Some people on these lists have also ended up being tagged with restriction codes.
Turkish authorities should protect those Uyghurs who consider Turkey a second homeland, and not put them in harm’s way.","Since late 2016, Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in northwestern China have been victims of crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Chinese government. As an international student living in Istanbul at that time, I decided not to return home and instead started publicly advocating on behalf of hundreds of thousands of arbitrarily detained Uyghurs in China. They include my father, Memet Yaqup, who disappeared in 2018 and is now serving a 16-year prison sentence, having committed no crime.

Until recently, the Turkish government had provided protection with preferential treatment for Uyghurs like me due to our Turkic origin. This made many of us eligible for long-term residence permits and subsequently Turkish citizenship. However, over the last couple of years, as Turkey has adopted increasingly anti-immigrant policies and China-Turkey relations warm, various administrative malpractices have not only nullified that preferential treatment – they have put members of my community at risk of forcible return to China.

Based on my recent research, Turkish authorities have arbitrarily assigned “restriction codes” to some Uyghurs, among other refugees and migrants, considering them public-security threats, often without evidence or any reasonable justification. The Turkish government has cited laws pertaining to foreigners and international protection in doing so, but the criteria and rationale for how these codes are currently assigned is unclear.

A simple complaint from a neighbour, even if deemed unfounded later, can result in the application of restriction codes in Turkey. The Chinese government has submitted lists to the Turkish authorities of people Beijing considers terrorists, in some cases for peaceful activism or expression of Uyghur identity. Some people on these lists have also ended up being tagged with restriction codes.

Such codes can lead to a cascade of negative and often devastating consequences, including denial of international protection, or denial of other statuses that entitle a person to residency or would provide a path to citizenship. This has had the effect of categorizing Uyghurs restricted by these laws as irregular migrants subject to deportation. If they are picked up by police or immigration officers for any reason, they can be sent to a deportation centre.

Turkish immigration authorities have pressed, and at times forced, Uyghur detainees (along with others from Syria or Afghanistan) to sign voluntary return forms.

Although the Turkish government has a policy against deporting Uyghurs directly to China, they have deported them to other countries where they are at risk of return.

I interviewed a person whom Turkish immigration authorities deported in 2019 to the United Arab Emirates, which has an extradition treaty with China. This person left the UAE and traveled through several other countries before reaching a safe destination. During that time, Chinese government agents harassed him and pressed host governments to send him back to China. Local immigration authorities in two of his transit countries detained him.

Under Turkish law, individuals can appeal these deportation decisions. However, according to a lawyer I spoke to who has made such appeals many times, judges often make a negative decision when they see restriction codes attached to a file, just to be safe.

I reviewed a number of cases in which Turkish courts ruled that the international prohibition on sending people back to a place where they would face danger does not apply for the Uyghurs. There is ample evidence, though, that Uyghurs returned to China face detention, interrogation, torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading types of treatments, especially if they come from countries Beijing arbitrarily deems “sensitive,” including Turkey.

As my community went through the pain of family members being forcibly disappeared back home, Turkey provided me the lifeline I needed. I graduated with a PhD in international relations from Turkey’s Koç University and feel privileged and grateful to have obtained Turkish citizenship. But that privilege is not the case for many other Uyghurs.

Many Uyghurs I speak with, from all over the world, including those in London, where I currently live, love Turkey and feel like home when they walk through Uyghur neighbourhoods in Istanbul.

Analysts are still working to understand Zohran Mamdani’s decisive victory in last month’s New York mayoral race. Like the blind men in the old Indian story of the “Blind Men and the Elephant,” the explanations offered have been mostly accurate but incomplete.

Mamdani’s focus on affordability was clearly appealing, as was his compelling affability on display in clever and incisive social media posts. The fact that he was constantly on the move, meeting and engaging voters where they were, was also a factor in his favor. It communicated his authentic desire to know voters and have them know him.

In the stale consultant-driven political environment in which we find ourselves, Mamdani was a breath of fresh air. With his opponents spending tens of millions on negative attack ads, Mamdani’s approach was new and exciting. Despite running against the well-funded campaign of a former governor and much of the New York Democratic Party establishment that saw him as a threat to their hegemony, he not only prevailed but also won more votes than any previous mayoral candidate in the city’s history.

Three other factors were also decisive in shaping the outcome.

The first is the changing demographics of New York City. In 1980, more than one-half of the city’s population was white. Today it is less than one-third white. In 1980, 1,400,000 New Yorkers were Hispanic. Today they number 2 ½ million. During this same period, New York’s Black population remained fairly stable at about 1,700,000, though over one-third of today’s Black population are immigrants or the descendants of recent immigrants from African or Caribbean countries. One of the biggest shifts has been the dramatic growth of New York’s population of Asian descent. They have grown from a few hundred thousand to 1,400,000.

These changing demographics in favor of newer immigrant communities resulted in substantial shifts in the composition of the electorate and it mattered in this election. Mamdani easily won among Asian, Hispanic, and Black voters. But it’s important to note that he almost evenly split the white vote with his main opponent. Performing that well among all demographic groups is unusual in New York politics.

Another critically important factor in Mamdani’s win was the role an empowered grassroots movement played. The political group that powered his victory was the Democratic Socialists of America. With thousands of organizers throughout New York City, they had already accounted for a number of upset wins during this past decade. The first was in 2018, when upstart Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated Congressman Joseph Crowley. At the time of his defeat, Crowley was the Chair of the Queens County Democratic Party and Vice-Chair of the Democratic Caucus in Congress. In many ways, Ocasio-Cortez’s win presaged Mamdani’s. Crowley had the support of the establishment and far more money than his unknown insurgent opponent, but the party apparatus he headed had grown lazy and stale. She had a grassroots movement that out-organized the establishment.

In the years that followed, DSA activists won a number of elections for state and local posts across the city (including Mamdani’s 2021 election to New York State Assembly). They showed that an organization of energized grassroots activists can defeat the establishment and their money.

A final factor that played a critical role in Mamdani’s victory was the impact of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza on the electorate in general, and specifically on the Jewish community in New York City.

For decades, the accepted political wisdom was that because of the size of the Jewish community in New York City, a political candidate who wanted to win there had to pay homage to Israel. It was assumed that the Jewish community was in lock-step with Israel and that those who wanted their votes or support should act accordingly. This not only silenced any reasoned discussion of the Middle East, but also had a devastating impact on the ability of Arab Americans and, especially after 9/11, American Muslims to freely participate in the city’s political life.

One example stands out. In 1988 Jesse Jackson’s presidential bid became the first to welcome the Arab community into a presidential campaign. The New York rally and fundraiser Arab Americans organized for Jackson was one of his most successful events. When, the following year, one of Jackson’s New York co-chairs announced that he would run for mayor, the Arab community was ready to play a part. Early in the year, I was called to New York by the candidate and his campaign manager. They told me that the city’s Jewish establishment was upset by the role Arabs had played in Jackson’s effort and by Jackson’s embrace of Palestinian rights. They told me, “Tell your people we don’t want their support. If the Arabs give us a thousand dollars, the Jewish community will raise one hundred thousand to defeat us. Keep them away.”

I left the meeting shocked and upset and went to prominent Jewish writers I knew at the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Village Voice and told them what had happened. They wrote scathing attacks on this bigoted exclusion. But, fear still won, and the exclusion continued.

Given this context, it becomes clear what an enormous difference was in evidence in this year’s New York election. The impact of Israel’s war on Gaza transformed politics. Support for Palestinians and criticism of Israel’s genocidal policies have become mainstream issues. Arabs and Muslims are welcomed. At the same time, this election shattered the myth of a monolithic Jewish vote. Despite the hysterical anti-Mamdani reaction of the Jewish establishment (more than one leader referred to him as “the enemy of the Jewish community”), the majority of young Jews supported Mamdani, along with more than one-third of all Jewish voters.

Combined, these factors demonstrate how New York City has changed, the city’s Democratic Party is changing, and the Arab American, American Muslim, and American Jewish communities are changing—all for the better. The bottom line: It’s not your daddy’s New York anymore.

Multiple advocates who talked with me said legal organizations that provide pro bono aid to migrants are overwhelmed amid Trump’s mass deportation drive.","At his clinic, John Sirabella is a hard man to talk to.

On a recent evening, in the back of a cavernous church basement, he led a training for over two dozen people gathered on folding chairs. Translators and volunteers sat at rows of tables. The session was dedicated to helping immigrants navigate the intense scenes in the Manhattan courthouses where masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have taken to snatching people who show up for scheduled hearings and routine appointments.

After Sirabella ran through his presentation and encouraged people to sign up to help with multiple programs, one volunteer asked, “Where is your need greatest?”

Sirabella explained that his top priority is assembling a team of multilingual volunteers who can reach out to immigrants they have encountered on their days acting as observers and escorts in court.

“My goal, my vision is that everyone we’ve met in court since March is notified; they know we’re here, we’re open, and we’re ready to support them,” Sirabella explained. “Whether they choose to go to us is up to them.”

He is particularly eager to recruit Spanish speakers to spread the word about the clinic.

“People are really terrified, getting a phone call from a stranger,” he said. “They think it’s ICE, so it’s vital to have someone who can call them in Spanish or text and tell them to come here and get help.”

Sirabella is a retired marketing executive from Brooklyn who volunteers with the New Sanctuary Coalition, an organization that was founded in 2007 with the goal of giving immigrants tools to lead their own advocacy and navigate the legal system. Along with leading the weekly clinic, Sirabella also plays a key role in the group’s court accompaniment program, which provides in person support for immigrants as they face the masked agents in Manhattan’s courts.

“I looked for some way of — not serving meals or something — but really helping people where rubber meets the road,” Sirabella said in an interview.

During this second Trump era, NSC has become a key part of New York City’s Undocumented Underground, which includes other advocacy organizations that are running legal clinics and court watching efforts. In churches and meeting rooms around the city, networks of activists and advocates are engaged in the painstaking, mundane work of untangling the cases of thousands of immigrants caught up in Trump’s mass deportation machine.

Sirabella said he “sort of fell into” the role of heading up the NSC’s legal clinic because he was a member of a church that had an optimal space. The clinic is a key engine behind the group’s work escorting migrants in court and trying to release those who have been detained. Inside, volunteers are trained to participate in accompaniment. They also provide ongoing help with cases and give migrants resources to represent themselves. NSC refers to the people they work with as “friends.”

“We’re here to serve them,” Sirabella said.

Throughout the night I watched him at the clinic, Sirabella was at the center of a quiet whirlwind, jumping between trainings and answering questions about a steady stream of immigration cases. He refers to the weekly scene at the clinic as “fluid yet orchestrated chaos.”

As with many of the stories in this series, I agreed not to identify the specific location of the church or the exact day of the clinic since many of the migrants who visit there face the threat of detention and deportation. I also granted anonymity to some of the volunteers involved in these programs.

Sirabella explained that the legal clinic typically draws 30 to 40 volunteers each week. NSC also has another weekly meeting that includes training and counseling for migrants. During my visit to the church, only a handful of immigrants were present. Many of the volunteers meet with those they work with privately and bring their documents and questions to the weekly events. Sirabella said the group is trying to “beef up” the number of migrants who seek help in person.

“It’s really a scary time and people are afraid to trust people,” he said.

After Sirabella wrapped up his briefing on court accompaniment, a woman named Sarah began a training on how to file motions to request a virtual hearing. NSC volunteers assist with those filings to help migrants keep their efforts to obtain legal residency alive without facing the chaos in the courts downtown.

“Right now, ICE is at the courts, waiting outside the rooms, and taking people from the halls,” Sarah said. “They’re basically extrajudicially taking people. No one knows who or why. It’s very terrifying for our friends, and there’s no oversight of detention conditions.”

As Sarah continued, Sirabella began doing laps around the basement. For the rest of the night he was on the move. People grabbed him to talk about individual cases. Others sought his advice on strategies for using Google Translate to communicate with friends. At points, he stopped and called out to the room to encourage people to sign up for Signal chats and to note which trainings they’d received on various attendance sheets. One group of three women pulled him aside and explained that they were all attorneys.

Sirabella stressed that they should always make clear they are a “volunteer” and “not acting as a lawyer.” NSC has forms they provide to friends that detail this distinction. It’s an important one to avoid mistaken impressions, to protect the organization from lawsuits, and to ensure the individuals working with them have the opportunity to continue representing themselves before the courts.

As Sirabella went over this with the trio, he was pulled away by a volunteer who brought over someone who spoke multiple languages. He quickly went with her to another corner of the room where people were working on plans for the outreach effort.

“This is our polyglot of the day,” Sirabella said as he steered the new volunteer into the group.

Sirabella was then corralled by someone who introduced him to a Colombian man who was holding an accordion folder overflowing with documents. Through a translator, Sirabella learned the man was looking for help on an asylum application. Sirabella paired him with a Spanish- speaking volunteer before continuing his rounds of the basement.

The next person to grab Sirabella was a man named Mark who was leading a group working on issues related to Special Immigrant Juvenile status (SIJS), one of the major tools advocates use to help young, eligible migrants obtain citizenship. Mark was wielding three different clipboards and had a bit of good news about a family’s case that had been disjoined.

“Their cases got put back together with the good judge that we want,” Mark said.

Someone else tried to pull Sirabella away. Mark grabbed his arm and drew him into a discussion about setting up a workflow for an operation focused on SIJ.

“Wait John,” he said. “You have to listen.”

NSC and other church programs around the city including the “welcome center” featured previously in this series have relatively formalized SIJS effort. Some advocates have also relied on a loose network of activists who are helping with court paperwork.

One part of this effort is “NYC 4 All,” which came together largely based on happenstance and word of mouth. An organizer who helped form the group told TPM that it began to coalesce about two years ago as Republican leaders were dispatching buses full of migrants to the city. The organizer was bringing “van loads” of winter clothes donated from wealthier neighborhoods in Brooklyn to churches and shelters where the migrants were staying.

“One of the pastors heard me speak Spanish and tried to recruit me to do the legal help that they were trying to provide,” the organizer said. “I actually resisted because, you know, it’s a lot of work, and I’m retired, and I did not want to commit.”

That reticence faded when they saw the “crazy situation” unfolding at the shelters.

“Hundreds and hundreds of people were coming,” the organizer explained.

Eventually, they said about 40 volunteers were working on the project. At times, they operated out of a storefront provided by a local business. The group focused on helping people from eligible nations apply for Temporary Protected Status, which is available to individuals from countries that have been designated as unsafe due to factors including armed conflicts and natural disasters. As soon as Trump retook the White House in January 2025, his administration set to work eroding the program. While this effort has been met with some legal challenges, the administration has succeeded in ending TPS protections for multiple countries.

After losing TPS as an option, the NYC 4 All volunteers began to, as the organizer put it, “switch into gear for SIJS.”

“It’s a whole other set of laws to figure out. So it took our little TPS group a minute,” the organizer said, adding, “Most of our kids have, usually, a death, or have a parent who is abusive, or who has … stopped support, which is why they left and came here. … The other half that aren’t from abusive situations are orphans.”

Volunteers serve as guardians in the court process for youth who do not have one parent in the U.S. with them. They also work to help the applicant orient themselves.

“We help that kid navigate New York City,” the organizer explained. “Whether that means getting a driver’s license and an ID, or getting enrolled in school, or helping them get health care or whatever it is. We step in to kind of translate New York City to the youth.”

Since, as the organizer put it, “asylum is subjective” and based on an individual judge’s decision, they came to believe SIJS is “the easiest thing” for those who are eligible. However, like so much of the immigration process, it has become harder in the new Trump administration.

“Trump started charging the kids a $250 application fee. Where [would] they get that? God knows because they don’t have work authorization and he won’t give them work authorization,” the organizer said.

The Trump administration also directed judges to stop granting deferred deportation orders to youth who are in the process of applying for SIJS. The organizer laid out the trap this creates for these young migrants.

“So, the courts have declared that they’re abandoned. They come from horrible situations, they’ve got nobody, and they’ve got to come up with money from a job they don’t have legally,” the organizer said. “They’re exploited as food service delivery guys, or construction guys. … They’re exploited with bad working conditions, and low pay, and they have to come up with a fee, and they have to stay underground for five or six years until the visa shows up.”

Last month, a federal judge ruled that the halt on protections for SIJS recipients was illegal. However, in the wake of that ruling it is unclear whether SIJS reviews have actually resumed or whether the Trump administration will appeal.

TPM reached out to the White House with several questions about the SIJS process including why the Trump administration began charging the fee and why they had directed judges to stop granting deferred deportation orders. We also asked whether SIJS reviews have resumed and whether the administration plans to appeal the judge’s ruling. The White House press office referred all questions to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which reviews applications for SIJS and deferred action. USCIS and DHS, which oversees that agency, did not respond to our request for comment,

Along with providing eligible youth with mentors, NYC 4 All is raising money to cover the SIJ fee for applicants. Overall, the organizer estimated the group has worked on about 100 SIJ cases. The Welcome Center, NSC, and other organizations with similar operations are also working to cover costs for applicants.

Most of the volunteers working with NYC 4 All and other similar groups that offer assistance to migrants have no formal legal training. Lou, a self-described “ex-finance guy” who lives in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, said he has been “deeply involved” in the group since early 2023. Lou focuses on helping people obtain work permits and SIJS.

“I was self-taught,” Lou said. “I’d just watch YouTube videos and figure out how to do it. It’s not that hard.”

While the volunteers say they have had little trouble learning the ropes of these processes, it’s another story for people who are unfamiliar with the system, do not speak English, and may not have resources for the fees or even a bank account.

“The logistics of it are just so fraught for them,” Lou said.

Multiple advocates who talked with me said legal organizations that provide pro bono aid to migrants are overwhelmed amid Trump’s mass deportation drive. That makes these volunteer efforts particularly critical. Advocates also said undocumented people can fall victim to predatory lawyers who charge exorbitant fees or abandon their clients.

“There’s a special place in hell for those people,” Lou said.

Lou stressed that while he can help with SIJS or obtaining an Employment Authorization Document, he recommends that anyone who has a complex case or is applying for asylum obtain a formal lawyer.

“I keep hammering people: get a freaking lawyer, get a lawyer, get a lawyer. Because I’m not that bright, man,” Lou said.

Overall, Lou estimated he spends about 15 hours a week working with NYC 4 All. Like many of the other volunteers there, Lou said he was motivated by the hardships faced by the migrants.

“They literally have nothing,” he said. “All they have is their character and their story.”

Back at the NSC clinic, during a rare quiet moment, Sirabella explained what motivated him to dive into the world of immigration advocacy and activism.

“I think part of what makes this country so great is this diversity. We’re a country of immigrants,” Sirabella said. “Also I was raised that … without the grace of God, that could just be me.”

Another man at the center of the action in the clinic was Ravi Ragbir, who is NSC’s executive director. Ragbir is a Trinidadian-American with long grey hair who has been through his own immigration odyssey.

He was convicted of mortgage fraud in 2001 and has since faced multiple deportation attempts, even after marrying a U.S. citizen. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, Ragbir was detained by ICE as part of what he and his family believe was retaliation for his activism. In January, on his last full day in office, President Joe Biden gave Ragbir a pardon for the decades-old conviction.

Ragbir told TPM his own experience has inspired his work with New Sanctuary Coalition where they “believe no one should be deported, and welcome everyone.” Ragbir said he knows that he might be “a target” again, but is undeterred.

“Who is not worried about facing retaliation? The thing is, when people are afraid of retaliation … they have won,” he explained. “I’ve always been a target for many years. But we cannot allow that to hinder or to delay our work.”

Like most activists and advocates who spoke with me for this series, Ragbir believes the volume and vehemence of ICE activity in New York is due to ramp up due to rumblings from Trump’s “border czar” and concerns the president might be eager to feud with the city’s new progressive mayor, Zohran Mamdani. Sirabella agreed the situation for immigrants in New York will likely get worse.

“Trump is really good in terms of declaring out front what he plans to do and he follows through,” Sirabella said. “They’re firing judges who grant asylum too frequently and they’re putting [military Judge Advocate Generals] in for judges. I think it is gonna get worse.”

While Ragbir said he thinks the immigration system “has always been horrible,” he does see a major distinction with Trump.

“What is different is the violence … the violence that is permeating his administration. If there is a difference, it’s that they’re willing to break the law to actually facilitate their agenda,” Ragbir said.",https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sirabella-inside-clinic-lead.jpg?w=804,N,,2025-12-15 11:58:28.067379

Ione WellsSouth America correspondent, Santiago

Chile is perceived by many of its neighbours in the Latin American region as a safer, more stable haven.

But inside the country, that perception has unravelled as voters worried about security, immigration and crime chose José Antonio Kast to be their next president.

Kast is a hardline conservative who has praised General Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former right-wing dictator whose US-backed coup ushered in 17 years of military rule marked by torture, disappearances and censorship.

To his critics, Kast's family history, including his German-born father's membership in the Nazi Party and his brother's time as a minister under Pinochet, is unsettling.

However, some of Kast's supporters openly defend Pinochet's rule, arguing that Chile was more peaceful then.

In a nod to Chile's past and to accusations levelled at other right-wing leaders in the region after they imposed military crackdowns on organised crime, the 59-year-old pledged in his first speech as president-elect that his promise to lead an ""emergency government"" would not mean ""authoritarianism"".

Sunday's election makes Chile the latest country in Latin America to decisively swing from the left to the right, following Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama.

Peru, Colombia and Brazil face pivotal elections next year.

Kast's victory places Chile within a growing bloc of conservative governments likely to align with US President Donald Trump, particularly on migration and security.

In some cases, like that of Argentina, inflation and economic crisis drove the shift. In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting.

In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.

Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.

His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.

The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela.

The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.

""Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,"" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign.

He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.

""What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,"" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.

He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced ""the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security"".

Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.

Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity.

Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.

He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an ""iron fist"" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.

But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult.

Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited.

Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily. But this is unlikely to compel hundreds of thousands to pack up.

For irregular migrants already in Chile, the future feels uncertain.

Gabriel Funez, a Venezuelan waiter, moved to Chile four years ago, crossing the land border irregularly to escape his country's ""very, very bad economic situation"".

He has since submitted his documents to police and immigration authorities and received a temporary ID so he can pay taxes but has so far had no response to his visa request.

His salary is currently being paid into a friend's bank account. ""I'm basically a ghost here,"" he says.

While he fears deportation, his bigger concern is a rise in xenophobia, which he says has already increased.

""Kast is expressing what many Chileans want to express. He's validating it,"" he said.

He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.

""It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.""

He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants.

With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business.

Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries.

He says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that ""the migrant workforce is very important"".

He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.

""Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,"" he adds.

Expelling unregistered workers ""will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,"" he warns.

Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.

""Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,"" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.

Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.

The strikes are arbitrary deprivations of life – extrajudicial killings – because lethal force is deliberately being used against people who, in that moment, pose no immediate threat to the lives of others and who could be apprehended by non-lethal means. Even on the assumption that those killed were drug smugglers, killing them on the high seas is as unlawful as if the police started killing those suspected of dealing drugs on the streets of a U.S. city.

Because U.S. military units are organs of the State under the law of State responsibility (Articles of State Responsibility, art. 4), and because each of the strikes breaches the IHRL obligation to respect life, they constitute “internationally wrongful acts” for which the United States bears responsibility. Moreover, those involved may have committed murder in violation of the domestic criminal law of States that can exercise jurisdiction. (Murder under international criminal law is a different matter.) This includes the domestic law of the United States, as the State of nationality of the perpetrators, and potentially any States whose nationals were among the victims of the strikes.

Although this is the prevailing view among experts, widespread discussion persists over whether the strikes violate the law of armed conflict. Such discussions are counter-normative because that law applies only to actions during armed conflicts. The administration has erroneously asserted that it is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the cartels. That assertion is legally flawed (see, e.g., here, here, and here). To be clear, there is no armed conflict, and LOAC simply doesn’t apply.

Nevertheless, in light of the administration’s mistaken claims that an armed conflict is underway, international law experts have pointed out that the strikes would be unlawful even under LOAC because the individuals aboard the boats are not targetable under that law and the drugs are not military objectives. And in any event, the infamous Sept. 2 strike on the shipwrecked survivors would have been a clear violation of the LOAC prohibition on attacking those who are hors de combat, if LOAC applied (see, e.g., here and here).

Congress has begun demanding answers regarding the legality of the strikes generally, and the Sept. 2 attack specifically. We strongly support this exercise of legislative branch oversight. However, international law imposes its own obligations to investigate potential violations of both IHRL and LOAC. In this article, we explain those binding obligations. Our examination includes the source of the obligations, when they are required, and the criteria according to which they are conducted. In our view, the IHRL obligation to investigate has been triggered and, by the administration’s mischaracterization of the situation, so too would its LOAC counterpart. We close by noting that the Department of Defense’s own policies require an investigation into the operations, irrespective of whether the proper legal regime governing the strikes is IHRL or LOAC.

International Human Rights Law Investigations

State procedural duties to investigate potentially unlawful killings have long been recognized under IHRL as part of the State’s overarching positive obligation to protect the right to life. All human rights bodies take essentially the same approach to the parameters of this obligation. A useful summary can be found in the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment No. 36 (¶¶ 27-8 & 64), which sets out the Committee’s approach to interpreting Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the instrument’s provision on the right to life.

Similarly, an instructive summary of the European Court of Human Rights’ jurisprudence on the procedural duty to investigate can be found in its case law guide (pages 35-51) for Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on the right to life.

The law of human rights bodies on the procedural duty to investigate unlawful killings is rich and varied, dealing with many different types of situations, including armed conflict. More importantly, that law is clear and unambiguous, and its overall correctness is not open to doubt.

The following principles can be distilled from this body of law.

First, the duty to investigate arises when State authorities “know or should have known of potentially unlawful deprivations of life” (General Comment 36, ¶ 27) (emphasis added). That requirement is clearly met regarding the boat strikes – the State itself is doing them. The fact that the President and the Department of Justice’s Office of the Legal Counsel (OLC) by fiat declared them to be lawful does not make them any less unlawful, let alone potentially so. That’s even more the case if the OLC relied on presidential determinations of a NIAC and other matters (as indicated by reporting), rather than engaging in independent legal assessment of those issues.

Second, investigations “must be aimed at ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice, at promoting accountability and preventing impunity, at avoiding denial of justice and at drawing necessary lessons for revising practices and policies with a view to avoiding repeated violations. Investigations should explore, inter alia, the legal responsibility of superior officials with regard to violations of the right to life committed by their subordinates.” (id.) The issue of superior responsibility, discussed below, looms especially large in these strikes in light of the Secretary of Defense’s personal involvement in them. So does the need to revise practices and policies, which Hegseth suggested never occurred after the shipwreck strike.

Third, it is not sufficient for States to investigate unlawful deprivations of life “merely through administrative or disciplinary measures, and a criminal investigation is normally required, which should lead, if enough incriminating evidence is gathered, to a criminal prosecution.” (id.) Measures short of a criminal investigation might be appropriate for personnel on the operational periphery of the strikes, but certainly not for those who played a direct role in planning, approving, or executing them.

Fourth, “[i]mmunities and amnesties provided to perpetrators of intentional killings and to their superiors, and comparable measures leading to de facto or de jure impunity, are, as a rule, incompatible with the duty to respect and ensure the right to life, and to provide victims with an effective remedy.” (id.) The presumption against immunity and amnesties is especially significant in light of President Trump’s excessive pardon practices.

Fifth, investigations “must always be independent, impartial, prompt, thorough, effective, credible and transparent .… States parties need to take, among other things, appropriate measures to establish the truth relating to the events leading to the deprivation of life, including the reasons and legal basis for targeting certain individuals and the procedures employed by State forces before, during and after the time at which the deprivation occurred.” (General Comment 36, ¶ 28).

Sixth, these duties apply even extraterritorially and in situations of armed conflict, in parallel with similar duties under LOAC, which are discussed below. For instance, this year the European Court of Human Rights found Russia responsible for failing to effectively investigate the role of its authorities in the downing of the MH17 airliner over Ukraine in 2014 (see more here). Of course, the context of an armed conflict may require some flexibility in applying criteria, such as thoroughness and effectiveness, to account for what is realistically feasible under the circumstances (General Comment 36, ¶ 64, and ECHR cases such as Al-Skeini v. UK, Jaloud v. Netherlands, Hanan v. Germany, and Georgia v. Russia No. 2, all discussed in the case law guide, page 47).

It is important to note that no extenuating circumstances would apply to an investigation into the boat strikes. Not only were those strikes not conducted in the course of an armed conflict, as we have explained, but all relevant information and evidence regarding them is in the possession of U.S. authorities. What is crucial at the moment is securing such evidence.

Taken together, these points lead to an inexorable conclusion: the United States has a positive duty under IHRL to investigate the lethal strikes against alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean. That duty can be discharged only if the investigation is independent, meaning that the State organs conducting the investigation must be free from undue influence from those they are investigating. Moreover, while Congressional oversight is welcome, the positive duty can only be discharged through a criminal investigation by the armed forces or the Department of Justice, as appropriate. A perfunctory administrative investigation within the Pentagon would clearly not suffice, and any interference in the investigations would be unlawful under IHRL.

Law of Armed Conflict Investigations

As noted, it is clear that the U.S. strikes against the alleged drug traffickers are not occurring in the context of a non-international armed conflict. However, as the administration claims they are, by its logic, the United States would be bound by any obligation to conduct investigations into LOAC violations amounting to war crimes during such conflicts. Moreover, with the administration threatening to conduct operations directly against Venezuela, the obligation to investigate LOAC violations during an international armed conflict, which those operations would trigger, merits attention.

The law of armed conflict imposes a two-tiered obligation to investigate possible war crimes. The obligation derives primarily from the four 1949 Geneva Conventions. Note that since they are considered to reflect customary international law (Nuclear Weapons, para. 79), Geneva Convention obligations are binding on all States. That States shoulder a customary law obligation to investigate possible war crimes is simply beyond dispute (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 158 and accompanying practice; UNGA Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law, prin. I). Indeed, as noted in the DoD Law of War Manual (§ 18.13)

The duties to implement and enforce the law of war also imply duties to investigate reports of alleged violations of the law of war. In addition to taking measures to meet the requirements of DoD policy, commanders may also take other measures they deem appropriate to ensure appropriate investigation and reporting of alleged violations of the law of war within their command. (see also U.S. Navy/Marine Corps/Coast Guard Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations, § 6.2.6).

The first tier involves the duty to investigate potential “grave breaches,” which are set forth in the Geneva Conventions (GC I, arts. 49 & 50; GC II, art. 50 & 51; GC III, arts. 129 & 130; GC IV, arts. 146 & 147; see also AP I, arts. 11 & 85). Willful killing of protected persons, which includes civilians and those who are hors de combat (like shipwrecked persons), is one of the enumerated grave breaches.

These provisions require States to pursue prosecution of those suspected of committing grave breaches by: 1) enacting domestic legislation enabling prosecution of offenders; 2) searching for those accused of violating the Conventions; and 3) either prosecuting them or turning them over to another State that is willing to do so (aut dedere aut punire). The requirement to “search” for the accused has long been interpreted as mandating an investigation into a possible grave breach to determine whether to prosecute or to turn the accused over to another State.

Importantly, the grave breaches provisions apply only during an international armed conflict, which the current situation is not, even according to the administration’s mischaracterization of the situation. However, should the United States attack Venezuela, thereby initiating an international armed conflict, these obligations would be triggered. A failure by the United States to satisfy them would constitute an internationally wrongful act.

The second tier of the investigations requirement, and of immediate relevance to the boat strikes on the administration’s own theory that a non-international armed conflict exists, is based on the obligation to “take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions of the present convention other than the grave breaches.” It appears in the same provisions that set out the requirement for investigating grave breaches. The duty to suppress does not encompass a duty to prosecute or send an offender to another State for prosecution, but necessarily implies a duty to investigate in order to determine whether a violation has occurred, take appropriate disciplinary measures against any offender, and assess whether action can be taken to prevent further violations by others.

What is different is that the suppression obligation applies to violations of all of the Conventions’ rules, including Common Article 3. That article, which appears verbatim in all four Conventions, prohibits “violence to life and person” directed at “persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including those placed ‘hors de combat.’” And unlike most other Geneva Convention articles, Common Article 3 sets forth fundamental rules for non-international armed conflict, violations of which have been criminalized in U.S. law (18 USC 2441(c)(3)). The resulting treaty-based duty to investigate and prosecute potential war crimes, even with respect to non-international armed conflicts, undeniably reflects customary international law (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 158, and accompanying practice). Therefore, the consequence of the administration’s assertion that it is involved in such a conflict is, by its own flawed analysis, that the “suppression” obligation attaches not only to any violations that might occur during operations in Venezuela that trigger an international armed conflict, but also to the strikes on the boats against the cartels.

There are several non-exhaustive principles regarding such investigations that can be identified by examining these and related rules, such as Article 87 of Additional Protocol I (which does not bind the United States), and the practice of States in applying them (see Investigations Study).

First, the legal obligation under LOAC to report possible violations applies to all individuals who exercise command authority over military forces, although “[e]ffective compliance with the requirement necessitates policies extending it to any member of the armed forces with knowledge of a possible … violation” (Study, page 79).

Second, every credible allegation of a war crime must be investigated promptly. In the absence of an allegation, an investigation is required whenever there is a credible reason to suspect a violation has occurred (id.).

Third, the duty to investigate can be “satisfied by investigations at any level of command, but only so long as the investigation in question is effective in terms of uncovering relevant facts and circumstances that will permit appropriate disciplinary or punitive action to be taken” (id.).

Fourth, the investigations must be impartial and independent. This does not necessarily mean that investigators must be outside the chain of command, unlike investigative duties under IHRL, so long as their work is effective in ascertaining the facts. However, any attempt to interfere with the investigation is strictly prohibited. Moreover, commanders and other responsible officers may not order and oversee investigations into incidents involving themselves; instead, they must refer them to a higher command or a law enforcement organization. (Study, page 80, para. 10).

Fifth, in the event “clear and reliable evidence of a war crime” surfaces, States are required to prosecute those who have committed war crimes and take appropriate disciplinary or remedial measures for violations that do not amount to war crimes. (Study, page 81).

And sixth, investigations need not be conducted, as a matter of law, publicly or their findings released. That said, in many situations in which the possibility of a war crime has become public, as in this case, doing so is generally sound policy. (id.)

Given the widespread publicity over the boat attacks, especially the Sept. 2 strike on the shipwrecked survivors, as well as the extensive analysis by international law experts, there are obviously credible allegations of war crimes, assuming the administration’s framing of the situation as a non-international armed conflict is correct. Of course, it is not, as we have explained – war crimes cannot be committed in the absence of an armed conflict. But, given its position on the existence of such a conflict, the administration has no alternative but to launch a prompt, impartial, and independent investigation to comply with the LOAC requirement that applies in such conflicts.

It is crucial to bear in mind that in both international and non-international armed conflict, commanders and other superiors can be held criminally responsible for the war crimes of their subordinates if they knew, or had reason to know, that war crimes were being committed, or about to be committed, by them and failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the war crimes or to punish those responsible for crimes that had already been committed (ICRC, Customary IHL study, rule 153 and accompanying practice). Ordering investigations is an effective step in prosecuting offenders and in identifying measures that need to be taken to prevent future war crimes. Based on publicly available information, the Defense Secretary’s apparent failure to change policies following the Sept. 2 double-tap strike is highly relevant in any assessment of compliance with these obligations.

Should a commander or other superior fail to order an investigation when doing so is called for in the circumstances, that individual might be subject to prosecution for the underlying war crime on the basis of command (superior) responsibility. This is true both with regard to military personnel throughout the chain of command and civilian superiors such as the Secretary of Defense (DoD Law of War Manual, § 18.23.3.2). In this regard, it merits emphasis that war crimes are subject to universal jurisdiction, that is, offenders may be prosecuted by any State, even when there is no relationship between the war crime and the State engaging in the prosecution. Additionally, commanders who fail to comply with the obligation to investigate and take other measures to suppress LOAC violations may be punished under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for dereliction of duty or violation of orders (§ 18.23.3.1).

Finally, we remind readers that IHRL continues to apply during armed conflict, albeit with due regard for military realities. There are none in this case that would meaningfully impede an investigation in full compliance with the aforementioned IHRL criteria. Indeed, as a matter of law, IHRL is the only appropriate framework for the investigations, unless the United States carries out the administration’s threats to take military action against Venezuela itself.

DoD Implementation of the Investigation Requirements under IHRL and LOAC

The United States has implemented the obligation to investigate in DoD Directive 2311.01E, DoD Law of War Program (see also, DoD Law of War Manual, § 18.13). It provides that “[a]ll military and U.S. civilian employees, contractor personnel, and subcontractors assigned to or accompanying a DoD Component must report through their chain of command all reportable incidents” (¶ 4.1). A reportable incident is (page GL-15):

An incident that a unit commander or other responsible official determines, based on credible information, potentially involves: a war crime; other violations of the law of war; or conduct during military operations that would be a war crime if the military operations occurred in the context of an armed conflict. The unit commander or responsible official need not determine that a potential violation occurred; they need only find that credible information warrants further review of the incident. (emphasis added)

Importantly, even if an incident occurs outside armed conflict, as in these strikes, the reporting requirement still applies.

The commander of any unit who receives a report “about an alleged violation of the law of war must assess whether the allegation is based on credible information and thus constitutes a reportable incident.” (¶ 4.2). Information is credible when “a reasonable military commander would believe [it] to be sufficiently accurate to warrant further review of an alleged violation.” Note that “[t]he unit commander or responsible official need not determine a potential violation occurred, only that credible information merits further review of the incident.” Among the examples of “incidents that must be reported,” the U.S. Navy’s Commander’s Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations includes the following: “Offenses against … Survivors of Sunken Ships;” “When military interests permit, failure to search out, collect, make provision for the safety of, or to care for survivors of sunken ships;” “Attacks on individual civilians;” and proportionality violations (§ 6.3).

If a report is credible, the commander concerned has to direct a “properly scoped” assessment, investigation, inquiry, or other review that is deconflicted with any ongoing criminal investigation. Even if there is a criminal investigation, the commander would still want to determine the facts, as they may require measures to avoid repetition, such as changing the Rules of Engagement. Should no such investigation be underway, the commander is obligated to “refer information about alleged war crimes to, or request an investigation by, a responsible Defense Criminal Investigative Organization” (DoD Law of War Program, ¶ 4.2).

Even if the unit commander concludes that there is no credible information to support an allegation, that commander is nevertheless obligated to forward this determination through the chain of command to the appropriate Combatant Commander. In the case of the boat strikes and any attack on Venezuela, it would likely be the Commander of U.S. Southern Command, although the involvement of Special Operations Command complicates matters. In any event, the responsible Combatant Commander must then assess the decision and forward all reportable incidents to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and applicable Service Secretaries (¶ 4.3).

There is no question that boat strikes are reportable incidents that, based on credible information, should lead a reasonable commander to conclude there may have been a war crime, especially in light of the Navy’s own guidance on the type of incidents that qualify. If an armed conflict were underway, as the administration claims, it would raise serious questions about targeting individuals who are neither members of an organized armed group nor directly participating in the hostilities. Even if those killed in the attack were reasonably believed to be targetable in the circumstances, the prohibition on attacking those who are shipwrecked, one of the most fundamental rules in the law of naval warfare, was undeniably implicated. There are also problematic proportionality and precautions in attack issues. The intense controversy that the reports of the strike have sparked is a testament to the extent to which the entire campaign raises questions of both State responsibility for LOAC violations on the part of the United States and possible war crimes by some of those involved (see, esp. here).

Importantly, even though the strikes are not occurring during armed conflict (contrary to the administration’s claims), they still have to be reported and investigated. Recall that reportable incidents include incidents outside of armed conflict if the conduct would be a war crime during armed conflict. That is very clearly the case here. Simply put, it would be unsupportable to argue that the incident did not fall within the four corners of the “reportable incident” standard.

Concluding Thoughts

All of this leads to a relatively straightforward conclusion. Whether the boat strikes conducted thus far are assessed under international human rights law, the law of armed conflict, or the Department of Defense’s own policies, they have triggered an obligation on the United States to investigate them. That obligation is obligatory, not discretionary, and it is not satisfied by the administration’s claims to be acting lawfully or by congressional hearings. International law is clear. The boat strikes, and any questionable operations that may occur in the future, necessitate prompt, impartial, and effective investigations capable of gathering the facts and identifying those responsible. The fact that the United States controls the factual record of the incidents heightens the imperative to act promptly.

We are, however, not naïve. In the current political context, it is doubtful that across-the-board investigations into the boat strikes will occur. If any investigation is ordered, we anticipate it will be limited to the Sept. 2 second strike incident that has drawn so much attention. But this does not mean that the United States is not under a legal obligation to conduct one or more broader investigations into all of the strikes in accordance with its international obligations. The impunity resulting from a failure to do so is one we have seen at least once before – when the use of torture by U.S. officials in the “war on terror” went largely unpunished. A clear line connects that episode of impunity with the ongoing situation, in which uniformed and civilian government lawyers have no real choice but to carry out their legal and ethical duties.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/The_Pentagon_January_2008-1024x585.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:57:19.494290

Over the weekend, there were two deadly shootings on opposite sides of the globe. In Australia, at least 15 people were killed on Sunday when two gunmen fired on a crowd that was celebrating the start of Hanukkah on a beach in Sydney.

This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy.

The authorities described the shooting as an act of terrorism and said it was carried out by a father and son.

An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.

natalie kitroeff

It was the latest in a series of anti-Semitic attacks across Australia. And in the hours after Saturday’s shooting, several Jewish leaders said their warnings about escalating violence had been ignored. Among the victims was a Holocaust survivor who died shielding his wife from gunfire and a rabbi who organized the event. Meanwhile —

Today is a day that the city of Providence and the state of Rhode Island prayed would never come.

natalie kitroeff

In Providence, Rhode Island, a gunman burst into a classroom at Brown University on Saturday and started shooting, killing two people and injuring nine. Police are still searching for the suspect. The shooting contained a particularly American wrinkle. For at least two Brown students, it was their second school shooting.

It’s surreal already having to have done this once. This is the second time.

natalie kitroeff

Back in 2019, Mia Tretta was shot in her stomach by a school shooter when she was a freshman in high school in Santa Clarita, California. On Saturday night, Tretta, now a junior at Brown, was studying in her dorm room when she learned that the same thing was happening all over again, this time at her college.

But we got what felt like hundreds of texts saying that there is an active shooter. Stay inside. Stay where you are. Run, hide, fight.

natalie kitroeff

As Tretta told my co-host, Rachel Abrams, she had chosen to attend Brown because she felt a sense of safety on its campus.

And my whole sense of safety, and innocence, and childhood was taken away on November 14 of 2019 at Saugus High School. And trying to reclaim any of that back, I felt like I could do that at Brown. And now it’s just been taken away again.

natalie kitroeff

That’s all we for now about both of these shootings. We’ll keep you posted as we learn more.

Today, as Democrats debate how to counter President Trump’s aggressive crackdown on immigration and try to win back voters with their own vision, we look back at why former President Biden let the border get so out of control in the first place and how he underestimated just how much the problem would come to define his presidency. My colleague, Chris Flavelle, takes us into his investigation of how Biden fumbled the issue of immigration and what his party can learn from his missteps.

It’s Monday, December 15.

Chris, you’ve spent much of this fall taking a forensic look back at what many consider to be one of the Biden administration’s biggest failures, its immigration policy. Under Biden, immigration at the border surged to record numbers. Many say it cost Democrats the election in 2024 and set the stage for the immigration crackdown that we’re in the middle of right now. I want to just start by asking, why look back on that policy in this moment, a year after Biden left office?

chris flavelle

So this moment looks a whole lot like 2020, right? You’ve got President Trump in the White House enacting really aggressive strategies in terms of arrests and deportations of migrants. You’ve got really, really strong anger from Democrats and others in response to those policies. And you’ve got Democrats as a party trying to figure out what position to take. That’s exactly what was happening in 2020 as Joe Biden was first campaigning for the presidency and then deciding after winning what to do as president.

He responded to those same pressures by charting a really aggressive counter campaign, being the anti-Trump. And we saw, with the benefit of hindsight, what the result was, huge surge in border encounters, massive shift in public opinion against Democrats, and, ultimately, Donald Trump returning to the White House again on a campaign against migrants and an open border. So I think the question of why did things go so badly and what did Democrats learn is actually really relevant right now and is very timely, because that question of what does the party stand for and what do Americans want for the border and immigration remains fundamentally unresolved.

So that’s why I went back and spent months looking at this question of why did Biden and his close aides make the decisions they did. And what I found was, surprisingly, a lot of those mistakes and blowback was preordained and warned, and they did it anyway.

natalie kitroeff

Preordained how? What do you mean by that?

chris flavelle

So let’s go back to the summer of 2020. You’re now approaching the height of the campaign. Joe Biden is seeking the presidency on a platform of being much more welcoming towards immigrants. As this is happening, I learned, some of his advisors began circulating a memo with a really important warning.

This memo, which we got a copy of, said that, combined with everything else that was going on, the pent up demand for migration under Trump, the economic devastation from COVID, on top of that, Mr. Biden’s own promises and his more welcoming tone, they warned, could produce a really serious surge in border crossings. And reading that language today, it’s remarkable how on the nose it was.

That memo said, quote, “At the US border, a potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities, and imperil the agenda of the new administration.” These warnings did not go over well with Biden’s campaign team. But these advisors kept on raising this through the ranks of the organization until, finally, after Biden had won election, he got a briefing from the people who worked on this memo.

And I’m told during that briefing that the president-elect and Kamala Harris, the vice President-elect, seemed to grasp that this was a problem, but they wound up ignoring those recommendations to change course.

natalie kitroeff

Just so I make sure I understand this, you’re saying that very early on, even before Biden won, there were advisors who wrote this memo who eventually carried out this briefing warning about the perils of immediately doing everything he said he would during the campaign, but Biden and Harris ignored them. Explain why.

chris flavelle

Yeah, look, the why is epic, right? The first part of the why is politics. It’s worth remembering what the mood was in 2020. This was the height of Black Lives Matter. This was a moment in American history when there was a real belief, especially among Democrats, that there was a racial reckoning underway.

And it seems as though the political calculus was they couldn’t turn their back on that. They couldn’t, in that atmosphere, decide they would get a little more aggressive on border enforcement. That’s the external why. The internal why, the staffing choices in the Biden administration early on reflected this idea that it was both politically sound and morally necessary to focus on how to help asylum seekers and not to focus as much on enforcing the border.

natalie kitroeff

So that’s the pressure he’s facing. But what does Biden himself think of this issue?

chris flavelle

One of the really strong through lines from almost all of my interviews with more than 30 people who worked in the administration on border and migration issues is that none of them felt like they really understood what Biden’s own views were. In fact, they weren’t sure he held strong, clear views and positions on immigration and the border. There were a few things he clearly cared about. One was he didn’t want to see kids held in these difficult conditions at border patrol stations. He didn’t want to be seen as doing anything like what Trump had done in terms of forcing migrants to remain in Mexico while they were waiting for their claims to be heard.

But beyond that, one of the strongest criticisms I heard was that Biden, as President, did not set broad strategic goals. There was a sense that he just didn’t like talking about this issue. One person told me that Biden’s body language changed. You could tell he was uncomfortable when he was talking about migration.

natalie kitroeff

Fascinating. He was physically uncomfortable talking about it. But it sounds to the extent that he was thinking about the issue, he does have sympathy with the side that believes there’s a moral imperative to reversing the signature pieces of Trump’s immigration crackdown. And we know that, once in office, that’s exactly what Biden does. So describe that. Describe what happened.

chris flavelle

Yeah, Joe Biden, the first day he was in the White House, made good on what he had promised to do during the campaign. He reversed almost all of Trump’s signature policies. He said he would stop building the wall. He dramatically reduced the scope of arrests inside the country for migrants.

He ended, or tried to end, what they called the Remain in Mexico Policy, forcing migrants to wait while their cases were heard. He stopped sending kids back over the border under the public health rules for COVID. And he announced that he would put a halt on deportations for 100 days.

natalie kitroeff

Right. And what followed from signaling a more welcoming stance toward migrants was, in fact, a huge surge at the border.

chris flavelle

Yeah, it was a disaster almost immediately.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

You could look at this as the first of a series of major miscalculations that the Biden team made on immigration, failing to anticipate the scale of the numbers of the people who were coming. During the campaign and the transition, as they prepared for these scenarios, they said, let’s plan around the idea that the number of people crossing the border once Biden is in office will equal the worst year or the worst month under Trump, and then just stay there.

And the reaction to that proposal was, well, it could never get that bad. And sure enough, by March of Biden’s first year in office, they had blown past the worst month of the first Trump administration. And then not only did it stay at those levels, it kept on rising. So even the people whose job was to think, well, how bad could it be turned out to be incredibly mistaken. They just didn’t imagine the geographic and numerical scale of migrants who would try to reach the border.

natalie kitroeff

And when it becomes clear just how bad it is, what’s Biden’s response to the chaos?

chris flavelle

Biden and his team were focused on responding to the immediate crisis of children who were stuck in border patrol stations that were not designed for them. And so their emphasis, their goal in the moment, was to find something to do with these children, to move them somewhere safe that made sense for them. It was a real situation of trying to react to events and just mitigate the damage. But there was no overarching vision of, well, what should the US do on the border and securing the border?

natalie kitroeff

You’re describing a paralysis from the White House. No real policymaking vision from the top. I have to ask, who is driving the car on this? If it’s not Biden, then who’s making the calls?

chris flavelle

One of the themes from my reporting was nobody was driving the bus.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Over and over again, people who worked in this told me that part of the reason for the policymaking paralysis was there was, during the early period, no single person who was specifically assigned responsibility to figure out and implement policy on the border and immigration. In the absence of that, you had different factions that had different views. You had people inside the White House who came from the world of immigration advocacy generally more favorable to migrants and asylum seekers.

You had people who came to this from more of a national security mindset. And they tended to emphasize enforcement of the border. And they couldn’t agree. And above all of that, you had this inner circle around the president that really thought, you know what? There’s no win here. We’re not going to get points for talking about this. Let’s just not talk about it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

I remember I was covering these issues at the time from Mexico City. And it was stark how the White House didn’t want to speak to this, as you say, but everyone else, regular people, were talking about it. They were concerned about what was going on.

chris flavelle

Yeah. And look, to the degree that there was a logic here, I’m told that the logic was if we just don’t talk about it, maybe it’ll resolve on its own. And the first time I heard that from someone who’d been involved in these conversations, I thought, that’s clearly crazy.

But there was some rationale behind it because that had happened in the past. Border surges in 2014 when Biden was vice president in the Obama administration. Surges under the first Trump administration. The border numbers had eventually subsided, and public attention had moved on. And they hoped the same would happen again, but they were wrong. These numbers did not fade. Instead, the surge kept on getting worse and worse.

natalie kitroeff

OK, so the White House wants to be silent on this. They don’t want to touch the issue. Remind us, what’s the reaction among Americans, among regular people, to the waves of migrants that are now coming in?

chris flavelle

Yeah, the polling data shows a real shift. And that shift goes in the opposite direction. It shows that more Americans are becoming worried about illegal immigration, and the support for migrants is falling, seemingly in response to this perception of chaos at the border. And now you would think that that polling data would be a red flag, but it wasn’t because of still more political miscalculations.

The administration, the people around Biden, were worried that if they got more aggressive on the border on enforcement, they risked alienating Latino voters who were an important part of the coalition that brought Biden to the White House. And beyond that, they figured that other American voters just wouldn’t care that much. They thought that unless you live in a border state, this wouldn’t be a real priority for you.

And sure enough, that situation didn’t last because, eventually, Texas found a way to make it a problem for the rest of the country. In April of 2022, Governor Greg Abbott of Texas figures out how to blow up this idea that Biden could ignore the border by starting a campaign to actually bus migrants from Texas to Washington, DC, and effectively say to Biden and the Democrats, you cannot ignore this. We won’t let you.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

We’ll be right back.

Describe this campaign, Chris, led by Governor Abbott, to bring this problem directly to Democrats’ doorsteps and, as you said, make it impossible to ignore. Remind us how that all played out.

chris flavelle

The campaign started with one bus.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

In April of 2022, there was a bus that arrived from Texas to Washington, DC. It pulled up near the US Capitol. And we know from data we got from a public records request that bus was carrying 12 Venezuelans, four Colombians, four Cubans, and four Nicaraguans. And it was the start of what became tens of thousands of migrants from Texas moved by bus over months and years to New York and Washington, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, eventually Denver.

And the result was really remarkable. You had, all of a sudden, mayors and governors in democratically-held areas saying, whoa, this is a problem for us. This is a problem financially. We’ve got to pay to find hotel rooms and shelters for these people. We’ve got a political problem. Our voters don’t like seeing this surge of people on the streets.

Publicly, the Biden White House is saying, come on, this is a stunt. You’re using migrants as props. This is despicable. That was the public response. But internally, this campaign by Abbott was described to me as a turning point where people who worked for the administration began to think, you know what? We actually have lost this debate. This is the moment at which people are going to turn on us. And it pushed the White House to at least say, OK, well, we can’t do nothing. What are we going to do?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

natalie kitroeff

And what do they do now that they’ve finally started to wake up to this?

chris flavelle

Yeah, so in this year, 2023, the third year that Biden is President, this administration tried two big swings to reduce the sense of chaos at the border. One of them was a program to take people from a handful of countries, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela, that had made up a big share of border crossers, and say, you know what? Instead of rushing the border, we’ll just let you in.

We’ll have a program that’s formal. You can apply, you can pass a background check, and you can fly into the country. That will reduce pressure at the border. That was their first idea. And then second, they said, people who want to cross the border still, OK, here’s an app, CBP1. And you have to wait and make an appointment.

Both those programs were intended to control the flow and reduce the sense of chaos. But by the one metric that mattered most, which was border crossings and border encounters, none of this worked. The numbers from that final few months of 2023 are incredibly clear. The border crossings had by this point tripled since Biden took office. They were reaching a quarter of a million people per month, just totally without any kind of precedent. And that’s when the Biden administration finally realized they had to get much more serious and much more aggressive.

natalie kitroeff

And what does that look like, getting more serious and more aggressive?

chris flavelle

It’s a few things. First of all, they decided to get on board with Senate talks that had begun a few months earlier, trying to look for a bipartisan deal to give the White House authority to effectively close the border to asylum applications. Also, at the very end of December, senior Biden officials flew down to Mexico City to meet with their Mexican counterparts and deliver a really tough message to Mexico, saying, we need you to close your own Southern border because that’s the only way we’re going to reduce the number of people getting to the US border.

And that worked. The Mexicans took action and, in response to that pressure, really aggressively cracked down on their own border. And you see that in the numbers. In January of 2024, Biden’s last year in office, those numbers had fallen, but not nearly enough. They were still facing much higher crossings than when Biden first came to office. And this is where the pressure gets even more intense, because in February of 2024, that border bill that was moving through the Senate collapses when President Trump, then candidate Trump, tells Republicans to vote against it.

So all of a sudden, Biden faces a real dilemma. And the election is less than a year away. That’s when they begin looking at what you think of as the nuclear option, which is finally using the power that Biden had, unilaterally, of his own authority, to effectively close the border to asylum applications, which he did in June of that year. And the thing that was amazing was it basically worked. The numbers plummeted almost right away. And so from a policy perspective, he had basically solved the problem.

natalie kitroeff

Yeah. Chris, help me understand this. I had this question at the time. I have this question now. Why did it take him so long to use executive action to do this?

chris flavelle

You ask 20 people, you get 20 answers, right? One answer that I got was they just didn’t believe it was right. This was not in keeping with Democrats’ principles about respecting the dignity of migrants. They want to respect the law. They couldn’t do it and wouldn’t until they felt they had to.

Another argument is they wanted to give Congress every possible chance to do this on their own, and only when it was crystal clear Congress wouldn’t do it. Only then would Biden do this himself. Whatever it was, I think, in hindsight, what’s clear is it didn’t work. They waited too long to get any meaningful benefit from doing this.

natalie kitroeff

Explain that. Where are voters on this? Why didn’t it work? Why didn’t it convince people that they were on the right track?

chris flavelle

Yeah, there’s two ways of thinking about why it didn’t work. One is just the calendar was so unforgiving, right? At this point, you’re five months away from Election Day. Voters, to the extent they’ve been paying attention, have lived through 3 and 1/2 years almost of border crisis. So that idea, that perception that Biden and Democrats favor open borders, is really cemented by this point.

But the other argument is, even after taking this step, they wouldn’t brag about it. They did not go out and say, look what we did. And I’m told by senior Democrats, that view persisted. That view of if we’re talking about immigration and talking about the border, they’re losing. And so they decided not to focus on it. Even at the end, once they had effectively solved the problem, that inherent foundational skittishness remained.

natalie kitroeff

I want to just talk about everything you’ve told us. It is really hard to overstate the significance of it, the significance of the fallout of Biden’s miscalculations on immigration. Obviously, it led to Trump’s return to office in part, and that has totally transformed the country. But there is this potentially deeper, longer-lasting impact that you point to in your reporting, which is that it actually helped lead to this rightward shift in the American public’s views of immigration. Can you describe that for me? And just help me understand how durable you think that shift is.

chris flavelle

The honest answer, of course, is no one knows how durable that shift is. There is polling data that has come in since Donald Trump came back to the White House, showing that some of the intense unease about immigration that really spiked by the end of the Biden years. That unease has softened a bit, and those numbers have receded to the pre-Biden levels.

But what that doesn’t account for is, anecdotally and based on conversations with people who work in this, there seems to be a real sense of lingering anger among American voters, Democrats, Republicans, the sense that people remain collectively a little bit scarred by what they saw when Biden was president.

natalie kitroeff

The question you’re pushing on is, are Democrats going to swing the pendulum back to more permissive immigration policies now that there is a backlash against Trump? Or are they going to look back at what Biden did and say, look, these are mistakes that we don’t want to repeat? And you talk to these folks. Do you have any clarity on that?

chris flavelle

I see no evidence from the reporting I did that Democrats have answered that question. I don’t get the sense that they have figured out what the lessons are from the Biden years and what they should say on immigration going forward. And I think the challenge that Democrats face is actually the same challenge facing Republicans, which is being squeezed between two extremes, right? We know that the Trump style approach of extremely aggressive crackdowns can work at reducing border crossings, and it can satisfy some portion of Americans.

But there’s a real pushback, right? It sure seems like many American voters are uneasy about the severity of the Trump approach. On the other hand, as we saw in the last four years, a lot of Americans are uneasy with the perception of open borders. And the challenge for moderate Democrats or moderate Republicans will be trying to find a third approach. But even if they can figure out what that is from a policy perspective, can they get American voters to accept it?

And maybe the room for new ideas, something closer to a more welcoming approach, is, for the foreseeable future, closed politically because of that lingering anger from the Biden years. And so maybe the real legacy of Joe Biden on immigration is that people’s willingness to give immigrants the benefit of the doubt, or even give Democrats the benefit of the doubt, is, at least for now, gone.

Well, Chris, thank you.

Here’s what else you need to today. Syrian and American officials confirmed that a gunman who killed two US Army soldiers and an American interpreter on Saturday was a member of Syria’s security forces who was set to be dismissed for his extremist views. The attack, which officials said was carried out by ISIS, claimed the first US casualties in Syria since the country’s strongman leader, Bashar al-Assad, was ousted from power a year ago. President Trump has vowed to retaliate.

Iranian man says ICE detention in NM is unlawful

In U.S. legally since 2024, Hamid Ziaei was jailed in June without explanation

In 2024, Hamid Ziaei came from Iran to the U.S. and was detained.Soon after, an immigration judge said that because Ziaei would likely face persecution if he returned to Iran, he could stay here under certain conditions, and he settled into a life in San Diego, an Innovation Law Lab news release said.In a regularly scheduled check-in in June, the judge's decision was ignored, and Ziaei was held without explanation by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and taken to the Torrance County Detention Facility in New Mexico.On Monday, Dec. 15, Ziaei and legal counsel will be in federal court in Albuquerque with a habeas corpus petition asserting that he has been detained unlawfully. Tiffany Wang, a fellow attorney at Innovation Law Lab — which is representing Ziaei — said the best outcome would be an immediate decision allowing him to return to his home in California. The judge could also want more time to decide, or could consider having Ziaei deported to another country. No such country has been named, and returning him to Iran is not allowed, Wang said.""I think it's important to understand that so many people just like Hamid have been building lives in the U.S., contributing, and have been indiscriminately swept away by ICE, shipped hundreds of miles away from the communities and everything they were doing,"" Wang said. ""There are procedures that ICE must follow, and they have completely thrown those out the window. And we're fighting against that."".

Dugan confronted the federal agents as they waited outside her courtroom.
Days later, Dugan was arrested and handcuffed by FBI agents and charged with obstruction and concealing an individual.
Her case catalyzed protests outside the Milwaukee FBI Office, and was repeatedly mentioned at the summer’s No Kings protests.
Her legal team initially attempted to have the case thrown out, t arguing that Dugan is covered by judicial immunity.","A federal jury will begin hearing the case against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Hannah Dugan, 66, on Monday in a lawsuit that has drawn national attention, weighing how far the Trump administration can go in squashing resistance to its nationwide crackdown on immigrants.

The case revolves around events in April, when Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a 30-year-old Mexican immigrant who had been charged with battery, appeared in Dugan’s courtroom. Federal agents also arrived at the courtroom that day, seeking Flores-Ruiz, whom they said entered the country illegally over a decade ago.

Dugan confronted the federal agents as they waited outside her courtroom. Later, she led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out of her courtroom through a side door which led into the same hallway where the federal agents were waiting. Flores-Ruiz was followed into the elevator and outside by the agents, who chased and then arrested him.

Days later, Dugan was arrested and handcuffed by FBI agents and charged with obstruction and concealing an individual. FBI Director Kash Patel posted photographs of Dugan in handcuffs and celebrated her arrest, writing on X, “No one is above the law.”

In early April, prior to Flores-Ruiz, ICE arrested two other people at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. Officials expressed concerns that the arrests were causing defendants, witnesses and victims to avoid coming to court or cooperating with law enforcement.

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley objected to what he characterized as intimidation tactics in enforcing its immigration crackdown and wielding the power of the state against “anyone who opposes these policies.” In a statement, Crowley said, “we have an obligation to administer our courts in a safe, efficient manner that delivers due process for anyone.”

Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera, said that the Trump officials “basically want to be unleashed to do whatever they want to commit these raids in courtrooms across the country.” Milwaukee-area Democratic Sens. Chris Larson and Tim Carpenter and Reps. Christine Sinicki, Darrin Madison, Supreme Moore Omokunde, Angelito Tenorio, and Sequanna Taylor issued a joint statement calling the county courthouse “a sanctuary for justice and peace where the accused come forward willingly in a fair an unbiased process”, and warned that “arresting people out of a courtroom will lead to a breakdown of civil society.”

At the end of April, the Wisconsin Supreme Court suspended Dugan with pay. Her case catalyzed protests outside the Milwaukee FBI Office, and was repeatedly mentioned at the summer’s No Kings protests. In July, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill to withhold pay for suspended judges.

“In these rare circumstances, these judges’ actions and alleged misconduct rose to such a level that suspension was warranted,” the bill’s authors, Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee), Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) and Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) wrote in a memo. “Simply put, Wisconsin taxpayers must be protected from the misconduct and/or commission of a crime by rogue judges.”

If convicted, Dugan, who has pleaded not guilty, faces six years in prison. Her legal team initially attempted to have the case thrown out, t arguing that Dugan is covered by judicial immunity. That argument was rejected by U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, who wrote that judges have civil immunity for official actions, but not criminal immunity, and that the case should go forward.

“As she said after her unnecessary arrest, Judge Dugan asserts her innocence and looks forward to being vindicated in court,” Dugan’s defense attorneys said in a statement.

On Thursday night, a crowd gathered outside the federal courthouse to support Dugan.

Therese Heeg, 66, told the Wisconsin Examiner that she felt a responsibility to attend the rally to “protect our democracy for my children, my grandchildren, my son-in-law who’s unable to live in the U.S. because he’s from Africa, my best friend’s children who are Hispanic who are afraid for their lives, even though they’re citizens.” Heeg said she’s worried about immigration enforcement coming to the city to take people away. “Every single day there’s more and more atrocities happening right here,” said Heeg. “We are trapping people in camps…I used to wonder what it was like to live under the Nazis, and now I know, I’m living it. It’s shocking, it’s hard to comprehend at the same time that it’s happening every single day.

Jury selection on Thursday was closed off from the public and media by U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, who is hearing the case. Adelman was responding to concerns from both the prosecution and defense that public questioning would taint the jury. An audio feed allowing media to listen to the jury selection process was restored following a legal challenge by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Sister Barbara Pfarr, who is among the leaders of the faith-based social justice group MICAH, said that the national attention on Dugan’s case shows that the judge struck a nerve by standing up to the Trump administration. Pfarr was disturbed by the effort to restrict press access during jury selection, and wondered whether anything similar would happen during the trial. “That’s the other big reason that I’m here, we’ve lost our democracy.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0306-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:58:23.884514

A woman who was four months pregnant and experiencing bleeding had not been seen by a doctor for months.
Some pregnant women were sleeping on concrete floors.
A woman who was four months pregnant was denied medication for gestational diabetes.
As Nezer told me: “Before this year, detaining pregnant women was the rare exception, and there were safeguards.","Absorbing the news about the brutal treatment of detainees, to say nothing of the outright murder of “suspected” drug runners in the Caribbean, I think back to a conversation I had in February of this year. My interlocutor was a Trump voter who had just had a friendly encounter with an African immigrant striver – the kind who came from poverty and had started a successful business here.

I recall saying, “I hope he has his documents in order.”

The Trump voter scoffed: “They’re not going after people like him. They’re only going after the criminals.”

Eleven months later, that naive faith has been smashed. Not his – mine. I have no idea how that person feels about the Trump administration now, but when I advised in February that they were going to cast a wide net for deportations, I had no idea how bad it would be. This is not just a matter of aggressive deportation. The things that are being done by our government to our fellow human beings are monstrous.

The testimony of the Venezuelans who were deported to CECOT prison in El Salvador is harrowing. Snatched from workplaces or homes on mere suspicion of being criminals, 252 men were bundled onto planes and flown to a prison known for torture. There, courtesy of a heinous bargain between Trump and Nayib Bukele, the dictator of El Salvador, they were “trampled, kicked … forced to kneel for hours,” as well as waterboarded, forced to sleep on mesh metal bunks, shot with rubber bullets, forced into stress positions (including the “crane” in which their wrists were handcuffed behind their backs and then lifted to put pressure on the shoulders and back) and sexually assaulted. At least one attempted suicide. Their accounts are available now only because El Salvador arranged a prisoner exchange with Venezuela in July.

Copious reporting has since demonstrated that only a fraction of those deported had criminal records in the United States and most of those were for relatively minor offenses such as shoplifting, possession of drug paraphernalia or traffic violations. Only six had convictions for violent crimes.

Those enjoying what they imagine is righteous pleasure at the abuse of the “worst of the worst” might want to consider the testimony of Physicians for Human Rights or the Women’s Refugee Commission, both of which have reported on the treatment of a group that the Trump administration apparently considers a dire threat: pregnant, nursing and postpartum women.

Melanie Nezer, vice president for advocacy and external relations at the Women’s Refugee Commission, described the conditions that hundreds of these women are facing in U.S. detention centers. A woman who was four months pregnant and experiencing bleeding had not been seen by a doctor for months. Another had a miscarriage and was deported while still bleeding.

Nezer described pregnant women being forced into overcrowded detention facilities with inadequate sanitary facilities, only frozen burritos or potato chips to eat, lack of clean drinking water (except by purchase) and no medical care or medicines. Some pregnant women were sleeping on concrete floors. A woman who was four months pregnant was denied medication for gestational diabetes.

Among these dangerous criminals that the Trump administration is devoting huge resources to detaining and deporting were a mother arrested as she was on her way to pick up her special-needs child from school, a mother separated from her 2-month-old baby, the mother of a 5-year-old whose husband is a U.S. citizen and hundreds of others (though exact numbers are impossible to obtain due to government noncooperation). Among those Nezer interviewed in Honduras were housecleaners, restaurant workers and stay-at-home moms. All of them were working, and quite a few had open asylum cases pending.

As Nezer told me: “Before this year, detaining pregnant women was the rare exception, and there were safeguards. Now it happens all the time and conditions are beyond inhumane.”

ICE agreements with local entities

What they're saying:

The Attorney General’s Office stated that only county boards of commissioners, not sheriffs, can enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE.

This comes after Ramsey County Attorney John Choi requested an opinion to clarify if Minnesota sheriffs are allowed to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE and if those agreements permit local police officers to detain anyone who would otherwise be released from custody without a civil detainer from ICE.

The opinion highlights that sheriffs can enter contracts for police services with towns and cities, but not with the federal government. This distinction indicates that the omission of federal contracts is intentional, according to AG Ellison's opinion.

The opinion also clarifies that 287(g) agreements do not authorize Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals solely based on ICE detainers. Officers must comply with state arrest laws.

The backstory:

The opinion builds on a February 2025 ruling that prohibits holding individuals based solely on immigration detainers if state law requires their release.

It provides eligible migrants with work authorisation and temporary protection from deportation.

""After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate U.S. Government agencies, the Secretary determined that Ethiopia no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a notice posted in the Federal Register.

Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorisation and temporary protection from deportation.

The program was created in 1991, and under Biden, it was extended to cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians. Noem reversed the extensions in February, saying they were no longer justified.

In recent months, the administration has removed the protective status for migrants from numerous countries, including Haiti, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. In November, Trump announced the termination of protection for Somalis in Minnesota.

Trump has made controlling immigration a central plank of his second White House term. Cancelling TPS protections is a boost to the administration's campaign to deport millions of people.

The cancellations have been challenged in court.

The Supreme Court in October cleared the way for the administration to revoke TPS for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the United States, granting a request to put on hold a federal judge's ruling that Noem lacked the authority to terminate the status while litigation proceeds.

The Homeland Security department also said on Friday it was no longer processing legacy cases under the Cuban and Haitian family reunification parole program, according to a post in the Federal Register.

The Department of Politics and International Relations sponsored a conversation about ICE tactics and the Trump administration’s immigration policies on Dec. 3. The discussion was moderated by department chair Michael McKoy. About 300 people attended.

Director of Wheaton’s Center for Faith, Politics and Economics David Iglesias ‘80, and Vice President of Advocacy and Policy at World Relief Matthew Soerens ‘06 participated in the conversation. Both speakers are Wheaton graduates.

“We hold this event with a certain amount of trembling,” McKoy said before the conversation began. The event follows a discussion panel in late November about the immigration crackdown.

McKoy acknowledged that the topic of ICE is controversial, even on Wheaton’s campus, and said that the goal of the discussion was shalom, “a wholesome, righteous and just peace.”

On Oct. 12, Wheaton students organized a prayer and worship service in front of Broadview ICE Processing Facility as a form of protesting ICE in Chicagoland. Many students have been involved with off-campus anti-ICE efforts.

Soerens and Iglesias began by sharing their experiences with immigration.

Iglesias served in the Navy from 1985 to 1988 and from 2008 to 2014. He also served as team leader, prosecutor and spokesman for the U.S. Military Commissions, dealing with war crimes and terrorism cases. He was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve as U.S. attorney for the District of New Mexico from 2001 to 2007.

Soerens interned for World Relief during college, and has worked for them the past 20 years. He received his masters in international public service from DePaul University in 2010. He has previously taught for the Humanitarian Disaster Institute at Wheaton and has co-authored three books about refugees and the immigration system.

After making introductions, the pair moved on to the topic of immigration policy changes under Trump’s administration.

Soerens said that last year ICE’s budget was between $3 billion and $4 billion. This year, as a result of the “Big Beautiful Bill”, the budget is now $170 billion. He added that the funding was drawn from various government programs, including the Transportation Security Administration.

Iglesias focused on how every administration has to implement immigration reform.

“I think there has been a crisis for a long time,” he said. “The crisis is that we don’t have a system that works.” Iglesias framed this crisis as a bipartisan problem that both the Obama and Bush administrations failed to solve. He asked the audience to suspend judgement on the policies of the current administration.

“Just give it a chance,” Iglesias said. “Just wait — if Trump’s right, you could see some real world changes.”

He was particularly weary of media coverage comparing the Trump administration to the Nazis.

“We’re not living in a new Nazi age, we are trying to fix problems that have been unresolved for decades,” Iglesias said.

Soerens discussed some possible solutions to the decades-long immigration crisis that Iglesias referred to. He said there should be an easier pathway for undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. to become legal citizens, barring any criminal convictions. This solution has been proposed in Congress as the Dignity Act, which has been gaining bipartisan support in Congress recently.

This proposal intrigued sophomore international relations major Katherine McCulloch, who said that Soerens offered “a solution I hadn’t heard before.”

Throughout the conversation, Iglesias expressed concern about whether the U.S. has the capacity to accommodate the number of people hoping to immigrate. He cited a poll taken in Mexico showing that most Mexican citizens would choose to live in the U.S. According to Iglesias, the U.S. does not have enough infrastructure, vehicles or food to support 100 million immigrants.

Soerens said he is more concerned about population decline than overpopulation, particularly given that the U.S. fertility rate hit an all-time low in 2024. While Iglesias emphasized the need for immigration limits, Soerens emphasized that immigrants are crucial for the U.S. economy’s well-being.

Junior urban studies student Anya Miller, who admitted that she had walked into the event with a bias toward a particular side, remarked that the discussion was more “civil” than she expected — reflecting the goals McKoy outlined at the beginning of the event.

“Shalom requires the courage to have difficult conversations, and that is why we are here tonight,” McKoy said.",https://thewheatonrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/unknown.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 22:57:21.253359

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council. “We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”

A company affiliated with the tribe’s business arm signed a year-long, $29.9 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 29. The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database. Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.

The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.

Rupnick, in a nearly 3-minute video address, said the tribe is “working on canceling this contract and fully disassociating the nation from it.”

He said the tribe risks losing future government contract awards in its efforts to extract itself from this one, but he said the tribe’s values must come first.

“I am sick to my stomach and frankly heartbroken that members of our nation put economic development — though it is sorely needed — above our moral obligations to other persecuted people,” Rupnick said.

The Tribe owns Prairie Band LLC, and Rupnick said it was created to secure employment and economic opportunities, “but it is also why we cannot compromise our values and seek to profit off the backs of our brothers and sisters in struggle.”

The second Trump administration has targeted immigrants, sometimes regardless of citizenship status or criminal history, detaining more than 65,000 people as of Nov. 16, according to ICE data analyzed by TRAC, a nonprofit data research project. Most of those people, nearly 48,000 did not have a criminal conviction.

Kansas has three facilities that house detainees and the potential for one more. Authorities at the Chase County jail in Cottonwood Falls, the Finney County jail in Garden City and the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth detain a combined average of 175 people on a given day.

“Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by ICE agents,” Omar, who said her son was born in the U.S., told WCCO-TV of the Twin Cities in an interview Sunday. “Once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go.”

Omar, who immigrated to the U.S. when she was 12 after having fled Somalia’s civil war, also accused ICE of “racially profiling” her community.

“They are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented,” she said.

About 80,000 people of Somali descent live in Minnesota.

Representatives for ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and Omar’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An administration official previously told NBC News that ICE was not specifically targeting Somali immigrants.

Omar’s on-air remarks came after she sent a letter to DHS on Friday about this month’s immigration operations in her state while signing onto another letter to DHS with other Democratic lawmakers the same day requesting answers about President Donald Trump’s pledge last month to “immediately” end temporary legal protections for Somalis living in Minnesota. The administration has taken steps to end similar protections for Haitians, Afghans and Venezuelans living in the U.S.

Trump has repeatedly disparaged Omar, Somalia and Somali immigrants.

“We always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right?” Trump told a crowd of supporters last week in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. “Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Trump’s recent focus on Minnesota and Omar comes after The New York Times reported that dozens of people of Somali descent have been convicted in connection with fraud schemes related to the theft of around $1 billion in Covid relief funds.

“Here in the United States, we don’t blame the crimes of an individual on a whole community,” Omar said in Sunday’s interview. “We are, as Minnesotans, also outraged, the fact that our tax dollars were defrauded.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251202-ilhan-omar-ew-546p-c1378d.jpg",N,,2025-12-14 21:56:30.325557

Yet the case is doctrinally important because two detailed dissents, by Justice Welch and Justice Thomas (joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh), crystallize competing approaches to three interlocking questions:

Does the Court of Claims Act’s one-year notice provision, MCL 600.6431, apply to actions seeking purely prospective relief (injunctions/declarations aimed at future harms)?

Does that notice provision apply to suits against state officers (e.g., the Governor) in their official capacity?

How does Michigan’s doctrine of sovereign immunity interact with the enforcement of federal and state constitutional rights, especially under the federal Ex parte Young framework for prospective relief?

The underlying dispute concerns access to workers’ compensation benefits for undocumented workers in Michigan, and whether a policy of denying such benefits violates due process under the United States and Michigan Constitutions. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), a nonprofit legal organization, sued Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her official capacity, seeking only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the continued enforcement of the allegedly unlawful policy.

The Court of Appeals held that MIRC’s action was barred because MIRC failed to comply with the Court of Claims Act’s one-year notice requirement. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to review that ruling. Justice Welch and Justice Thomas, however, would have granted leave and reversed, articulating significant legal principles about:

the temporal reach of notice and limitations provisions, and

the ability of private parties to seek prospective constitutional relief against state officials despite sovereign immunity and statutory procedural barriers.

This commentary analyzes those dissents, the precedents they rely on, and the implications for constitutional litigation in Michigan.

II. Summary of the Opinion and Procedural Posture

A. The Order of the Court

The majority of the Michigan Supreme Court issued a one-paragraph order:

On order of the Court, the application is again considered, and it is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.

This is a discretionary denial of leave to appeal. Under Michigan practice:

It decides nothing on the merits beyond leaving the Court of Appeals judgment in place for this case.

It has no precedential value as to the legal questions presented. See Haksluoto v Mt Clemens Regional Med Ctr, 500 Mich 304, 314 n 3 (2017).

B. The Court of Appeals’ Decision (Unpublished)

The Court of Appeals:

Assumed, without deciding, that MIRC had standing and that there was an “actual controversy.”

Held that MCL 600.6431, the Court of Claims Act (COCA) notice provision, applies to all claims against the state unless expressly exempted, citing Christie v Wayne State Univ, 511 Mich 39 (2023).

Applied general accrual principles (a claim “accrues” when suit may first be brought), relying on AFSCME v Highland Park Bd of Ed, 457 Mich 74, 90 (1998).

Concluded that MIRC’s claim accrued no later than 2019 (when it hired additional staff in response to the alleged policy), but MIRC did not file its complaint or a notice of intent to sue within one year of that date.

Ordered dismissal under MCR 2.116(C)(7) (claim barred by statute or immunity) for failure to comply with MCL 600.6431.

Because the Supreme Court denied leave, that unpublished Court of Appeals opinion governs this particular case but is not binding precedent on other panels, see MCR 7.215(C)(1).

C. The Dissents

Two justices filed separate, substantial dissents from the denial of leave:

Justice Welch focused on the temporal scope of the COCA notice provision, arguing that it cannot apply to claims seeking purely prospective relief to prevent future harm.

Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh, focused on sovereign immunity, statutory text, and constitutional structure. He argued:

Textually, MCL 600.6431 does not apply to suits against “officers,” even though the COCA’s jurisdictional provision does.

As a matter of federal law, under Ex parte Young, state officials lack immunity to prospective federal constitutional claims; state-created notice conditions premised on sovereign immunity cannot bar such suits.

As a matter of state constitutional law, a parallel principle should apply to claims under the Michigan Constitution, limiting the Legislature’s ability to insulate state officers from prospective relief for ongoing constitutional violations.

Both dissents would have granted leave and allowed MIRC’s claims for prospective relief to proceed, rejecting the Court of Appeals’ application of the COCA notice provision.

III. Factual and Legal Background

A. The Parties and Underlying Dispute

Plaintiff: Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC), a nonprofit providing legal resources to immigrants in Michigan.

Defendant: Governor Gretchen Whitmer, sued in her official capacity.

Beginning in 2017, MIRC’s farmworker and immigrant rights program received numerous calls from undocumented workers alleging they had been denied workers’ compensation benefits because of their immigration status. MIRC alleges:

The denial of benefits systematically affected undocumented workers injured on the job.

This denial strained MIRC’s resources, leading it to hire additional staff in 2019.

B. The Legal Basis: Sanchez v Eagle Alloy and the Workers’ Compensation Statute

The controversy is rooted in:

MCL 418.361(1), which includes a provision that workers’ compensation benefits are unavailable “whenever commission of a ‘crime’ prevents the person from obtaining or performing work.”

Sanchez v Eagle Alloy, Inc, 254 Mich App 651 (2003), where the Court of Appeals held that:

Using false documents to obtain employment is a “crime” for purposes of this statute.

Therefore, injured workers who obtained employment through such means could be denied workers’ compensation benefits.

MIRC contends that, in practice, this interpretation (or policy derived from it) has been applied to deny benefits to undocumented workers as a class, in violation of due process.

C. Relief Sought by MIRC

MIRC sought only prospective, non-monetary relief

A declaratory judgment that the “commission of a crime” language in MCL 418.361(1) is unconstitutional and unenforceable;

A declaration that Sanchez wrongly held that working while undocumented is itself a crime (or that using false documents in this context should not be treated as barring benefits); and/or

A declaration that subsequent Michigan Supreme Court precedent has significantly limited or undermined Sanchez.

Crucially:

MIRC did not seek damages for past denials of benefits.

It asked the court only to prohibit enforcement of the challenged policy going forward.

D. The COCA Notice Provision at Issue

MCL 600.6431(1) provides:

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a claim may not be maintained against this state unless the claimant, within 1 year after the claim has accrued, files in the office of the clerk of the court of claims either a written claim or a written notice of intention to file a claim against this state or any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies.

MCL 600.6431(2) further requires that the notice specify:

“the time when and the place where the claim arose,”

“a detailed statement of the nature of the claim and of the items of damage alleged or claimed to have been sustained,” and

a verified signature.

The central dispute is whether these requirements make sense—or can even logically be satisfied—when the plaintiff:

is suing for future harm that has not yet occurred, and

seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief (no damages).

IV. Detailed Analysis

A. Justice Welch’s Dissent: Notice Provisions Do Not Apply to Purely Prospective Relief

1. Core Principle

Justice Welch argues that Michigan law already recognizes a fundamental distinction between:

Retroactive relief (e.g., damages, refunds of money already paid), and

Prospective relief (e.g., injunctions or declarations to prevent future unlawful conduct).

Her central legal claim: Notice and limitations provisions govern claims for retroactive relief but do not bar suits seeking to prevent future harms.

2. Reliance on Taxpayers Allied for Constitutional Taxation v Wayne Co

Justice Welch’s primary precedent is Taxpayers Allied for Constitutional Taxation v Wayne Co, 450 Mich 119 (1995).

In Taxpayers Allied:

Wayne County had adopted a tax increase in 1981.

In 1991, taxpayers sued, seeking:

a declaration that the tax increase was invalid,

an injunction against future assessment and collection of the increased tax, and

a refund of taxes already paid.

Lower courts dismissed on statute-of-limitations grounds.

The Michigan Supreme Court reversed in part, drawing a sharp temporal distinction:

For refunds (retroactive money relief), the claims accrued when taxes became due; the statute of limitations barred refunds for taxes due more than one year before suit.

For prospective injunctive relief, the statute of limitations could not bar a taxpayer from seeking to enjoin the future imposition of unconstitutional taxes:

“[A] suit for injunctive relief may seek to prevent a future wrong, [so] the cause of action necessarily arises before the wrong occurs.” 450 Mich at 127.

But Michigan’s accrual statute, MCL 600.5827, provides that “the claim accrues at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when the damage results.” The Court reconciled these rules by holding that:

Limitations periods apply to claims for retroactive monetary relief.

They do not bar otherwise valid claims for prospective injunctive relief directed at future wrongs.

Declaratory relief follows the same pattern: if it is essentially retroactive (e.g., a declaration that money must be refunded), it is subject to limitations; if it is derivative of a non-time-barred prospective injunctive claim, it is not barred. See 450 Mich at 128–129.

Justice Welch imports this structure directly into the COCA context. She treats the COCA notice provision as a functional analog to a statute of limitations, citing Christie and Fairley, which view notice as a condition precedent to the state’s waiver of sovereign immunity.

3. Application to MIRC’s Suit

Applying Taxpayers Allied, Justice Welch reasons:

If MIRC had sought money damages or compensation for past economic harms (e.g., costs incurred in 2017–2019 because of the policy), those claims would have accrued when the past wrongs occurred and would be subject to the one-year notice requirement; failure to comply would bar retroactive relief.

But MIRC seeks only prospective declaratory relief—to stop continued enforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional policy. For that category of relief, under Taxpayers Allied, the notice/limitations framework should not apply.

She thus would hold that:

“The COCA’s notice provision does not prevent MIRC from seeking declaratory relief for harm that has not yet happened.” (Welch, J., dissenting, p 4)

4. Textual Argument: Logical Impossibility of Noticing Future Harm

Justice Welch also reads the text of MCL 600.6431(2) as implicitly oriented toward past harm:

The notice must contain a “statement of the time when and the place where the claim arose” and “items of damage alleged or claimed to have been sustained.”

Those requirements presuppose that a discrete wrong has already occurred and that concrete damages have already been sustained.

In her view, it is impossible to satisfy these terms for a claim aimed at a future wrong:

There is no specific “time” when the claim “arose” if the wrong has not yet occurred.

There are no “items of damage” yet sustained.

This textual point dovetails with Taxpayers Allied: both emphasize that standard limitations and accrual concepts do not fit neatly with claims designed to prevent future violations.

5. Purpose-Based Argument: Notice’s Rationales Don’t Fit Prospective Relief

Justice Welch invokes the purpose of the COCA notice requirement, as explained in Christie v Wayne State Univ, 511 Mich 39 (2023), and Fairley v Dep’t of Corrections, 497 Mich 290 (2015):

To ensure the proper state entity learns of a potential claim;

To allow timely investigation and discovery;

To allow the state to create fiscal reserves to cover potential liability.

She reasons that these goals are ill-suited to purely prospective constitutional claims:

There is no danger of stale evidence when the alleged wrong is an ongoing policy and no past damages are being adjudicated.

There is no need to set aside funds for damages if no monetary relief is sought.

Thus, applying the notice requirement to such suits neither fits the text nor advances the statute’s purposes; instead, it would “truncate the plaintiff’s legitimate claim to prospective relief”, contrary to Taxpayers Allied.

6. Welch’s Bottom Line

Justice Welch concludes:

Statutes of limitation and notice provisions apply to declaratory or injunctive claims that are functionally retroactive.

They do not apply to declaratory or injunctive actions that seek to prevent future harms arising from ongoing government policies.

The Court of Appeals therefore erred in treating MIRC’s prospective declaratory action as accruing in 2019 and subject to MCL 600.6431’s one-year notice requirement.

She would have granted leave and reversed, allowing MIRC’s prospective challenge to proceed on the merits.

B. Justice Thomas’s Dissent: Sovereign Immunity, State Officers, and Ex parte Young

1. Statutory Text: Notice Applies to the State and Its Entities, Not to Officers

Justice Thomas begins with a close reading of the COCA:

Jurisdictional provision – MCL 600.6419(1)(a) gives the Court of Claims jurisdiction:

“[t]o hear and determine . . . any demand for monetary, equitable, or declaratory relief or any demand for an extraordinary writ against the state or any of its departments or officers . . . .” (emphasis added)

Notice provision – MCL 600.6431(1) bars maintenance of a claim “against this state” unless a written claim or notice is filed “against this state or any of its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies” within one year.

Key observation: The jurisdictional provision expressly includes suits against officers, but the notice provision does not mention “officers” at all.

Applying standard canons of statutory interpretation (context, avoidance of surplusage, reading provisions harmoniously), Justice Thomas concludes:

The Legislature knew how to include officers when it wished to; it did so in MCL 600.6419.

Its omission of “officers” in MCL 600.6431(1), while still listing the state, departments, commissions, boards, etc., indicates an intent that the notice requirement not apply to suits against individual state officers.

He finds support in Pike v Northern Mich Univ, 327 Mich App 683 (2019), where the Court of Appeals distinguished suits against state employees from those against the state itself and noted the absence of any reference to officers in MCL 600.6431.

Thus, purely as a matter of statutory construction, Justice Thomas would hold that:

MCL 600.6431 does not govern constitutional claims seeking prospective relief against state officers in their official capacities.

2. Constitutional Avoidance and Legislative Awareness

Justice Thomas notes:

Michigan courts assume the Legislature legislates against the background of existing common law and constitutional doctrines.

By the time of the relevant COCA enactments, the Ex parte Young doctrine, allowing suits against state officers for ongoing constitutional violations, was well established and recognized.

Michigan itself had acknowledged such suits in cases like Thompson v Auditor General, 261 Mich 624 (1933).

Against that background, he reads the statutory omission of “officers” from the notice provision as a conscious decision to avoid conflict with the longstanding rule that officials lack immunity from prospective constitutional claims.

He also invokes the doctrine of constitutional avoidance: where a case can be resolved on statutory grounds without reaching constitutional questions (e.g., about the Legislature’s power to insulate officers from constitutional accountability), courts should prefer that route.

3. Federal Law: Ex parte Young and Federal Due Process Claims in State Court

Justice Thomas then examines the federal law of sovereign immunity in the context of:

federal constitutional claims,

against state officials,

seeking prospective relief.

Under Ex parte Young, 209 US 123 (1908), the U.S. Supreme Court held that a state official enforcing an unconstitutional law:

“comes into conflict with the superior authority of [the Federal] Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequences of his individual conduct.” 209 US at 159–160.

This fiction allows courts to grant prospective relief against state officials in their official capacity, despite state sovereign immunity, so long as:

the plaintiff alleges an ongoing violation of federal law, and

the relief sought is prospective (injunctive or declaratory), not retroactive monetary damages. See, e.g., Va Office for Protection & Advocacy v Stewart, 563 US 247, 255 (2011); Edelman v Jordan, 415 US 651 (1974).

Justice Thomas emphasizes:

This doctrine applies in state courts as well as federal courts. See Alden v Maine, 527 US 706, 747 (1999); Gen Oil Co v Crain, 209 US 211 (1908).

Michigan recognized this over 90 years ago in Thompson v Auditor General, which endorsed allowing mandamus or injunction against state officers for federal constitutional violations in state courts.

MIRC’s federal due process claims, as described by Justice Thomas, fall squarely within Ex parte Young:

MIRC alleges an ongoing violation of the Fourteenth Amendment by the continued enforcement of a policy denying workers’ compensation to undocumented workers.

It seeks only prospective declaratory and injunctive relief, no damages.

From this, Justice Thomas draws a key conclusion:

Because Ex parte Young recognizes that officials lack sovereign immunity to federal constitutional suits for prospective relief, such suits do not depend on the state’s waiver of immunity and thus cannot be conditioned on compliance with state-law notice provisions that derive from that waiver.

In other words, for federal due process claims:

MIRC does not need the benefit of the state’s waiver of immunity.

The COCA notice provision—an expression of conditions on that waiver—simply does not apply.

4. State Constitutional Claims: Extending the Ex parte Young-Type Principle

Justice Thomas then turns to state law: should a similar principle apply when plaintiffs allege ongoing violations of the Michigan Constitution by state officers?

He begins from Michigan’s own constitutional structure:

The Michigan Constitution of 1963 is a limitation on government power, not a grant.

The people are the sovereign; the branches of government, including the Legislature, are creatures of the Constitution.

The courts have a special role in vindicating constitutional rights, as recognized in decisions like:

Bauserman v Unemployment Ins Agency, 509 Mich 673 (2022),

Mays v Governor, 506 Mich 157 (2020), and

Sharp v Lansing, 464 Mich 792 (2001).

In Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health, 428 Mich 540 (1987), a fractured Court nonetheless agreed that sovereign immunity is “not available” in state court to bar constitutional tort claims alleging that the state, by custom or policy, violated rights conferred by the Michigan Constitution. That case concerned damages, not prospective relief, and lacked a single majority rationale, but it stands for the idea that:

The Legislature cannot use immunity doctrines to leave state constitutional rights effectively without a remedy.

Justice Thomas reads these cases, together with Bauserman, as reinforcing a core principle: rights require remedies. The Legislature cannot, by statute, license constitutional violations or wholly remove judicial remedies for ongoing constitutional harms:

“[T]he Legislature cannot grant a license to state and local government actors to violate the Michigan Constitution.” – Sharp v Lansing, 464 Mich at 810.

“Those choices are contained within the Constitution.” – Bauserman, 509 Mich at 704.

From this, he suggests that Michigan should adopt, at least by analogy, the core insight of Ex parte Young for state constitutional claims:

When a state officer enforces a policy that violates the Michigan Constitution, that official acts beyond constitutional authority.

Such conduct cannot be shielded by state sovereign immunity, because immunity is itself subordinate to the Constitution.

Therefore, state officers cannot assert sovereign immunity against suits for prospective relief that seek to halt ongoing violations of the Michigan Constitution.

He also observes that COCA’s structure—jurisdiction over suits against “officers” but no notice requirement applied to them—aligns with this understanding.

5. Thomas’s Bottom Line

Justice Thomas’s conclusions can be summarized as:

Statutory holding (preferred): By its own terms, MCL 600.6431 applies only to suits against “the state” and its departments, commissions, boards, institutions, arms, or agencies, not to suits against “officers.” Therefore, the notice provision does not bar MIRC’s suit against the Governor in her official capacity.

Federal constitutional overlay: Even if the Legislature had intended MCL 600.6431 to apply to such suits, it could not bar MIRC’s federal due process claim, because under Ex parte Young the Governor lacks immunity to suits seeking prospective relief for ongoing violations of federal law.

State constitutional structure: A similar principle should apply to state due process claims; the Legislature cannot immunize officers from suits that seek prospective relief against ongoing violations of the Michigan Constitution.

He thus would have granted leave, clarified the law of sovereign immunity and COCA’s reach, and allowed MIRC’s prospective constitutional claims to be heard on the merits.

C. Precedents and Doctrinal Threads

The dissents collectively invoke several doctrinal strands worth unpacking.

1. Christie v Wayne State Univ and the Scope of COCA Notice

In Christie, 511 Mich 39 (2023), the Court:

Reaffirmed that the COCA is “this state's controlling legislative expression of waiver of the state's sovereign immunity,” quoting Greenfield Constr Co v Dep't of State Hwys, 402 Mich 172 (1978).

Held that compliance with MCL 600.6431 is mandatory for claims within the Court of Claims’ jurisdiction.

Interpreted the notice requirement broadly and strictly as a condition precedent to suit.

The Court of Appeals, in MIRC’s case, relied on Christie to support a sweeping view: the notice requirement applies to “all claims” against the state unless a specific statutory exemption appears.

Justice Welch does not dispute Christie’s general characterization of MCL 600.6431 but argues that Taxpayers Allied shows how limitations/notice regimes function differently when the relief sought is entirely prospective. Justice Thomas, by contrast, narrows the scope of “claims” subject to MCL 600.6431 by focusing on the entities it names (state, departments, etc.) and the omission of “officers.” Both approaches seek to harmonize Christie with long-standing doctrines ensuring judicial review of ongoing unlawful governmental action.

2. Taxpayers Allied, AFSCME, and Accrual

The Court of Appeals’ reliance on general accrual principles from AFSCME v Highland Park Bd of Ed (claim accrues when suit may be brought) clashes, in the dissents’ view, with the nuanced approach in Taxpayers Allied:

AFSCME sets a default rule; Taxpayers Allied recognizes that where the relief is to prevent a future wrong, “the cause of action necessarily arises before the wrong occurs,” and the statute of limitations “does not prevent” such a taxpayer from seeking an injunction.

Justice Welch extends this logic to the COCA notice provision, treating it as analogous to a limitations bar for purposes of temporal reach.

3. Ex parte Young, Alden v Maine, and Federal Law in State Courts

Ex parte Young and its progeny establish that:

State sovereign immunity (including Eleventh Amendment immunity in federal court) does not bar suits against state officials for ongoing violations of federal law seeking prospective relief.

This principle governs in both federal and state courts. Alden v Maine clarified that states retain sovereign immunity in their own courts, but that does not undermine the viability of Ex parte Young-type suits against officials.

Justice Thomas stresses that Michigan courts must apply United States Supreme Court precedent on federal questions, citing Abela v Gen Motors Corp, 469 Mich 603 (2004). Thus, Michigan courts must permit Ex parte Young-style actions. A state-law notice provision tied to waiver of sovereign immunity cannot undercut that federal command.

4. Smith, Bauserman, Mays, and State Constitutional Remedies

Smith v Dep’t of Pub Health recognized that plaintiffs can bring direct state constitutional claims (so-called “constitutional torts”) for damages against the state where no adequate alternative remedy exists. While fractured, it commonly rejected broad sovereign immunity from such claims. Later:

Mays v Governor (Flint water crisis) reaffirmed the judiciary’s central role in enforcing constitutional limitations on government.

Bauserman v Unemployment Ins Agency emphasized that rights in the Michigan Constitution require judicially enforceable remedies unless the Constitution itself says otherwise.

Justice Thomas reads these cases as supporting a robust remedial principle: the Legislature may regulate remedies, but it may not functionally nullify state constitutional rights by insulating ongoing violations from judicial scrutiny through procedural conditions tied to sovereign immunity.

D. Impact and Future Ramifications

1. No Immediate Precedent, But Strong Signals

Because:

The Supreme Court denied leave without opinion; and

The Court of Appeals’ decision is unpublished and thus nonbinding;

there is no binding new rule on:

whether MCL 600.6431 applies to suits seeking purely prospective relief, or

whether it applies to suits against officers in their official capacities.

However, the detailed dissents:

Offer a roadmap for future litigants and lower courts.

Set out two analytically distinct, but converging, paths to allowing prospective constitutional challenges to proceed:

The temporal distinction between prospective and retroactive relief (Taxpayers Allied/Welch).

The entity-based and sovereign-immunity-based distinction between claims against the state itself and claims against officers (Ex parte Young/Thomas).

2. Practical Litigation Strategy

For plaintiffs challenging ongoing state policies as unconstitutional, these dissents suggest several strategic considerations:

Pleaded defendant: Suing the relevant state officer in an official capacity rather than the “state” or a “department” may better align with Justice Thomas’s statutory reading (that “officers” are not subject to MCL 600.6431).

Type of relief: Framing the suit as seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, without damages or retroactive relief, strengthens the argument under Justice Welch’s Taxpayers Allied-based approach.

Federal vs state claims: Including federal constitutional claims, especially under the Fourteenth Amendment, invokes Ex parte Young directly and may foreclose reliance on state-law notice provisions as bars to suit.

Conversely, the state may:

Continue to argue, based on Christie and an expansive reading of COCA, that notice is a condition for all claims within the Court of Claims’ jurisdiction, including those styled as prospective constitutional challenges.

Distinguish Taxpayers Allied as concerning ordinary statutes of limitations, not an immunity-based notice condition.

3. Doctrinal Development: Open Questions

The dissents highlight several unresolved questions likely to return to the Court:

Scope of MCL 600.6431: Does the notice provision apply to:

All claims over which the Court of Claims has jurisdiction, regardless of the named defendant?

Only claims in which the state or its enumerated entities (departments, boards, etc.) are defendants?

Accrual for prospective relief: How should “accrual” be understood for claims that seek to prevent future harms from ongoing government policies?

State constitutional Ex parte Young analogue: Will the Court expressly adopt a doctrine that state officers are stripped of immunity when they enforce policies that violate the Michigan Constitution, at least as to suits seeking prospective relief?

Interaction with federal remedies: How will Michigan courts harmonize COCA, Ex parte Young, and state court jurisdiction over federal constitutional claims, especially in light of cases where plaintiffs could alternatively sue in federal court?

4. Substantive Policy Stakes

Though the Supreme Court did not reach them, the case’s substantive stakes are significant:

Access of undocumented workers to workers’ compensation benefits, and the interpretation of MCL 418.361(1) and Sanchez, affect workplace safety and economic security in sectors like agriculture and food processing.

Nonprofits like MIRC, which bear the brunt of counseling and representing affected workers, seek clarity on whether systemic denial of benefits can be challenged as unconstitutional policy.

Procedural bars like notice provisions can have the practical effect of insulating contested policies from judicial review, even when substantive constitutional issues are weighty.

The dissents underscore that, for rights to be meaningful, there must be a viable procedural path to raise such constitutional challenges, particularly in the face of ongoing statewide policies.

V. Key Concepts Simplified

1. Sovereign Immunity vs. Governmental Immunity

Sovereign immunity refers to the state’s immunity from being sued without its consent. In Michigan, this applies to the state and its departments and is governed by statutes like the COCA.

Governmental immunity typically refers to immunity for local governments (cities, counties, school districts), governed by the governmental tort liability act (GTLA), MCL 691.1401 et seq.

They are related but distinct doctrines. This case primarily concerns sovereign immunity.

2. Court of Claims and the COCA Notice Provision

The Court of Claims is a specialized Michigan court with jurisdiction over claims against the state and its officers for money, equitable, and declaratory relief.

The COCA notice provision (MCL 600.6431) requires that, within one year after a claim “accrues,” a claimant must file either:

a written claim, or

a written notice of intent to file a claim,

containing specific information about when and where the claim arose and what damages were sustained.

Failure to comply generally bars the claim because the state has conditioned its waiver of immunity on compliance with this requirement.

3. Prospective vs. Retrospective Relief

Prospective relief aims to prevent future or ongoing harm. Examples:

An injunction ordering a government official to stop enforcing an unconstitutional policy.

A declaratory judgment clarifying that a law or policy is unconstitutional going forward.

Retrospective relief addresses past harms. Examples:

Monetary damages for injuries already suffered.

Refunds of taxes or fees previously paid.

Taxpayers Allied teaches that statutes of limitations and similar temporal bars apply robustly to retrospective relief, but not to otherwise valid claims for prospective relief aimed at preventing future violations.

4. Accrual of a Claim

A claim “accrues” when:

the alleged wrongful act occurs, and

the plaintiff has a right to bring suit.

Michigan’s accrual statute, MCL 600.5827, states that a claim accrues “at the time the wrong upon which the claim is based was done regardless of the time when the damage results.” For usual damages claims, this is straightforward. For prospective relief, however, the “wrong” may be the anticipated enforcement of an ongoing policy—raising special problems that Taxpayers Allied and Justice Welch’s dissent emphasize.

5. Ex parte Young Doctrine

Ex parte Young is a century-old U.S. Supreme Court doctrine that allows individuals to sue state officials in their official capacity for ongoing violations of federal law, seeking prospective relief (injunctions, declaratory judgments). The key points:

Such suits are deemed to be against the officer, not the state, for immunity purposes.

Sovereign immunity does not bar these suits, even though the relief may indirectly affect the state treasury or policies.

The doctrine’s limits:

The violation must be ongoing, not purely in the past.

The relief must be forward-looking, not retrospective monetary damages.

Justice Thomas’s dissent argues that:

Michigan courts must honor Ex parte Young when hearing federal constitutional claims.

State procedural rules tied to sovereign immunity (like COCA notice) cannot override the federal right to bring such suits.

6. Declaratory vs. Injunctive Relief

Declaratory relief – A court declaration that a law or policy is (un)constitutional or that certain rights exist. It does not by itself order anyone to do or stop anything but often forms the basis for further relief.

Injunctive relief – A court order compelling or prohibiting specific conduct (e.g., “Governor X is enjoined from enforcing Policy Y”). Violating an injunction can lead to contempt sanctions.

In practice, declaratory and injunctive relief often travel together in constitutional litigation, and the temporal analysis (prospective vs. retrospective) usually follows the character of the underlying substantive claim, as highlighted in Taxpayers Allied.

VI. Conclusion

Michigan Immigrant Rights Center v. Governor leaves the Court of Appeals’ unpublished dismissal of MIRC’s suit in place, but the Michigan Supreme Court’s order creates no binding precedent on the reach of the Court of Claims Act’s notice provision. The real significance of the case lies in the dissents.

Justice Welch articulates a clear doctrinal framework: notice and limitations regimes govern retroactive relief, not purely prospective efforts to halt future harms. Relying on Taxpayers Allied, she argues that applying MCL 600.6431 to MIRC’s prospective declaratory action misreads both the text and purpose of the statute and unjustifiably truncates legitimate constitutional claims.

Justice Thomas, joined by Chief Justice Cavanagh, advances a complementary but distinct analysis: COCA’s notice provision, by its terms, does not apply to suits against “officers”. Even if it did, the federal Ex parte Young doctrine and Michigan’s own constitutional structure prevent the Legislature from insulating state officers from suits seeking prospective relief for ongoing federal and state constitutional violations.

Together, the dissents:

Reaffirm that constitutional rights—federal and state—must be paired with effective remedies, especially in the face of ongoing official policies;

Highlight significant unresolved questions about the interaction between COCA, sovereign immunity, and constitutional enforcement; and

Provide a detailed intellectual blueprint for future challenges, both statutory and constitutional, to overly broad applications of procedural bars in constitutional litigation.

Although not yet the law of Michigan, these dissenting opinions are likely to influence future cases. They delineate two powerful, interlocking principles:

Prospective constitutional relief should not be foreclosed by limitations or notice rules designed for retrospective damages claims; and

State officers cannot hide behind sovereign immunity or statutory notice barriers when asked to answer for ongoing violations of superior constitutional law.

If and when the Michigan Supreme Court revisits these issues in a precedential opinion, Michigan Immigrant Rights Center v. Governor will stand as a key precursor, marking the contours of an emerging debate over the procedural and doctrinal architecture of constitutional accountability in Michigan.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 23:56:32.210270

Minneapolis is the Trump administration’s latest target in its immigration crackdown campaign. It comes after President Donald Trump used xenophobic language earlier this month during a Cabinet meeting to describe the state’s large Somali community as “garbage.”

In his tirade, Trump also took direct aim at Omar, calling her “incompetent” and “terrible.” Omar last week sent letters to the Department of Homeland Security about the crackdown in Minneapolis, suggesting that “this surge came in direct response to Trump’s racist comments about Somali people, and about me in particular,” and about the decision to rescind temporary protected status for Somalis in the U.S.

Omar said the Trump administration racially profiles in immigration raids and that “they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.”","https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765750922/251214-ilhan-omar-son-ice-vb/251214-ilhan-omar-son-ice-vb.jpg?_i=AA",N,,2025-12-14 19:56:47.956038

“The president has not been clear, and he has not certainly been communicating with Congress,” Turner told host Martha Raddatz on ABC News’s “This Week.” Turner added that while the administration should explain its escalatory tactics toward the South American country to the legislative branch, it has not yet done so because “they don’t want to show their hands” to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

The U.S. has ramped up tensions with the government of Maduro, whom administration officials have dubbed an “illegitimate leader,” in recent months.

The Pentagon has built up a significant presence in the U.S. Southern Command region, while President Trump has authorized at least 22 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific since early September, killing at least 87 people.

On Wednesday, the U.S. also seized an oil tanker en route to Cuba off the coast of Venezuela. The vessel was sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022 and was believed to be carrying more than 1 million barrels.

Earlier Sunday, Democratic Sen. Mark Warner (Va.), a member of the “Gang of Eight” — comprising the House and Senate leaders of both parties and the top GOP and Democratic members of the Intelligence committees — told ABC News he had not been briefed on the administration’s intentions with regard to Venezuela.

Turner, who chaired the Intelligence Committee from 2023 until January and was its ranking member for just more than a year before that, said the seizure of the tanker shows the administration is increasing its “economic pressure” on Maduro.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/turnermike_092823gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-14 19:56:43.658905

Europe experiencing a growing sense of division

Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.

In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King’s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain’s debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.

Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.

Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Germany’s AfD, France’s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing “economic decline” and “civilizational erasure” because of immigration and loss of national identities.

The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries’ far-right parties.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration’s concern that mass immigration was “shaking the balance of European countries.”

Racist rhetoric and hate crimes on the rise

Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.

A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn’t see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain’s second-largest city. Neither politician had to resign.

Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that’s not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.

“There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.”

U.K. government statistics show police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase over the previous 12 months.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain’s streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum center is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behavior. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Outflanking the right

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain’s center-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain’s national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O’Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Calls for calmer rhetoric

Politicians of the political center also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany’s center-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don’t look German don’t truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes — though he added that’s “quite a forlorn hope.”

“The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

The only way to obtain data about asylum seeker deaths is via freedom of information (FoI) requests to the Home Office, which officials do not always comply with.
However, the NHS produces regular figures about deaths in hospitals and the Ministry of Justice does so with deaths in custody.
Louise Calvey, the executive director at Asylum Matters, said: “People are dying in our asylum system.
We have taken immediate action to restart asylum processing and robust measures are in place to prioritise the safety of anyone in asylum accommodation.","Human rights and refugee campaigners are calling on the Home Office to be transparent about the numbers of asylum seekers who die in its care by publishing quarterly data as other government departments do.

The only way to obtain data about asylum seeker deaths is via freedom of information (FoI) requests to the Home Office, which officials do not always comply with. However, the NHS produces regular figures about deaths in hospitals and the Ministry of Justice does so with deaths in custody.

Fifty-one people died in Home Office-provided asylum accommodation in 2024, an increase of 11 on the previous year and a more than twelvefold rise on 2019 when four people died, according to FoI data.

The department initially claimed that only 30 people had died during that year, but had to apologise after it emerged there were 21 additional deaths.

Deaths in recent years include those of Leonard Farruku from Albania, who died on the Bibby Stockholm barge in December 2023; Mehrab Omrani from Iran, who is thought to have lain dead for four months in Home Office accommodation before his body was discovered in March 2024; and Hussein Haseeb Ahmed, a Kurdish Iraqi man who died at Manston processing centre in Kent after contracting diphtheria in November 2022.

An amendment to the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act 2025 proposed publishing this data but was not passed. The investigative journalism unit Liberty Investigates argued in an appeal to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that the Home Office should make these deaths public but was unsuccessful.

The ICO agreed with the Home Office, which said that “preventing potential harassment or violence against vulnerable individuals and staff would outweigh any countervailing interests in transparency”.

The Home Office said giving the names of those who died could assist in “indirectly identifying the relatives of deceased individuals and/or the accommodation providers. This could expose relatives of the deceased to harassment or violence, particularly in light of recent incidents in August 2024 where asylum locations were targeted.”

Officials added: “This targeting of asylum locations could also expose the staff who work there to harassment or violence. Therefore it is our view that disclosure of the requested information would lead to endangerment.”

The charity Asylum Matters is coordinating a campaign calling for both deaths of asylum seekers in the care of the Home Office and those who die trying to cross the Channel to be published.

Louise Calvey, the executive director at Asylum Matters, said: “People are dying in our asylum system. They’re dying at our borders, yes, but they’re also dying in camps, hotels, and other privately run, profit-driven Home Office funded accommodation. People are dying by suicide, dying of infectious disease, dying avoidable deaths. What we know for certain is that lives are being lost – but what we don’t know is how many.

“It’s an utterly shameful outlier: when people die in government care in other settings, such as the prison system, there’s a duty to report and track that data. Not tracking the figures in the asylum system makes it impossible to take effective action to reduce these tragedies – and it sends the appalling message that the deaths of people seeking sanctuary don’t matter.”

The Home Office previously revealed it did not routinely inform family members when asylum seekers died in its care and did not want to supply details of these deaths publicly in case it upset them and “endangers their mental health”.

A department spokesperson said:“Our thoughts and sympathies are with the families and friends of any asylum seeker or migrant who has died. We have taken immediate action to restart asylum processing and robust measures are in place to prioritise the safety of anyone in asylum accommodation. Our Border Security Act will also make it an offence to endanger another life during perilous small boat crossings, including a sentence of up to five years in prison.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983a017fa4d1ca7acb557974c47373b08a79aa03/743_0_3937_3151/master/3937.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d1c43eff05098f8cb05f2b85646a50b4",N,,2025-12-14 15:56:52.289538

In a letter sent Friday, addressed to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Omar says witnesses have documented ""blatant racial profiling"" and ""an egregious level of unnecessary force"" by ICE agents amid the so-called Operation Metro Surge.

""It is clear to me that this surge came in direct response to Trump's racist comments about Somali people, and about me in particular,"" Omar wrote.

Omar noted that ""over 90% of Somalis in America are U.S. citizens."" U.S. Census Bureau data show Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the country. More than 107,000 people identified as Somali across Minnesota, with more than 80,000 living in the Twin Cities.

""Rather than focusing the operation on individuals with judicial warrants, ICE officers have been stopping Black and Brown Minnesotans on the street or in public spaces at random, demanding to see their IDs,"" Omar continued.

""It is appalling to witness this unlawful behavior by ICE agents, which echoes some of the darkest chapters in our nation's history,"" she added.

Omar asked for a detailed report of ICE actions, including the number of people arrested and number of citizens detained. She also asked for clarity about the number of warrants prepared in advance for the surge, and the estimated cost of the operation to taxpayers.

On Friday night, Homeland Security confirmed more than 400 arrests since the operation began Dec. 1.

Meanwhile, federal investigators say they will dig deeper to determine if Minnesota fraud money fueled terrorism overseas. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday said, ""Egregious fraud in Minnesota has cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, including funds sent to Somalia through money services businesses.""

“We are known across the nation now as traitors and treasonous to another race of people,” said Ray Rice, a 74-year-old who said he and other tribal members were blindsided. “We are brown and they’re brown.”

ICE deals with tribes generate scrutiny

Tribal Chairman Joseph “Zeke” Rupnick promised “full transparency” about what he described as an “evolving situation.” In a video message to tribal members Friday, he said the tribe is talking with legal counsel about ways to end the contract.

He alluded to the time when federal agents forcibly removed hundreds of Prairie Band Potawatomi families from their homes and ultimately corralled them on a reservation just north of Topeka.

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” Rupnick said in the video message. “We were placed here because we were prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and the trauma once done to our people.”

The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in September for federal agents to conduct sweeping immigration raids and use apparent ethnicity as a relevant factor for a stop. With some Native Americans being swept up and detained in recent raids, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s overtures to tribes and even longstanding deals are generating extra scrutiny.

An LLC owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama also has a multimillion dollar contract with ICE to provide financial and administrative services. Meanwhile, some shareholders of an Alaska Native corporation say their values don’t align with the corporation’s federal contracting division, Akima, to provide security at several ICE detention facilities.

“I’m shocked that there is any tribal nation that’s willing to assist the U.S. government in that,” said Brittany McKane, a 29-year-old Muscogee Nation citizen who attends the tribe’s college in Oklahoma.

Some tribal nations have advised their citizens to carry tribal IDs.

Last month, actor Elaine Miles said she was stopped by ICE agents who alleged her ID from the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation in Oregon was fake.

Economic pressure increases as federal funding decreases

The economic arms of tribes, which can be run by non-Natives, are under increasing pressure to generate revenue because of decreased federal funding, high inflation and competition from online gambling, said Gabe Galanda, an Indigenous rights attorney based in Seattle.

But the economic opportunities presented to tribes don’t always align with their values, said Galanda, a member of the Round Valley Indian Tribes in northern California.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi has a range of businesses that provide health care management staffing, general contracting and even interior design.

The tribal offshoot hired by ICE — KPB Services LLC — was established in Holton, Kansas, and is not listed on the tribe’s website. It previously qualified along with dozens of other companies to provide logistical support to the U.S. Navy although, to date, it hasn’t performed any work for the federal government.

The ICE contract initially was awarded in October for $19 million for unspecified “due diligence and concept designs” for processing centers and detention centers throughout the U.S., according to a one-sentence description of the work on the federal government’s real time contracting database. It was modified a month later to increase the payout ceiling to $29.9 million. Sole-source contracts above $30 million require additional justification under federal contracting rules.

The contract raises a number of questions and seems to go against the Trump administration’s stated of goal of cleaning up waste, fraud and abuse, said Attorney Joshua Schnell, who specializes in federal contracting law.

“The public’s trust in the federal procurement system depends on transparency and competition,” said Schnell. “Although there is a role within this system for multimillion dollar sole-source contracts, these contracts are an exception to statutory competition requirements, and taxpayers are entitled to know how the government is spending their money.”

Backlash swift as news about the ICE contract spread

It’s unclear what the Tribal Council knew about the contract. A spokesperson for the Tribal Council did not respond to repeated requests from the AP for details, including who was terminated.

What is known is that KPB was registered by Ernest C. Woodward Jr., a retired U.S. naval officer with degrees in engineering and business who is a member of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, according to a website for his one-time consulting firm, Burton Woodward Partners LLC.

The website described Woodward as a serial entrepreneur and tribal adviser on mergers and acquisitions, accessing capital and landing federal contracts. The consulting firm was registered to an office park in Sarasota, Florida, in 2017 but was delisted two years later after it failed to file an annual report.

The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation in a 2017 news release said Woodward’s firm advised it on its acquisition of another government contractor, Mill Creek LLC, which specializes in outfitting federal buildings and the military with office furniture and medical equipment.

Woodward also is listed as the chief operating officer of the Florida branch of Prairie Band Construction Inc., which was registered in September.

Attempts to locate Woodward were unsuccessful. The phone number listed on Burton Woodward Partners was disconnected, and he did not respond to an email sent to another consulting firm he’s affiliated with, Virginia-based Chinkapin Partners LLC.

Every day we witness terrifying new ways that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is being empowered to take whatever actions it wishes while justifying them as necessary — supposedly in order to keep us safe. The continued dehumanization of our immigrant communities proceeds alongside proliferating cases of U.S. citizens being detained, as ICE’s reign of terror shows no concern for fundamental human rights or even basic human dignity.

As a result, our immigrant communities are living in fear that corrodes the essential components of life. Community members are now skipping doctor visits and are afraid to send their children to school or even attend their houses of worship. Western North Carolina residents got a firsthand look at ICE in action back in April 2018, when the federal agency detained an estimated 25 community members.

President Trump proclaims that ICE will make our communities safer and that somehow the alphabet soup of federal law enforcement agencies (ATF, DEA, FBI, etc.) lacks the personnel, expertise or funding needed to arrest violent criminals and break up drug trafficking rings. But while the war on drugs — a war on people suffering from addiction — has been a colossal failure over the past 40-plus years, no one has suggested holding a PTA bake sale because the DEA is underfunded. (To be clear, ICE was also empowered under President Obama, though in a more limited fashion.)

Afraid to report crimes

In an interview with Mountain Xpress earlier this year, Henderson County Sheriff Lowell Griffin defended his cooperation agreement with ICE. (Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act empowers ICE to delegate immigration officer functions to state and local law enforcement personnel.)

In the interview, Sheriff Griffin hinted that the federal agency might employ tactics that push the limits of what’s legal or perhaps acceptable. “I have met with officials from ICE from Atlanta and Charlotte, and there’ve been zero requests,” he said, adding, “I was concerned about how ICE may be operating in the county, and I wanted to be aware of what’s going on.” Later in the interview, however, Griffin said, “I don’t think we’re going to see an aggressive ICE response in Henderson County because we’ve basically already done the work to try to remove those that have ties to any kind of criminal organization.”

But immigrants and undocumented folks are sometimes victims of crime just like everyone else. And because of programs like 287(g), residents in these communities are often scared to report crimes they witness or are the target of. There’s a good reason that the Department of Homeland Security has two special types of visas providing legal protection for undocumented individuals who are victims of specified crimes and who cooperate with law enforcement. Underreporting crime makes all of us less safe. And every person, regardless of their skin tone, background or immigration status, wants and deserves to live in a community where they feel secure.

Let’s go after drug trafficking, not people

From 2019-24, I served as director of public affairs under Buncombe County Sheriff Quentin Miller. Immediately after taking office, Miller and members of his staff began meeting with individuals and immigrant rights organizations to determine how local law enforcement could do a better job of serving those communities.

In 2019, I drafted the sheriff’s policy that declined to honor ICE “detainer requests,” which ask local law enforcement to hold a prisoner for up to 48 hours past when they would otherwise be released. Although compliance with these requests was voluntary, conservatives lambasted officials who refused to honor such requests, claiming that “sanctuary sheriffs” were breaking the law. But as Miller clearly communicated, in order for his office to hold anyone at the county jail, the law required a warrant signed by a judge, and courts have upheld that position. (The N.C. General Assembly has since passed legislation that requires local law enforcement, as well as judges in the state, to comply with ICE detainer requests.)

Meanwhile, both state and local authorities have aggressively targeted drug trafficking operations in our area, which does serve to improve community safety. In fact, under Sheriff Miller, the specialty unit focused on high-level drug trafficking made a record number of arrests for fentanyl and meth trafficking in Buncombe County — without any assistance from either ICE or U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

To be clear, I do believe that arresting and prosecuting high-level drug traffickers and the gun crime that very often accompanies those activities make our communities safer. ICE, however, seems rather to excel at pushing people further into the shadows. By discouraging them from reporting crimes such as domestic violence — or even, for that matter, from simply going to work due to fear of arrest — ICE is ultimately making our entire community less safe. But as is the case with Trump and MAGA, the cruelty is really the point — and there seems to be no limit to it.

(WTVF) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested at least 15 people in Middle Tennessee this past week, according to advocates who are documenting the activity throughout the region.

Music City Migra Watch says they have witnessed armed agents making stops in unmarked vehicles, including a detention in Gallatin that was captured on video. The advocacy group says agents are targeting people in work vans as people travel to their jobs.

""They're going after people with families that are just going to work, trying to get by, trying to support their family, trying to have a better life,"" said Ashley Warbington, an advocate who has been recording encounters.

Warbington emphasized the importance of documentation during these stops.

""It's very important that they know they have the right to remain silent, and documenting that encounter is really incredibly important in this moment,"" Warbington said.

Warbington says the recent activity differs from operations conducted in May, when the Tennessee Highway Patrol stopped more than 600 vehicles over six nights in majority Hispanic neighborhoods in South Nashville. Those stops, conducted in partnership with ICE, led to nearly 200 arrests.

""This last week has certainly been more activity than we've seen in a while, but this activity is very different than what we saw in May,"" Warbington said. ""These are agents, ICE agents, going out into the community anywhere in Nashville and surrounding counties, and pulling over individuals going to work in their work bands. They're pulling them over without the help of another law enforcement agency.""

An ICE supervisor confirmed to NewsChannel 5 that agents are making arrests in Middle Tennessee, describing them as part of ongoing efforts to detain people who are in the country illegally and have committed crimes.

An ICE spokesperson provided a statement when reports first emerged three weeks ago: ""As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation's immigration laws. All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention, and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.""

However, data from the Deportation Data project shows that in the first nine months of President Trump's second term, around 75,000 people arrested by ICE did not have a criminal record. That represents over a third of all ICE arrests during that period.

A suspected ICE vehicle was also spotted near an Inglewood elementary school, though Metro School Board Member Zach Young posted on Facebook that there were no reports of ICE entering school property. Young said schools should remain safe spaces for families.

Community organizes toy drive

Advocates are working to support families affected by immigration enforcement activities. They continue to assist families impacted during the May operations while organizing holiday support for children whose parents have been detained.

The organization is partnering with community members for ""House of Hope"" to collect more than 1,000 toys for kids whose parents were detained and for those too afraid to leave home to shop. Only 300 toys have been collected so far.

""Regardless of what's going on out in the communities, regardless of what's going on in the household, in the family, within the families, we want to make sure that the kids feel that sense of joy,"" said Toy Drive Organizer Dulce Castro.

People can drop off toys by December 19 at Viva La Fresa, a Mexican and French fusion coffee shop at 17 S. Lowry St. in Smyrna, and receive a free drink in return. Online donations are also accepted.

The Trump administration has slashed disaster preparedness dollars across multiple FEMA programs this year as part of its campaign to transfer more responsibility for disasters to states.","A federal judge in Massachusetts on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to restore billions of dollars in canceled FEMA disaster mitigation funding, siding with 22 states and the District of Columbia that sued over the canceled grants this summer.

President Donald Trump's administration said in April it was “ending” the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which helped communities with predisaster projects to harden infrastructure and improve resilience against the increasing threats of climate change.

The administration called the program “wasteful and ineffective” and said it would halt $3.6 billion in funding awarded but not yet paid and would not award $882 million in grants for the following fiscal year.

The program's disruption upended projects across hundreds of communities in both Republican- and Democratic-led states, thwarting plans to improve stormwater drainage, harden electrical lines and even help relocate households living in areas most vulnerable to disasters.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told The Associated Press Thursday that DHS “has not terminated BRIC,” but did not elaborate on the program’s status.

“The Biden Administration abandoned true mitigation and used BRIC as a green new deal slush fund,” the spokesperson said, referring to a Democratic plan to combat climate change. “It’s unfortunate that an activist judge either didn’t understand that or didn’t care.”

The order comes at a time of profound uncertainty over FEMA's future and on the same day that a long-awaited meeting of the FEMA Review Council to present a report recommending reforms to the agency was abruptly canceled by the White House because it had not been fully briefed on the latest version of the report, according to a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

RELATED STORY | Acting FEMA administrator resigns as agency faces sweeping changes

Congress funded BRIC during the first Trump administration through the 2018 Disaster Recovery Reform Act, and FEMA launched the program in 2020. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act made an additional $1 billion available for BRIC over five years, though only about $133 million had been delivered to communities by April, according to FEMA.

The program was criticized by some for being difficult to access for rural and less wealthy communities due to a complicated application process and cost-sharing requirements. But even Republican lawmakers like Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana opposed the cancellations and called for BRIC's reinstatement.

“It protects families and saves taxpayer dollars in the long-run,” Cassidy said on the Senate floor a week after the funding cancellation. “That’s efficient in my book.”

Judge Richard G. Stearns found that FEMA's actions were unlawful since Congress appropriated the money specifically for the grants and that there was an “inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law.”

“The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,” Stearns wrote in the court order.

The Trump administration has slashed disaster preparedness dollars across multiple FEMA programs this year as part of its campaign to transfer more responsibility for disasters to states.

Since February, Trump has not approved any requests for hazard mitigation funding, a typical add-on that helps states, tribes and territories complete resilience projects after major disasters.

Emergency preparedness grants that states and local governments rely on to staff emergency management agencies and buy equipment are currently frozen after 12 states sued the Trump administration over unprecedented grant stipulations related to the administration's immigration agenda.

recipients from deportation has helped about 200,000 migrants, according to the National Immigration Project, which is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit.","On a crisp November morning in White Plains, N.Y., six lawyers spent hours in a federal courtroom arguing about the government’s plan to deport a teenager from the Bronx.

Agents had detained the boy, Joel Camas, 16, during a routine check-in at 26 Federal Plaza, the New York City headquarters for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. They held him at a shelter for three weeks while the New York Civil Liberties Union fought for his release, arguing that Joel had followed orders and that forcing him to return to his native Ecuador would put him in danger.

When the hearing ended, Judge Cathy Seibel ordered that Joel be freed while she considered the merits of his case. But his future in the United States remains uncertain. Joel, like thousands of other young migrants, has become a target of the Trump administration’s deportation crackdown, and immigration officials are working to dissolve long-established protections meant to help young people like him stay.

Joel is a recipient of a decades-old designation known as special immigrant juvenile status, which, until recently, had shielded some undocumented young migrants who could prove that they had been abused or neglected by at least one parent. Beginning in 2022 under President Joe Biden, migrants who were granted this status were immediately told whether they would be protected from deportation through an immigration classification known as deferred action. Those who received the deferred action designation were eligible to apply for a work permit while awaiting a pathway to permanent residency.

But in April, Trump administration officials quietly stopped granting deferred action designations and instead began to deport S.I.J. status holders with little notice and no chance to appeal, alarming immigration lawyers.

A coalition of immigrant advocates filed a federal lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York seeking class-action status to challenge the new policy. In late November — two days after Joel’s hearing — a judge granted the plaintiffs a partial victory by ordering the government to temporarily halt its new policy, though it did not set a deadline to comply. A final decision has not been made.

“People with S.I.J. or in the process of getting S.I.J. are being ordered removed, and they are not able to access this relief that as a child or young person they would have,” said Beth Baltimore, Joel’s lawyer. “We’re just so concerned about this happening with more and more people.”

Immigration officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Joel had fled South America with his mother, Elvia Chafla, about three years ago, making the arduous journey through the Darién Gap on foot in search of a safer place to live, away from gang violence. In the United States, he dreamed of becoming an auto mechanic or Army soldier. The government determined he was eligible for S.I.J. status because he had been abandoned by his father.

He had been without his mother for about four weeks, staying with relatives and attending Gotham Collaborative High School, when he was detained by immigration officials. His detention in October stunned his lawyer, Ms. Baltimore, who emerged from the federal building with tears in her eyes. She had believed his S.I.J. status and his age would spare him.

Instead, he was placed in a shelter in the Bronx, where Ms. Baltimore and the rest of his legal team argued that he was falling behind in school because the classes at the shelter were not guaranteed to be accepted for credit by the public education system. A family court later granted Joel’s uncle legal guardianship over him, clearing a way for his release.

At his hearing, Judge Seibel criticized what she described as superfluous bureaucracy that had kept Joel confined longer than necessary. She lamented that migrant children were being held even when they had a safe place to go, but she stopped short of criticizing the Trump administration’s effort to deport Joel.

“It’s not my place to decide whether what the government is doing is heartless or an inexplicable expenditure of resources,” Judge Seibel said. “My job is to decide whether they’re allowed to do what they’re doing.”

The federal law establishing special immigrant juvenile status was enacted in 1990 and then expanded in 2008. It does not grant legal status, but it allows recipients to apply for a visa to become legal permanent residents and to obtain a work permit.

The Biden-era policy to protect S.I.J. recipients from deportation has helped about 200,000 migrants, according to the National Immigration Project, which is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit. Roughly 150,000 migrants who have been approved for special immigrant juvenile status could be affected by the government’s decision to stop the policy, according to court documents.

The group argued that the government violated the law by ending the policy without proper notice or justification, leaving thousands of immigrant youth in legal limbo and at risk of deportation.

Despite the uncertainty, young migrants like Mamadou Mouctar Diallo, 20, are still applying for special immigrant juvenile status in hopes that it will help them secure a place in the United States. Mr. Diallo was arrested in Lower Manhattan in August and detained for about three months before he was released in November upon being granted asylum from Guinea.

Young people living in New York make up the largest portion of recipients of special immigrant juvenile status who are waiting for a green card compared with other states, at about 20 percent, followed by those in California, who made up 15 percent, according to data obtained and analyzed by the End SIJS Backlog Coalition, an advocacy group.

From Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January through mid-October, ICE has arrested about 2,600 children younger than 18 across the country, according to federal data obtained by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, Berkeley. In the New York City area, it has arrested at least 140 minors.

This year, ICE has sent 600 immigrant children into the federal shelter system — more than in the previous four years combined, according to an investigation by ProPublica. It is the highest number since record-keeping began a decade ago.

And Rep. Roy, a Republican, says there's no better time than now, when criminal illegal immigrants are being rounded up and deported, to round up members of terrorist organizations who've come to America such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim Brotherhood.

""Just like Governor Abbott did in Texas, who declared CAIR as a terrorist organization.""

Roy says we need to look back 100 years or so to 1920, when there were almost as many foreign-born in the US as there are today, which was around the time the US also severely cut back on immigration, a move that served the nation well for decades in the 20th Century, before politicians decided to open the immigration flood gates.

But there are huge differences between then and now:

""Back then they wanted to assimilate, to learn about American ways in American schools, to be taught that the US is a great nation,"" but most importantly, he says, ""there was no social welfare state and there was no threat from Islamism.""

But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that.","ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Many political candidates like to talk up their résumés in their stump speeches.

Ryan Crosswell reads from his resignation letter.

A former federal prosecutor now running for Congress, he quit in February when President Donald Trump’s administration dropped corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams in return for his cooperation on immigration enforcement.

“I pray that the Department of Justice remains dedicated to upholding the rule of law evenly without fear or favor. Sincerely, Ryan Crosswell,” he read at a recent campaign event.

The line got applause and whoops from dozens of Democratic Party activists who had gathered to see him in the West End Taproom in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Crosswell is one of five candidates who are vying for the opportunity to unseat Republican Rep. Ryan Mackenzie, a top target of Democrats in next year’s midterm election, when control of the U.S. House will be on the line.

Polling shows that voters prioritize economic issues, and Democrats have focused on concerns about affordability as they try to claw back power in Washington.

Crosswell is testing a different approach, relying on his law enforcement and corruption-fighting background amid fears about how Trump is reshaping the nation’s justice system.

Voters often ask him about Trump’s pardons for the politically connected, immigration enforcement officers using force, U.S. military strikes on boats in the Caribbean, or prosecutions against the president’s enemies.

“I think I get asked that probably more than the average candidate, but I also lean into it,” Crosswell said in an interview.

Mackenzie’s campaign said voters in Pennsylvania “aren’t interested in a lecture. They’re interested in the issues—affordability, public safety and national security.”

Running amid fears of authoritarianism

Crosswell’s background was a draw for many who came to see him at the event.

“I like that he quit his job because he was given a job that went against his moral compass,” said Elisabeth Grant.

Grant and others said they believe Trump is attacking the rule of law, and many described it a top motivation.

Some described personal fears. Joe McDermott said he is outspoken on Facebook about his criticism of the Trump administration—”I refer to it as a ‘crime family'”—and people ask him if he isn’t afraid that someone will come after him.

He is, and he wouldn’t discount the Department of Justice going after someone like himself.

“I would not put anything beneath them right now,” McDermott said.

Joniel Colon Rosario is thinking twice about whether he should speak his native Spanish on the street around strangers.

“I don’t know if some random guy in a ski mask is going to come down and tackle me because I’m speaking my native tongue,” said Colon Rosario, who is originally from Puerto Rico.

Crosswell said voters are worried that the government “appears to do anything the president orders.”

“People aren’t asking, ‘How can my government protect me?’ It’s, ‘How can I protect myself from my government?’” he said.

A prime swing seat in Pennsylvania

It’s no wonder Democrats are eager to challenge Mackenzie. A freshman, Mackenzie was a state lawmaker when he won his race for Congress by 1 percentage point last year, among the narrowest margins in the country.

Crosswell—also a former active-duty U.S. Marine and a current reservist—isn’t alone in leaving federal government service this year to run as a Democrat.

Zach Dembo, a former federal prosecutor and Navy lawyer who worked briefly for Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, is running for an open seat in Kentucky. And John Sullivan, a former FBI intelligence official, is running for a Republican-held seat in New York’s Hudson Valley.

Crosswell, 45, will have some baggage in his primary contest.

He changed his registration from Republican to Democrat a year ago. After he resigned in February, he moved from Washington, D.C., to Allentown—about 45 miles from where he grew up in Pottsville, Pa.

Crosswell remembers thinking, “Do I want to leave public service, or do I want to fight back?”

Economic fears are No. 1 in polls

It’s unclear whether a corruption-fighting message will carry the day in either a primary or general election.

Polling has consistently shown that Americans are more focused on economic issues than broader concerns about how government is functioning.

A CNN poll from August found roughly 4 in 10 U.S. adults said economic concerns were the most important problems facing the country, and only about 1 in 10 named attitudes about government, including concerns about the rule of law or corruption.

The House Democrats’ campaign arm, which is officially neutral in Crosswell’s primary race, said the midterms are “shaping up to be a referendum on who is going to lower costs and help improve the lives of everyday Americans, not the wealthy and well-connected.”

Crosswell acknowledges that not everybody is concerned about how Trump wields power and that it depends on the audience.

Jon Macklin, a Crosswell supporter who goes door-to-door for Democratic candidates, told a similar story. People he meets who are less engaged with politics are most concerned about their finances and how the economy is affecting them.

But Crosswell said public corruption doesn’t have to be separate from that. And he intends to drive home that message. In other words, a corrupt government and a corrupt economy can hurt everyone.

“Corruption is a kitchen table issue,” Crosswell said. “Because public office is a public trust.”",https://fox56news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2025/12/AP25344772866598.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-14 12:57:32.245232

Homan was joined at the U.S.-Mexico border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott and local Border Patrol officials. The visit included a heavily secured appearance near the border wall.

Homan said the administration’s immigration crackdown has led to sharp declines in sex trafficking, fentanyl smuggling and the number of suspected terrorists attempting to cross the border illegally.

“A secure border means stronger national security, but most importantly, it means saving migrants’ lives and American lives,” Homan said.

Justin De La Torre, the chief patrol agent for the San Diego sector, pointed to recent deaths tied to human smuggling as evidence of the dangers migrants face.

“Just recently in San Diego, we had four people die in the ocean at the hands of human smugglers who did not care about the lives of the people they were smuggling,” De La Torre said.

Homan also said Homeland Security has recovered about 62,000 children who were smuggled into the United States, many during recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. While some were eventually found with family members, he said others were victims of sex trafficking or forced labor.

Commissioner Scott said increased cooperation between ICE and Border Patrol agents has led to a rise in deportations while also slowing illegal crossings.

“We will track you down, we will arrest you, we will deport you,” Scott said. “The number one thing that stops illegal immigration is changing the dynamic — not releasing people and making sure they know they cannot freely move about the United States if they cross illegally.”

Immigrant rights advocates, however, argue the enforcement strategy is violating civil rights and targeting people who are actively pursuing legal status.

Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee’s U.S.-Mexico border program, said agents are arresting immigrants at ICE check-ins, court hearings and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services interviews.

“These are individuals who have been vetted over and over,” Rios said.

Homan rejected the criticism, saying President Donald Trump has given him authority to enforce immigration laws and remove anyone in the country illegally.

“They cheated the system,” Homan said. “They entered the country illegally, which is a crime.”",https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/12/snapshot-2025-12-13T222326.878.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-14 10:59:34.072875

At a cabinet meeting at the White House, President Donald Trump disparaged the state’s Somali community, saying he did not want them in the United States. He said they contributed nothing to the country and referred to them as garbage.

The same day, reports emerged that 100 Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents were being deployed to the state to target Somali immigrants. Raids have been rampant across the Twin Cities since, with immigrants and citizens alike caught in the crossfire.

For members of the Somali community, it has been a difficult several weeks, with students left to adjust to a rapidly changing situation.

Despite the warning signs of imminent immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities, President of the University of Minnesota’s Somali Student Association Dahir Munye said it was still hard to believe.

“We heard the talks coming a couple weeks ago, but now to really see things in effect is almost shocking,” Munye said.

The Trump administration’s sudden escalation against Somalis has made Munye’s position on SSA all the more important. A student group with no political affiliations, the organization was thrust overnight into a position of guidance for the University’s Somali community.

“A lot of people are reaching out to us, wanting our perspective on things,” Munye said. “It’s really been a lot.”

It is also unclear exactly who is being targeted. Despite the Trump administration’s stated goal of removing undocumented immigrants from the country, the majority of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, and even more are permanent residents.

That has left many American citizens of Somali descent in the Twin Cities fearful for their safety. According to Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, that is the point.

“The majority of people who are concerned are U.S. citizens, because that’s the majority [of the population],” Hussein said. “To target a community, call them garbage and then to send the police after them with a mission they cannot be successful at — because the majority of the people are citizens — tells you that this is a targeted attack against the black community.”

The fears are not unfounded. On Tuesday, a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis’ Cedar-Riverside neighborhood was physically restrained and arrested by ICE agents despite offering to show identification, and was only released after being taken to ICE offices in Fort Snelling.

He was then told to walk home, a nearly two and a half hour walk in the cold.

For Hussein, situations like these mean Somali residents need to take new, unprecedented steps to protect themselves.

“People are now worried if they should carry their passports around, and we are recommending to have those documents handy,” Hussein said. “You should not live in the United States walking around with your passport, but that’s where America is.”

ICE on the streets

The morning of Wednesday, Dec. 10, began unassumingly for Mahamed, a resident of Cedar-Riverside.

It snowed the night before, so he grabbed a shovel and began digging out his car. There was no indication it would be anything other than a typical winter morning in Minneapolis until, minutes later, he looked up to find himself surrounded by eight federal agents.

“I didn’t even know if it was ICE,” Mahamed, who wished not to use his last name for fear of retaliation, said. “I just saw some cars driving by. I was looking down ‘cause I’m trying to get the snow out of the way of my car, and when I looked up, they’d already surrounded me.”

Agents approached Mahamed and asked him to present identification. They refused to identify themselves and had arrived in unmarked vehicles.

Alone with his mother nearby, Mahamed was afraid of what might happen.

“It was actually quite terrifying,” he said. “I was very intimidated.”

Adding to his fears was a man with the agents, using a phone on an extended mount to film Mahamed. Mahamed said he was uncomfortable providing identification while being filmed by someone who was clearly not law enforcement.

“It felt like a reality show,” he said.

That man was Ben Bergquam, an influencer from right-wing television network Real America’s Voice. Bergquam’s role in the operations is unclear, and neither Bergquam nor Real America’s Voice responded to the Minnesota Daily’s request for comment.

Agents proceeded to ask Mahamed questions about where he was born and whether he was a citizen, accusing him of making things difficult when he refused to show identification. When Mahamed continued to refuse, agents threatened to detain him.

“They basically threatened me and said, ‘Hey, we either figure this out in 7 minutes, or we hold you for 72 hours,’” he said.

Agents questioned Mahamed’s mother as well, who is also a U.S. citizen, and prevented Mahamed from approaching her when she began crying. He said agents criticized him when he spoke Somali to his mother and asked why he was using a foreign language.

Mahamed believed the agents first approached him because his mother wears a niqab, a face covering often worn by Muslim women. He also said he felt agents were trying to intimidate him to present identification, which he had no legal obligation to do.

“I was very much willing to be detained, because I’m a U.S. citizen and I was born in this country,” he said.

Agents showed no signs of leaving until community members began arriving to confront officers, according to Mahamed.

Community members on foot and bike recorded the interaction and blew whistles to alert other bystanders of ICE’s presence. Agents left shortly thereafter without detaining Mahamed or his mother.

Mahamed said the community response provided a sense of reassurance during an otherwise scary experience.

“That’s what made me feel a lot better, when the community was there, and everybody was witnessing it,” he said. “Because the community was there, there’s lots of people recording it, they [the agents] became a lot more wary and careful with what they were doing.”

Shortly after leaving Mahamed and his mother, agents made their way to Riverside Plaza, where they were, again, confronted by community members.

Federal agents gained access to a residential apartment complex in the plaza, according to eyewitnesses, but did not detain any individuals. Bergquam was once again present with agents during the operation, and video taken by the Daily showed him arguing with community members as agents returned to their vehicles.

Another video captured by the Daily showed a federal agent pepper-spraying bystanders out of the passenger side window as agents drove off. Bystanders stood on the sidewalk or side of the road and were not obstructing the agents’ vehicle.

Minutes after agents had departed, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey arrived at a nearby cafe to grab some coffee. Stumbling onto an ICE raid was not on the agenda, Frey said.

“Initially, we were out here to get some coffee as the day is starting and obviously show support to our Somali community,” Frey said. “On our way over, we heard yet another one [raid] had taken place.”

Minneapolis has long been a target of the Trump administration’s anger, owing to the city’s sanctuary city ordinance. Frey and Trump have exchanged verbal jabs in recent weeks, with Trump calling Frey a fool.

On Wednesday, Frey doubled down on Minneapolis’s sanctuary city status.

“We won’t cooperate with them in any way, shape or form, and we’re doing everything possible to work with our community members, including those who are here right now,” Frey said.

While agents departed Riverside Plaza, ICE raids across the city continued. Community members continued showing up as well, documenting agents’ actions and blowing whistles, just as they had been doing since raids began.

The community’s relentless pursuit is not a coincidence. Across the Twin Cities, individuals and organizations have been preparing for this moment.

The community responds

On the morning of Dec. 5 at the corner of East Lake Street and Stevens Avenue, Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee organizer Alvin was keeping watch. The corner had been a hotspot of ICE activity in recent days, and Alvin was ready to send out the alert if he saw more.

Alvin, who preferred not to use his last name for fear of retaliation, is no stranger to ICE raids. He was present at previous ICE operations in St. Paul and was even shot at with pepper balls by agents.

But what has been happening in the Twin Cities over the past several weeks has proven to be a new challenge, he said.

“These are operations where ICE comes by and tries to pick up just one or two folks off the street,” Alvin said. “Those operations are really hard to stop because once the observers get notice of it and try to go to the location, oftentimes ICE has already left.”

These targeted raids have been occurring throughout the cities, leaving organizers and concerned citizens like Alvin scrambling to keep up. The shorter duration and more isolated nature of these raids mean that community members can no longer afford to wait to receive news of operations.

“We are now trying to be more proactive,” he said. “It’s very hard to get notice and then go out to the situation, so we’re being more proactive by stationing MIRAC members at particular hotspots across the city so they can observe and be immediately ready to act should something happen.”

The increase in observers is not reserved for MIRAC or even community organizations.

Up the street at Karmel Mall, Miri Villerius was stationed on the corner of West Lake Street and Pillsbury Avenue, keeping watch. They had been there since 4:45 a.m., looking for ICE.

They were representing no organization or community group, only themself.

A popular destination for South Minneapolis’ Somali population, Karmel Mall was a likely target for federal agents, and not only for Somalis. The day before, Villerius responded to an attempted detention of a Hispanic man, who was ultimately let go.

Villerius is not alone in their efforts, both at Karmel Mall and throughout the cities. A series of Signal chats has emerged for individuals like him to share information about ICE activity and mobilize community members to the scene.

With these networks, individuals have taken to the streets in high-risk areas to keep watch for ICE agents and spread information they capture of their activity. When ICE operations are confirmed, community responders may be called for support, as was the case at Riverside Plaza.

There are other organization-led response networks as well. MIRAC, the Immigrant Defense Network, Unidos and Monarca all have their own response networks to mobilize responders to ICE operations.

As raids continue throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul, this response continues to be tested.

Making sense of the chaos

At the University, the SSA has been left to pick up the pieces of a difficult situation. As president, that responsibility has fallen heavily on Munye.

“It’s been a rollercoaster,” he said.

Munye said the organization took its time releasing a statement on the ICE raids, wanting to ensure it was doing its best to provide accurate information and helpful resources for the community. Being in a position of suddenly having to educate the community on how to protect themselves was not something they had anticipated.

“We’re not a political group or anything like that, we’re just a bunch of students,” Munye said.

“That means that us, as board members, we have to find the answers for ourselves.”

On Saturday, however, at nearby Augsburg University, a student was targeted by ICE agents on campus grounds.

Given the close relationship between the University and the surrounding community, students are on high alert. What happens outside the University boundaries can easily make an impact inside as well, something Jaylani Hussein understands in his role at CAIR.

“They [students] are worried about their family,” Hussein said. “Their parents might have different statuses and they were born here, so that’s important.”

For Munye, the attacks against the Somali community have been difficult and certainly unfair. He says the hateful rhetoric and actions they have been facing are not a reflection of the truth.

“All the immigrants he’s targeting, we escaped war; there’s a bunch of doctors and business owners in my community,” Munye said. “These are really people who strive to do good for their community.”

Munye believes they will once again prevail here.

“We’re taking a lot of wounds,” he said. “But I know my community, and I know there’s nothing we can’t come back from.”",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/icesomali.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 10:59:41.583404

The two offices traditionally have worked closely together to enforce civil rights protections for students.
In the spring, the U.S. Senate confirmed Harmeet Dhillon as leader of the Civil Rights Division.
But still, she said, there is a larger pattern of ambivalence to the Justice Department’s approach to civil rights complaints.
This story about the Justice Department was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.","The 10-year-old was dragged down a school hallway by two school staffers. A camera captured him being forced into a small, empty room with a single paper-covered window.

The staffers shut the door in his face. Alone, the boy curled into a ball on the floor. When school employees returned more than 10 minutes later, blood from his face smeared the floor.

Maryland state lawmakers were shown this video in 2017 by Leslie Seid Margolis, a lawyer with the advocacy group Disability Rights Maryland. She’d spent 15 years advocating for a ban on the practice known as seclusion, in which children, typically those with disabilities, are involuntarily isolated and confined, often after emotional outbursts.

Even after seeing the video, no legislators were willing to go as far as a ban. Nor were they when Margolis tried again a few years later.

In 2021, however, the federal Justice Department concluded an investigation into a Maryland school district and found more than 7,000 cases of unnecessary restraint and seclusion in a two-and-a-half-year period.

Four months later, Maryland lawmakers passed a bill prohibiting seclusion in the state’s public schools, with nearly unanimous support.

“I can’t really overstate the impact that Justice can have,” said Margolis. “They have this authority that is really helpful to those of us who are on the ground doing this work.”

Within the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division is a small office devoted to educational issues, including seclusion, as well as desegregation and racial harassment. The division intentionally chooses cases with potential for high impact and actively monitors places it has investigated to ensure they’re following through with changes. When the Educational Opportunities Section acts, educators and policymakers take notice.

Now, however, the Trump administration is wielding the power of the Justice Department in new and, some say, extreme ways. Hundreds of career staffers, including most of those who worked on education cases, have resigned. The Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights also has been decimated, largely through layoffs. The two offices traditionally have worked closely together to enforce civil rights protections for students. The result is a potentially lasting shift in how the nation’s top law enforcement agency handles issues that affect public school students, including millions who have disabilities.

“There are those who would say that this is an aberration, and that when it’s over, things will go back to the way they were,” said Frederick Lawrence, a lecturer at Georgetown Law and former assistant U.S. attorney under President Ronald Reagan. “My experience is that the river only flows in one direction, and things never go back to the way they were.”

The Justice Department’s lawyers historically have worked on a few dozen education cases at once, concentrating on combating sexual harassment, racial discrimination against Black and Latino students, restraint and seclusion, and failure to provide adequate services to English learners.

In the last 11 months, however, the agency has sued over and opened investigations into concerns about antisemitism, transgender policies and bias against white people at schools. It sued at least six states for offering discounted tuition to undocumented immigrants and pressured the president of the University of Virginia to resign as part of an investigation into the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies. And it joined other federal departments to form a special Title IX investigations team to protect students from what the administration called the “pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.”

As the Educational Opportunity Section’s mission shifted, it shrunk in size. In January, before President Donald Trump took office, about 40 lawyers tackled education issues. In the spring, the U.S. Senate confirmed Harmeet Dhillon as leader of the Civil Rights Division. Dhillon founded the conservative Center for American Liberty, which describes itself as “defending civil liberties of Americans left behind by civil rights legacy organizations.”

After her confirmation, staff who weren’t political appointees began resigning en masse, concerned Dhillon would promote only the administration’s agenda.

By June, no more than five of the 40 lawyers were left, according to former employees. Some new staff have been hired or reassigned to the section, but the head count remains well below usual. It’s far from enough to sustain the typical workload, said Shaheena Simons, who was chief of the Educational Opportunities Section until she resigned in April. “There’s just no way the division can function with that level of staffing. It’s just impossible,” said Simons, who took over the section in 2016. “The investigations aren’t going to happen. Remedies aren’t going to be sought.”

Department officials responded to a list of questions from The Hechinger Report about changes to their handling of student civil rights protection with “no comment.”

The Department of Justice, including its educational work, has always been somewhat subject to White House interests, said Neal McCluskey, director of the libertarian Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom. During President Joe Biden’s term, for example, the agency pursued allegations of discrimination against transgender students, reflecting administration priorities.

McCluskey added, though, that the Trump administration is more aggressive in how it is pursuing its goals and is bypassing typical protocols, noting that in many cases “it’s like they’ve already decided the outcome.”

An investigation into allegations of antisemitism at the University of California, Los Angeles, for instance, took just 81 days before the department concluded the school had violated federal law. DOJ investigations typically have taken years, not months, to complete.

Lawrence, who also serves as president of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, said he could not speak to specific investigations, but the UCLA timeline “does suggest a rather accelerated process.”

A federal judge recently ruled that the administration could not use the findings from its UCLA investigation as a reason to fine the university $1.2 billion, which if paid would have unlocked frozen federal research funding. She wrote that the administration was using a playbook “of initiating civil rights investigations of preeminent universities to justify cutting off federal funding.”

As new investigations are opened, older ones remain unresolved, including one of practices in Colorado’s Douglas County Public Schools.

In 2022, Disability Law Colorado submitted a complaint to the Justice Department about the district’s use of seclusion, as well as restraint, where school employees physically restrict a student’s movement.

The following year, three other families sued the school system, alleging racial discrimination against their children. The students were repeatedly called monkeys and the N-word, threatened with lynchings and “made by teachers to argue the benefits of Jim Crow laws,” according to the complaint.

The Department of Justice decided to investigate both issues. Four staffers were assigned to the restraint and seclusion investigation, said Emily Harvey, co-legal director at Disability Law Colorado.

As part of the inquiry, Justice officials visited the district twice. The second time was during the final week of Biden’s presidency.

After that visit, Douglas County didn’t hear anything about the investigation from the Trump administration until a mid-May email. “Good morning,” it read. “We are having some staffing changes.”

The email, which The Hechinger Report obtained through a public records request, said that going forward, the district could contact two staffers on the restraint and seclusion case. The racial harassment case would be reduced to only one employee until another Justice staffer returned from leave in the fall.

One Douglas County parent, who asked her name be withheld because she is afraid of retaliation from the district, said that although she knew the investigation could take a couple of years, the longer it goes without a resolution, the more children could be harmed.

“The justice system is just moving so incredibly slow,” she said.

The parent said she knows of dozens of families who have dealt with restraint and seclusion issues in the district. Her own son, she said, was secluded in kindergarten. “He was scared of the person who put him in there. He kept saying, ‘I can’t go back,’” she said. “I never envisioned, until my son was secluded, a world where the school would not care about my child.”

When Harvey, of Disability Law Colorado, first contacted the Department of Justice, she hoped for statewide reform. She wanted to see a ban on seclusion, like Margolis had helped secure in Maryland, and for the state to commit to more accurate tracking of use of restraints. The way Colorado law is written, restraints must be recorded only if they last more than a minute. Douglas County, the second largest in the state with 62,000 students, reported 582 restraints to the Colorado Department of Education in the 2023-24 school year. The number of shorter-term restraints, however, is unknown.

“We believe this is an arbitrary distinction,” Harvey said. “My hope was that the Department of Justice would potentially weigh in on that as a violation” of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Douglas County school administrators said in a statement to The Hechinger Report that their “focus is on taking care of each and every one of our students” and that they take all concerns seriously.

They have worked with the federal government to set up school visits and interviews during their visits, according to emails from January.

Subsequent emails between district and federal officials describe a phone call over the summer and requests for additional documents. Another DOJ employee was included in the messages.

There are signs that the Justice Department is not abandoning restraint and seclusion work, said Guy Stephens, founder of the national advocacy group Alliance Against Seclusion and Restraint. A webpage about previous cases that was removed after Trump took office has been restored, and in July, the DOJ announced a settlement with a Michigan district over these issues.

Yet Stephens has concerns. “There are still people very, very dedicated to this work and the mission of this work, but it’s very hard to work in a system that is shifting and reprioritizing,” he said.

Former DOJ employees worry that it might not only be future investigations that are markedly different. The department has historically monitored places where it has reached agreements that demand corrective action, rewriting them if districts or colleges fail to live up to their promises. It also provides support to achieve the new goals. Now, provisions written into past resolutions might be at odds with Trump administration actions, and oversight of some settlements is ending early.

Take, for instance, a DOJ investigation into Vermont’s Elmore-Morristown Unified Union School District over allegations of race-based harassment against Black students. Investigators found that the district didn’t have a way to handle harassment or discrimination not targeted at a specific person, according to David Bickford, the school board chairman.

As part of a settlement agreement signed two weeks before Trump was inaugurated, the district agreed to provide staff training on implicit bias. A Trump executive order, however, calls for eliminating federal funding for anyone that discusses such a concept in schools.

Bickford said that the district has complied with everything the settlement called for, including professional development.

The investigation itself, he said, was extremely thorough, and required handing over nearly a thousand pages of documentation. Since then, the district has sent regular reports to the department but has not received any lengthy response or input, Bickford said. He also noted there had been staffing changes in who the district reports to.

Justice officials decided to end supervision of a 2023 settlement early following a racial harassment investigation in another Vermont district, Twin Valley. The original plan was to monitor the district for three years. In October 2024, investigators visited the district to check in. In a letter two months later, officials noted that while Twin Valley had made significant progress, they still had several areas of concern, including how the district investigated complaints, as well as “persistent biased language and behavior on the basis of multiple protected classifications; a pervasive culture of sexism; and lack of consistent and effective adult response to biased language and behavior.”

Even so, the department was pleased overall with its visit, said Bill Bazyk, superintendent of Windham Southwest Supervisory Union, which includes Twin Valley. “But things certainly sped up after the election,” said Bazyk, who started his job after the case had been settled.

Throughout the spring, Bayzk and his staff checked in with the department, and in May the district was told oversight of the settlement would end a year early, as Twin Valley had fully complied with the terms.

“We were doing all the right things,” Bayzk said, noting that the district’s work on diversity and equity is ongoing. “We took the settlement very seriously.”

The investigation began in 2021 after the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont filed a complaint. Legal Director Lia Ernst said it is possible that Twin Valley resolved those lingering problems between December and May, stressing that it’s impossible to know from the outside. But still, she said, there is a larger pattern of ambivalence to the Justice Department’s approach to civil rights complaints.

“It is disappointing to see that one ending early,” she said. “It is my hope that it is ending early because Twin Valley has made so much progress, but it is my fear that it is ending early because DOJ just doesn’t care.”

And senior politicians advocated the deportation of longtime U.K. residents born abroad.

The overt demonization of immigrants and those with immigrant roots is intensifying in the U.K. — and across Europe — as migration shoots up the political agenda and right-wing parties gain popularity.

In several European countries, political parties that favor mass deportations and depict immigration as a threat to national identity come at or near the top of opinion polls: Reform U.K., the Alliance for Germany and France’s National Rally.

President Donald Trump, who recently called Somali immigrants in the U.S. “garbage” and whose national security strategy depicts European countries as threatened by immigration, appears to be endorsing and emboldening Europe's coarse, anti-immigrant sentiments.

Amid the rising tensions, Europe's mainstream parties are taking a harder line on migration and at times using divisive language about race.

“What were once dismissed as being at the far extreme end of far-right politics has now become a central part of the political debate,” said Kieran Connell, a lecturer in British history at Queen’s University Belfast.

Immigration has risen dramatically over the past decade in some European countries, driven in part by millions of asylum-seekers who have come to Europe fleeing conflicts in Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine.

Asylum-seekers account for a small percentage of total immigration, however, and experts say antipathy toward diversity and migration stems from a mix of factors. Economic stagnation in the years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the rise of charismatic nationalist politicians and the polarizing influence of social media all play a role, experts say.

In Britain, there is “a frightening increase in the sense of national division and decline” and that tends to push people toward political extremes, said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Unit at King’s College London. It took root after the financial crisis, was reinforced by Britain's debate about Brexit and deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic, Duffy said.

Social media has exacerbated the mood, notably on X, whose algorithm promotes divisive content and whose owner, Elon Musk, approvingly retweets far-right posts.

Across Europe, ethnonationalism has been promoted by right-wing parties such as Alliance for Germany, France’s National Rally and the Fidesz party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.

Now it appears to have the stamp of approval from the Trump administration, whose new national security strategy depicts Europe as a collection of countries facing “economic decline” and “civilizational erasure” because of immigration and loss of national identities.

The hostile language alarmed many European politicians, but also echoed what they hear from their countries' far-right parties.

National Rally leader Jordan Bardella told the BBC he largely agreed with the Trump administration’s concern that mass immigration was “shaking the balance of European countries.”

Policies once considered extreme are now firmly on the political agenda. Reform UK, the hard-right party that consistently leads opinion polls, says if it wins power it will strip immigrants of permanent-resident status even if they have lived in the U.K. for decades. The center-right opposition Conservatives say they will deport British citizens with dual nationality who commit crimes.

A Reform UK lawmaker complained in October that advertisements were “full of Black people, full of Asian people.” Conservative justice spokesman Robert Jenrick remarked with concern that he “didn’t see another white face” in an area of Birmingham, Britain’s second-largest city Neither politician had to resign.

Many proponents of reduced immigration say they are concerned about integration and community cohesion, not race. But that's not how it feels to those on the receiving end of racial abuse.

“There is no doubt it has worsened,” said Dawn Butler, a Black British lawmaker who says the vitriol she receives on social media “is increasing drastically, and has escalated into death threats.”

U.K. government statistics show police in England and Wales recorded more than 115,000 hate crimes in the year to March 2025, a 2% increase over the previous 12 months.

In July 2024, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim violence erupted on Britain’s streets after three girls were stabbed to death at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class. Authorities said online misinformation wrongly identifying the U.K.-born teenage attacker as a Muslim migrant played a part.

In Ireland and in the Netherlands, protesters often demonstrate outside municipal meetings in communities where a new asylum center is proposed. Some protests have turned violent, with opponents of asylum-seekers throwing fireworks at riot police.

Across Europe, the main focus of protests has been hotels and other housing for asylum-seekers, which some say become magnets for crime and bad behavior. But the agenda of protest organizers is often much wider.

In September, more than 100,000 people chanting “We want our country back” marched through London in a protest organized by a far-right activist and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson. Among the speakers was French far-right politician Eric Zemmour, who told the crowd that France and the U.K. both faced “the great replacement of our European people by peoples coming from the south and of Muslim culture.”

Mainstream European politicians condemn the “great replacement” conspiracy theory. Britain’s center-left Labour Party government has denounced racism and says migration is an important part of Britain’s national story.

At the same time, it is taking a tougher line on immigration, announcing policies to make it harder for migrants to settle permanently. The government says it is inspired by Denmark, which has seen asylum applications plummet since it started giving refugees only short-term residence.

Denmark and Britain are among a group of European countries pushing to weaken legal protections for migrants and make deportations easier.

Human rights advocates argue that attempts to appease the right just lead to ever-more-extreme policies.

“For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” Council of Europe human rights commissioner Michael O’Flaherty told The Guardian. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around?”

Politicians of the political center also have been criticized for adopting the language of the far right. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in May that Britain risked becoming an “island of strangers,” a phrase that echoed a notorious 1968 anti-immigration speech by the politician Enoch Powell. Starmer later said he had been unaware of the echo and regretted using the phrase.

Germany’s center-right Chancellor Friedrich Merz has hardened his language on migrants as the Alternative for Germany has grown more powerful. Merz caused an uproar in October by saying Germany had a problem with its “Stadtbild,” a word that translates as “city image” or cityscape. Critics felt Merz was implying that people who don’t look German don’t truly belong.

Merz later stressed that “we need immigration,” without which certain sectors of the economy, including health care, would cease to function.

Duffy said politicians should be responsible and consider how their rhetoric shapes public attitudes — though he added that's “quite a forlorn hope.”

""The perception that this divisiveness works has taken hold,” he said.

Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling along the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, people gathered with paintings of Our Lady of Guadalupe on her feast day, Dec. 12, for a special prayer service for those detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Auxiliary Bishop Kevin T. Kenney of St. Paul and Minneapolis and Father Christopher Collins from the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul led the prayer service, which was held as federal officials conducted an immigration enforcement effort in the Twin Cities.

Barred from entering building

A parent of a local Catholic school student was apprehended by ICE the same day. A monthly prayer service is common at the Whipple Federal Building, but Dec. 12 many prayer members were surprised to find they were barred from entering. Security staff asked them to move off the building’s grounds. The request for a permit had been denied.

About a block from their usual spot for prayer, a tall evergreen tree protected about 40 people from below-zero windchill. Members of parishes such as the Basilica of St. Mary and Ascension, both in Minneapolis, huddled together and prayed a decade of the rosary — led by Bishop Kenney — sang hymns, and offered each other words of encouragement.

After the rosary, Bishop Kenney asked the group, “What’s the best way to get rid of ice on your sidewalks?” The answer was salt.

Salt in the Old Testament

“In the Old Testament, you sprinkle that salt, you rid the area of evil and bad happenings,” Bishop Kenney said. “I would recommend you bring salt to church with you and have it blessed and share it with your neighbors to sprinkle around homes, parishes, cars. It does offer protection. … Maybe if we put salt on the sidewalk, the ice will disappear.”

Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, an associate attorney at a local law firm, and the attorney representing the person apprehended by ICE, stopped by the prayer service to thank everyone for their support. She said the individual was being detained in Brainerd.

Family is ‘pretty torn up’

“I know her family really appreciates it,” Dhawan-Maloney said. “They’re pretty torn up right now. … I don’t know if there’s going to be a lot of options for her, to be honest.”

Father Collins told those gathered that the opposite of chaos is not order, but community, such as the one gathered in the cold outside the federal building.

Marking the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Bishop Kenney joined Archbishop Bernard A. Hebda and Bishop Michael Izen of St. Paul and Minneapolis in releasing a video Dec.12 reminding immigrants and their families that the Catholic Church stands beside them.

“Our Catholic faith teaches that every person is made in the image of God,” Archbishop Hebda said in the video. “And deserves respect, dignity and care.”

Our Lady of Guadalupe ‘walks with us’

“In this beautiful celebration of Our Lady of Guadalupe, we remember that she walks with us, especially with those who left their homeland in search of a better future,” Bishop Kenney said in the video.

During the prayer service, Bishop Kenney reminded those gathered of what Our Lady of Guadalupe said to St. Juan Diego. “Am I not here, I who am your mother?”

People lit candles and sang “Sancta Maria.” Several cried and embraced each other. After the prayers and hymns Bishop Kenney blessed the images of Our Lady of Guadalupe.

He didn’t earn much in Colombia and had a daughter to look after. He crossed the Darién Gap with an injured knee; he paid bribes to cartels in Mexico so that he would be allowed to continue his journey. Even so, he emphasizes, nothing compares to what he experienced at the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), the mega-prison in El Salvador built by President Nayib Bukele. That’s where he was sent — along with more than 200 other men — after being accused by U.S. President Donald Trump of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.

“I have nothing to do with it, nor have I ever had anything to do with it,” he says, in a park in northern Bogotá, after almost five months of freedom. “It’s been very hard to go back to normal life. It’s like starting from scratch.”

The Colombian-Venezuelan spent about a year in the United States. After applying for asylum, he lived between Los Angeles and Miami, doing various jobs: repairing cars, washing dishes, making deliveries and working in construction.

In January 2025, he had a court date in California, in order to determine his immigration status. He went, hoping to finally regularize his situation. “They took me into a room and told me to wait a while. Without warning, four immigration agents came in, slammed me against the wall and handcuffed me. I explained that I hadn’t done anything, but they didn’t care.”

Palencia says they took him to a basement, where other migrants were being held in a kind of makeshift jail. They allowed him to make a single phone call to notify his family about his arrest. Agents then took him to a detention center in the border city of Calexico, California. There, along with other Venezuelans, he learned that they were being linked to the Tren de Aragua gang. The only basis for this? Their origins and their tattoos.

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) — one of the largest civil rights organizations in the U.S. — there’s an arbitrary profiling system in place. If a Venezuelan migrant has tattoos of ordinary images — such as a clock, a crown, or a star — ICE may suspect them of being a gang member.

In early-March, U.S. authorities promised Palencia and his cellmates that they would soon be deported to Venezuela. By the middle of the month, they were on a plane to go home. Or so they thought.

Unbeknownst to them, President Trump had reached an agreement with his Salvadoran counterpart — Nayib Bukele — to deport more than 200 migrants to the Central American country under an 18th-century law that allows for the expulsion of “alien enemies” without judicial oversight. This meant that U.S. authorities never had to prove that the men were criminals.

Humanitarian organizations point out that half of those deported had no criminal record. The legality of this action — ordered by the White House — remains in dispute.

“The agents who were with us told us that we were going to Venezuela. We were happy and calm… even though our hands, feet and waists were tied up. On the first landing, they told us we had arrived in Honduras for a technical stop. The plane took off again, but touched down about 30 minutes later. We didn’t understand what was happening,” Palencia recounts. “We opened the windows and saw the army, riot police, trucks, armored vehicles…”

They were forcibly removed from the plane, beaten and taken to CECOT. In this mega-prison — according to several NGOs — hundreds of gang members are incarcerated and subjected to human rights violations.

Palencia had heard about this facility on TikTok. He knew gang members were imprisoned there, but he didn’t know that it was “a hellhole.”

As soon as they arrived at CECOT, the Salvadoran agents changed them into white uniforms and shaved their heads. “They told us that we were going to spend the rest of our lives there. That no one came out alive.” The routine consisted of waking up at 4 a.m., taking a shower and spending almost the entire rest of the day sitting in silence until bedtime, at around 9 p.m. If the prisoners made any noise or didn’t stick to the established schedule, the guards punished them without mercy.

The moments Palencia remembers most vividly are when the inmates tried to protest their detention. “We went on a hunger strike and a blood strike [self-inflicted wounds]; we rioted to keep the guards from entering our cellblock. But they came in anyway. Once, they used pepper spray on us, which [temporarily] blinded me and set my whole body on fire. They also hit me in the face with a baton. It opened a deep cut on my eyebrow, which a nurse closed without anesthesia,” he recounts.

Today, Palencia considers himself to be among the lucky ones. Several of his cellmates were hit at point-blank range by rubber bullets, causing serious injuries, as documented in a report published by Human Rights Watch.

Palencia was also on “the island” — the nickname for the isolation and torture cell at CECOT. “They dragged me in as I was bent over, almost licking the floor. The only thing I could see before they started kicking and hitting me with batons were their black boots. I had to pretend to faint for them to stop,” he recalls. “The island,” as he remembers it, has a few cells and a tiny opening, with a bit of light coming through. Each cell consists of a toilet and a small cement bed.

His release was sudden and without warning. It was July 18. “Around 3 a.m., some guards arrived and ordered us to shower. We couldn’t be sure, but several of us started celebrating and crying because it was very likely that we would be freed.” Indeed, this turned out to be the case.

That night, Palencia didn’t sleep in the cell where he had been held for what felt like years. He slept in a hotel in La Guaira, near Caracas. The horror was over. Trump had reached an agreement with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s government to exchange more than 200 migrants for prisoners in Venezuelan jails, including several U.S. citizens.

Looking back, he doesn’t hesitate to call what happened to him “the worst experience” of his life. “Being tortured for four months when you’re innocent is truly a nightmare,” he asserts. Palencia denounces the U.S. government’s policy on migrants, specifically Venezuelans. “They say we’re criminals, but they’re the real criminals.”

After a few months in Venezuela, he returned to Bogotá, where his parents and daughter live. “I cried with joy when we were reunited. I could only thank God for being with her again,” he sighs.

Otherwise, his return to freedom has been marked by uncertainty. “It’s been tough. I went [to the United States] with a purpose, to be able to [work and] buy the things [we needed]. Going back means starting from scratch. And I’m worse off than before I left: I came out [of the prison] with a diabetes problem. Because of the beatings, my arm can’t handle heavy work,” he laments.

Aside from the physical ailments, he says that he’s not sleeping very much. He sometimes wakes up in a daze. He drives a motorcycle for ride-hailing apps and delivery services, in order to continue supporting his family. When asked if he would consider returning to the United States, Palencia is emphatic: “If they give me papers, yes. But I’m never going back to prison.”",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GMX23D3TCFAVZCUXYIVXDWZFSI.jpg?auth=24ddab273bdb9cddcf4ee0a385fef867f1ee447adf7da9645e1bb3624ae86eb7&width=1200,N,,2025-12-14 01:56:50.842887

Before Trump, ICE didn’t get involved with domestic travel—and the TSA didn’t concern itself with immigration matters. But since March, according to a new report by The New York Times, the two agencies have quietly been working together to apprehend people at the airport at the command of the Trump administration.

According to the Times, it’s not clear how many arrests have been made so far. But the paper obtained documents that show the program led to the arrest of 19-year-old Any Lucía López Belloza, who was picked up at Boston Logan Airport when trying to visit her family in Texas for Thanksgiving. Two days later, López was deported to Honduras, where she had not been since she was 7 years old.

According to former ICE officials interviewed by the Times, the program can help the agency meet its high deportation quotas—plus, it allows agents to quickly deport those caught, like López.

“The administration has turned routine travel into a force multiplier for removals, potentially identifying thousands who thought they could evade the law simply by boarding a plane,” said former deputy head of ICE in New York City, Scott Mechkowski.

Since Trump took office in January, many in the U.S. have been living in fear. Trump’s deportation campaign has led to the arrest and detention of immigrants and citizens alike. People have been grabbed by ICE off the street, from their apartments, from their places of work. Now, the airport is another place that’s no longer safe.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, expressed no remorse for the position she’s put people in. “The message to those in the country illegally is clear: The only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home,” she said.

In the wee hours of Saturday morning, the president laid into Republicans who voted against his gerrymandering campaign in Indiana. Perhaps unable to sleep due to the crushing sting of defeat, Donald Trump took to Truth Social close to 1 a.m. to mock and threaten the state’s legislators.

“Republicans in the Indiana State Senate, who voted against a Majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, should be ashamed of themselves,” Trump wrote. “Headed by a total loser named Rod Bray, every one of these people should be “primaried,” and I will be there to help! Indiana, which I won big, is the only state in the Union to do this!”

On Thursday, Indiana lawmakers voted down Trump’s midcycle redistricting push, choosing to keep election maps the same rather than gerrymander them to Republicans’ advantage. For weeks leading up to the vote, the president had been bullying the Hoosier state’s lawmakers in an attempt to shore up support.

After the vote, Trump turned his fury on state Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, the main opponent to redistricting. Bray believes the state should instead work on flipping a preexisting district rather than blowing up the whole map—a risky move that would narrow Republicans’ margins in the new districts, and could even result in a loss of seats, he told Politico.

Trump has made it clear that if a Republican is unwilling to follow his agenda to the letter, he’ll put his weight behind a primary challenger. Hours before the vote Thursday, he posted, “Rod Bray and his friends won’t be in Politics for long, and I will do everything within my power to make sure that they will not hurt the Republican Party, and our Country, again.”

Read more about Trump’s redistricting fight:

Republicans are scrambling for a next move after President Donald Trump’s humiliating failure to bully Indiana lawmakers into bending to the president’s gerrymandering scheme.

On Thursday, Indiana lawmakers rejected the president’s push for midcycle redistricting in the Hoosier State to ensure Republican victory in the 2026 midterms. Indiana Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith claimed that the Trump administration had even threatened to withhold federal funding if they refused—but lawmakers wouldn’t budge.

With the midterms fast approaching and the Republican Party’s prospects looking increasingly grim, Trump’s allies have started to discuss where to turn up the heat next.

“Nebraska and Kansas are two top targets,” wrote Tyler Bowyer, chief operating officer of Turning Point Action, the advocacy arm of Charlie Kirk’s organization, in a post on X Friday.

But even he had to admit that Republicans faced some challenges in those states. “Nebraska did not help the President by passing winner-take-all last year. Not a great sign for redistricting. Kansas is controlled by the Koch HQ,” Bowyer wrote.

In Nebraska, the unicameral legislature requires the support of every Republican to advance redistricting, but 83-year-old state Senator Merv Riepe is not buying in. He previously blocked Trump’s 2024 effort to reshape the state’s split Electoral College vote into a winner-takes-all state, and seems similarly uninterested in supporting his gerrymandering this time around.

“I don’t think it’s a necessity for us,” Riepe said in October.

In Kansas, Republicans haven’t seemed all that anxious to get on board the president’s push for redistricting, either. Republicans will need a two-thirds majority to redraw the maps and override an expected veto from Governor Laura Kelly.

Meanwhile, the Heritage Foundation, the far-right think tank behind Project 2025, this week published a report that listed ending ranked-choice voting as a policy priority in 2026. Michigan is currently the only state circulating a ranked-choice ballot petition, meaning that Republicans are likely to target efforts to impose a new voting system there.

The chair of the Republican National Committee is issuing a dire warning to Republicans: Anticipate losing next November.

The president’s handpicked RNC leader, Joe Gruters, has been preaching the caucus’s impending doom ahead of the 2026 midterms in a transparent attempt to lower expectations. Gruters joined several right-wing podcasts and Christian television networks to spread the word that the GOP is coming up against a “looming disaster.”

“The chances are Republicans will go down and will go down hard,” Gruters said.

“This is an absolute disaster. No matter what party is in power, they usually get crushed in the midterms,” Gruters told Salem News Channel, a new media entity co-owned by Trump’s son Don Jr.

Republicans have had a trifecta in Washington since Donald Trump returned to office, white-knuckling every branch of the federal government. If history is any indicator, that won’t bode well for the party come next year: In a typical midterm cycle, the presidential party loses grounds via midterms, a phenomenon known as the “presidential penalty.” Those are the basic odds, even before Trump’s devastating tariffs and wildly controversial immigration agenda are taken into account.

But early indicators—such as a healthy dose of special elections in the last year—suggest that the national backlash to Trump’s second-term agenda could be worse for the party than usual. Democrats have seen surprising gains in unexpected areas of the country, including in Tennessee, Georgia, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, Republicans seem to be on the verge of panic. Anxious about midterms, the White House has spent months trying to pressure red states to gerrymander their congressional lines to turn a handful of seats in Congress. But so far, the pressure campaign has backfired: On Thursday, Indiana state senators overwhelmingly voted against the effort, citing Trump’s open threats and his crass mouth as their rationale.

Gruters’s comments have similarly raised a stir. The Heritage Foundation’s news site, Townhall, blasted The Bulwark for first publishing Gruters’s opinion, claiming that the “story is FAKE” because the publication had edited out Gruters’s words to eliminate his alleged faith in the caucus. But in doing so, Townhall cut out Gruters’s conclusion: “We are facing almost certain defeat,” he said.

President Donald Trump just got hit with a lawsuit over his enormous $300 million ballroom that would dwarf the White House.

In a 65-page complaint filed Friday, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit organization working to save America’s historic places, argued that Trump did not have the constitutional authority to fast-track construction for a project of this scale, and has violated the Administrative Procedures Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

The lawsuit also notes that Congress is required to approve any construction on federal land, and the White House is located at the White House and President’s Park, a national park.

In October, Trump fired all six members of the Commission on Fine Arts, which is charged with advising the federal government on the art, design, and architectural development of Washington, seeming to clear the way for him to make any changes he likes to the nation’s monuments. A Trump official said the members would be replaced by those who were “more aligned with President Trump’s ‘America First’ policies,” but two months later, the seats still remain empty.

The legal challenge is just the latest issue to complicate Trump’s plans for a behemoth ballroom. Trump has reportedly had a falling-out with his architect, James McCrery II, who argued that the 90,000-square-foot blueprint would overshadow the 55,000-square-foot White House mansion, violating basic architectural principles.

Trump has repeatedly misled the public about the construction process, claiming that the original structure of the White House wouldn’t be touched—before razing the entire East Wing. He also claimed that the project would only cost $200 million, but that number has since ballooned to $300 million.

The privately funded ballroom has presented a golden opportunity for the country’s wealthiest families and biggest corporations to make good with the Trump administration—and a few defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Palantir have also tossed the president some cash for his vanity project.

Trump has repeatedly turned his attention away from actually governing to the destruction of American landmarks. Trump has redone the Oval Office in the gaudy gold style of Mar-a-Lago, added stupid signs and white marble bathrooms to the White House, paved over the Rose Garden, pitched an “Arc de Trump” monument, and the builder in chief recently declared his intention to “fix” the 100-year-old Reflecting Pool on the National Mall in Washington. Fix what, exactly? Your guess is as good as ours.

Unfortunately for Indiana Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith, what he posts on the internet stays forever.

Beckwith deleted a Thursday post that confirmed the Trump administration had threatened to pull federal funding from Indiana if state legislators refused to bend to the president’s gerrymandering scheme.

“The Trump admin was VERY clear about this,” Beckwith wrote in the since-deleted post. “They told many lawmakers, cabinet members and the Gov and I that this would happen. The Indiana Senate made it clear to the Trump Admin today that they do not want to be partners with the WH. The WH made it clear to them that they’d oblige.”

He was responding to another post by the Heritage Foundation, which claimed that Trump would withhold national funding from Indiana if it refused to draw new congressional lines, just five years after approving the last batch of maps.

“Roads will not be paved. Guard bases will close. Major projects will stop. These are the stakes and every NO vote will be to blame,” the official account for the Heritage Foundation wrote.

But Indiana’s Senate did reject the White House’s pressure campaign late Thursday, with 21 Republican senators voting against the scheme. Their rationale for doing so ranged from personal disgust with the president’s language to the personal, violent threats they endured for considering voting against the effort.

Why Beckwith would have felt pressured to delete his post—within hours of making it—is not clear.

Anxious about the 2026 midterms, Trump issued directives to several red states, including Indiana, to redraw their congressional maps in order to bolster Republicans’ razor-thin majority in the House. In Indiana’s case, that unprecedented, long-shot effort would have won the GOP two more seats in the U.S. House.

But so far, bullying lawmakers and barking demands has not been a successful midterm strategy for the Republican leader. Redistricting efforts have crumbled in other red states where Trump issued gerrymandering directives, though not always due to the same ferocious local pushback.

The White House’s propaganda is getting sketchier.

The official X account for the executive mansion released new figures about the economy Thursday, proclaiming that 91 percent of Americans noticed “gas prices were dropping.” The source of that information, however, was from a White House email survey.

Meanwhile, practically every American has felt the ramifications of Donald Trump’s rattling economic policies. The Drudge Report, the most heavily trafficked conservative news aggregator, topped its site Friday with the headline: “POLL: ‘TIS THE SEASON FOR INFLATION.”

The AP-NORC poll found that large shares of American shoppers are dipping into their savings to afford buying presents this holiday season, with half of polled Americans reporting that it’s harder than usual to afford the things they would typically try to buy.

Roughly the same percentage of U.S.-based shoppers said they were cutting back on nonessentials or big purchases in order to afford their needs, according to the poll.

The findings make sense: An analysis by the Groundwork Collective of popular holiday gifts found that prices skyrocketed by a whopping 26 percent this holiday season.

The disparity between the White House’s messaging and what’s actually happening boils down to the president, who has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there is “no” inflation, that the word “groceries” is an “old fashioned” term, and that the issue of affordability is a “con job” and a “fake narrative” invented by Democrats to trick the public into not supporting him.

“When will I get credit for having created, with No Inflation, perhaps the Greatest Economy in the History of our Country? When will people understand what is happening?” Trump whined Thursday on Truth Social. “When will Polls reflect the Greatness of America at this point in time, and how bad it was just one year ago?”

Inflation has been accelerating since April, when Trump first announced his “liberation day” tariffs. Eight months later, practically everything on the U.S. market is more expensive than it used to be, as companies pass off the cost of the president’s tariffs onto consumers. Food and energy costs are up compared to figures from last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even American-made goods have taken a hit by the tariffs, since more often than not they are created with parts sourced from other areas of the world.

But the commander-in-chief seems to be completely out of touch with that reality. In an interview earlier this week with Politico’s Dasha Burns, Trump remarked that he would rate the current state of the economy “A+++++.”

President Donald Trump still can’t seem to wrap his head around the fact that the United States is a democracy.

While signing an executive order aimed at preventing states from regulating artificial intelligence, Trump whined that states needed to be “unified” on his approach to AI, in order for the country to win global dominance over China.

“We have to be unified. China is unified because they have one vote, that’s President Xi [Jinping]. He says ‘do it,’ and that’s the end of that. You know, we have a different system,” Trump said. “But we have a system that’s good—but we only have a system that’s good if it’s smart.”

As the president spoke, sitting behind his desk, he covered his right hand, where a massive, mysterious bruise has formed.

Meanwhile, the folks watching at home weren’t impressed by Trump’s longing for a unitary government and his dismissal of his own country’s so-called “different system.”

“Yes, it’s called DEMOCRACY,” wrote California Governor Gavin Newsom on X.

This isn’t the first time Trump has longed for another form of government. After visiting China earlier this year, the president said he wished his Cabinet secretaries would greet him with stoic compliance (even though their meetings are already a well-documented spectacle of sycophancy).",https://images.newrepublic.com/669f97794d4e652c5c2b007ccb40d140cadafc41.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:56:28.634567

Since the shooting of two members of the National Guard in Washington last month, President Trump has clamped down on immigration from Afghanistan. The administration has paused programs Afghans can use to legally come to the U.S., including visas, and has stripped temporary permissions to stay from Afghans who are already here. Among those impacted are Afghan citizens who helped the U.S. during the war. As NPR's Ximena Bustillo reports, some Republicans think these restrictions have gone too far.

XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Shawn VanDiver is the founder of #AfghanEvac, an organization that advocates for Afghans who supported the U.S. military. He's been tracking how these wartime allies have been impacted by Trump's immigration policies.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SHAWN VANDIVER: Halting asylum decisions, suspending visa processing for Afghans, rereviewing every refugee admitted under the last administration, while fast tracking others they see as more desirable.

BUSTILLO: Some of these changes came after the deadly shooting of a National Guard member allegedly by an Afghan national. The policy changes have highlighted a rift within the GOP over who should be allowed into the United States. Some Republicans still want to extend a legal pathway. Here, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina talking about the aftermath of the shooting.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

THOM TILLIS: It's unfortunate that it happened, but that by itself can't be a reason to shut down any consideration going forward or even reconsidering some of the other ones.

BUSTILLO: Others like Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine agree with the Trump administration that there needs to be more vetting but not that the program should be shut down.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SUSAN COLLINS: There are Afghan citizens who acted as guards, drivers, interpreters, cooks for our troops. So I think the answer is more intensive and careful vetting.

BUSTILLO: And others, like Republican Senator James Lankford, who sits on the Homeland Security Committee, say it's not Congress' job to intervene.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JAMES LANKFORD: Primarily that's an executive branch issue. The vetting process does exist and is out there. It's just a matter of its execution at this point or making...

BUSTILLO: The suspected shooter was approved for asylum earlier this year, but it's unclear what additional vetting could've helped. He had previously worked for a unit of the CIA. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the Afghan national had been radicalized after coming to the U.S. A spokesperson for the department told NPR the safety of the American people always comes first when asked about the policy changes. Still, some advocates, like VanDiver, say Congress is not doing enough to stand up for America's allies after a long war.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VANDIVER: Instead of asserting its constitutional role, Congress has allowed itself to be sidelined, failing to provide meaningful oversight. The vacuum they have left is being filled with fearmongering, not facts, politics, not policy.

BUSTILLO: Some lawmakers had added a bipartisan provision to the national defense policy bill that would've brought back a State Department office that relocates Afghan refugees, but House GOP leaders pulled it out of the bill that they voted on this past week.

According to observers, ICE agents surrounded the site around 10 a.m., blocking access and attempting to detain two construction workers. Video shared with reporters shows a tense but mostly peaceful standoff between agents and roughly 100 demonstrators who arrived after word of the operation spread.

Ann Wiesner, who was on scene, said the crowd remained peaceful despite the nearly 50 federal agents. “There were people there of all different races who were saying, This is not the country I want to live in,” Wiesner said. “There were people of faith there who were praying.”

Democratic State Representative Alex Falconer, who was also on scene, says the way ICE conducted its raid is alarming.

“Immediately, when I showed up, I was asking, Do you have a judicial warrant? Do you have the names of the people you’re looking for?” Falconer said. “They said no. They did not have a warrant, which raises obvious concerns.”

Observers say the operation lasted more than three hours in frigid conditions. Both Falconer and Wiesner say that after spending hours on the roof in the freezing cold, one of the workers was placed on a stretcher by EMS and taken to the hospital with ICE agents following behind.

""I think what's happening is cruel, and I can't be silent,"" Wiesner said.

Now, many in the community, according to immigration advocates, are panicking after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced on Friday that it's terminating the Temporary Protected Status designation of Ethiopia. That means any Ethiopians in the United States under the TPS designation have 60 days to leave the country or be subject to deportation.

""It just doesn't make sense,"" said Lidia Tamerat, with the nonprofit Colorado Ethiopian Community. ""We're business owners. We're part of the community.""

She says many Ethiopians immigrated to the United States seeking safety from the civil war that started in 2018, with many immigrating to the U.S. in 2022.

""It was very hard. There is famine. There was killing. There was a lot that was happening. And the country is still very unsettled,"" Tamerat said.

About 4,500 Ethiopian immigrants have been granted TPS designation by the U.S. government so they could resettle and work, according to Congressional data, but those days have come to an end.

Regarding the cancellation, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson said, ""Temporary Protected Status designations are time-limited and were never meant to be a ticket to permanent residency,"" and ""conditions in Ethiopia no longer pose a serious threat to the personal safety of returning Ethiopian nationals.""

The U.S. Department of State has a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Ethiopia right now, saying on its website, ""Reconsider travel to Ethiopia due to sporadic violent conflict, civil unrest, crime, communications disruptions, terrorism and kidnapping in border areas.""

Tamerat says the Ethiopian community is in a state of panic and disagrees that Ethiopia is a safe place to return to.

""For people that have been here since 2022, they've established a life. They're just sending their children to school. A lot of them do have employment authorization cards, so they have started work,"" Tamerat said. ""There's still a lot of ethnic war happening. It's really hard for those that are living there to find jobs, to feed their family. There's still parts of Ethiopia that's facing famine.""

DHS is giving Ethiopians under TPS designation until February 2026 to self-deport. The agency added that if they use the U.S. Customs and Border Protection mobile app to report their departure, they will get a complimentary plane ticket and a $1,000 exit bonus.

Bruna Ferreira was detained by federal immigration authorities last month despite her status as a legal resident under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

“It doesn’t make sense. I’m trying to understand and have faith that there’s some logical explanation behind any of this, but there isn’t. I’m not the first,” she said during a Friday appearance on CNN’s “Erin Burnett OutFront.”

“I’m surely not going to be the last. There’s thousands of women and families and children being separated daily. Where does it end? When does it stop?” she added.

Ferreira said she believes she was targeted, as police seemed to know her movements and whereabouts. Her attorney told Burnett that she’s been working to apply for her green card after being brought to the United States by her parents at age 6.

“The reality is here that she’s in line for her green card, like tens of thousands of other people. And throughout the country, people are just being illegally arrested when they’re in the middle or the beginning or the end of a lawful process that congress created roughly in the mid ’90s,” her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said.

“The laws aren’t perfect, but they’re there for a reason. People are entitled to due process of law,” he added.

Earlier this week, an immigration judge ordered Ferreira’s release, however, she still faces scrutiny as the Department of Homeland Security previously alleged she’s a criminal.

“I’m heartbroken. I’m heartbroken for my son, you know, I’m heartbroken for my mother, who has worked for a quarter of a century cleaning houses, earned an honest living, has paid her taxes. I’ve been a law-abiding citizen. I don’t even have a parking ticket,” Ferreira said.

“And I’m so proud of it. I’m proud of my name, and I carry it like a badge of honor, you know, like being on an honor roll. And now my child is sitting somewhere watching them broadcast this 24 hours a day, seven days a week. As a child, he must be terrified. ‘Is it true? Did my mom do something? Do I not know about it?’ Gossip in school,” she added.

She was originally arrested while attempting to pick up her son, Michael, whom she shares with Leavitt’s brother, in a Boston suburb.

“I don’t know what’s going on in his little mind. And I just want him to know that none of those things are true, honey.

Who Is Justice G.R.
Justice G.R.
The immediate trigger for the impeachment notice was an order passed by Justice Swaminathan in relation to Thiruparankundram in Madurai.
Conclusion The Justice G.R.","Introduction

The proposed Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment has triggered one of the most serious constitutional debates in recent years, bringing into focus the balance between judicial independence and judicial accountability. A notice for his removal, signed by more than 100 opposition Members of Parliament, has been submitted to the Lok Sabha Speaker alleging misconduct and lack of impartiality by a sitting judge of the Madras High Court.

Impeachment of judges is constitutionally permitted but intentionally made extremely difficult. The present controversy therefore raises a fundamental question: can disagreement with judicial reasoning justify invoking the impeachment mechanism?

Who Is Justice G.R. Swaminathan?

Justice G.R. Swaminathan was elevated as a judge of the Madras High Court in 2017. He is known for detailed judgments that frequently engage with constitutional philosophy, legal history, and comparative jurisprudence. His judicial work spans criminal law, constitutional interpretation, religious and cultural disputes, and questions of social justice.

What Triggered the Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment Motion?

The immediate trigger for the impeachment notice was an order passed by Justice Swaminathan in relation to Thiruparankundram in Madurai. The dispute concerned the lighting of a Karthigai Deepam on a traditional stone pillar located near a dargah. The court permitted the lighting of the lamp, which led to political backlash from certain parties.

Critics alleged that the order reflected ideological bias and raised concerns regarding religious neutrality and constitutional secularism.

Allegations Mentioned in the Impeachment Notice

Judicial bias and lack of neutrality

Conduct unbecoming of a constitutional court judge

Violation of secular constitutional principles

Judicial indiscipline in observations and reasoning

Notably, the notice does not allege corruption, bribery, or personal enrichment, which have historically formed the core grounds for impeachment proceedings.

Constitutional Framework for Removal of Judges

Articles 124(4) and 218 of the Constitution govern the removal of judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts. A judge may be removed only on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity.

Procedure for Impeachment

Notice signed by at least 100 Lok Sabha MPs or 50 Rajya Sabha MPs

Admission of the motion by the Speaker or Chairman

Constitution of a three-member inquiry committee

Proof of charges after investigation

Special majority vote in both Houses of Parliament

Opposition by Former Judges

In response to the Justice G.R. Swaminathan impeachment notice, 56 former judges of the Supreme Court and various High Courts publicly opposed the move. They warned that using impeachment to challenge judicial reasoning threatens judicial independence and could intimidate judges from delivering fearless decisions.

They emphasized that the proper remedy against incorrect or controversial judgments lies in appeal or review, not impeachment.

Judicial Independence vs Judicial Accountability

The controversy highlights a constitutional tension. Judicial independence protects judges from political retaliation and allows them to decide cases without fear. Judicial accountability ensures ethical conduct and adherence to constitutional values.

The central issue is whether disagreement with a judge’s interpretative approach can amount to constitutional misbehaviour.

Historical Perspective on Impeachment in India

India has witnessed very few impeachment attempts against judges, and none have resulted in removal through parliamentary vote. In past cases, allegations involved financial impropriety or abuse of office rather than dissatisfaction with judicial reasoning.

Legal Significance of the Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment Attempt

It focuses on judicial reasoning rather than corruption

It risks expanding the meaning of proved misbehaviour

It may weaken the separation of powers doctrine

It could have a chilling effect on judicial independence

What Happens Next?

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha will decide whether to admit the impeachment motion. If admitted, an inquiry committee will be formed to examine whether the allegations meet the high constitutional threshold required for removal.

Conclusion

The Justice G.R. Swaminathan Impeachment controversy is a test of India’s constitutional framework. While judicial accountability is essential, transforming ideological or legal disagreement into impeachment risks undermining the independence of the judiciary.

How this episode is handled will have lasting consequences for the balance of power between Parliament and the judiciary and for the future of constitutional governance in India.",https://www.legalserviceindia.com/Legal-Articles/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/justice-gr-swaminathan-impeachment-constitutional-debate.webp,N,,2025-12-14 06:56:20.741435

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California.
Let me repeat: For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement.
At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles.","The Trump administration must remove California National Guard troops from Los Angeles by Monday, a federal appellate court ruled. The decision upheld a lower court order that halted the mobilization that had roiled the nation’s second-largest city for six months.

The ruling late Friday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit substantially upheld a district court decision from earlier this week that found the federal government had illegally prolonged the military presence in Los Angeles months after intense protests over immigration enforcement had died down.

The decision by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit effectively blocked the Trump administration from using the remaining 100 or so National Guard troops in California — at least, for the moment.

But the appellate judges temporarily blocked a key part of the order by District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer that would have forced the Trump administration to return control of the troops to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who ordinarily commands them.

California officials celebrated the move as a partial victory in a battle that has dragged on for months.

“The Ninth Circuit’s decision means that, come Monday, there will be no National Guard troops deployed in California. Let me repeat: For the first time in six months, there will be no military deployed on the streets of Los Angeles,” the state’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in a statement.

“California did not ask to be a testing ground for the president’s militarized vision of America,” he added. “There is no crisis to justify the National Guard’s continued presence, and we look forward to continuing to prove that in court.”

The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the deployment’s high point in June, about 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines were commandeered by the Trump administration and dispatched to Los Angeles. State and local officials objected strenuously to the move, calling it an inflammatory overreaction to scattered demonstrations that were being ably handled by local and state law enforcement agencies.

Mr. Newsom sued over the initial deployment, but the administration argued that the troops were responding to an emergency and were needed to protect federal agents and property. In June, the Ninth Circuit ruled that conditions in Los Angeles were sufficient for Mr. Trump to take control of the state’s National Guard and direct troops to provide protection during the enforcement of immigration laws.

The administration began gradually drawing down the number of federalized troops in July as public condemnation grew and protests abated. As of last month, about 300 California National Guard members remained under the president’s command, and most were in the process of being released to their usual duties, which generally involve part-time service controlled by the state.

State officials said on Friday that the California deployment consisted of about 100 troops on federal orders that were scheduled to last into February. Last week, Judge Breyer ruled that any emergency the president might have cited as justification for the deployment had long since ended, and that all remaining troops should be released from federal orders and returned to the governor’s command.

Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the law required an emergency only at the time the president decided to federalize National Guard troops, after which he could extend the deployment as long as he deemed necessary. They also said that troops were still needed to protect federal workers from threats stemming from immigration raids that have been intensely unpopular in immigrant-heavy Southern California.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/19/multimedia/13nat-ca-guard-01/19nat-ninth-circuit-fmwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 19:56:45.554576

Officials released an image purportedly showing the ICE officer’s bloodied hand following the alleged attack.

“During the arrest, Perez-Perez attempted to flee by pushing officers. He used his teeth as a weapon and clamped down on an ICE officers’ hand, breaking the skin and drawing blood,” Homeland Security said.

“Many of these assaults, including biting and vehicle rammings, are happening as a direct result of sanctuary politicians encouraging illegal aliens to evade arrest.”

DHS said Perez-Perez entered the United States at an unknown date and time and was not inspected or paroled by an immigration officer.

News of the arrest came on the same day ICE released an image showing a suspect accused of threatening federal agents being taken into custody by an officer from Homeland Security Investigations.

KANSAS CITY, Missouri ‒ Inside an ICE headquarters in a suburban office park hangs a printed text-message that immigration officers feel is aimed at them: ""Get a gun and shoot them in the streets.""

It's tacked on a cubicle wall that dozens of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pass by daily. The screenshot message also declares, ""This is a war.""

In response, an ICE agent wrote on the printout in all caps: ""BE VIGILANT!!""

For ICE Supervisory Detention and Deportation Officer Keone Feliciano, the note is an unavoidable reminder of the danger he and his colleagues face amidst rapidly increasing anger over the Trump administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement.

Across the country, Feliciano and other longtime ICE officers accustomed to operating below the radar have been thrust into the spotlight by President Donald Trump's orders to conduct the largest mass deportation in history.

For many, it's an uncomfortable position as they work to balance their self-image as patriotic, law-and-order Americans with the perception that they have suddenly become, in the words of one ICE officer, ""the bad guys.""

In response to Trump's orders, the deployment of masked federal agents across American communities has spawned sometimes violent backlash including shootings, attacks on ICE facilities and vehicle rammings

Protesters, the vast majority peaceful, say agents are crossing dangerous lines for American society, smashing car windows, chasing workers through restaurants and targeting people for detention seemingly at random.

To report on the perspective of both sides, USA TODAY journalists spent several days this November in Kansas City, accompanying ICE officers as they detained suspects, collected detainees from local jails, and loaded others onto a charter flight to Texas for eventual deportation.

We also spoke with Kansas City-area migrant advocates and local elected officials who say the expanded immigration enforcement is tearing communities apart, turning neighbor against neighbor and sparking heated confrontations over the tactics now being deployed.

On a cool November morning, Feliciano, an 11-year veteran of the department, raced his Dodge truck through the pre-dawn darkness to join his team as they arrested a previously deported Venezuelan man convicted of sex crimes.

Feliciano's white pickup was fresh from the repair shop after protesters tailed and rammed him on a busy street in Chicago amidst the controversial Operation Midway Blitz, during which Border Patrol agents fired tear gas at protesters after being confronted by angry crowds.

He helped chain and load the Venezuelan man into the back of an unmarked ICE vehicle. Then, Feliciano urged his officers to get off the streets quickly.

""The longer we're out here, the more attention it's going to draw,"" he said. ""Some people just like to drive by and be looky-loos, but some people could have hostile intentions. We just want to keep everybody safe and get out of here.""

'Pendulum swings' of enforcement strategies

Feliciano, a Navy veteran and former local police officer, said the pendulum swings between different presidential administrations have sometimes interfered with the reason he got into immigration enforcement: to remove criminals from American communities.

He said he's particularly proud whenever his team can deport convicted sex offenders, who he believes pose a significant public risk even after serving a criminal sentence.

There was a time under President Joe Biden, when, ""if we weren't able to immediately effect a removal, we were being ordered to just release them,"" Feliciano said. ""Which is why we have now such a huge backlog of aliens just floating in the country with pending cases that have gone nowhere.

""Now we have an administration that's saying, 'Stop releasing them. Put them back in custody,'"" he said.

The Venezuelan man Feliciano's team arrested in November had previously been deported from the United States following a statutory rape conviction. He reentered illegally; when he got arrested, he requested asylum, saying he feared returning to Venezuela.

A judge ruled the man could be deported to a third country like Mexico, ordered him fitted with a GPS tracker and released him back into the community, according to ICE officials. Re-entry after deportation is a felony, but making an asylum claim, especially during the Biden years, could qualify some people to remain free while their cases were pending.

Feliciano's team decided to detain the man after his GPS tracker detected tampering. It could have been a false alarm but potentially indicated the man had tried to remove it.

After staking out the man's house for several days, the team waited until he left for work early one morning before stopping his Honda Pilot near an empty intersection, blocking him in with multiple vehicles. Agents prefer traffic stops to entering homes for safety reasons.

The man surrendered immediately and was shackled. At his request, an officer drove his car back to his nearby house.

Growing tensions between ICE and advocates

Back at the ICE office in Kansas City, longtime officers sit next to fresh-faced recruits brought on under Trump's rapid agency expansion. Under the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" passed by Congress this summer, federal immigration agencies have been ordered to hire 18,500 new agents and support staff – roughly doubling the force.

Nationally, these new federal agents, often from Customs and Border Protection, have orders to pursue undocumented immigrants whether they have criminal convictions or not. Just over 40% of those currently in detention have only immigration violations ‒ no criminal convictions or pending charges ‒ a 25-fold increase since the start of the Trump administration, according to Ausin Kocher, an expert in immigrant enforcement at Syracuse University.

Like other hardline immigration enforcers, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino has suggested that prior presidential administrations broke faith with the American public by failing to properly restrict illegal immigration.

""We will not allow criminal illegal aliens to take over American communities. We will continue to track down illegal aliens in Los Angeles, Chicago, or any other city we choose,"" Bovino said in a Nov. 15 social media post. ""That is the way THIS team operates.""

This more combative approach took shape in Kansas City in late July when ICE officers swarmed into two popular Mexican restaurants in the western and southern suburbs, detaining about a dozen workers.

ICE had a criminal federal search warrant, signed by a judge, to search the premises as part of an ongoing investigation, officials said. Under the Trump administration priorities, ICE officials say they are under orders to question suspected undocumented immigrants whenever they encounter them.

As the raids unfolded, dozens of migrant-rights activists and community members surrounded the restaurants, screaming at federal agents and officers and damaging one of their vehicles. While protesters portrayed the raids as unwarranted and immoral, ICE officials consider the protests ill-informed activism.

ICE has still not explained specifically what officers were looking for during the raids, but note the restaurants had previously been under investigation for wage theft during the Biden administration. Activists say ICE's refusal to explain why the two restaurants were targeted for immigration enforcement is contributing to a lack of trust.

""We are feeling scared and worried but in a strange way we feel more empowered to speak up for our community. We feel this commitment to defend our people,"" said Melanie Arroyo, a member of the suburban Lenexa City Council, across the state line in Kansas.

Around Kansas City, community activists are handing out fliers advising people of their constitutional rights, including their right to remain silent, to not open the door to agents without seeing a warrant, and to film interactions from a safe distance.

The ""pendulum swings"" in immigration enforcement are spilling into local politics, too.

Arroyo's own citizenship was briefly investigated by state and local police after one of her constituents misunderstood legislative testimony she had given.

At first she thought it was amusing that someone had questioned her citizenship – until she realized neighbors were demanding to see her papers although she was an American citizen.

""This is a scary pattern and people need to wake up and recognize that we can't just be compliant. Because this is not OK,"" Arroyo said.

Accountability has deteriorated amidst the hiring spree and tougher enforcement environment, said Genevra Alberti, a longtime Kansas City immigration attorney. In recent months she's found the Kansas City ICE office less responsive to her inquiries about her clients and detention officers less cooperative when it comes to her concerns about overcrowded cells or health issues.

""There have always been officers here who I could tell enjoyed what they were doing, and for them, this is great,"" she said. ""They get to do what they've always wanted to do.""

Kansas state Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Democrat who represents suburban Kansas City, said the new harsher approach is rupturing the trust built between local police and immigrant communities, who have long been encouraged to report crimes against them even if they're living illegally in the United States.

""It has come to the point where no one is trusting each other. People are not out in the community like they normally would be. That means they're not shopping. They're not going to school. It's affecting our entire way of life because you don't know who to trust. Can you trust your neighbor?"" Ruiz said.

'We're just enforcing the laws as written'

Feliciano and his team say they're using appropriate levels of force at a time when an increasing number of immigrants know that getting detained means they'll get deported.

Under past presidential administrations, undocumented immigrants were often allowed to remain free on bond or on GPS monitoring while their cases played out.

But the Trump White House has essentially ordered detention without bond until their case is decided for anyone livingwithout legal status in the United States. Others are being deported to third countries.

In the face of this shift, immigrants are feeling more desperate and are more likely to resist arrest, Feliciano said ‒ raising the danger for everyone involved.

""The detention space hasn't changed much but we're able to get people through the system faster,"" Feliciano said. ""We're getting people out of the country very, very quickly.""

That means undocumented immigrants stopped for routine traffic violations are now increasingly running away or refusing to cooperate with local police or ICE agents.

For longtime agents like Feliciano, this shift means being prepared for violence both from the person they're stopping and from community members angered by the White House orders. Hence the printout tacked to the cubicle wall.

Feliciano said the threat of violence from community members won't dissuade his Kansas City team from following their orders. He takes pride in the work his agents do targeting criminal offenders through surveillance and documentation.

Later in the week as he navigated his pickup to the Kansas City airport to oversee a deportation flight, Feliciano listed off all the ways detainees have their chance to plead their case in court, appeal the decisions and request asylum.

He said ICE officers like him are going to keep arresting people who pose a danger to the public, working as ordered by the White House, despite the concerns of what he called ""social justice warriors"" protesting in Chicago and other cities.

On the airport tarmac, Feliciano watched as members of his team frisked and chained detainees before they were loaded onto a charter flight headed to a centralized deportation facility in Texas. His phone rang; one of his other officers was calling to discuss details of ongoing surveillance for their next targeted arrest.

""We're not the feelings police. We're the law police,"" he said. ""And we're just enforcing the laws as they're written.""","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PTX1/87657208007-keone-ice-4319.JPG?crop=3497,1967,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-13 18:56:45.685506

And Tina Smith is a Democrat who represents Minnesota and announced this year that she won’t be seeking re-election in 2026.
Senator Flake, when you left the Senate, you had been serving in Congress for 18 years.
Flake: It’s not in vogue now, but I don’t think it’s gone.
So all of that argues to me that we need a Senate and a Congress that’s capable of making those big changes.","The United States Senate is at a precarious moment. From tariffs to agency funding to foreign affairs, the Senate’s check on the executive branch is arguably weaker than ever, with some critics, and some senators, warning that the body is abandoning its constitutionally prescribed role. (Congress is also incredibly unpopular: A recent Gallup poll showed its approval rating at a dreadful 15 percent.)

With that in mind, I wanted to have a different sort of conversation than we usually do on The Interview: a round table about the state of the Senate, and how we got here, with three lawmakers who decided to leave the body at different points in the Trump era.

Jeff Flake is a Republican who represented Arizona for 18 years, initially in the House and then in the Senate, before announcing that he would not seek re-election in 2018 because of President Trump’s influence on the Republican Party. Joe Manchin represented West Virginia, first as a Democrat — one who drove other Democrats crazy by frequently voting with Republicans — and later as a registered independent. He decided not to run for re-election and left the Senate at the start of the year. And Tina Smith is a Democrat who represents Minnesota and announced this year that she won’t be seeking re-election in 2026. I gathered them in Washington to get their read on the state of the Senate and of our politics and democracy more broadly. I told them that I hoped, because they are out of or nearly out of office, that they would feel free to be candid, to which Manchin replied, “That’s why we left!”

I want to start by asking you all to give me a word or a sentence that describes the state you think the Senate is in right now.

Tina Smith: Broken.

Jeff Flake: Retreat. The presidency, just by virtue of the system, gains more power over time. But what has been frustrating is to see the Senate just willingly give up Article I authority.

Joe Manchin: Abdication. They’ve abdicated their responsibilities. The Senate is the most unusual body in the world. Our framers designed it to be that way, and it was ingrained in me that the filibuster is the holy grail, keeping us talking and working and becoming friends. They’ve abdicated that type of responsibility.

Those are all pretty bleak words.

Manchin: You want us to call them cowards?

I want you to say what you think. Senator Flake, when you left the Senate, you had been serving in Congress for 18 years. In a speech you gave on the floor, you gave this warning: “Let us recognize, as authoritarianism reasserts itself in country after country, that we are by no means immune.” Do you think you were right to be concerned?

Senator Smith, you’ve said that you’re stepping down to spend more time with family and that it has nothing to do with politics. A lot of politicians who leave say that.

Manchin: Come on, tell us the truth!

Smith: [Laughs] I actually mean it, because I really like my family. But I’ve also said a few other things about why I’m leaving.

Representative Jared Golden of Maine, who is stepping down from the House, talked about the political nastiness and the political violence as reasons that he’s not seeking re-election. Are those issues weighing on you too?

Smith: Everything that has happened this year has certainly not made me wonder whether I made the right decision. This horrible political assassination of my dear friend Melissa Hortman, the speaker emeritus of the Minnesota House. We had the shooting at the Annunciation school, which is literally 10 blocks from where I live. And so the reality of these political attacks, and in this moment fueled by the president of the United States, who just a couple of weeks ago said that two of my colleagues and four members of the House of Representatives should be tried for treason and executed — of course these things all have impact. But there was another part of it for me, which is that I will be 68 next year.

Pretty young for a Democratic senator!

Smith: [Laughs] Yes, it is. And I am not burdened by the belief that I am the only one who can do this job.

Flake: When I left, I never said I wanted to spend more time with my family. I love my family, but I would have liked to have served another term. You don’t get all the way to the most exclusive club in the world and just want to stay one term. But the price for doing so would have been for me to say, “Those principles I said I believed in — I no longer do.” And that price was too steep to pay.

Manchin: Jeff, those of us who’ve been in these tough races before, when you’re facing something that you know is going to turn you into a different animal — that’s not who we are. But we’d have had to turn into another animal if we wanted to go on. I never faced an election where I thought the other side was the enemy. I learned from every election. If I was in a debate, after the election was over — I won most of them — I’d call the person, and I’d say: “You had some good ideas in that debate. Can we talk about that?” And start building relationships. That’s gone.

Flake: It’s not in vogue now, but I don’t think it’s gone.

Smith: I don’t think it’s gone either. I haven’t given up hope on that, Joe.

Manchin: I never give up. I’m just dealing with reality today. The thing that I saw, and Jeff, you can talk about this because you came from the House: I came from being a governor, which is the most collegial of all institutions. You could go to a governor’s [convention]. If I didn’t know that the person was a Republican or a Democrat, you could not tell the difference. We were all curing the same problems. But the House, you all operate on a simple majority. You don’t even have to acknowledge the other side. Don’t even have to let them be involved if you don’t want to. And I kept noticing more and more congresspeople that kept coming to the Senate with that mind-set made it harder for the Senate to stay collegial. Am I right?

Flake: Oh, definitely. The real turn in the House came in 2005. I got there in 2001, when we didn’t adopt formally but basically lived by the so-called Hastert rule. It wasn’t Hastert; it was really Tom DeLay and a few others, who said if you’re going to bring something to the floor as a Republican — and we had a bigger cushion at that time in the majority — that you should be able to pass it just with Republican votes. And if it might gather bipartisan votes, then knock some provisions off so it won’t be attractive and then use that as a cudgel during the next election. You had people mature as politicians under that system, and some of them have gone to the Senate.

One reason I wanted to bring you here is because you have the long view, and clearly all of this predates the era that we’re in now. But this era has supercharged what you’re discussing. And you’ve touched on one of the main critiques of the Senate right now. It’s something I heard when I sat with Senator Lisa Murkowski earlier this year, which is that the Senate, regardless of the partisan nature, is just not doing its job. It’s not acting as a check on the executive. Do you think that this is an enduring shift away from congressional power?

Flake: I don’t think it’s an enduring condition. I think it has to do with leadership. I look at the potential field on the Democratic and Republican sides, and you see some who will try to replicate what President Trump has done in terms of amassing power and stiffing the House and the Senate. But the vast majority of Republican senators who I’m most familiar with don’t like this at all. They want to reassert their prerogatives.

Smith: I completely agree with Jeff that behind the scenes you will hear many Republicans in the Senate say: “I don’t like this. I don’t think this is right.” But then they also say, “We’re just waiting for the right moment to actually do something about it.” And meanwhile, the powers of the Senate and the powers of the legislative branch are gushing out of the Capitol. I’m always so fascinated by the interpersonal relationships of everybody in the Senate. And the people that seem to feel the most betrayed right now are my Democratic colleagues who stake their careers on working across party lines to accomplish things. They were part of the gangs — so much of the work that you did, Joe, around the infrastructure act — and they feel as if the bonds of trust between Democrats and Republicans have been so broken because of the ways in which Republicans in the Senate have kowtowed to the president, not only allowing him to undo our budget bills, but on the ways that they have confirmed — against their better judgment, I would argue — some of these really terrible nominees like R.F.K. Jr. and the secretary of defense. Part of the problem, and I believe this is where I differ from both of my colleagues here, is that the Senate rules have so completely stymied the ability of the Senate to do anything.

You’d like to get rid of the filibuster?

Smith: I would at least like to reform it so that if you’re going to filibuster a bill you ought to at least have to stand on the damn floor and talk, instead of just saying, “Oh, I don’t like this, so I’m going to object and then go out for dinner.”

Manchin: We’re exactly alike on that.

Flake: Every president who has a majority is going to want to get rid of the filibuster. And every Senate ought to resist that, Republican or Democrat, because it is one of the few mechanisms left that forces people to work together.

Smith: I’ve watched the Senate for the last eight years, and I have not seen that the filibuster is the pill to cure partisanship. Sometimes it creates the very systems that make it very difficult for the things that Americans want to get done to actually get done.

Smith: In a functioning legislative body, you would think that the Democratic leader and the Republican leader would talk to each other all the time, to try to figure things out, to try to get things going. It just doesn’t happen anymore. But this informal group that I am a part of is a group of senators who have been complaining and unhappy primarily with the ways in which the leader has been identifying what candidates he wants to run in what states.

Which is interesting, because when I spoke to Senator Schumer, he touted that as his greatest strength, that he really can choose candidates that win. And so you get a Gov. Janet Mills running for Senate in Maine at 77 years old against Graham Platner, who’s 41 and more progressive, and that sets up an intraparty fight.

Smith: Yes, it does. To be clear, I haven’t endorsed anybody in Maine —

Manchin: I’m endorsing Susan Collins in Maine. They get rid of a Susan Collins, then you’re really losing the Senate. People that have that mind-set, we can’t even get them to run anymore.

Flake: You mentioned Chuck Schumer. I was part of a gang of eight with Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin on immigration. We passed a bill, 68 to 32. That was one of the last examples we’ve seen of the Senate working how it used to work. My point is that some of the same characters that we now look at and say, “They could never do this” — they can. And they have in the past.

I’m wondering what you think of the Republican leader, John Thune, who people broadly view as being less obsequious to Trump than the House speaker, Mike Johnson, who, according to critics, really takes everything that he’s doing from the White House. That said, Thune has been accused of chipping away at the filibuster by allowing a number of simple-majority votes, ushering in what The New Yorker called the Senate’s “Age of Irrelevance.” Senator Flake, why do you think he’s so weak? Is he so weak?

Flake: When I mentioned before that there are Republican senators who want the Senate to be like it used to be, he’s one of them. He’s an institutionalist. But when the other day the president said, “Get rid of the filibuster,” John Thune’s response was, “We don’t have the votes,” which is true. But I would have liked him to say: “That’s a terrible idea, Mr. President. We’re not going to do it.” Or on tariffs, actually pull your power back. Get ahead of the Supreme Court. You don’t want to have them fight your battles for you. So yeah, I am frustrated sometimes. But I do think that he’s often doing the best he can given the political situation.

Why isn’t he pulling his power back, though? He is the Senate majority leader.

Manchin: His caucus.

Flake: Yeah, and you get angry tweets every day if you do.

From the president, you mean?

Flake: Yes, definitely. The president has been able to say, in any Republican seat in the country, “I can get a primary opponent for you if you don’t do what I say.” That’s a powerful political incentive. We may like it to be different, but that’s the incentive structure that most of my former colleagues are working under. They don’t like it, but they’re in it.

Manchin: I’ve come to the conclusion there’s two things that would change politics in America: [congressional] term limits and open primaries. Our friend Lisa Murkowski would not get elected through the primary process in Alaska if it wasn’t for the open primary. When you can control the primary, that’s what gives President Trump, or gives a Democrat president, the power in a real blue state or a red state, knowing that they have that power to name who they want or primary you. An open primary — boom. The best will succeed, and he can’t target you.

Flake: If you had five or six states with open-primary laws like Alaska has, that would create a whole different power structure in the Senate.

Let me give you the counterpoint to this dream of bipartisanship, which is: Did we get here because the Senate has been ineffective at responding to the real problems that voters have because, essentially, it has been incremental? There are just not any big swings anymore. People at the moment seem to be clamoring for ideas that can solve their very real problems. Does incrementalism, which can be read as bipartisanship, actually get the job done?

Smith: This is exactly the issue. Significant majorities of Americans have said that they think things are terribly on the wrong track, that they’re working as hard as they possibly can and nothing is really changing. And so if you have a governing body that hasn’t been capable of making the big changes that need to be made, of course people are going to be frustrated. We often get sucked into this [question]: Are you moderate or are you progressive? I don’t think that’s the right continuum at all. I think it’s a question of whether you actually think that the status quo is working, or do you think that it needs to be fundamentally changed? And Americans are telling us that the status quo is not working for them. And they’re telling us that things that maybe would be seen as progressive — paid family and medical leave, child care that people can afford, raise the minimum wage, even Medicare for All, which was seen as being incredibly radical, a majority of Americans want to a see a complete revamping of our health care system. So all of that argues to me that we need a Senate and a Congress that’s capable of making those big changes.

Flake: I’ll make the case for incrementalism. Being a conservative means preserving institutions that work, and the Senate has worked over time, so incrementalism is what you want. That’s why I like the filibuster, for example, because it helps from having wide swings of popular opinion back and forth like you have in the House. The Senate is all about incrementalism, and that has served the country well. So I don’t think that’s the problem. Look at Joe Manchin. He was always in the middle of every bipartisan fight, every bill that looked for bipartisan support, saying, “Hey, compromise is the coin of the realm here,” because you don’t want to have these wide swings.

Manchin: There used to be an old saying, “Guilt by association.” If someone was a bad actor and you were working with them, [people thought] you must support that. Now it’s guilt by conversation. You can’t even be seen having a conversation with someone who might not be on the same side. That is so ridiculous to me. The Democrats chastised me for working across the aisle.

There’s this perception that people who are fortunate enough in a closely divided Senate to wield a lot of power —

Manchin: I don’t recommend that to anybody. But if it happens, be ready.

Fair. But I’m giving you the counterargument that they are obstructing actual progress. James Carville, the longtime Democratic strategist who is a self-described centrist, recently argued that Democrats need to run on, and presumably eventually legislate on, “a sweeping, aggressive, unvarnished, unapologetic and altogether unmistakable platform of pure economic rage.”

Smith: When I read what James Carville said, I was thinking about how, for the last 10 years, the national Democratic Party has been stuck in a bad relationship. We’ve so defined ourselves by being opposed to Trump that it’s like we’ve forgotten how to do the other part of our job, which is to put forward an aggressive, strong, positive vision of where the country ought to go.

Flake: When I hear “economic rage,” that suggests a very leftist platform, a Mamdani kind of thing, and I hope the Democrats don’t do that. They would be responding to that subset of a subset of a subset of voters in Democratic primaries, just like too many Republicans respond to that subset on the right. But it doesn’t do much for the country, and it allows the Republicans to be more extreme than they could otherwise be. I think if the Democrats would be more centrist, it would force the Republicans back into that more centrist mode as well.

That’s the other side of this coin. You certainly can’t accuse the Trump administration of moving incrementally. Should the Democrats be emulating what the Trump administration’s doing? Because Republicans are really taking the ball and running with it.

Smith: Super interesting question. What Trump is doing is seizing massive amounts of power. Let’s just take for example his policy around what to do about people who are inside the country without documents, maybe illegally, maybe they are here legally. He is doing something very radical when it comes to his immigration policy. It’s dramatically unpopular. People do not like it. So the thing that’s missing in your question that I’m responding to is that we ought to be able to meet the needs of Americans and what they want. And that’s not been happening.

Flake: I don’t disagree with you about immigration overreach. Talk about going after criminals — everybody wants that. But he has gone far beyond that. Every president coming in exaggerates the mandate that they were given. And they’re usually given a whooping in the midterm elections. This time it’ll be significant, I think. And so you’ll now have a period of divided government, which, as a fiscal conservative concerned about debt, I am looking forward to. The pendulum swings, and we’re seeing that swing in a big way on a few things. I wrote a piece the other day called “The Great G.O.P. Migration Has Begun.” Marjorie Taylor Greene —

Smith: There’s cracks in the facade.

Flake: There are. When people realize that it’s popular now to be against the president on a couple of issues and in order to survive some of these general [elections] coming up, you’ll see a different attitude.

But coming back to this idea of when things have really moved in the Senate, it’s because a party has said, “We’re going to put all of our power behind this issue, whether it be Obamacare or something else, and we’re going to make this a priority.”

I want to end with this question of how much power the Senate has right now. It has ceded control over tariffs, as we’ve discussed, but also over foreign affairs. There’s an uproar over the double-tap strike on a Venezuelan boat allegedly carrying drugs. There are Navy ships in the Caribbean now. Do you feel like the Senate’s response to the questions about what we’re doing in and around Venezuela is sufficient? Why isn’t there more questioning over something that, again, was a core purview of the Senate?

Flake: That has been the frustrating thing. I do think that this double-tap strike, particularly if that video is released — there will be revulsion on most Americans’ part. Sure, they want a strong response on drugs, but you can have that with some humanity as well. It has been frustrating because in all areas of foreign policy, whether it’s tariffs, whether it’s war powers, whether it’s support for Ukraine — there’s a bill in the Senate now with 85 co-sponsors that the Senate could, if it wanted to assert itself, pass that veto-proof bill. And there are sufficient votes in the House too. But they just haven’t, because they’re afraid of what the president can do to them.

Manchin: Someone needs to ask Pete Hegseth: “Your commander in chief, the president, said he’d like people to see the video. How do you not take that seriously?” [Trump has since changed his position on this.]

Would you like to see the senators do more, from both parties?

Manchin: They have to do more. The senators have to do their job. There’s not another body that can fix this. The House is not going to fix it. The Senate can right the ship. Are they waiting for another election to see what’s going to happen in the midterms, or is it so serious right now that [they think], We just need to do something? I’m praying to God that we can put the politics aside and reach across for the sake of the country and do the right thing. We’ll see if that happens.

Do you miss it?

Manchin: Not at all. And the reason I don’t miss it is I could tell that I could get more done on the outside than I can on the inside. I’d been in the Senate for almost 15 years. Tried everything humanly possible to make those changes.

So what’s an unvarnished truth that you weren’t able to say then that you could say now?

Flake: Well, I can say that most of my former colleagues don’t agree with the policies they’re pursuing on tariffs and foreign policy and this Venezuela stuff. The political incentives are not aligned for them to speak truth to power here. That’s the bottom line. Like I said, I think that’s shifting, but as of now, re-election is a strong pull.

Julianne Murray, the former chair of Delaware’s Republican Party, resigned as U.S. attorney on Dec. 12, a position she had tenuously held without required congressional approval since her temporary appointment by the Trump administration earlier this summer.

She cited a recent court ruling by a federal appeals court that disqualified a similar Trump appointee as U.S. attorney in New Jersey. She also took a parting shot at Delaware’s Senate delegation that did not support her permanent appointment for what she described as “highly politicized” and “flawed” reasoning.

“The people that think they have chased me away will soon find out they are mistaken,” she said in a resignation statement that indicated she will continue to work within Delaware’s federal prosecutor’s office.

Upon Murray’s resignation, Delaware’s District Court judges appointed Ben Wallace, her top deputy, as Delaware’s U.S. attorney, a powerful position that instigates and oversees prosecutions of federal crimes and acts as the federal government’s representative in other legal matters in their state.

While the president has appointment power and their candidate of choice often reflects their political party, these positions have historically been viewed as apolitical enforcers of federal law that come from prosecutorial backgrounds − not politics − and are moored to the law, not the president’s social media postings.

Trump’s second term has seen a shift in that with his administration pushing to install loyalists without prosecutorial legal backgrounds and in some cases, have been blatantly devoted to the president’s encroachment of power upon the legal checks of Congress and the judiciary.

But the requirement that U.S. attorneys be approved by the U.S. Senate is becoming one the administration’s highest hurdles in its expansion of executive power. It ultimately caused what became a standoff between Trump's administration and Delaware's congressional delegation that led to Murray never being put to Congress for approval and her eventual resignation.

""I did not have complete confidence that Julianne Murray had the experience in criminal prosecution, in managing and supervising a complex office and demonstrating political independence that met the moment we are currently in,"" said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons in an interview after her resignation.

Julianne Murray's lack of local support

Murray, whom Trump once described as ""MAGA all the way,"" was appointed interim U.S. attorney for Delaware in ther summer.

Under the law, an interim appointment lasts 120 days. When that 120-day period expired, the Trump administration evolved Murray’s title from interim to acting, a move that has parallels to appointments in other states, which federal judges have invalidated as an illegal bypass on Congress’s appointment of power for the role.

In an interview, Coons said the Trump administration approached him about nominating Murray and he, along with Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, talked to Murray earlier this year.

While nominees for U.S. attorney must be approved by the full Senate, the senators from the state they will work in have informal veto power over a president’s nominee for the role under what is known as the “blue slip” tradition. That tradition has been under attack by Trump but has been continued by Republicans in charge of Congress.

Coons said he wasn’t convinced Murray had the prosecutorial or management experience necessary and had larger questions about her “political independence.” He said her “previous statements” and “political activity” raised concerns about her “ability to be an independent federal prosecutor.”

In her resignation post, Murray said the blue-slip tradition is “highly flawed” and added that Coons’ and Blunt Rochester’s refusal to support her appointment was “highly politicized.”

“I naively believed that I would be judged on my performance and not politics,” Murray wrote. “Unfortunately, that was not the case.”

Murray has presided over the conclusion of some high-profile criminal cases during her six months in office. Her tenure also saw the initiation of a fight in which her office is trying to get the court to compel the state’s Department of Labor to hand over data to immigration authorities in Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

Coons said his lack of support for her isn’t naked politics but “part of the checks and balances in our constitution.”

He added that in another time, those concerns would not be as grave as they are in the context of the Trump administration's “broadly illegal conduct that has challenged the very guardrails of our democracy.""

A national fight

This conflict is a microcosm of the larger issue in other states with the Trump administration seeking to install loyalists. These fights have had implications over political prosecutions and whether the judiciary can still serve as a check on the Trump administration’s power.

In New Jersey, the Trump administration appointed his former personal attorney, Alina Habba, as U.S. attorney first as interim. When that role expired, the federal court in New Jersey appointed her deputy as U.S. attorney, but that deputy was immediately fired by the Trump administration, who argued that move returned Habba to the position.

However, earlier this month, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling that Habba was unlawfully filling that position and she resigned. That ruling was cited in Murray’s resignation notice, as well. The Trump administration has said it would appeal the ruling.

The implication of these fights over the rule of law is most clear in Trump’s efforts to employ the federal government to seek retribution against his political foes in Virginia. Recently, a federal judge ruled that Lindsay Halligan, Trump’s former personal lawyer and insurance law specialist with no experience as a prosecutor, was illegally installed as U.S. attorney there by the Trump administration.

That had the effect of dismissing two-high profile criminal cases that bear hallmarks of political retribution campaigns sought by the Trump administration: the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letita James. Trump's vendetta against both goes back years.

In 2017, he fired Comey as head of the FBI, which was investigating possible contacts between the 2016 Trump campaign and the Russian government. Afterward, Comey became an outspoken critic of Trump.

James brought a civil fraud lawsuit against Trump in 2022, claiming he engaged in years of fraud as a real estate mogul.

On social media and in public statements, Trump has openly clamored for his government to seek prosecutions of those individuals.

In September, Halligan’s predecessor, Erik Siebert, was working in an interim status when he expressed concerns to top Department of Justice officials about the validity of pursuing charges against Comey and James, according to court filings. Trump told reporters he wanted Siebert out and he resigned.

Two days later, Halligan was appointed as U.S. attorney there without congressional approval and quickly delivered grand jury indictments against Trump’s political foes.

Last month, a federal judge ruled that Halligan was illegally installed and dismissed the indictments. Federal prosecutors have sought to reindict the cases, but have failed to convince a grand jury to do so multiple times, according to reporting by the Associated Press this week.

Meanwhile, CNBC has reported that the Trump administration will now seek congressional approval to appoint Halligan.

Julianne Murray's resignation prompts new appointment

While uncertainty over Murray's non-permanent appointment bubbled over the past six months, the chief judge of Delaware's federal court began a legal process by which judges on that court can appoint a U.S. attorney when the position remains vacant.

In September, Chief Judge Colm Connolly, a former U.S. attorney himself, posted notice that the court was accepting applicants for the position. In November, when Murray's interim status expired and the Trump administration changed it to ""acting,"" the court posted notice it was declining to appoint anyone at that time.

Then, on the morning of Dec. 12, the court posted notice of Wallace's appointment. Connolly declined to comment for this story.

In an interview, Wallace said the appeals court ruling upholding the disqualification of Habba earlier this month raised concerns that Murray's position exposed legal cases brought by her office to ""significant litigation risk.""

He said they felt the federal government had strong legal arguments to justify her ongoing tenure, but the risk to the office's ongoing work made Murray uncomfortable and so she decided to step aside.

He said conversations between the White House and Department of Justice administrators in Washington, D.C., eventually centered on him, as her deputy, as a replacement. And, with the blessing of Delaware's federal judiciary, the court exercised its authority to appoint him to the job in a permanent role when Murray resigned.

Wallace is a registered Republican, but in an interview with Delaware Online/The News Journal, he described his politics as ""apolitical"" and said would run the office ""by the book.""

Coons said he looks forward to working with Wallace, whom he described as ""skilled"" and ""capable.""

“I don’t know what comes next,” Coons said. “But I hope it is stability and professionalism and political independence for the Delaware U.S. Attorney’s Office.”

The seizure of the sanctioned ship, called Skipper, is the most recent swipe by the Trump administration against Maduro, whom U.S. officials have called an “illegitimate leader” and accused of heading a drug-trafficking cartel.

The president has ordered lethal strikes against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean, in the vicinity of Venezuela, indicated that Maduro’s days are “numbered” and established a massive military presence in the U.S. Southern Command (Southcom) region.

When asked on Thursday whether the campaign against Venezuela is about acquiring oil or thwarting the trafficking of illegal drugs in the region, Trump pointed to various reasons, including barring Venezuelan migrants from illegally entering the U.S.

“Well, it’s about a lot of things,” the president told reporters at the White House. “But one of the things it’s about is the fact that they’ve allowed millions of people to come into our country from their prisons, from gangs, from drug dealers and from mental institutions, probably proportionately more than anybody else.”

Here are the main factors that seem to be driving Trump’s multi-front campaign against Maduro:

Migration

Trump often pins the blame on Maduro for two things when asked about his pressure on Venezuela: migrants and drugs.

“We just have to take care of Venezuela. They dumped hundreds of thousands of people into our country from prisons,” the president said last month.

Venezuela is still one of the biggest sources of migrants in the world. The majority of Venezuelan migrants, over 80 percent, live in Latin America and the Caribbean. In the U.S., there were about 770,000 Venezuelan immigrants as of 2023, according to the Migration Policy Institute, making up below 2 percent of the entire U.S. immigration population.

The number of Venezuelan migrants in the U.S has gone up from about 33,000 in 1980 to 770,000 in 2023, according to the Migration Policy Institute’s report in February.

After an early October ruling by the Supreme Court, more than a quarter million Venezuelans lost Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Before it later expired in November, the Biden-era program shielded Venezuelan nationals from deportation until October next year.

Drugs

The president has accused the Maduro regime of pouring illegal narcotics into the U.S., which it says justifies the ongoing lethal strikes against alleged drug-trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Since early September, when the lethal military campaign began, the U.S. military has conducted at least 22 strikes against purported drug-smuggling vessels in both the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing at least 87 suspected “narco-terrorists.”

The boat strikes have become a political lightning rod for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, after survivors of a strike in September were killed in what many Democrats have called a war crime. Hegseth authorized the strikes but has denied specifically ordering the killing of survivors.

The administration has linked some of the individuals on the boat to the drug cartels and argued that every blown-up vessel saves 25,000 American lives. However, the target vessels in the Caribbean are believed to be carrying cocaine, not the far more deadly fentanyl, according to lawmakers who were briefed on the strikes.

In Latin America, the top producer and exporter of cocaine is Colombia.

Trump has touted that maritime illegal drug trafficking in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific has drastically plunged since his administration’s boat strikes began.

“If you look at drug traffic, drug traffic by sea is down 92 percent. And nobody can figure out who the eight is, because I have no idea,” the president said on Thursday. “Anybody getting involved in that right now is not doing well. And we’ll start that on land too. It’s gonna be starting on land pretty soon.”

As part of the pressure campaign, the U.S. government has designated the so-called “Cartel de los Soles” as a foreign terrorist organization and accused Maduro of being its leader.

Oil and Minerals

Venezuela has lucrative oil and gas reserves. Oil makes up close to 90 percent of the country’s export revenues, part of the reason Maduro’s regime has argued that U.S. moves in recent months are meant to secure access to the nation’s energy reserves.

The vessel the U.S. seized on Wednesday, which was previously sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2022 and was sailing under a different name, was believed to be carrying more than 1 million barrels and was falsely flying Guyana’s flag.

If the U.S. were to continue to seize more of Venezuela’s oil tankers, it could thwart the nation’s ability to purchase weapons, buy food and keep the government’s lights on, experts told The Hill on Thursday.

Although the analysts said a full oil blockade would likely be improbable due to Washington’s reliance on Caracas’s oil imports and international pushback, they stated that the president could get to a similar outcome by seizing more tankers.

“So you could get a complete collapse in Venezuelan oil exports if the US does this, because it would be equivalent to imposing a de facto naval blockade of Venezuela,” said Francisco R. Rodríguez, a senior research fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research.

Ousting Maduro

Trump and other top administration officials have said that Maduro’s days are “numbered” and the president has not ruled out the option of putting boots on the ground in Venezuela.

In recent weeks, the U.S. has established a gigantic military presence in the Southcom area, dispatching F-35 fighter jets, warships, Marines, spy planes, at least one submarine and USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier.

Trump has also repeatedly warned that strikes inside Venezuela could come “soon,” but the president has not closed the door on negotiating with Maduro, who he spoke with recently.

Some experts say Trump’s actions are aimed at regime change, a charge that Secretary of State Rubio denied.

Rubio, a Cuba hawk and son of Cuban immigrants who are vehemently anti-socialist, views Maduro’s potential ouster as a heavy blow to Cuba’s leadership, with whom the Venezuelan president has close ties.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the Skipper was part of Venezuela’s efforts to support Cuba financially.

The secretary, who also serves as Trump’s national security adviser, has said that the U.S.’s goal in the region is not to enact regime change in Venezuela, although he recently cast doubt that Washington can strike a deal that Maduro would honor.

“At the end of the day with Maduro — and his problem basically is that this is a guy, if you wanted to make a deal with him, I don’t know how you’d do,” Rubio said during his recent appearance on Fox News’s “Hannity.” “He’s broken every deal he’s ever made.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/WhyVenezuela_Timotija_AP_CristianHernandez.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-13 19:56:58.339588

The group held its protest on a pathway in front of the El Paso Field Office for ICE here in El Paso and within view of the Fort Bliss migrant camp and its white tents.

“The purpose of this vigil is to protest the horrific and inhumane conditions in the Camp and to bring attention to the unlawful, abusive, and unconstitutional conduct of government officers towards the detainees, that now number approximately 2,700, both men and women,” the group said in its news release.

This week, a coalition of human rights organizations, including the ACLU, sent a letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to quit detaining migrants at the facility on Fort Bliss property.

The groups summarized in the letter accounts of horrific conditions, including beatings and sexual abuse by officers against detained immigrants, the groups said in a news release.

The letter follows months of interviews with more than 45 detained people at Fort Bliss and is accompanied by 16 sworn declarations by immigrants detained at the facility, the human rights groups said.

Saturday’s protest was held in what they called a “theater” format. Many participants were dressed in black and held signs that describe alleged conditions within the facility.

“This is not a left or right issue. This is a humanitarian issue. Human rights are being violated every day in this facility,” said Erika Hisey, one of the organizers. “We stand with the ACLU. We stand with local organizations (like Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center) to say shut it down — now, today, right now.”

U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-El Paso, has been critical of the migrant facility numerous times after talking to detainees there after it opened last summer.

In September, a Washington Post report noted that a leaked internal ICE inspection found the Fort Bliss facility violated over 60 federal detention standards in the first 50 days of its opening.

But this week it came to a head in a flurry of meetings, calls and one heady statement. Twenty-seven European countries urged a rethink of the human rights laws forged after the second world war, describing them as an impediment when it came to addressing migration.

Amnesty International has called it “a moral retreat”. Europe’s most senior human rights official said the approach risked creating a “hierarchy of people” where some are seen as more deserving of protection than others.

The roots of the clash can be traced back to May, when nine EU states, including Denmark, Italy and Poland, published a letter arguing that the European convention on human rights was hindering their ability to exert sovereignty over their states and deport people who committed crimes. “We have to restore the right balance,” the letter noted. “What was once right might not be the answer of tomorrow.”

This week 27 countries shared these grievances, though several, including France, Spain and Germany, declined to sign the letter, hinting at a divide in how states view the convention.

Speaking to the Guardian this week, Europe’s top human rights official hit out at politicians’ “lazy language”, laced with assumptions and inaccuracies, which led countries to erroneously target human rights legislation.

One example was the “lazy correlation” of migration and crime, said Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights. “This doesn’t correspond with reality,” he said.

Even so, this distorted perception had been widely peddled. “What’s at issue is this feeding into the misunderstanding in society that we’re opening the door to criminals to run amok in our societies doing untold damage,” he said. “No wonder people get frightened, no wonder people are demanding limits on migration.”

Politicians from across the spectrum were to blame, he said. “What happens is middle-of-the-road politicians use this lazy language, but then it’s instrumentalised by those who would actively promote disinformation.”

He pointed to the UK, where tremendous attention had been given to court cases where the convention on human rights had stymied the expulsion of criminals. “And again here, the figures simply don’t correspond with that,” said O’Flaherty. “The figure is tiny, and it’s completely manageable in any modern rule of law state. And very few of these cases ever reach the European court of human rights because there are all those checks and balances at the national level that kick in first.”

His view was backed by a report, published this week by the University of Oxford, which found that media reporting in the UK was “dominated by often inaccurate or misleading reports” when it came to the impact of the convention on immigration control.

The report also highlighted the many ways in which the convention, whose first signatory was the UK when it launched 75 years ago, safeguards people in workplaces, hospitals and care homes and protects victims of domestic violence and modern slavery.

The history of the convention traces back to the aftermath of the second world war when countries came together to launch the Council of Europe, envisioning it as a guardian of fundamental rights across the continent. These rights were enshrined in the European convention on human rights, a document that has since been signed by 46 countries.

O’Flaherty said he saw no need for the convention to now be modernised, warning that the call by politicians risked creating a “false expectation” among voters. “Is that really going to change migratory flows?” he asked. “Is that going to stop people from crossing the Channel? Is that going to ruin the business model of the migrant smugglers? I don’t think so.”

He also pushed back against the assertion that the convention impeded on states’ sovereignty. Individuals and countries could only make an application to the European court after they had exhausted domestic options, he noted, while the European court of human rights is made up of judges representing every member state. “This is not a bunch of foreign judges imposing something on us,” he said.

Writing in the Guardian this week, the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, argued that an update of the convention on human rights was needed to help see off the rise of the populist right.

O’Flaherty rejected the link. “For every inch yielded, there’s going to be another inch demanded,” he said. “Where does it stop? For example, the focus right now is on migrants, in large part. But who is it going to be about next time around? What happens when another small vulnerable, weak, marginalised group catches the eye of some populist schemers?”

Yielding ground on human rights would ultimately serve the interest of these populists by weakening the rule of law, he said, and risk creating a “hierarchy of people”, a notion he described as “very, very worrying” given the convention’s roots in the horrors of the second world war.

He said: “The convention and the whole human rights system emerged out of the most barbarous hierarchisation of rights holders that you could imagine, where you had not only some humans more worthy than others, but certain humans, because of their origin, as having no value whatsoever.

“A universal system of human rights was built, strategically built, to make sure that we could never end up in that nightmare scenario again,” O’Flaherty added. “We’re not there now, of course we’re not. But we have to be very cautious and careful about the ultimate consequences, albeit unintended, of the paths we might embark on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71177f45052606d51e8af071642f11a6a424b5d3/401_0_3496_2797/master/3496.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1a05e4b65bd4fc8e37dbffafa40b80bd",N,,2025-12-13 16:57:34.791487

As the Buzz forecast last week, on December 11, 2025, the U.S. Senate approved a package of ninety-seven executive branch nominees. Included in the package were Scott Mayer and James Murphy—both nominated to fill empty seats on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)—as well as Crystal Carey, who will now be the Board’s general counsel.

With Mayer and Murphy joining current Democratic member David Prouty, the Board has a functional quorum for the first time since January of this year. But even though Republicans will have a majority, reversing Biden-era Board decisions may not be so easy. While not required by law, traditionally, the Board does not overturn case precedent without at least three affirmative votes. If Mayer and Murphy adhere to this tradition, it means they will need one additional vote—likely from a future Republican nominee—to reverse Board cases issued between 2021 and 2024.

Court of Appeals Upholds Removal of NLRB, MSPB Members. On December 5, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed district court rulings that found President Donald Trump’s removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the NLRB and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protections Board (MSPB) were unlawful. In reversing the lower courts’ decisions, the court of appeals ruled that these terminations were lawful because the statutory language prescribing fixed terms for members of the NLRB and MSPB, while allowing for removal for neglect of duty or malfeasance, unconstitutionally limits the president’s ability to remove agency officials who wield executive power on his or her behalf. With specific regard to the Board, the court of appeals determined that the agency wields significant executive authority, including the power to promulgate regulations, craft national labor policy through adjudication, order remedies through enforcement authority, conduct litigation, and oversee union elections.

CBP Proposes Social Media Vetting for Tourists, Short-Term Business Travelers. In a notice published in the Federal Register on December 10, 2025, and pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is soliciting public comment on proposed changes to the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). With an ESTA approval, most nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries are permitted to travel to the United States for business or tourism for ninety days or less without obtaining a visa. Specifically, CBP proposes to “require ESTA applicants to provide their social media from the last 5 years.” Comments must be submitted by February 9, 2026.

The administration has already initiated similar social media vetting protocols as applied to F, J, and M visa holders and, most recently, to H-1B visa holders.

DOL Seeks to Help Faith-Based Organizations. On December 10, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) published a Federal Register notice titled, “Addressing Barriers to Participation of Faith Organizations in DOL Programs and Funding.” The notice seeks input from responders on “specific DOL regulations, guidance, or policies, explicitly or implicitly restrict or discourage faith-based organizations from participating in DOL-funded programs (e.g., job training, workforce development, or employment services).” Specifically, DOL seeks information regarding potential “accommodations, policies, or tools could DOL develop to ensure faith organizations receive reasonable accommodations for their religious beliefs and practices” to participate in DOL programs. Comments must be submitted by February 9, 2026.

The solicitation of information is consistent with the current administration’s efforts to support faith-based groups and target religious-based discrimination.

USCIS Cuts Work Authorization Times. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has updated its policy manual to amend the maximum validity period for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) for certain foreign nationals. Effective December 5, 2025, the maximum EAD validity period for the following foreign nationals will be reduced from five years to eighteen months:

Those admitted as a refugee

Those granted asylum

Those granted withholding of deportation or removal

Those with a pending application for asylum or withholding of deportation or removal

Those with a pending application for adjustment of status under Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) 245

Those with a pending application for suspension of deportation, cancellation of removal, or relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA)

The line of people outside the office for Mexico’s refugee agency formed before 7 a.m., stretching down the sidewalk on a September morning in Tapachula, a small city near the border with Guatemala.

“Strong Cuban coffee!” a woman advertised in Spanish, walking up and down the line.

Haitian women sat across the street selling pastries from large, plastic tubs.

As 9 a.m. approached, the line continued to grow, each new arrival verifying they had found the end of the queue.

Mostly a mix of Haitians, Cubans and Venezuelans, those standing in line were all there to sign in — to prove to the Mexican government that they hadn’t left Tapachula, that they were waiting as instructed for the government to process their asylum applications. They said they had to return and sign in again roughly every two weeks.

When asked how long they’d been waiting in Tapachula, they answered with the number of times they’d come to sign in. A Cuban man who had arrived about three months ago was on his second signature. A Venezuelan woman had signed in 11 times, and two Cuban men said they’d come to sign in nearly 20 times.

None of the asylum-seekers interviewed by Capital & Main were willing to be identified because of their uncertain, vulnerable situations.

The two Cuban men who’d been in Tapachula roughly a year seemed resigned to their indefinite waits.

“When God says,” one of the men responded when asked when his final appointment would happen.

Since President Donald Trump came back into office and shut down a phone application called CBP One that under the Biden administration was the only way to request protection in the U.S., migrants in Mexico have had to recalculate their plans.

Some have continued on to the U.S. anyway, crossing the border without permission — the only way left to gain access to U.S. soil and possibly request protection — and risking deportation without any review of their cases. Others have opted to go back to their home countries or to pursue asylum claims in Canada or Europe.

The people waiting outside the refugee agency in Tapachula were among those who chose a third option, to try to start their lives over in Mexico. COMAR, as the refugee agency is known, has not yet released data about asylum applications in 2025, but organizations including Asylum Access Mexico, Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights and Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración have reported long wait times for processing.

The Trump administration’s cuts to foreign aid slashed COMAR’s budget, one of the reasons for the increased waits, according to the human rights organizations.

The U.S. State Department would not comment on the record, but responded with a statement from an unnamed spokesperson:

“In managing U.S. foreign assistance funding, the State Department puts the American people first and ensures every hard-earned taxpayer dollar spent is justified by a concrete benefit to U.S. national interests,” the statement said.

Because of the administration’s cuts, many of the organizations that helped migrants in Mexico have also lost funding and either closed or cut staff, according to Miguel Hernández, head of the Tapachula office for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, or CHIRLA.

“Those who stayed trapped in Mexico face a rather broken refugee system,” Hernández said.

Migrants are also still arriving in Tapachula, said Joselin Zamora of Centro de Derechos Humanos Fray Matías de Córdova, a human rights nonprofit that helps migrants in Tapachula.

“They haven’t stopped arriving because the reasons they left their countries haven’t disappeared,” she said.

Requesting protection in Mexico

To apply for asylum in Mexico, migrants first go to the COMAR office and give their information. Workers tell them to wait for an email with appointment details. The entire process is supposed to take about a month and a half, Zamora said, but in reality, it’s much longer.

The wait for just the initial email can take one to four months, Zamora said. From there, asylum-seekers often wait about a year for an interview to determine their eligibility. In the meantime, COMAR requires them to check in periodically and sign in to prove they’re still waiting.

Those needing interviews in languages other than Spanish take the longest, Zamora said, because of limited interpretation resources for the interviews.

For several years, the office has received more applications than it has the resources to complete. More people turned to the Mexican asylum process during the Biden administration because the U.S. government pressured Mexico to stop migrants from heading north, and completing at least part of the process at the time allowed for safer passage through the country.

Now, for many, it’s the only way to avoid deportation to places where they fear for their lives.

The two Cuban women selling coffee that September morning said they’d been in Tapachula since January, and that after Trump came into office, they decided to apply for asylum in Mexico.

From February through September, they signed in at the COMAR office 17 times, they said.

They said they weren’t allowed to leave the state of Chiapas, where Tapachula is located, until they finished the process and had received refugee status. They said they struggled to find work to make ends meet in Chiapas, one of the poorest states in the country.

Every morning, they arrived outside the COMAR office before 7 a.m. to sell coffee and fried food — chicken croquetas, churros and Cuban tamales — to those waiting in line. They said they stayed until either they sold out or there were no more people in line.

What they made from the breakfast sales wasn’t enough to pay rent, they said, so they were constantly looking for other ways to make money.

Hernández said that the cost of living in Tapachula has increased significantly in the past couple of years.

“They can’t get dignified work,” he said of the asylum-seekers still stuck there.

A Haitian woman who had lived in Chile before coming north to Mexico sold drinks next to the Cuban women. She hadn’t been able to sell much, she said.

“Life is really difficult,” the woman said in Spanish.

She worried about being able to take care of her daughter. They had been waiting nine months — or 15 signatures — she said.

A Haitian man named Job stood talking with her. He said that Haitians, in particular, struggle in Tapachula. Over time, as the town became a migrant hub — a place some called a prison city for migrants — many locals discriminated against arriving Haitians.

“We’re looking for life, and there isn’t life really,” Job said in Spanish.

He said he’d been an English and Spanish teacher in Haiti before bandits took control and he had to leave.

‘Starting over from zero’

A little after 9 a.m., the COMAR line started to move, guided by federal police who instructed people to put their phones away and take off hats, glasses and headphones as they entered. Many carried stacks of documents in colorful, plastic folders.

The line wound through crowd-control fencing to the back of a long room.

A man on a megaphone inside the office informed those in line that their next appointment to sign in would be in two weeks at a new location. Workers at two desks called people up one by one from the line to check in.

As the morning wore on, the people still in line outside the building shifted to the shade to avoid the heat of the sun.

The Venezuelan woman who had already signed in 11 times stood toward the back of the line. She said she still hoped to go to the U.S. one day.

“I think that’s the dream of everyone that’s here,” she said in Spanish.

She had crossed through the Darién Gap, a notorious jungle that separates Colombia and Panama that in recent years became a common migrant path north.

She said she had been willing to risk her life taking that route toward the hope of a better future, but she did not want to risk her family. She hoped to be able to bring her adult children, ages 27, 20 and 19, to Mexico once she finished the asylum process.

A Cuban man who stood behind her in line had left his 5-year-old son and wife back home. He traveled from Cuba to Nicaragua and then north through Central America. He, too, hoped to obtain Mexican residency and bring his family to join him.

Both the Venezuelan woman and Cuban man said they had worked in the medical field before deciding they needed to flee their countries because of the political situations there.

They weren’t sure whether they would be able to get relicensed in Mexico.

“It’s starting over from zero,” the Venezuelan woman said, “but nothing is impossible.”

Going home

That same week, in an upscale neighborhood in Mexico City, a group of Venezuelans stood in line outside a building with a different purpose: They were trying to go back to their home country.

They were waiting at the Venezuelan embassy to get help to go home. Those with passports could buy plane tickets home, but otherwise, they had to request safe passage, the only alternative without taking the risky journey through the Darién Gap a second time.

After seeing that path for themselves as they traveled north, those waiting outside the embassy said they didn’t want to repeat their experiences. They were also afraid of staying longer in Mexico. Several said they had been victims of kidnapping or other violence against migrants.

“Here, everything is a fight,” one Venezuelan woman said in Spanish.

Another woman said she’d come north looking for freedom, education for her children, access to health care and work to be able to support family members still in Venezuela. She was worried about starting over back home.

“But we’ll be in known territory,” she said in Spanish.

They were staying in a shelter in Mexico City while they waited for approval of their safe passage requests, she said.

This process, too, was backlogged, according to Gretchen Kuhner, co-founder and director of Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, or IMUMI. Several faded pieces of paper with QR codes offering information about lists for passports or safe passage requests, relics of that backlog, were still taped to the wall outside the embassy in late September.

But the people waiting that afternoon said they expected to finish the process in a matter of weeks now that fewer people were applying.

A couple waiting for their safe passage documents said they had CBP One appointments to request asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border for Jan. 26, but the Trump administration cancelled the program days before their scheduled date. They said traveling through Mexico was even worse than the Darién Gap, and because of that, they wanted to go home by plane.

They had taken a bus to Mexico City, they said, and Mexican police strip-searched them on the way, looking for money.

“It was horrible,” the wife said. “They abuse you as a migrant.”

They were afraid of going back to Venezuela, but more afraid of staying, they said. They couldn’t find enough work to take care of their basic needs, and schools wouldn’t accept their children because they are not Mexican, they said.

“Our dream was to arrive in the United States, but we couldn’t,” the husband said.

Now, he’s not sure if he would want to live in the U.S. anyway. He’d seen videos online of immigration officials making violent arrests.

“I prefer to be free,” he said.

I will never forget this one weekend that students involved with the AFS program from around the globe came to Niles West High School in Skokie, IL.

My entire hometown welcomed these foreign students with open arms, including those who were from Latin America. It was a unique educational experience for both parents and their children. It was an event that had a great impact on my life.

My family, along with all the family members of high school students involved in the AFS club, hosted students to stay in their homes for a weekend. My family hosted a teenage girl from Ecuador. I’ll call her “Maria.”

“Maria” was the first person I ever met from a different country who was bilingual. Maria spoke both English and Spanish fluently. I remember being so intrigued.

I remember Maria sharing what life was like in Quito, and how different and similar it was to the United States.

As a grade-schooler, I had been clueless how the world operated until that weekend. I was young and naive. I thought the entire world was just like Skokie. I had no idea what it was like living on a farm, on the ocean, in mountains, etc. It was my first real exposure to the concept of cultural diversity.

The last night of the weekend, all the families that sponsored students, along with the foreign exchange students, gathered in the “Oakton Street Lobby” at Niles West. We all sat by the fireplace. Together, all the students connected to AFS sang the song “Guantanamera.”

It was the first time I ever heard a song sung totally in Spanish. That moment has been embedded in my brain for over 50 years.

It was the early 1970s. It was a time of unrest in the United States. The song, and the experience of meeting so many foreign exchange students for the first time, started me thinking outside my sheltered little box.

When learning the words to “Guantanamera,” I started to understand the concept that politics, racism and political terrorism had on our universe.

The song “Guantanamera” opened my eyes up to much more than racism and segregation in the United States. It made me think on a global level for the first time in my life. Even though the song was written in the 1920’s, it became one of the protest songs of the 1970s.

Flashing forward to the unrest in the world today, I just can’t comprehend how the grandchildren of the hippie generation, the grandchildren of flower children — turned into people unable to utilize their own ability to critically think. So many of these young people have become extremely self-centered, prejudiced individuals, who are unable to think for themselves.

How is it that this new generation never learned the concepts of “Peace, Love and Rock and Roll?” What happened to the concept of saving our planet and creating a utopian society? Or a world in which peace, love and understanding prevailed?

I just can’t comprehend how my generation allowed our nation to be brainwashed to the degree that it has. How is it that voters ignored the warning signs of a dictator wanna be?

Twice our nation elected an individual to become President who is a known sexual predator, a person who filed bankruptcy numerous times, a man who has spewed hate against just about every ethnicity, and has made fun of those with physical challenges, along with individuals who risked their lives serving our nation.

How is it so many of today’s politicians grew up during a time in which we all strived for social change? We strived to make the world a better place, and NOT one in which a sociopathic dictator wannabe would use Gestapo-like tactics on innocent people, like what he is doing with ICE.

It’s time to stop this insanity and start singing songs like “Guantanamera” again.",https://static-cdn.toi-media.com/blogs/uploads/users/vicki-polin-new-new1680114980-400x400.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 21:57:10.986283

Grijalva (AZ-07), Greg Stanton (AZ-04), and Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03) in sending a letter to the Chairs and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees calling for a formal congressional investigation into a troubling pattern of abusive conduct and obstruction of independent journalism and congressional oversight by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The request follows a recent DHS operation in Tucson, Arizona, during which agents deployed chemical agents against a crowd that included Rep. Grijalva and clearly identified journalists.

“In a recent incident, DHS agents demonstrated an aggressive response that included the deployment of chemical agents during an operation in Tucson, Arizona, where Representative Adelita S. Grijalva presented herself as Member of Congress to use her legal authority and constitutional duty to obtain pertinent facts, observe policies, and conduct oversight of the executive’s implementation of federal law,” the lawmakers wrote. “On the same day, DHS issued a public statement denying the incident, which is inconsistent with independent press accounts, information from eyewitnesses, and video footage. Such contradictions further erode public trust in the Department and underscore the need for clear, transparent congressional review of its operations.

“This episode is part of a growing and deeply concerning national pattern that raises serious questions about DHS’ operations. Under the current administration, DHS personnel have repeatedly used force or obstructed elected officials and members of the press attempting to observe or inquire about enforcement actions and detention. The growing number of incidents collectively suggest a systemic disregard for oversight, transparency, and constitutional protections by DHS and its component agencies,” the lawmakers continued.

The letter requests a formal congressional investigation into DHS, including to: “Investigate the extent of DHS’ obstruction of Congressional oversight, interference with the right of the press to document and report on DHS operations, excessive use of force tactics against American civilians, including the use of chemical agents and other extraordinary measures, and the impact these tactics have on businesses and local communities.”

In a September ruling, a federal judge wrote that federal officers “unleashed crowd control weapons indiscriminately and with surprising savagery” during protests that occurred in Los Angeles. “Specifically, the Court concludes that federal agents’ indiscriminate use of force … will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events and protestors seeking to express peacefully their views on national policies,” the judge wrote.

Mary stands nearby outside the Lake Street Church in Evanston, Illinois, wearing a plastic gas mask and flanked by Roman soldiers in tactical vests labeled ""ICE.""

In another Chicago suburb, not far from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that has drawn protests over detentions, a sign at the manger outside the Urban Village Church says ""Due to ICE activity in our community the Holy Family is in hiding."" And more than a thousand miles away, the Christ child went missing from a Nativity scene at St. Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced by a hand-painted sign: ""ICE was here.""

These and other stark reimaginings of Christ's birth are drawing praise and outrage as churches turn the Christmas tableau into a commentary on federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration. Their creators say they are placing the ancient story in a contemporary frame, portraying the Holy Family as refugees to reflect on the fear of separation and deportation that many families — including their own parishioners — are experiencing today.

Supporters of the displays say the Bible is on their side, but critics call the scenes sacrilegious and politically divisive, accusing the churches of abusing sacred imagery and some arguing they should lose their tax-exempt status. The archdiocese in Massachusetts ordered that the manger must be ""restored to its proper sacred purpose.""

The debate comes as immigration enforcement intensifies in states and cities whose leaders object to the immigration crackdown. In September alone, a combined total of at least 2,000 people were arrested in Illinois and Massachusetts, according to federal arrest figures released by immigration authorities.

""A grave scandal for Catholics""

For churches, Christmas is a time ""when we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something,"" said Rev. Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street. Another Nativity scene created by the Baptist congregation one recent year showed Jesus in rubble — a ""plea for peace"" in Gaza, he said.

St. Susanna parishioners locked baby Jesus in a cage in 2018 to protest how President Donald Trump's first administration was separating families at the border. Another year, they depicted the infant floating in water polluted with plastic to highlight climate change.

Boston Archbishop Richard Henning ordered this year's display taken down. As of Thursday, Father Steve Josoma was seeking a meeting and had yet to comply.

""The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,"" a diocesan spokesperson said.

Some Catholic activists want the priest punished.

""This is really a grave scandal for Catholics, and I think he's playing with fire,"" said C.J. Doyle, director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. ""The archbishop can remove him as pastor, suspend him from active ministry — he can even close the parish and sell the property right out from under him.""

The community's reality

Josoma said the display's purpose is to move ""beyond static traditional figures and evoke emotion and dialogue"" in response to the fear many parishioners face as federal forces arrest more than undocumented immigrants, sweeping up longtime legal residents and spreading anxiety.

In Illinois, the detention campaign has left bystanders choking on chemical sprays and children traumatized at the site of neighbors and teachers being taken away, prompting state and local investigations.

""We wanted to reflect sort of the reality that our community is experiencing,"" said Jillian Westerfield, associate minister at the United Methodist church in Evanston.

After the figure of Joseph blew down and was damaged, leaving Mary alone with the baby, they put up an explanatory sign: ""Joseph didn't make it. We hold this space to honor and remember all the victims of immigration enforcement terror.""

Critics either don't fully understand the message or ""find it really challenging to their conscience and are lashing out at the art rather than engaging with what the actual message is,"" Westerfield said.

""Not a stunt""

Phil Mandeville, who sits on St. Susanna's Parish Council and coordinates a multi-church refugee support committee, said long-standing relationships make the parish resolute about keeping the display.

The committee has worked with about 10 refugee families since 2019, helping them find housing, enroll in school, learn English and secure work. Much of the effort is done in partnership with the federal government, which puts families through extensive vetting before they arrive, he said.

""Just to emphasize the reason for all of this — it's not a stunt,"" Mandeville said. ""We work on a daily basis with refugees. But people get upset about a bit of plaster. I care more about individuals than I do a manger scene. I understand what it represents — I don't understand why no one cares about these human beings.""

""Look at the Gospel just before Christ was executed — that was political,"" he added. ""We were always taught: when you're unsure how to act, ask, 'What would Christ do?' Now we're doing that, and it doesn't seem to jibe.""

Divided reaction

The controversy in Evanston drew volunteers from a nearby synagogue, who stood outside during Lake Street's services to help worshippers feel safe. Reactions outside the Dedham church ranged widely.

Walter Niland snapped a selfie and said he disagreed with the display. ""I believe that the church enjoys a tax-exempt status,"" said Niland, a Catholic from a neighboring town. ""We should speak to spiritual matters, not matters of political division.""

Others came to challenge the parish directly — including one man who livestreamed his attempt to pull on locked church doors.

Steve Grieger, a former Catholic schoolteacher, drove an hour from Worcester to show his support.

""The Archdiocese says, 'Oh no, that goes against our tradition.' Well, we're living in times that are totally abnormal. We can't just proceed as normal,"" Grieger said. ""If we're following the scriptures of Jesus, then we have to recognize that these ICE raids, and all of these terrible things going on, are totally against that.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8107x4560+0+422/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2F46%2F32c5bcba4003ae298987247ee090%2Fap25345010903357.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 13:57:06.668267

SEE: Federal judge issues order to prohibit immigration officials from detaining Kilmar Abrego Garcia

Mr. Abrego Garcia – Maryland resident, union sheet-metal worker, father of three, and longstanding member of his community – was previously wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March 2025 despite a prior judicial order forbidding his removal to that country. His case has drawn national attention as a stark example of unchecked immigration enforcement and the human cost of policies that prioritize punitive tactics over due process and family unity.

“Today’s ruling is an important affirmation that no person – regardless of immigration status – should be detained without a lawful basis or separated from their family without legitimate cause,” said CAIR’s Maryland Director Zainab Chaudry. “We welcome the judge’s decision, and call on policymakers at all levels of the government to ensure that our immigration system respects basic human dignity, adheres to the rule of law, and keeps families together.”

CAIR Maryland welcomed previous federal court rulings in Abrego’s favor, and has consistently advocated for immigration policies that are humane, fair, and rooted in respect for fundamental rights and civil liberties. This includes ensuring transparency and accountability in enforcement actions and opposing practices that lead to family separation, unlawful detention, and retaliation against individuals exercising legal rights.

Judge Xinis’s ruling highlights critical concerns about due process and government overreach. It reinforces that judicial oversight must remain a safeguard against arbitrary detention and that the judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding constitutional protections when executive action exceeds legal authority.

Mr. Abrego Garcia’s case is one of many across the country where immigrant community members – workers, parents, and neighbors – have been caught up in expansive enforcement actions that lack transparency and undermine community safety. CAIR Maryland continues to stand with immigrant families and advocates for comprehensive reforms that ensure fairness and accountability in immigration policy.

The US is ending temporary legal status for citizens of Ethiopia in the United States, according to a government notice on Friday, as the Trump administration continues its crackdown on legal and illegal immigration.

“After reviewing country conditions and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, the secretary determined that Ethiopia no longer continues to meet the conditions for the designation for Temporary Protected Status,” homeland security secretary Kristi Noem said in a notice posted in the Federal Register.

Temporary protected status is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The program was created in 1991, and under Donald Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, it was extended to cover about 600,000 Venezuelans and 521,000 Haitians. Noem reversed the extensions in February, saying they were no longer justified.

In recent months, the Trump administration has removed the protective status for people from numerous countries, including Haiti, Myanmar, South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela. In November, the president announced the termination of protection for Somalis in Minnesota.

Trump has made controlling immigration a central plank of his second White House term. Canceling TPS protections are a boost to the administration’s campaign to deport millions of people. The cancellations have been challenged in court.

The US supreme court in October cleared the way for the administration to revoke TPS for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan people in the United States, granting a request to put on hold a federal judge’s ruling that Noem lacked the authority to terminate the status while litigation proceeds.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also said on Friday it was no longer processing legacy cases under the Cuban and Haitian family reunification parole program, according to a post in the Federal Register. Those programs make it easier for US citizens and lawful permanent residents to bring family members into the country.",https://www.hiiraan.com/uploads/2025/12/1765601648Screenshot2025-12-13075347.png,N,,2025-12-13 13:57:13.629790

If you’re someone who might be subject to deportation in the United States, then it’s probably worth being aware of this new reality…","I don’t think anyone will be surprised to learn this, but there’s a new level of cooperation between government agencies in the United States, which could lead to more airport arrests, including of domestic travelers.

Airline passenger data is helping Trump’s deportation efforts

The New York Times reports how the Trump administration is increasingly using the airline tickets that people book to help with deportation efforts.

When passengers book airline tickets, it’s standard that the data is provided to the TSA, and is compared against national security databases, to identify people on watch lists, suspected terrorists, etc. The TSA hasn’t historically used this information to get involved in domestic criminal or immigration matters. However, that has now changed.

Under a program that was launched in March 2025, multiple times per week, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) shares the names of all travelers booked on flights with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE then matches the list against its own database of people subject to deportation, and sends agents to airports to arrest people.

This is of course being done as part of the goal of carrying out the largest deportation campaign in United States history. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson released a statement that “the message to those in the country illegally is clear: the only reason you should be flying is to self-deport home.”

A former deputy head of the ICE office in New York City said the following about this program:

“The administration has turned routine travel into a force multiplier for removals, potentially identifying thousands who thought they could evade the law simply by boarding a plane. This isn’t about fear; it’s about restoring order and ensuring every American knows their government enforces its laws without apology.”

An example of how this program was recently used

Last month, there was a story that got quite a bit of attention about Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19-year-old who was attending college in Boston. On November 20, 2025, she showed up at the airport in Boston to fly to Texas to visit her family for Thanksgiving.

Moments before getting on her flight, she was told there as a problem with her boarding pass, and on her way to the customer service desk, she was “surrounded, (placed) in handcuffs, and dragged out of the airport,” according to her attorney.

Within 48 hours, she was deported to Honduras, a country she hadn’t lived in since she was seven years old, when her parents brought her to the United States, while seeking asylum. Her attorney claims she was removed even after a federal judge issued an order barring the government from removing her outside of Massachusetts. She was also never shown a warrant, a removal order, or given any explanation, by ICE officials.

DHS claims that an immigration judge ordered her removal in 2015, but she “illegally stayed in the country since.” Meanwhile her attorney claims the only record he found in the government’s database indicates her case was closed in 2017.

Obviously immigration is a contentious topic. I think a vast majority of reasonable people agree that violent criminals should be deported (I certainly do!). But my heart breaks for children who were brought to this country by their parents (through no choice of their own), and are now being sent to a country that is really “foreign” to them, and that they don’t really know.

At this point it seems like the government is deporting people just to reach a quota. I mean, top White House official Stephen Miller has made it a goal for 3,000 people to be arrested everyday for immigration. To me, it’s sad when you’re deporting people just to deport them, especially someone like this young woman, who was trying to contribute positively to society, was pursuing education, etc.

But hey, I have to be balanced. We live in a democracy, and not in my imaginary dream world. Trump promised the largest mass deportation in history, and that’s what we’re getting.

Bottom line

In recent months, the TSA has started frequently sharing airline passenger lists with ICE, in order to facilitate airport arrests of people subject to deportation orders. Historically, domestic passenger data hasn’t been used for these purposes, but instead, the data was just shared in order to screen potential terrorists.

If the goal is to simply deport as many people as possible, then I can see how using airports is one of the easier ways to do so — you know exactly where and when someone will be, and if they’ve been screened by the TSA, you also know they don’t have weapons.

Since the shooting of two national guard soldiers in Washington DC late last month, with the authorities charging an Afghan man as the suspect, the Trump administration has taken harsh action, especially against Afghans in the US, generating a mix of fear, outrage and defiance in the diaspora.

The government has completely frozen asylum decisions at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), paused visa and immigration applications filed by Afghans and, more widely, halted all legal immigration cases for nationals of 19 countries listed on its travel ban, including citizenship ceremonies.

“The attacker hasn’t been put on trial, but the whole Afghan community has been labeled as guilty,” said Yahya Haqiqi, president of the Afghan Support Network in the US, an organization founded shortly after the fall of Kabul to Taliban control in 2021 that has helped thousands of Afghan refugees settle in Oregon.

“There are folks that came here because they fought for American values in Afghanistan, and because of the action of one individual, they and the whole community are being harmed. They are scared of their future, of not knowing what’s going to happen tomorrow.”

The administration also directed officials to re-investigate the cases of immigrants from those 19 countries who were granted legal status under the Biden administration, and reduced the validity period for work permits issued to several groups of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and refugees.

Trump administration officials have argued the changes are necessary after federal authorities identified the suspect in the shooting of the national guard soldiers, one of whom died, as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan evacuee who entered the US in September 2021 and was granted asylum in April 2025.

The moves also come amid reports of stepped-up apprehensions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in some heavily Afghan communities.

Afghans who spoke with the Guardian said they condemn the killing of national guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom and that they hope guardsman Andrew Wolfe fully recovers after being critically wounded. But, they said, the policy changes introduced by the administration are unnecessarily creating uncertainty for thousands of families fighting to stay in the United States.

Shir Agha Safi said he worked as an intelligence officer alongside American forces fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. He came to the US in 2022 as part of Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden administration effort to resettle tens of thousands of Afghan evacuees.

Safi said he applied for a green card in 2023 through the special immigrant visa (SIV) program, which offers permanent residency to Afghans who supported the American war effort, as translators or in other roles.

“I agree with the re-examination of green cards,” he said in a telephone interview with the Guardian last week – but not for the reasons the Trump administration is citing.

“The US government should recognize the faces of those who served the US mission in Afghanistan,” he said. Safi is now the executive director of Afghan Partners in Iowa, a non-profit in Des Moines, where around 500 Afghan families settled after the 2021 evacuations.

“Some are feeling a sense of betrayal in my community, of being marginalized, but I said that if they have not done anything wrong, they should not be afraid of the changes,” he said.

Some 80,000 Afghan immigrants were granted humanitarian parole to enter the United States under Operation Allies Welcome. As of 2022, nearly 200,000 Afghan immigrants had been welcomed into the United States, with California, Virginia, Texas and New York being the states with the highest concentrations of Afghans.

Haqiqi , in Oregon, said that Afghans in the Portland metro region “are scared of just living, they are scared of exposing themselves as Afghans, not just to immigration officials, but how people will react to them as part of their community”.

Meanwhile, Safi added that in Des Moines, Afghans have been detained by federal immigration officials following the announcement of the sweeping changes to US immigration policies. The government defended the reason behind the reshaping of the process of asylum, visas and green cards, citing concerns for the safety of the country.

“Military-age males were routinely flown into the United States before their identities and backgrounds were fully established, with the Biden administration asserting that thorough vetting would occur only after arrival,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security.

“Under the Trump administration, we have instituted rigorous, multilayered screening: mandatory biometric enrollment, comprehensive social-media vetting, expanded recurrent background checks, and a requirement for annual in-person reporting. The safety of Americans must come first.”

In 2022, a report by the inspector general said that the National Counterterrorism Center had failed to use Department of Defense biometric data when vetting Afghan evacuees after the chaotic 2021 troop withdrawal.

In June, a federal report that reviewed the participation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the evacuation of Afghans since 2021 said: “When potential threats to national security were identified related to certain evacuees, we found that the FBI proactively used its investigative authorities and continuous identity discovery tools to mitigate those potential threats.”

In the wake of the latest policy changes, Vermont’s governor, Phil Scott, a Republican, said: “The shooting in Washington DC is a painful reminder that people can become violent for inexplicable reasons, especially those involved in warfare. Although there’s no excuse for what happened, it’s also not fair to cast blame on an entire group of people who are doing the best they can to integrate into our communities and follow the American dream.”

In a recent memo, USCIS confirmed it had paused all pending immigration applications from 19 countries on the travel ban, including Afghanistan. This means that those people with pending applications for green cards and other benefits, like Safi, are in limbo indefinitely, with their cases unable to move forward for the foreseeable future.

Even before the new restrictions, only a small number of visas were issued to Afghans due to the inclusion of Afghanistan in the travel ban. The majority were special immigrant visas.

According to a federal report, from January to March of 2025, there were more than 10,000 Afghan applicants seeking approval of special immigrant visas. That process has been brought to a complete halt since the shooting in Washington.

Immigration lawyers and Afghan refugees are still scrambling to understand how the Trump administration’s new restrictions will be implemented and for how long. But what is clear is the far-reaching scope of the crackdown. The asylum pause, for example, could affect some 1.5 million applicants awaiting a decision on their cases.

One of them is Freshta, a 29-year-old Afghan immigrant who came to the US in 2022 on a visa for highly qualified students. She asked for her real name to be withheld, citing fears about being targeted and ultimately deported by federal immigration officials amid the recent crackdown.

Freshta said she applied for asylum with USCIS in the first months of 2023. But her case has been brought to a complete halt due to the pause in asylum decisions.

“I came here the legal way. I came here because everyone said there was freedom of speech and I could pursue my dreams as an Afghan woman,” Freshta said in an interview over tea on a recent afternoon in New York City.

“That doesn’t exist in Afghanistan. Everybody knows that women can’t go to school, can’t work, let alone have an opinion. See? I don’t wear scarves, I don’t follow the Taliban’s rule, so small things like these, if not kill me, would create a lot of challenges.”

Decisions on the granting of asylum are made by the Department of Homeland Security. The Guardian reached out to the agency asking whether asylum applicants should expect their applications to be terminated, but the question wasn’t addressed.

“I feel like I am getting close to who I was dreaming to be but it’s hard to be an immigrant now,” Freshta added. “If I speak the language, I pay taxes, I integrate into this society, what else can I do? I want a normal life, a normal human being with dignity.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcc7ff4f78ad829425141874c8425717c218f472/239_0_2371_1897/master/2371.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a6726bc3ac71d0fa06943bd13862d7a",N,,2025-12-13 10:58:28.789426

So what happens when immigration agents show up to question the people working at your house? One woman in Charlotte, North Carolina, had to face that situation last month when Border Patrol agents suddenly appeared on her front lawn. NPR's Adrian Florido has her story.

ADRIAN FLORIDO, BYLINE: There's a big pine tree in Rheba Hamilton's front yard, about 10 feet tall. Each year, just before Thanksgiving, she has it strung with Christmas lights. But this year, the lights are wrapped only around the very top of the tree, just the tip.

RHEBA HAMILTON: It looks completely ridiculous unless you know why it looks like that.

FLORIDO: On November 15, Hamilton was on her front porch drinking coffee while two men she'd hired to put the lights up set up their ladder and got to work. They'd just gotten started when an unmarked minivan pulled up out front.

HAMILTON: I see the car rolling to a stop, and I see the door's already open with the guys getting out. Border Patrol is here.

FLORIDO: Two uniformed agents with their faces covered got out of the van and approached her workers. Hamilton grabbed her phone and started filming.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMILTON: Randy (ph), they're in our yard.

FLORIDO: She yelled out to her husband as the agents started peppering her workers with questions in Spanish.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED BORDER PATROL AGENT: (Speaking Spanish).

FLORIDO: I want to know what country you're a citizen of, the agents say. You're not answering my question. I'm a federal agent. In the video, you see the worker on the ladder freeze in place. The one on the ground slowly moves away. Neither says a word. Hamilton gets up close to record.

HAMILTON: I wanted their faces. I wanted to be able to show them hiding their faces. They're not proud of the work they're doing.

FLORIDO: She says she was terrified for the workers, who were undocumented. Then, suddenly and without saying a word, the agents stop their questions and run back to their van and drive off. At that moment, Hamilton felt her fear turn to rage. She rushed toward the van.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMILTON: Get the hell out of my yard, you [expletive].

I was so angry, and I was really surprised to hear myself bid them farewell because I don't really cuss. But I stand by it.

FLORIDO: DHS says its agents do not racially profile, but Hamilton says that is what it felt like. The agents came onto her property without permission, she says, ready to haul away two men because they look Latino.

HAMILTON: Of course, they chose them because they were brown. But I think, also, they chose them because they thought they were going to be a real easy target.

FLORIDO: Once the agents were gone, her workers ran to their truck and drove off themselves.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HAMILTON: Yeah. Just go home.

FLORIDO: Hamilton says she fully supports law enforcement, but she thinks immigration agents under Trump are terrorizing good people like her workers.

HAMILTON: If this is happening in your yard - and while you do not know the people well, you know them well enough to know that they are well and truly screwed if this goes down, that they will maybe never see their families again. So I feel like a lot of people would have done exactly what I did.

FLORIDO: As for the still half-decorated Christmas tree in her yard...

HAMILTON: I thought maybe we'll just leave it like this as a symbol of what happens when ICE and Border Patrol gets involved in your world. Things don't go as planned.

FLORIDO: And you wind up, she says, with no work getting done.

404 Media previously obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement emails revealing the agency’s facial recognition app, called Mobile Fortify, and catalogued social media videos showing agents scanning people’s faces to verify their citizenship.
The app runs the person’s face against a database of 200 million images, according to internal ICE material 404 Media viewed.
The need for Mobile Fortify, according to that internal document, is for immigration authorities to identify people who can be removed from the country.
“It is conceivable that a photo taken by an agent using the Mobile Fortify mobile application could be that of someone other than an alien, including U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents,” the document reads.","This article is a partnership between Reveal and 404 Media.

Jesus Gutiérrez, 23, was walking home one morning from a Chicago gym when he noticed a gray Cadillac SUV with no license plates. He kept walking, shrugging it off. Then the car pulled over and two men got out.

The federal immigration officials told him not to run. They then peppered Gutiérrez with questions: Where are you going? Where are you coming from? Do you have your ID on you?

Gutiérrez is a US citizen. He told the officials this. He didn’t have any identification on him, but, panicking, he tried to find a copy on his phone. The agents put him into the car, where another two agents were waiting, and handcuffed him. Just sit there and be quiet, they said.

Without Gutiérrez’s ID, the agents resorted to another approach. They took a photo of his face. A short while later, the agents got their answer: “Oh yeah, he’s right. He’s saying the right thing. He does got papers,” Gutiérrez recalled the agents saying.

Gutiérrez’s experience, which he recounted to Reveal, is one snapshot of something that federal authorities have acknowledged to 404 Media that they are doing across the country: scanning people’s faces with a facial recognition app that brings up their name, date of birth, “alien number” if they’re an immigrant, and whether they have an order of deportation. 404 Media previously obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement emails revealing the agency’s facial recognition app, called Mobile Fortify, and catalogued social media videos showing agents scanning people’s faces to verify their citizenship.

Now, Reveal has spoken to a person who appears to have had that technology used against them. Gutiérrez sent Reveal a copy of his passport to verify his citizenship.

“You just grabbing, like, random people, dude,” Gutiérrez said he told the agents after they scanned his face. The officials eventually dropped off Gutiérrez after driving for around an hour. For several days, he didn’t go anywhere, not even to the gym. Gutiérrez told his father at the time that he “got kidnapped.”

“This is a flagrant violation of rights and incompatible with a free society,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy project director for the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. “Immigration agents have no business scanning our faces with this glitchy, privacy-destroying technology—especially after often stopping people based on nothing more than the color of their skin or the neighborhood they live in.”

Mobile Fortify is available to ICE and Customs and Border Protection officials on their work-issued phones. After an agent scans someone’s face, the app queries an unprecedented collection of US government databases, including one run by the FBI and another that checks for outstanding state warrants, according to user manuals seen by 404 Media. The app runs the person’s face against a database of 200 million images, according to internal ICE material 404 Media viewed.

“The photograph shown [in the app’s results] is the photograph that was taken during the individual’s most recent encounter with CBP, however the matching will be against all pictures CBP may maintain on the individual,” said an internal Department of Homeland Security document 404 Media obtained. The app turns the system usually used for verifying travelers at the border inward against people on US streets.

The need for Mobile Fortify, according to that internal document, is for immigration authorities to identify people who can be removed from the country. But it acknowledges that it may be used against US citizens, like in Gutiérrez’s case.

“It is conceivable that a photo taken by an agent using the Mobile Fortify mobile application could be that of someone other than an alien, including U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents,” the document reads.

Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, previously told 404 Media that ICE will prioritize the results of the app over birth certificates. “ICE officials have told us that an apparent biometric match by Mobile Fortify is a ‘definitive’ determination of a person’s status and that an ICE officer may ignore evidence of American citizenship—including a birth certificate—if the app says the person is an alien,” he said. “ICE using a mobile biometrics app in ways its developers at CBP never intended or tested is a frightening, repugnant, and unconstitutional attack on Americans’ rights and freedoms.”

404 Media has found other instances in which ICE and CBP agents have used a facial recognition app to verify someone’s identity and citizenship. In one that appeared to take place in Chicago, a Border Patrol officer stopped two young men on bicycles before asking his colleague, “Can you do facial?” The other official then scanned one of the boy’s faces, according to a video posted on social media. In another, a group of ICE officers surrounded a man driving a car. He said he was an American citizen. “Alright, we just got to verify that,” one of them said. A second then pointed their phone’s camera at the man and asked him to remove his hat. “If you could take your hat off, it would be a lot quicker,” the officer said. “I’m going to run your information.”

In Gutiérrez’s case, there is little indication that he was stopped for any reason beyond the color of his skin. He is of Mexican descent, he said. Stops of people based on their race, use of Spanish, or location (such as a car wash or bus stop) have become known among critics as “Kavanaugh stops,” after Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh justified the method in a September opinion.

“The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English,” the opinion says. (Gutiérrez speaks Spanish but conducted his interview with Reveal in English.) “If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiate the process for removal.”

The ACLU’s Wessler added: “In the United States, we should be free to go about our business without government agents scanning our faces, accessing our personal information, saving our photos for years, and putting us at risk of misidentifications and wrongful detentions. ICE and CBP’s use of Mobile Fortify on the streets of America should end immediately.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, “DHS is not going to confirm or deny law enforcement capabilities or methods.” CBP said that the agency built the app to support ICE operations and that it has been used by ICE around the country.

A CBP spokesperson added in a statement, “Mobile Fortify is a law enforcement app developed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection for ICE agents and officers. It helps field personnel gather information during immigration inspections, but agents must consider all circumstances before deciding on someone’s immigration status. CBP personnel working with ICE teams can access the app after completing required training. Further details cannot be shared due to law enforcement sensitivities.”

Gutiérrez said that at the end of his encounter, while he was still in the car, the agents were laughing.",https://i0.wp.com/revealnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54307135384_dc6f645841_k.jpg?fit=2048%2C1153&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-13 10:58:39.495297

The H-1B visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers with specialized skills for jobs where U.S. workers with similar qualifications cannot be found, mainly in science and technology.
“The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including California, and threatens the quality of education, health care and other core services available to our residents,” Attorney General Rob Bonta of California said in a statement.
An earlier challenge to the $100,000 fee was filed in October by a group of unions, higher-education professionals and religious organizations, who said that the fee would harm hospitals, churches, schools and small businesses.
The $100,000 fee has significantly added to the costs for companies that are considering using the program to hire workers, on top of legal fees and other administrative expenses.","The attorneys general of 20 states including California and New York sued the Trump administration on Friday over its decision to impose a $100,000 fee on visas for skilled foreign workers.

President Trump signed a proclamation in September imposing the fee. His administration has argued that some employers had abused the program to keep wages low, hurting American workers. The policy took effect Sept. 21.

The states have asked a federal court to declare the policy unlawful and to block its enforcement.

The H-1B visa program allows employers to hire foreign workers with specialized skills for jobs where U.S. workers with similar qualifications cannot be found, mainly in science and technology.

California and Massachusetts were the lead plaintiffs in the suit, which was filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. California-based tech companies including Meta, Google and Apple were among the largest employers of H-1B visa holders this year, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Schools and universities also use the program to bring educators and researchers to the United States.

“The $100,000 visa fee is devastating for all states, including California, and threatens the quality of education, health care and other core services available to our residents,” Attorney General Rob Bonta of California said in a statement.

An earlier challenge to the $100,000 fee was filed in October by a group of unions, higher-education professionals and religious organizations, who said that the fee would harm hospitals, churches, schools and small businesses.

The H-1B policy has created a rift among Mr. Trump’s supporters, with his backers in the tech industry on one side and opponents of immigration on the other.

Immigration hard-liners approve of it, saying it would encourage companies to hire American workers. Tech start-ups are among the critics of the new fee, which they say will hurt their ability to fill critical roles and stay competitive. Health care associations have said the fee would exacerbate physician shortages.

Employers apply for the three-year visa on behalf of foreign workers, a process that can be highly competitive because Congress capped the number of H-1Bs issued each year at 85,000. The $100,000 fee has significantly added to the costs for companies that are considering using the program to hire workers, on top of legal fees and other administrative expenses.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/20/multimedia/12trump-news-h1b-suit/20biz-h1b-visas-lfcz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 10:58:25.785283

Contrary to Trump’s ranting, the United States did in fact restrict admission to only include white, European immigrants by law through much of the past century.
Today, the Trump administration is closing immigration pathways by which people enter the US, and gain status when here.
But it is not just through the physical brutalization that this ethnic cleansing is being executed.
This ethnic cleansing can only be accomplished through the destruction of all of the above, in ways that touch the lives of each and every person within the nation, American or not.","A rally on affordability in Pennsylvania on 9 December devolved into a racist tirade when Donald Trump said to the crowd: “We only take people from shithole countries. Why can’t we have some people from Norway, Sweden, just a few? … From Denmark. Do you mind sending us a few people? Send us some nice people. But we always take people from Somalia, places that are a disaster, right? Filthy, dirty, disgusting, ridden with crime.”

Referring to the US representative Ilhan Omar’s hijab as a “little turban”, Trump continued: “She should get the hell out. Throw her the hell out.” His supporters erupted in chants of: “Send her back.”

The rant is abhorrent and factually incorrect, but it does hold one truth – the Trump administration’s vision for the United States is one of a white Christian nation. And the path to accomplish it is through the exclusion and removal of all who do not fit that vision – in other words, through ethnic cleansing.

To that end, Trump and his acolytes have increasingly been using the term “reverse migration” and even proposed an “office of remigration”. The idea, borrowed from white supremacists in Europe, understands immigrants as an inherent threat to the identity of what they imagine to be “white” nations. Immigrants’ forcible and systematic removal – remigration – is envisioned as a way to “restore” that whiteness.

This vision of an ethnically cleansed, white US is being enacted in policy.

Contrary to Trump’s ranting, the United States did in fact restrict admission to only include white, European immigrants by law through much of the past century. Racial quotas were only abolished through Black activism and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s.

Whether immigrants are welcome or not has always been an issue of racial inclusion in this settler colonial state – it is the mechanism by which we decide who belongs in this nation.

Today, the Trump administration is closing immigration pathways by which people enter the US, and gain status when here. Asylum is dead. Resettlement is cancelled except, tellingly, for white Afrikaners. Temporary protective status, which protects people from deportation due to turbulence in their nations of origin, has been or will be cancelled for Haitians, Venezuelans, Nicaraguans, Syrians and others, leaving hundreds of thousands of people deportable to countries the US recognizes as unsafe. Fees for all immigration processes have sharply increased.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is exploring how to block pathways to citizenship for people who qualify. Citizenship ceremonies are being cancelled as people are being pulled out of line while waiting to take their oaths. Mohsen Mahdawi was detained on 14 April at his citizenship appointment for his participation in a civil pro-Palestinian protest at his university.

Trump issued an executive order to cancel birthright citizenship – the mechanism by which formerly enslaved Black Americans became citizens – that has made its way to the supreme court. And he has said he would “absolutely” denaturalize American citizens if he could.

While this commentary seems bombastic, it is not without precedent in United States history, where in the first half of the 20th century, hundreds of thousands of people were denaturalized due to politicized accusations of fraud, lacking “good moral character” or having “racial ineligibility” (ie not being white).

These current policies sit against the backdrop of the grotesque expansion of the mass deportation system. In September, two months after the so-called Big Beautiful Bill was passed – adding $75bn to ICE’s budget, giving it a bigger budget than all but seven of the world’s militaries, and making it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government – the supreme court authorized ICE officers to racially profile people.

This makes every person of color, regardless of status, a potential target. And, in a nation that remains segregated by race, where people of color often live apart from white people, ICE is terrorizing communities of color.

US citizens have also been caught up in ICE raids: members of the Navajo and Mescalero nations; a Black man in Chicago with his birth certificate in his backpack; a 20-year-old in Minnesota of Somali origin who kept trying to show ICE officers his passport, only to be forced by officers to undergo a facial scan to prove his citizenship. The investment of millions of dollars in cybersurveillance technology – which can hack phones in a certain radius and uses AI to recognize faces and places – presents a violation of privacy for every single person in this country regardless of race or status.

Meanwhile, the rhetoric that once justified deportations has been revealed as a lie. Data shows that the vast majority of immigrants detained have no criminal record. Concerns of the fiscal burden that immigrants pose (never actually borne out in data) are shown for their absurdity when Trump says there is “no price tag” on his mass deportation agenda. Somalis added $8bn to Minnesota’s economy, though their contributions should have no bearing on their humanity.

There seems to be joy in the cruelty, when Trump trolls “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” as we watch men and women dragged from the arms of their children, sobbing. Many of them are sent to privatized detention centers rife with human rights violations that turn a profit on human lives – incentivized to limit healthcare, food and comfort to detainees to maximize shareholder profit.

But it is not just through the physical brutalization that this ethnic cleansing is being executed. There is also violence in systematic disinvestment that disproportionately cuts essential lifelines for Black and brown people. The Big Beautiful Bill rolls back social spending, denying millions of people healthcare coverage, food benefits and welfare benefits. It enacts policies that exacerbate burdens of student debt. It raises the budgets of police and carceral facilities.

The idea that those who cannot be removed should be subjugated is alive in our academic institutions, through attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion, on students’ right to dissent, on affirmative action.

The strength of this imperfect nation, which has never repaired for its original sins of genocide and enslavement, is in the incredible diversity of people who make it great, in the freedoms it claims to uphold – of life, liberty and justice. This ethnic cleansing can only be accomplished through the destruction of all of the above, in ways that touch the lives of each and every person within the nation, American or not.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc3b7156f50e2115bbde29a9d9e9a3445b7d7c0/0_0_1200_960/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d964b1de4337ec6ed51cace563407eab",N,,2025-12-13 09:57:08.724402

The debate comes as immigration enforcement intensifies in states and cities whose leaders object to the immigration crackdown. In September alone, a combined total of at least 2,000 people were arrested in Illinois and Massachusetts, according to federal arrest figures released by immigration authorities.

‘A grave scandal for Catholics’

For churches, Christmas is a time “when we have public art out on the lawn and we get an opportunity to say something,” said Rev. Michael Woolf, senior minister at Lake Street. Another Nativity scene created by the Baptist congregation one recent year showed Jesus in rubble — a “plea for peace” in Gaza, he said.

St. Susanna parishioners locked baby Jesus in a cage in 2018 to protest how President Donald Trump’s first administration was separating families at the border. Another year, they depicted the infant floating in water polluted with plastic to highlight climate change.

Boston Archbishop Richard Henning ordered this year’s display taken down. As of Thursday, Father Steve Josoma was seeking a meeting and had yet to comply.

“The people of God have the right to expect that, when they come to church, they will encounter genuine opportunities for prayer and Catholic worship — not divisive political messaging,” a diocesan spokesperson said.

Some Catholic activists want the priest punished.

“This is really a grave scandal for Catholics, and I think he’s playing with fire,” said C.J. Doyle, director of the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. “The archbishop can remove him as pastor, suspend him from active ministry — he can even close the parish and sell the property right out from under him.”

The community’s reality

Josoma said the display’s purpose is to move “beyond static traditional figures and evoke emotion and dialogue” in response to the fear many parishioners face as federal forces arrest more than undocumented immigrants, sweeping up longtime legal residents and spreading anxiety.

In Illinois, the detention campaign has left bystanders choking on chemical sprays and children traumatized at the site of neighbors and teachers being taken away, prompting state and local investigations.

“We wanted to reflect sort of the reality that our community is experiencing,” Jillian Westerfield, associate minister at the United Methodist church in Evanston.

After the figure of Joseph blew down and was damaged, leaving Mary alone with the baby, they put up an explanatory sign: “Joseph didn’t make it. We hold this spaced to honor and remember all the victims of immigration enforcement terror.”

Critics either don’t fully understand the message or “find it really challenging to their conscience and are lashing out at the art rather than engaging with what the actual message is,” Westerfield said.

‘Not a stunt’

Phil Mandeville, who sits on St. Susanna’s Parish Council and coordinates a multi-church refugee support committee, said long-standing relationships make the parish resolute about keeping the display.

The committee has worked with about 10 refugee families since 2019, helping them find housing, enroll in school, learn English and secure work. Much of the effort is done in partnership with the federal government, which puts families through extensive vetting before they arrive, he said.

“Just to emphasize the reason for all of this — it’s not a stunt,” Mandeville said. “We work on a daily basis with refugees. But people get upset about a bit of plaster. I care more about individuals than I do a manger scene. I understand what it represents — I don’t understand why no one cares about these human beings.”

“Look at the Gospel just before Christ was executed — that was political,” he added. “We were always taught: when you’re unsure how to act, ask, ‘What would Christ do?’ Now we’re doing that, and it doesn’t seem to jibe.”

Divided reaction

The controversy in Evanston drew volunteers from a nearby synagogue, who stood outside during Lake Street’s services to help worshippers feel safe. Reactions outside the Dedham church ranged widely.

Walter Niland snapped a selfie and said he disagreed with the display. “I believe that the church enjoys a tax-exempt status,” said Niland, a Catholic from a neighboring town. “We should speak to spiritual matters, not matters of political division.”

Others came to challenge the parish directly — including one man who livestreamed his attempt to pull on locked church doors.

Steve Grieger, a former Catholic schoolteacher, drove an hour from Worcester to show his support.

“The Archdiocese says, ‘Oh no, that goes against our tradition.’ Well, we’re living in times that are totally abnormal. We can’t just proceed as normal,” Grieger said. “If we’re following the scriptures of Jesus, then we have to recognize that these ICE raids, and all of these terrible things going on, are totally against that.”

Data obtained and recently released by the Deportation Data Project show immigration arrests skyrocketed in the state and mostly were made through local jails, following new state laws requiring cooperation between local sheriffs and ICE.

Federal agents are following through with the Trump administration's directives to fill immigration jails — ICE made about 3,400 arrests in North Carolina from Jan. 20 through Oct. 15 this year compared to about 1,720 arrests in all of 2024, according to a WUNC analysis of the data.

The Deportation Data Project is a team of researchers based out of UCLA and UC Berkeley which filed Freedom of Information Act requests and sued the government to obtain federal data for 2025, 2024 and a part of 2023.

Note: The data in many cases include location identifiers, but not in all. The federal government has not released specific numbers, nor verified figures reported by the Deportation Data Project. WUNC identified North Carolina immigration arrests through a combination of attribution to counties, localities, metro areas and detention facilities where detainees were processed. Figures reported in this story are close estimates, but should not be considered exact.

Data for all of the U.S. published by the Deportation Data Project show that in this same time frame, around 75,000 people arrested by ICE did not have a criminal record, which is more than one-third of all ICE arrests, NPR reported.

ICE is a separate agency from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, whose green-vested agents targeted the state in last month's operation dubbed ""Charlotte's Web"". ICE primarily conducts arrests through agreements with local jails and is aided by the new North Carolina laws under House Bills 10 and 318.

Maine resident opens up about his journey in ICE detention, which included wedding at Texas facility

A man living in Maine who was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for weeks is sharing the wild story of how he and his fiancée got married at the Texas immigration facility where he was being held. Lucas Segobia, a Searsport resident and Brazilian native, said that back in May, he was driving to work in Bar Harbor with his friend Marcos Henrique after attending a festival out of state. Driving on the Maine Turnpike through Scarborough, they were pulled over by the Maine State Police for improper license plates.""I was asleep, my friend was driving,"" Segobia recalled. ""He said, 'Oh, the cops just pull us over,' and I say, 'Okay, what happened? What did you do? An accident?' He said, 'Nothing, I was just driving normal.'""In heavily redacted body camera footage — obtained by Segobia and shared with Maine's Total Coverage — a state trooper can be heard asking the pair for their licenses. The footage does not show exactly what was given to the officer, but Segobia had overstayed his visa, and Henrique was driving without a license.""Because you have no license, I need to give you a couple tickets, so it's going to take a while,"" the trooper said in the video.""He said, 'OK, you guys just wait here,'"" Segobia said of the encounter. ""He went to his car, and we waited, like, 40 minutes, almost an hour. And when he comes back, he comes back with the Border Patrol.""In the video, the trooper makes a few calls about the situation, including to someone who said they needed about 30-40 minutes to come ""get those guys."" About a half hour later, an official with U.S. Border Patrol arrived. When the Border Patrol official determined Segobia and Henrique did not have legal status, the official took them into custody. “On May 26, 2025, the Maine State Police requested Border Patrol assistance in verifying the identities of two individuals encountered during a traffic stop,"" a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in response to the detainments this past spring. ""Border Patrol agents determined that one of the individuals had overstayed their B2 visa, and neither had legal status in the United States. Both individuals were taken into custody and turned over to ICE/ERO (Enforcement Removal Operations) for removal.”""They arrest me and arrest my friend who was driving, and we were asking, 'Why? Where are we going?' And they don't say anything,"" Segobia recalled. ""The first moment I was like, 'OK, I'm going to get deported.' Like, I don't know where I'm going. I don't know what's happening or what's going on.""By this time, Segobia's fiancée and now wife, Laura, had arrived on the scene, but there was nothing she could do but watch her fiancé be taken away.""I was pretty frantic and was talking with both officers because I knew at that point, there's nothing in my power that I could do to convince officers to release him,"" she said. ""I was just being like, 'I need to keep track of him,' because this is the reality of our country right now, is that this is happening all over the place.""Laura and several friends made calls to try to locate Lucas, and over the next few days, he was moved around to a few facilities in Maine.""They put like nine people inside the room, inside a cell, and it's supposed to be just one, so it's really small,"" Segobia said of his time at a facility in Fort Fairfield.

""Reasonable efforts are made to provide showers for detainees who are approaching 72 hours in detention. Blankets are made available to all detainees.""Segobia said after pleading with the officers, he was able to make some calls and get in contact with the Brazilian consulate. He was also able to get in contact with Laura, thanks to a list of contacts he slipped into his shirt pocket before being detained.""When I see that I was getting arrested, I started to write numbers, to have the numbers to talk with someone,"" Segobia said. ""And I put in my clothes, my pocket of my shirt."" Laura continued to gather support, even holding a rally in Portland, sharing Lucas's story. But right before the rally, she found out he was moving to a facility in Texas. ""When I found out he was in Texas, I was like, 'I'm going,'"" she said. Laura crashed on a friend's couch in Austin for weeks and was only able to see Lucas in the facility once a week for an hour. In that time, she was able to secure an attorney, who encouraged the couple to move up their wedding date. ""One of the guards gave me a packet to fill out,"" she said, explaining the process to apply for a marriage license and request the ability to marry within the facility. ""I, Laura Anderson, drove 3,000 miles from Maine to the state of Texas on my own free will, and I am not getting paid to do this.""The couple's request was approved, and in a small ceremony at the Karnes County Immigration Process Facility in South Texas, they were married.""I mean, after I got to go have Brazilian barbecue with his mom, and I got a hotel,"" Laura joked.

""Upon considering all the evidence, the immigration judge concluded and determined that he would not pose a flight risk and that Lucas himself does not pose a danger to the community,"" Morine said. ""We do want to show the judge that this individual has a lawful pathway to obtaining status in the United States,"" she continued. ""We were able to do just that in Lucas' case, because during his time in detention, he married his wife Laura, who has been very supportive throughout this process and is a U.S. citizen, which makes him eligible for an adjustment of status.""Lucas was released and is now back home in Maine, but his legal journey is not over.

Photos appeared to show dozens of migrants wearing life jackets being brought in to Dover, Kent, aboard a Border Force vessel.

Before the weekend, no migrants had made the journey for four weeks, according to Home Office figures. The last recorded arrivals before Saturday were on 14 November, marking the longest uninterrupted stretch since 2018.

December is typically a quieter month for crossings due to adverse weather conditions, and this is thought to have contributed to the lull.

Home Office figures on the number of migrants that arrived in the UK on small boats on Saturday will be published on Sunday.

So far this year, 39,292 people have made the Channel crossing, the highest figure for any year other than 2022 when there were 45,774 arrivals.

More than 187,000 people have arrived in small boats since figures were first recorded in 2018.

The UK government has ramped up efforts to tackle small boat crossings in recent months, but the measures are not expected to have an immediate impact.

At the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would ""smash"" people smuggling gangs and cut the number of crossings by 2029.

Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met with ministers from other European nations last week to discuss reforms to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to make it easier to deport illegal migrants.

In November, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced asylum changes including making refugee status in the UK temporary and subject to review every 30 months, and sending refugees home if their country is deemed safe.

A ""one in, one out"" pilot agreed between the UK and France began in August. Under the scheme, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in Britain comes the other way.

When reached for comment, a DHS spokesperson described the partnership as ""nothing new.""

""Back in February, Secretary Noem reversed the horrendous Biden-era policy that allowed aliens in our country illegally to jet around our country and do so without identification. Under President Trump, TSA and DHS will no longer tolerate this,"" the spokesperson said in a statement provided to PEOPLE. ""This administration is working diligently to ensure that aliens in our country illegally can no longer fly unless it is out of our country to self-deport.""

Traveler information is typically provided to TSA by airlines after flights are booked for reference in the Terrorist Screening Dataset and other national security databases. Before the ICE and TSA partnership, TSA would not get involved in immigration cases or domestic criminal cases, a former TSA official said, per NYT.

It is unclear how many people have been arrested as a result of this partnership.

However, the NYT reports that the arrest and deportation of college student Any Lucía López Belloza is a result of the program. Belloza, 19, was arrested at Boston’s Logan Airport on Nov. 20, and deported to Honduras. The Babson College freshman was brought from Honduras to the U.S. when she was 7. She and her family were not aware she was subject to deportation.

Weeks before López Belloza’s arrest, Marta Brizeyda Renderos Leiva, a woman from El Salvador, was arrested at the Salt Lake City airport. Both López Belloza and Leiva’s arrests were flagged by the Pacific Enforcement Response Center, which is an office based in California that tips off ICE across the U.S. to arrest and detain immigrants, according to the NYT.

The recent report of TSA and ICE working together comes after the Trump administration has attempted to utilize other federal agencies’ databases, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).",https://people.com/thmb/SJbYQGjbcqCKHpMsQ-KQJOY12Gc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/Ice-Agent-121225-8caf750796164baaa6ea2ceccb0b25b7.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 09:57:14.884440

Sonja Hutson

If you spend a lot of time online, you may have seen videos like this one.

[VIDEO CLIP PLAYING]

Videos of people being arrested by federal immigration agents.

The Trump administration says it’s deported more than half a million people who entered the country unlawfully. It wants that number to grow dramatically. And just how government officials gather information on the people they wanna deport is changing in a big way.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

This is Swamp Notes, the weekly podcast from the Financial Times, where we talk about all of the things happening in US politics, finance and the economy. I’m Sonja Hutson, and this week we’re asking: how is the US government using private data to carry out immigration enforcement? Here with me to discuss is Peter Andringa, he’s a reporter on the FT’s visual investigations team. Hi, Peter.

Peter Andringa

Hi, Sonja.

Sonja Hutson

And we’ve also got Stefania Palma, the FT’s US legal and enforcement correspondent. Hi, Stefania.

Stefania Palma

Hi.

Sonja Hutson

So Peter, you recently published a big investigation into how the Department of Homeland Security uses this web of private contractors, data brokers and government agencies to help deport more people. What made you wanna report this story?

Peter Andringa

So some colleagues and I have been looking at federal contracts a lot this year. In part because ICE received a huge amount of money, over $75bn in the Big, Beautiful Bill that the Trump administration passed over the summer. And so when ICE is trying to ramp up its operations so quickly, it turns to contractors to deploy that money into the field as fast as it can.

So we’ve been looking at detention centres. We were looking at the deportation flights around the globe, and then later in the summer and early in the fall, I started seeing more and more videos of ICE operations on the ground, and wondering, how does any of these get organised? You know, where does the data come from? How do they find out whether someone they’ve arrested is or isn’t a citizen, or is or isn’t who they are? And so I started digging into the contracts and I was surprised to learn that there really was this huge and growing web of contracted private companies involved in piecing this whole data system together.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania, before we delve any further into Peter’s reporting, I think we should go over some definitions here. So ICE or Immigration and Customs Enforcement sits under the Department of Homeland Security. What has DHS done historically and what’s so different about this year?

Stefania Palma

So DHS was set up right after the 9/11 terrorist attacks here in the US, sort of as a response in trying to put under a single umbrella different government efforts to counter that kind of risk. But obviously since then, the agency has been involved in a string of different things, be it immigration, drugs, or human trafficking. And so by definition, given there’s no one single mandate per se, you could argue there always has been a bit of tension as to what really defines this department in terms of responsibilities. And currently under the Trump administration, just because of how important the immigration policy has become for his second term, the DHS and ICE has therefore been heavily focused on immigration and deportations.

Sonja Hutson

Well, that leads us into, you know, this particular area that you reported on, Peter. Can you give us some examples of the companies that we’re talking about here when we’re talking about the use of private data for immigration enforcement? I mean, who is ICE buying from?

Peter Andringa

So there’s a whole range of companies, but one that people will have probably heard of is a company called Palantir, which has been a vendor for ICE for a long, long time, who was often building tools that were helping with their criminal investigation. Palantir has been contracted to build a system that they’re calling ImmigrationOS that’s trying to track the identity and path. They call it the immigration life cycle of immigrants all throughout the country at all stages of their immigration process. And they’re also using that then to manage tracking down who they’re going to arrest and who they’re going to deport and watching who leaves the country.

Sonja Hutson

So Palantir is basically this kind of data synthesis company. Like, they’re bringing together all these sources of data to paint a really complete picture of how specific immigrants are moving through the country.

Peter Andringa

That’s exactly right. Palantir, you can think of as the, like, connecting layer that pulls in data from a ton of different government systems. You know, ICE has been acquiring data from the IRS and from the Social Security Administration. They’ve been buying data from data brokers — from established companies as well. Like Thomson Reuters — which is, you know, a big legal services data provider — has an investigative product called Clear, that provides all sorts of utility bills, court records, internet data, vehicle registrations that ICE can use to find data, both private and public, on individuals all across the country.

Sonja Hutson

I don’t think of Thomson Reuters as a company that would be working on this type of immigration enforcement. Palantir obviously, you know — and I think in a lot of people’s minds is really synonymous with this type of work — but it’s interesting that immigration enforcement is also working with these really household names.

Peter Andringa

Yeah, and to be clear, Palantir and Thomson Reuters didn’t comment for our investigation, and I don’t know how much the companies themselves are choosing whether or not their tools are being used for immigration. Palantir has obviously signed up to build this ImmigrationOS system, but in Thomson Reuters’ case, their tools are designed for criminal enforcement, and they sell tools to law enforcement — you know, local, state, federal — for all sorts of investigations.

Sonja Hutson

What kind of tools are we talking about here?

Peter Andringa

One of the tools that has been really, really popularly used for criminal investigations for a long time are these automated licence plate readers, which are networks of cameras across the country that ICE has bought through Thomson Reuters to be able to sort of tag different vehicles as they travel. You can look up one car as it travels from place A to place B. You can look up the whole history for that car. You could look up any car that passed the specific camera at the specific time.

And you know, historically, that’s really useful for tracing criminals across the country, or the movement of drugs or weapons or whatever it may be. Now, we see examples where ICE is using this and linking it up with the registration data and with their citizenship data in order to make more arrests and ultimately sort of feed their deportation targets.

Sonja Hutson

Do we know how many companies ICE and DHS are purchasing data from? Like how big is this web?

Peter Andringa

There’s definitely hundreds of different companies that ICE is buying stuff from, but the funny and surprising thing about it is that the dollar amounts involved are not always that large. ICE spends billions of dollars on deportations and on flights every year, and on detention centres even more. But the total surveillance that we could find for the fiscal year 2025 was only about $350mn. And so, you know, in the big scheme of things, I think one of the interesting things we discovered is how inexpensive it is to acquire these surveillance tools, and that’s in part because of the nature of the internet.

All of us have this trace data about our lives, about our social media activity, about products and services that we purchased, and that data is being sold and resold among data brokers on the internet every single day. And so, ICE and law enforcement more generally, is able to tap into those data brokers for much, much less expensive than they might have otherwise sort of had to build surveillance capabilities on their own.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania, does any of this data collection and the way it’s being used raise legal concerns?

Stefania Palma

I think definitely. I think as it often has happened in recent decades when it comes to data collection and distribution linked to the internet age, there always are legal questions.

Sonja Hutson

Hard to avoid.

Stefania Palma

Yes, exactly. And I think in this case, there have been many questions around things like confidentiality and privacy. And we saw that in one case, for instance, sort of a non-profit group and others filed a lawsuit arguing that the IRS was actually turning its back on its internal rules when it comes to protecting the confidentiality of information tied to taxpayers. And actually, last month in that case, the judge decided to halt the agreement that IRS had with ICE. It’s essentially arguing that it’s very likely that this entire set-up is in fact unlawful. So it definitely raises a lot of important questions, and ones that also have important ties to the Constitution.

Sonja Hutson

There are constitutional protections about privacy from the government. How does that change when we’re talking about privacy protections from private companies?

Stefania Palma

I think critics of, say, what ICE is doing, especially with this use of data that it is purchasing also from companies and not necessarily just from other parts of the government, definitely raises questions around the Fourth Amendment of the US constitution, which basically protects the population from untoward seizures or surveillance, essentially. And I think critics of ICE at the moment are arguing ICE purchasing this data from private companies is seen as an effort, kind of a sidestep things like Fourth Amendment rights, but also other processes that would kick in, like having to go out and seek court orders in terms of trying to get access to this information. But having these deals is sort of seen as kind of a backchannel to try and evade all of those responsibilities. And of course, this is going to be, I think, an enormous legal and constitutional question in this Trump administration.

Sonja Hutson

And Peter, you spoke to some former DHS staffers who faced similar situations under prior administrations. What did they tell you?

Peter Andringa

Yeah. I spoke with a lot of different officials from, you know, the last 20 years of work in the Department of Homeland Security, and they told me that, you know, there’s been a real administration-to-administration shift over how they treat these issues of privacy and surveillance.

The Biden administration in particular, they said, spent a lot of time carefully thinking about what types of data they could and couldn’t purchase. And one official told me that they determined that a lot of stuff was legal, that even then they thought was going to be inappropriate. And a big part of these discussions were actually two particular offices inside of DHS: the Privacy Office and the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. And these offices were constantly pushing and pulling against other parts of the department that were asking for more and more data and for more and more capabilities, and, you know, doing their best to negotiate those trade-offs and to ensure transparency was happening where it needed to.

The big change since this administration has come in, officials told me, is that these departments have really been sort of sidelined. The Department of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties went from over 130 staff to just 22. The privacy office has shrunk somewhat less in size but has shrunk in ambitions. They’ve devolved a lot of authority to sort of local component offices, and what officials told me that means is that there’s less and less oversight over how these technologies are being used. There’s fewer and fewer people internally asking the hard questions about whether a given surveillance tool is really necessary or appropriate for a given use case.

Sonja Hutson

OK, so all this investment in data, do we know what effect that is actually having on immigration enforcement?

Stefania Palma

I think one big topic of debates in this second Trump administration is what specific policy priorities are doing to how law enforcements is rolled out in this country, and I would say a lot of Trump critics, but also sort of former law enforcement officials, have continuously raised concerns around the fact that so many resources across the board are being taken away from other priorities — say, even things like, for example, at sort of the FBI, what happens when you move so much staff to focus on immigration crackdowns when you have, say, agents like the FBI that should be perhaps also, if not more, focused on preventing, say, terrorism attacks. And this is something that . . . this concern has really been growing, I think, in recent months. And there really doesn’t seem to be any signal, essentially, that the administration is choosing to go the other way, because immigration has become such a linchpin of this second presidency for Trump, and it’s, I think, politically too important for him.

Peter Andringa

Yes, Stefania is absolutely right. I spoke with a lot of officials from the Homeland Security Investigations Division of ICE, which is from the old customs enforcement side that was focused on sort of human smuggling and drug smuggling and trafficking and all sorts of cross-border crimes. And some of those officials were fans of the president and actually agreed with his immigration goals. But the thing that they raised concerns to me about was the redirection of resources away from all of the other investigations they were working on. They told me they were really concerned that crimes against children or drug smuggling or weapons would be slipping into the country without someone like them watching.

Sonja Hutson

What is DHS and the White House have to say about all this?

Peter Andringa

So we put these things both to DHS and the White House, and the White House pushed back against the idea that they’re not able to do both. They argue that they can both enforce immigration law and enforce criminal law across the country. White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson told me that narcotics seizures and human smuggling arrests are up significantly, and she described a historically secure border so that the Trump administration is making America safer than ever before.

Sonja Hutson

Stefania, what do you think comes next in this evolution of the Department of Homeland Security?

Stefania Palma

I think it’s interesting to see some of the data the DHS has put out. I think recently they came out and said that for the first year of Trump’s second term, they expect to deport a total of approximately 600,000 people, which is actually definitely below the reportedly talked about 1mn mark. So, it’ll be interesting to see what that does politically. Do they keep doubling down and doubling down, especially as obviously midterm elections are coming up?

And the question of immigration has obviously been a successful one for Trump during the general election of 2024 in a way that I think the Democratic party has found far more testy as something to navigate. However, others argue that the kinds of, say, videos that Peter included in his story, the things that the public sees in terms of the level of aggression, in terms of ICE arrests or just the unprecedented tools and legal tools used to deport individuals, may be shocking the population here in the US in a new and different way, and in turn may be spurring some Democrats to actually stand up and forcefully sort of reject all of this.

Sonja Hutson

And Peter, what about you? What are you looking out for next?

Peter Andringa

So the thing that I’ve been hearing from officials most recently, and what their concerns really laid, is in the expansion of these surveillance efforts beyond just immigration. President Trump raised a memo in September authorising law enforcement across the federal government to investigate what they call, quote, acts of political violence and intimidation, including, quote, civil disorder. And officials inside DHS told me that those sorts of declarations, while they are not themselves laws, have the effect of shaping the behaviour throughout this entire massive department. There are a lot of officials who I spoke to who are very afraid about what could happen next.

Sonja Hutson

Peter Andringa, he’s a reporter on the FT’s visual investigations team. Thanks, Peter.

Peter Andringa

Thanks for having me.

Sonja Hutson

And Stefania Palma, our US legal and enforcement correspondent. Thanks so much.

Stefania Palma

Thank you.

Sonja Hutson

All right, we are going to take a quick break and when we come back, we’ll do Exit Poll.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

We are back with Exit Poll where we ask an FT journalist one of your questions. This week we have Steff Chávez, the FT’s US defence correspondent. Hi, Steff.

Steff Chávez

Hi, Sonja. Nice to be here.

Sonja Hutson

Steff, we’ve heard from a bunch of listeners in the last couple weeks who had questions about the strikes that the US military is launching on boats that they say are carrying drugs near the coast of Venezuela. One of them is Steven from New Zealand, and he wanted to know this: what legal justification is the US government using for these strikes?

Steff Chávez

So, of course, the legality of the entire boat strikes campaign is being questioned. But in this case in particular, it’s the fact that they hit survivors. After viewing the video of the follow-up strike, which some lawmakers were able to see, Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said that it showed the US military attacking shipwrecked sailors. So the DoD’s own Law of War Manual says that shipwrecked people should not be knowingly attacked, fired upon, or unnecessarily interfered with, and that orders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal. US defence secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday said that he was briefed after this follow-up strike that the survivors were, quote, folks who could still be in the fight with, quote, access to radios. And that, quote, there was a link-up point of another potential boat; drugs were still there. So he is basically saying that those who, you know, the lawmakers are calling shipwrecked were actually, as he said, still in the fight. That seems to be DoD’s justification, that these survivors were still a threat and were still engaging.

Sonja Hutson

And of course this week, Trump administration officials said that they captured an oil tanker with ties to Venezuela. What’s the justification there?

Steff Chávez

US officials have said that the tanker was seized because it’s under sanctions for transporting oil from Venezuela and Iran in support of foreign terrorist organisations. But as we’re recording, this just happened, so things are still developing. But Trump said on Wednesday, quote, other things are happening, so you’ll be seeing that later. So this is very much developing, and there are certainly questions about whether this is a new broadside in Trump’s pressure campaign against Nicolás Maduro’s regime.

Sonja Hutson

Steff Chávez, the FT’s US defence correspondent. Thanks so much.

Steff Chávez

Thank you.

Sonja Hutson

Her husband called her and said federal immigration agents were following them.
Bullies rule by fear and violence, and that is exactly how federal immigration agents have been behaving under the Trump administration's “mass deportation” mandate.","The U.S. Senate's Permanent Committee on Investigations released a report on December 9 titled, “Examining the Trump Administration's Extrajudicial Immigration Detentions of U.S. Citizens.” It contains 22 accounts, from across 10 states, of U.S. citizens detained by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol from June to November of this year—from across the nation.

The report was released in conjunction with a shadow hearing hosted by House and Senate Democrats.

“Americans should have a hard time recognizing our great nation in these shocking, stomach turning stories of fellow Americans assaulted brutally by agents of the United States government,"" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal who authored the report and spoke during the hearing on Tuesday.

There are four new accounts included in the report relayed by U.S. Citizens who have never spoken with the media about their kidnappings. Julian Cardenas, Alberto Nila, and Ceasar Saltos were kidnapped in the area of Southern California. Their stories were shared for the first time. L.A. TACO will release a separate article, including these accounts tomorrow.

Of the 22 individuals, 11 of them were detained in the Los Angeles area including the aforementioned three: Cary Lopez Alvarado, Job Garcia, Brian Gavidia, Adrian Andrew Martinez, Javier Ramirez, Rafie Ollah Shouhed, Andrea Velez, Andreina Mejia, and her 15-year-old son.

The report does not include the testimonies of green card holders or visa recipients who have been taken by federal immigration agents. An article by Pro Publica detailed at least 170 instances of U.S. Citizens having been detained by federal immigration agents, which prompted the investigation by Senate Democrats.

L.A. TACO found that there have been at least 15 U.S. citizens detained in at least 96 “Kavanaugh Stops” in Southern California–which have been the result of the Supreme Court’s stay on the temporary restraining order on racial profiling by federal immigration agents in Los Angeles and surrounding counties.

The report describes patterns that investigators found during their interviews: Seven of the 22 individuals interviewed were held for longer than 24 hours; the detention of and reckless treatment of children; the routine use of excessive force; the denial of medical care and basic needs; violent reactions to community observers; denied claims of citizenship; the widespread use of agents using clothes to conceal their identities; causing fear; and agents fabricating assault claims.

L.A TACO has reported on the brutal detainment and initial disappearance of Adrian Andrew Martinez into federal immigration custody in June, and was the first outlet to speak with his family.

It is a term rooted in white supremacy and the ethnic cleansing of anyone who is not white. The DHS X account is home to a slew of anti-immigrant, racist, and xenophobic comments distributed by the federal agency.

DHS has lied to the U.S. public, denying claims that U.S. Citizens are being racially profiled.

It is clear in our reporting here at L.A. TACO, and in this Senate Probe, that U.S Citizens are being detained and their’ civil liberties are being violated, resulting in countless human rights abuses.

The abuse of U.S. citizens, with protected legal status, is another chilling indication that the treatment of people without legal status is significantly much worse. This past year has seen the highest rate of death in detention in decades, with three additional deaths occurring in ICE custody this month in Texas.

“The Trump Administration is seeking to build a nationwide paramilitary force with vast resources that lawlessly detains citizens based on its own whims—an effort which has a number of unfortunate and obvious historical parallels,” states the report.

Children detained by federal immigration agents

“M”, a 6 year-old child with autism, lured and kidnapped by ICE agents (September 16, 2025)

“M” was kidnapped from her family's car by armed ICE agents in Massachusetts. Agents held her on the edge of her family's lawn in an attempt to lure her parents off of their private property. Agents took her to the local police department where she fell ill and was not provided with medical treatment. When she was released she had to be taken to the emergency room for treatment, had to miss school, and now suffers from nightmares.

14-year-old zip-tied and six and eight year-olds held at gunpoint by unidentifiable men (October 19, 2025)

“I’m gonna fucking blow your head off, “ masked agents told Anabel Romero.

Romero told investigators that masked agents threatened to shoot her point-blank after she asked them to identify themselves during a violent encounter–which resulted in her children being ziptied and held at gunpoint. One of the children has special needs.

This occurred during a horse race in Idaho where Anabel Romero was confronted by masked men. Her daughter sustained bruised ribs after the men pulled her out of the truck. She and her children were held separately.

15-year-old with special needs, kidnapped at gunpoint in front of school (August 11, 2025)

“At least you’ll have an exciting story to tell when you go back to school, ” a federal immigration agent told a 15-year-old, after a case of mistaken identity.

While in the parking lot of Arleta High School, Andreina Mejia’s 15-year-old son with special needs was removed at gunpoint from her car and handcuffed by federal immigration agents. Los Angeles police officers told the federal agents to pick up the bullets they left scattered on the floor of the vehicle, and an agent told the police officers to use them to “practice their shooting.”

Cary Lopez Alvarado (June 8, 2025)

“Do you want to get killed?” an agent asked Lopez when she dialed 911 while they were attempting to detain her family members.

Lopez Alvarado was nine months pregnant and sitting in her car in Hawthorne, as part of her daily routine of leaving lunch for her husband and cousin. Her husband called her and said federal immigration agents were following them. She left her vehicle and walked over to where her family members were surrounded by unmarked vehicles and agents. She began to record, told agents they were on private property, and called 9-1-1.

She was shoved into the side of the truck, by federal agents, clutching her belly to protect her baby. She was handcuffed by agents and became dizzy. They were all taken to a location in Commerce.

Cary said that all three of them were taken in the same car to “an isolated place” in the City of Commerce and, one by one, were ordered to step out of the vehicle. An agent asked her, “That baby’s from Mexico, right?”

Officers asked her where she was born. She told them here in Los Angeles, and provided them with her social security and I.D. Agents kept her outside of the vehicle for several hours, where she told them she needed to use the bath room. Agents then told her to squat between their cars, as some agents watched.

They were taken to the LAPD Harbor Community police station in San Pedro, where she was fingerprinted and photographed while undergoing severe stomach pain. She was not released until midnight, when a DHS agent informed her they would press charges against her. She went to the hospital to be treated for her abdominal pain and loss of feeling she was experiencing in some areas of her body.

She gave birth four days later, while her husband and cousin were still incarcerated.

Javier Ramirez (June 12, 2005)

“[J]ust get him, he’s Mexican,” masked agents told Ramirez when masked agents grabbed him on private property.

Ramirez had his I.D. and passport with him inside his pocket, when he was kidnapped from his work place in Montebello, California. He is diabetic and was held for over four days. He passed out in the back of the agents' vehicles due to a combination of violent blows and the refusal of access to his medication. He was denied access to counsel and communication with his family, as well. All charges brought by federal agents were dropped against him.

Andrea Velez (June 24, 2025)

“[My mom is] probably going to wait for me to come home, and I’m never going to come home,"" Velez told senate investigators. “I thought they were kidnapping me.”

Velez was being dropped off at her workplace in Los Angeles, by her family members when she was confronted by masked agents who did not identify themselves. She had her ID in her bag. She was violently arrested and pulled into an unmarked vehicle. In detention she met another U.S. Citizen, Luis Hipolito, a 23-year-old who alleged he had been severely beaten by agents. She was detained for more than two days, and was accused of assaulting a federal agent. Her charges were later dropped.

Job Garcia (June 19, 2025)

“I got another one,” a federal immigration agent, told Garcia as they were detaining him. “None of the agents bothered to check my status,” Garcia told investigators.

Garcia was detained in Hollywood after he began to film an immigration raid at a Home Depot from a distance. He was tackled by five agents and detained. He was taken to Dodger Stadium then taken to a detention facility. Job was moved to Dodger Stadium and then a detention facility, where he was held despite having proved he was a U.S. Citizen.

Brian Gavidia (June 12, 2025)

“They see me hugging him and they embarrassed us. They were laughing and bullying us,” Gavidia told investigators, about the moment when he consoled the brother of one of his co-workers who was the target of agents’ taunting.

Gavidia was detained by DHS agents at the tow yard he works at in Montebello. Agents pushed him against a wall despite him telling them he is a U.S. citizen. Agents responded by taunting him, and looking through his cell phone. His co-worker who was also a citizen was violently taken. The encounter lasted almost an hour. Gavidias’ ID, which agents confiscated during the interaction, was not returned.

Adrian Andrew Martinez (June 17, 2025)

20-year-old Martinez was brutally detained by federal immigration agents while speaking up for an older man who was being kidnapped in parking lot of a Pico-Rivera Walmart, where he worked. He was dragged and choked into the agent's vehicle.

Days into detention, Martinez was accused of assaulting federal agents. He was detained for three days in the Metropolitan Detention Center and was denied access to a phone call. Several charges were dropped, but he is still facing a charge of conspiracy to impede a federal officer.

Rafie Ollah Shouhed (September, 2025)

“You don’t fuck with ICE. We are here,” agents told Ollah Shouhed while handcuffing him.

“I’m a United States citizen. What are you doing to me?” he replied.

79-year-old Ollah Shouhed was brutally detained by federal immigration agents during a warrantless raid on his small business in Van Nuys.”

He was thrown and held against the ground by three agents. He sustained broken ribs, trauma to his chest, cuts, torn ligaments, and a brain injury. He was denied medical care and was detained for almost twelve hours.

Wilmer Chavarria (July 23, 2025)

“[You] ha[ve] no constitutional rights at a port of entry,” U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officers told Chavarria, while detaining him at the airport following a trip to visit family in Nicaragua.

Chavarria, who is a superintendent of the Winooski School District in Vermont, was interrogated by officers for hours in an isolated room, away from his husband–whom he was travelling with.

The customs agent initially told him he had been “flagged,” but no reason was given for the interrogation. He was coerced, pressured, and aggressively threatened into handing over all of his electronics, including passwords to his personal devices and later, to the devices that were school district property, which contained sensitive information about students.

Officers denied him access to a phone call or lawyer. Officers looked through and questioned him about personal messages between him and his husband, releasing him after five hours.

The reports of brutality present in these detentions of U.S. citizens, conducted by agents of the federal government, is the physical manifestation of years of dehumanizing rhetoric directed at immigrants and non-white people by Donald Trump.

Bullies rule by fear and violence, and that is exactly how federal immigration agents have been behaving under the Trump administration's “mass deportation” mandate. The actions taken by federal immigration agents are not mistakes–they suggest the intentional targeting of Americans with ill treatment, detention, and abuse as part of the direct mission of Border Patrol, ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security.

Trump and his immigration agency cronies feel threatened by the American melting pot, and anyone who is not in line with their vision of a White nation.

This pattern of violent civil rights abuses of U.S. Citizens is a blaring alarm bell–just the tip of an egregious iceberg of violations of due process, and often lack of probable cause.

Frankly, this behavior by the federal government is shameful, embarrassing, and unconstitutional: Donald Trump doesn’t make America great, he makes it worse.",https://lede-admin.lataco.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2025/12/Shadow-Hearing-edited.png,N,,2025-12-13 12:56:57.022472

In the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, the attorneys general claim the agency implemented the large fee without proper public notice or comment. They say the high price tag flies in the face of Congress’s goals of helping U.S. employers retain highly skilled workers from other nations.

At a press conference announcing the lawsuit, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the effects of imposing the fee on California employers would be “devastating.”

“California needs more teachers, more nurses, more doctors. There is a shortage,” Bonta said. “These workers fill essential roles that keep the community running.”

The H-1B visa program was established by Congress through the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows employers to hire expert workers, often those with advanced degrees, including physicians, nurses, educators and researchers.

The program is designed to help fill U.S. labor shortages in specialized fields. But in a proclamation in September, President Donald Trump imposed a new $100,000 fee for all H-1B petitions.

By sidestepping public processes under the Administrative Procedure Act, Bonta said the Trump administration’s establishment of a new fee was unprecedented and a “direct violation of the law.”

“It was designed to dismantle the program entirely,” he said. “No president can ignore the coequal branch of government and ignore the law.”

The attorneys general also say the new policy grants the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion to decide when to exempt the fee. They say that “raises concerns that the enforcement could be applied selectively against employers disfavored by the Trump Administration.”

In a statement, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said Oregon universities depend on the H-1B visa program to fill faculty and research roles.

“Eliminating access to H-1B faculty, researchers and staff would inflict significant institutional harm, depriving students of critical educational opportunities,” he said.

In Vermont, Attorney General Charity Clark said the state relies on hundreds of H-1B visa-holders, especially in health care services.

“Vermont has an aging population, and we need health care workers and other skilled professionals to fill many of our job openings,” Clark said. “While Vermont is focused on recruiting talented professionals and welcoming new neighbors, President Trump is exacerbating the problems with unlawful and exorbitant fees.”

Before the new policy, the fee for an employer could range from $900 to $7,595 — an amount that was already difficult for some employers and institutions to pay per hire, the attorney generals claim.

They say the $100,000 far exceeds the cost to process the petitions and is an insurmountable financial barrier for all but the wealthiest, making it even more difficult to hire for hard-to-fill positions.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The coalition includes the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2021/11/dhs-hq-washington.jpg/w=1300,h=731",N,,2025-12-13 16:57:30.929189

Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.

“We know our Indian reservations were the government’s first attempts at detention centers,” said Joseph Rupnick, chairman of the Tribal Council. “We were placed here because we were treated as prisoners of war. So we must ask ourselves why we would ever participate in something that mirrors the harm and trauma once done to our people.”

A company affiliated with the tribe’s business arm signed a year-long, $29.9 million contract with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Nov. 29. The contract requested the recipient, KPB Services, which is affiliated with Prairie Band LLC, design warehouse structures on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detainees, according to a public federal contract database. Before KPB Services signed the contract, the federal government upped the dollar amount.

The Tribal Council fired members of Prairie Band LLC’s leadership Tuesday after Topeka TV station KSNT made news of the contract public the day before.

Rupnick, in a nearly 3-minute video address, said the tribe is “working on canceling this contract and fully disassociating the nation from it.”

He said the tribe risks losing future government contract awards in its efforts to extract itself from this one, but he said the tribe’s values must come first.

“I am sick to my stomach and frankly heartbroken that members of our nation put economic development — though it is sorely needed — above our moral obligations to other persecuted people,” Rupnick said.

The Tribe owns Prairie Band LLC, and Rupnick said it was created to secure employment and economic opportunities, “but it is also why we cannot compromise our values and seek to profit off the backs of our brothers and sisters in struggle.”

The second Trump administration has targeted immigrants, sometimes regardless of citizenship status or criminal history, detaining more than 65,000 people as of Nov. 16, according to ICE data analyzed by TRAC, a nonprofit data research project. Most of those people, nearly 48,000 did not have a criminal conviction.

Kansas has three facilities that house detainees and the potential for one more. Authorities at the Chase County jail in Cottonwood Falls, the Finney County jail in Garden City and the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth detain a combined average of 175 people on a given day. CoreCivic, the private prison company, is attempting to open a fourth detention center in a shuttered state prison.

Julie Zuckerbrod, an attorney representing Democrats in one of the lawsuits, argued to one of the two three-judge panels overseeing these cases that “it’s absolutely possible” for a ruling by March 1, the deadline for when these maps would have to go into effect.

Lawyers from each of the respective cases asked the panels for a March 2027 trial. Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese said the panels will make a ruling or dismiss the cases “when we can decide them.”

Democratic voters filed the first lawsuit, which argues that the current congressional district makeup packs Democrats into two districts, while Democratic-leaning communities are broken up into the other six Republican-leaning districts.

The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy’s lawsuit argues that the state’s congressional maps are an anti-competitive gerrymander, which violates the constitution. The median margin of victory for candidates in Wisconsin’s eight districts is near 30 percentage points.

“When the outcome is predetermined, it discourages challengers from running, voters from voting, and insulates politicians from their constituents demands,” according to Law Forward’s summary on the lawsuit.

Independent political strategist Brandon Scholz told NBC News that the panels are “biased.”

“Call a spade a spade,” Scholz said. “This is a partisan, political move by what’s supposed to be a nonpartisan court. It really seems like a push to have two partisan panels in place to determine redistricting on a congressional level.”

Wisconsin’s Supreme Court approved of the current district makeup in the state in 2010. The year before, Democrats held five seats. Republicans now hold six seats, with Reps. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.) and Mark Pocan (D-Wisc.) as the state’s only two Democratic representatives in the House.

Democrats are hopeful that they can unseat Reps. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisc.) and Bryan Steil (R-Wisc.) in 2026. Kind told Wisconsin Public Radio in September that they both risk losing their seats due to their support for Trump’s agenda.

The lawsuit in federal court in Boston is at least the third to challenge the fee announced by Trump in September, which dramatically raises the cost of obtaining H-1B visas. Currently, employers typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office said in a release that Trump lacks the power to impose the fee and that it violates federal law, which allows immigration authorities to collect only fees necessary to cover the cost of administering visa programs.

The H-1B program allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields. The tech industry, with many companies headquartered in California, is particularly reliant on workers who receive the visas.

Bonta, a Democrat, said the $100,000 fee would create unnecessary financial burdens for providers of vital services such as education and healthcare, exacerbating labor shortages and threatening to cut services.

The states joining California in the lawsuit include New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey and Washington.

The White House, in response to other lawsuits, has said the new fee is a lawful exercise of Trump’s powers and will discourage employers from abusing the H-1B program.

Critics of H-1B visas and other work visas say they are often used to replace American workers with foreign employees who will work for less. But business groups and major companies have maintained that workers on H-1B visas are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the country’s largest business lobby, and a coalition of unions, employers and religious groups have filed separate lawsuits challenging the fee. A judge in Washington, D.C., is set to hold a hearing in the Chamber’s lawsuit next week.

Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made the $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to existing H-1B holders or those who applied before September 21.

Trump in the order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to U.S. interests.

Bonta’s office said on Friday the $100,000 fee far exceeds the cost of processing H-1B petitions, rendering it unlawful. It added the U.S. Constitution bars Trump from unilaterally imposing fees to generate revenue for the United States, a job that is reserved for Congress.

Abrego Garcia currently can’t be deported to his home country of El Salvador thanks to a 2019 immigration court order that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past few months, government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

Abrego Garcia is fighting his deportation in federal court in Maryland, where his attorneys claim the administration is manipulating the immigration system to punish him for successfully challenging his earlier deportation.

Here’s what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite the earlier court ruling.

When Abrego Garcia was deported in March, he was held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

The Trump administration initially fought efforts to bring him back to the U.S. but eventually complied after the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in. He returned to the U.S. in June, only to face an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was held in a Tennessee jail for more than two months before he was released on Friday, Aug. 22, to await trial in Maryland under home detention.

His freedom lasted a weekend. On the following Monday, he reported to the Baltimore immigration office for a check-in and was immediately taken into immigration custody. Officials announced plans to deport him to a series of African countries, but they were blocked by an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland.

On Thursday, after months of legal filings and hearings, Xinis ruled that Abrego Garcia should be released immediately. Her ruling hinged on what was likely a procedural error by the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019.

Normally, in a case like this, an immigration judge will first issue an order of removal. Then the judge will essentially freeze that order by issuing a “withholding of removal"" order, according to Memphis immigration attorney Andrew Rankin.

In Abrego Garcia's case, the judge granted withholding of removal to El Salvador because he found Abrego Garcia's life could be in danger there. However, the judge never took the first step of issuing the order of removal. The government argued in Xinis' court that the order of removal could be inferred, but the judge disagreed.

Without a final order of removal, Abrego Garcia can't be deported, Xinis ruled.

The only way to get an order of removal is to go back to immigration court and ask for one, Rankin said. But reopening the immigration case is a gamble because Abrego Garcia's attorneys would likely seek protection from deportation in the form of asylum or some other type of relief.

One wrinkle is that immigration courts are officially part of the executive branch, and the judges there are not generally viewed as being as independent as federal judges.

“There might be independence in some areas, but if the administration wants a certain result, by all accounts it seems they’re going to exert the pressure on the individuals to get that result,” Rankin said. “I hope he gets a fair shake, and two lawyers make arguments — somebody wins, somebody loses — instead of giving it to an immigration judge with a 95% denial rate, where everybody in the world knows how it’s gonna go down.”

Alternatively, the government could appeal Xinis' order to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and try to get her ruling overturned, Rankin said. If the appeals court agreed with the government that the final order of removal was implied, there could be no need to reopen the immigration case.

In compliance with Xinis' order, Abrego Garcia was released from immigration detention in Pennsylvania on Thursday evening and allowed to return home for the first time in months. However, he was also told to report to an immigration officer in Baltimore early the next morning.

Fearing that he would be detained again, his attorneys asked Xinis for a temporary restraining order. Xinis filed that order early Friday morning. It prohibits immigration officials from taking Abrego Garcia back into custody, at least for the time being. A hearing on the issue could happen as early as next week.

Meanwhile, in Tennessee, Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case where he is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling.

Prosecutors claim he accepted money to transport, within the United States, people who were in the country illegally. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

Abrego Garcia has asked U.S. District Court Judge Waverly Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

Crenshaw earlier found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive” and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on a Fox News Channel program that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a0dc3335-5c32-4393-b13f-32109629f9ae/wirestory_c6f255d11c8ce09be5e67a8df3de2f64_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-13 04:56:25.068179

Over Noncitizen Licenses,"Karoun Demirjian, www.nytimes.com, karoun-demirjian",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/us/politics/transportation-dept-threatens-to-withhold-funds-from-ny-over-noncitizen-licenses.html,"He called the state “the worst offender” for issuing commercial driver’s licenses to foreign nationals without sufficient proof of their long-term work authorization.
Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrs have based their criticism of New York on a federal audit of 200 non-domiciled commercial licenses.
Mr. Duffy has been criticized for focusing his efforts on states led by Democratic governors.
Together, the two states issue over half of the country’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses, he said.
“You don’t just drive in New York if you get a New York commercial driver’s license.","The Trump administration threatened on Friday to withhold tens of millions of dollars in highway funds from New York unless the state rescinded commercial driver’s licenses issued to people not authorized to work in the United States.

New York is the latest state to come into the cross hairs of the Transportation Department as the Trump administration attempts to prevent undocumented immigrant drivers from operating trucks and other large vehicles requiring commercial driver’s licenses. Last month, California agreed to revoke the driving credentials of some 17,000 foreign nationals after coming under similar pressure.

But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took special aim at New York at a news conference on Friday. He called the state “the worst offender” for issuing commercial driver’s licenses to foreign nationals without sufficient proof of their long-term work authorization. He also threatened to pull $73 million in federal highway funding unless officials paused issuing all non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and learner’s permit and voided the active licenses of any immigrants found to be driving without legal work permits. The state was given 30 days to respond to the administration’s demands.

Derek D. Barrs, the administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, added that if New York failed to act within 30 days, the state could also lose its certification to issue any commercial driver’s licenses.

New York’s commercial driver’s license standards, he charged, represented “a systematically grossly unacceptable deviation from federal safety regulations.”

“When improper licenses are issued, safety is compromised,” he added.

In a statement, Walter McClure, a spokesman for New York’s Department of Motor Vehicles, accused federal transportation officials of “lying about New York State.”

“Here is the truth: Commercial drivers licenses are regulated by the federal government, and New York State DMV has, and will continue to, comply with federal rules,” he said.

“This is just another stunt from Secretary Duffy, and it does nothing to keep our roads safer,” he added.

Mr. Duffy and Mr. Barrs have based their criticism of New York on a federal audit of 200 non-domiciled commercial licenses. They said more than half of those license-holders no longer had proper authorization to work in the United States and cited examples in which they said New York had issued credentials to foreigners who didn’t have proper work authorization at the time of their application.

Using that evidence, they questioned whether New York had verified the immigration status of the approximately 32,000 people holding active non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses holders from the state. They also pointed out that the state regularly issued noncitizen commercial driver’s licenses that were valid for eight years, even if applicants did not have work visas that lasted that long.

“They’re not verifying the legal status of that individual,” Mr. Duffy said, arguing that New York was not routinely checking applicants’ passports or visas to verify their continued work eligibility.

Mr. McClure, the New York D.M.V. spokesman, countered that every commercial driver’s license was “subject to verification of an applicant’s lawful status through federally issued documents reviewed in accordance with federal regulations.”

The Trump administration has been pursuing a variety of initiatives to prevent certain immigrants from procuring commercial driver’s licenses. Earlier this year, Mr. Duffy’s department added a nationwide requirement that truckers meet new English-language proficiency standards. Earlier this month, his department revoked the accreditation of thousands of training centers where he said drivers improperly received their licenses.

The centerpiece of the effort, however, has been the department’s effort to pressure certain states to revoke licenses for noncitizen drivers already on the road, largely by threatening to withhold critical highway funds. The urgency around the effort increased after an August crash in Florida, in which an immigrant holding a California-issued commercial driver’s license and accused of being in the country without authorization killed three people after making an illegal U-turn.

Mr. Duffy has been criticized for focusing his efforts on states led by Democratic governors. But he argued on Friday that the threats to California and New York were just about numbers. Together, the two states issue over half of the country’s non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses, he said.

“You don’t just drive in New York if you get a New York commercial driver’s license. You drive around the country,” Mr. Duffy said. “These unqualified drivers operate in every single state, so everybody’s at risk,” he added.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/12/multimedia/12trump-news-ny-funds-topart-blzc/12trump-news-ny-funds-topart-blzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:56:54.709133

These executive orders are what the lower courts are enjoining and what the Supreme Court is upholding.
If the Supreme Court turns more of these executive orders into formal and final law, we will have a new constitution very soon.
But it is the Supreme Court – packed for years by extremist Republicans – that is the activist, partisan, and rogue court.
I believe that danger becomes less scary when it is better understood – so learning all I can about systems in danger is a way to cope.","Last week, we published the results of our Judicial Resilience Project, in which we used scenarios to analyse how authoritarian populists would seek to attack the independent judiciary in Germany. Our study shows that the judiciary in Germany is more vulnerable than often assumed. From numerous international examples and an extensive body of research on “judicial backsliding”, we know that the strategies authoritarian populists employ to pressure, delegitimise, and ultimately capture judicial systems repeat themselves in strikingly similar ways. Few scholars have described these dynamics as profoundly as Kim Lane Scheppele, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Sociology and International Affairs in the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs and the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University. We talked to her about the state of the US judiciary, determining tipping points, and how to cope with the daily darkness of democratic backsliding.

1. Dear Kim, in the United States, courts have been among the most important and active bulwarks against Trump’s executive aggrandisement. At the same time, they have themselves become the target of massive attacks. Adding to this is the fact that the Supreme Court, as a court that has already been packed and politically skewed, has by and large supported Trump’s agenda. How would you assess the state of judicial independence in the United States at the end of 2025?

We have a decidedly mixed picture of judicial independence in the US. So far, the lower courts are mostly holding the line against autocracy, but the Supreme Court is actively pushing consolidation of power in the executive on all questions that come to it. Trump’s executive orders and lawless actions have generated more than 500 lawsuits (not counting all of the individual immigration cases). In nearly 170 of those cases, lower courts have issued injunctions stopping Trump from doing what he proposed – and those injunctions are still holding. But in the 30 or so cases that have gone all the way to the Supreme Court, that Court has lifted the injunctions and let Trump destroy laws, agencies, careers, and norms while the cases are pending. This has resulted in massive destruction of the US government, which, if the plaintiffs win in the end, cannot be easily rebuilt. Those of us who care about democracy shudder every time a new case gets to the Supreme Court, but some of what the lower courts are doing will hold – and I have been impressed that so many of these judges (including judges appointed by Trump in his first term) have been holding the line even when they are threatened by Trump.

2. The judiciary’s experience also shows that Donald Trump does not proceed subtly or gradually. He is confrontational by “flooding the zone”. Violating the law does not restrain him; on the contrary, he considers himself above the law. Some argue that Trump therefore goes beyond what you described as “autocratic legalism”. It has now been nearly a decade since your seminal article: Has the phenomenon evolved over time?

Trump is and is not quite an autocratic legalist. On the “is” side, Trump has signed more than 200 executive orders creating new law and instructing his minions to enforce it. These executive orders are what the lower courts are enjoining and what the Supreme Court is upholding. If the Supreme Court turns more of these executive orders into formal and final law, we will have a new constitution very soon. Textbook autocratic legalism. On the “not quite” side: Trump has unleashed a reign of terror in American cities under the guise of enforcing immigration laws and preventing crime. But these actions are totally lawless as masked federal officers kidnap people off the streets and disappear them into an inhumane detention system. In addition, Trump has also governed by whim in both domestic and foreign policy. So Trump mixes legalistic and terror-inducing strategies of control. Because Americans are standing up to the reign of terror, however, Trump may be prevented from engaging in legal autocratic capture, which he might otherwise have succeeded in accomplishing.

3. A central feature of judicial backsliding is delegitimising the judiciary as elitist, partisan, or too slow. All too often, these narratives gain traction because they contain a grain of truth. Criticism of the judicialisation of liberal democracies is not new, but it has resonated more strongly in recent years. To what extent are courts themselves, at least in part, contributing to the problem?

Trump has been attempting to delegitimize the judiciary by calling lower court judges activist, rogue, and partisan, and his supporters in Congress have threatened impeachment of judges. But it is the Supreme Court – packed for years by extremist Republicans – that is the activist, partisan, and rogue court. Trump, like most autocrats, claims that the people have put him there (though sometimes he says that God did it). But in the land of 50/50 elections, where polling is ubiquitous, and Trump’s popularity sits in the mid-30-percent favourability range, it’s hard to claim supermajority support. That doesn’t stop him, however.

Attacking the judiciary for being anti-democratic is, of course, an old rogue argument. And if by “democratic” you simply mean that the current occupant of the office is elected, then saying judges are anti-democratic makes sense. But if you think about democracy as the potential to change leaders at the next election, then that shifts the debate over how democracy is defended. If courts try to keep pathways open for democratic rotation if the voters want that, then courts defend – rather than undermine – democracy.

4. In 2013, you concluded your commentary on “The Rule of Law and the Frankenstate” with a plea for a “forensic legal analysis”: the systematic use of “what-if questions” to expose the vulnerable points of constitutional orders. With our Judicial Resilience Project, we put forward a methodological framework that allows such institutional stress tests to be carried out prospectively and transparently. We found that working with scenarios and combining comparative, doctrinal, and qualitative analysis is particularly effective. This approach allows us to anticipate authoritarian-populist strategies and thus prepare more effectively. What continues to occupy us, however, is how to determine when a system is beginning to tip. What indicators allow us to pinpoint institutional “points of no return” – including in today’s US judiciary?

It’s wonderful that you are thinking holistically because constitutions are meant to work as a system and not as a checklist. So, looking at the relationships among the parts is precisely the way to go. And using scenarios for institutional stress tests is brilliant!

So how does one tell when a system is beginning to tip from democracy into dictatorship? Most of the autocratic takeovers in recent years have occurred when an elected leader attacks the institutions and rules that prevent him from governing by whim. So, the main point of focus should be on the executive and the pattern of actions that this executive undertakes. One or two actions to evade checks on power may be simply enthusiasm; more are signs of danger.

Pay special attention to constitutional “resonant frequency” points – that is, the point where threats are boosted to the point where they destroy the integrity of the thing threatened. The best historical example comes from Germany in 1933, where the parliament was first dissolved and then a state of emergency declared, when the only check on an abusive emergency declaration was the (now dissolved) parliament. The best modern example is the Hungarian constitution, which permits amendment with a single two-thirds vote of the unicameral parliament in a system where the election law makes gaining a two-thirds majority very possible.

5. Many of us find it taxing to engage daily with the ways in which liberal democracies are currently – and may in future be – under threat. How do you cope with this personally? What motivates you to continue researching, explaining, and warning? And how can we protect ourselves and others from the impact that this unrelenting doom and gloom can have on our emotional state and mental health?

I believe that danger becomes less scary when it is better understood – so learning all I can about systems in danger is a way to cope. Staring danger in the face is itself energizing and generates the energy to keep going. Yes, it is exhausting sometimes, but looming dictatorships often generate better political humour, so I really appreciate and collect political cartoons.

But here’s the best part: Times like this also create tremendous solidarity among those who work together to push back against dictatorship. I’ve made so many great friends fighting autocracy in Europe, and now have new friends in the US who are all in for fighting autocracy here. Some of the best people you’ll ever get to know are the ones who take the current threats as a call to action. For example, I’ve been honoured to get to know those of you on the Judicial Resilience Project!

Even the cover is a statement: two men kissing, sweating, living in and for the moment. But the photo – taken in 2002 by Wolfgang Tillmans in a London club – is misleading. While Douglas Stuart’s latest novel Young Mungo does revolve around homosexual love, its setting could hardly be more removed from a gay party. Readers follow 15-year-old Mungo through 1990s Glasgow, an environment sharply at odds with his empathetic nature: his mother is severely alcoholic, and his brother leads a criminal youth gang. This despair manifests physically in Mungo as a tic: whenever he feels uncomfortable, his face twitches. Beyond these everyday hardships, terrible things happen to Mungo – some scenes are tough to take in. Relief comes only when Mungo encounters someone around whom he no longer feels uneasy, someone who makes his face stop twitching. By the end, one can’t help but despair a little over his story. It left me, at least, with a gentle sadness.

The Week on Verfassungsblog

summarised by EVA MARIA BREDLER

In Germany, we do not abduct people from the streets like KIM LANE SCHEPPELE reports for the US. But a notion of “we” is readily invoked here too, including in debates on migration. Some call for “us” to “finally speak more honestly” about migration and crime. Who exactly is this “we”? CHRISTIAN WALBURG (GER) reconstructs the discourse and offers reassurance: there are gaps, but the picture of a dominant tendency in the discourse to downplay migration and crime does not reflect reality.

States don’t just construct a discursive “we”; they also create a legal one, separating citizens from others – and those who fall through all the cracks become stateless. After months of devastating violence in Gaza, several Western states recognise Palestine, while Germany continues to resist. SENOL BECIROVSKI (GER) explores what this means under residence law for the stateless Palestinian diaspora in Germany, concluding that recognition would be largely symbolic and would not solve their legal problems – it might even make them worse.

Sweden is also narrowing its own “we”. There, a law is planned that could revoke previously granted permanent residence permits for asylum reasons. REBECCA THORBURN STERN (ENG) explains the context of Swedish migration policy and the serious risks the bill could pose for non-citizens.

EU-wide minimum standards are also under pressure in the migration debate. The European Commission has just launched the first Annual Migration Management Cycle, a concrete step towards implementing the New Pact on Migration and Asylum. The pact promises a better balance between solidarity and responsibility than under Dublin III. But HANNAH PÜTTER und SALVATORE NICOLOSI (ENG) already see early signs that the new system could increase mistrust between Member States, restricting both fundamental rights and access to asylum.

Solidarity is also central to the proposed Reparations Loan, which would use frozen Russian state assets to support Ukraine. The European Council will discuss it in December. Belgium has been the loudest critic, calling it a disguised confiscation. What’s really at stake? PETER VAN ELSUWEGE (ENG) explains the risks.

For a more open form of confiscation, the German government has now put forward a draft law: whether paralysed airports or spied-on infrastructure, drone sightings are increasing – yet it is unclear who is allowed to shoot them down. FINN PREISS and LAURIDS HEMPEL (GER) analyse the draft and explain why no constitutional amendment is needed.

Another controversial draft comes from the Federal Ministry of Justice: the Criminal Code is to be amended to strengthen protection against so-called knock-out drops. HANS KUDLICH and MUSTAFA TEMMUZ OĞLAKCIOĞLU (GER) see no need: existing law already covers these situations and allows for heavy penalties.

There is, however, an undisputedly urgent legislative need at the EU level in another context. For fifteen years, the EU has seemed powerless as Viktor Orbán, the “predator of press freedom,” systematically undermined the media. Most recently, Swiss media group Ringier sold its entire Hungarian portfolio to Indamedia, a government-aligned group that already controls 18 online publications and platforms. KATI CSERES and ANA-CATERINA CIUSA (GER) are now hopeful: the recently adopted European Media Freedom Act could finally protect media freedom and pluralism effectively.

This week, we have also concluded our two symposia.

In her contribution to “The European Convention on Human Rights at 75: Transnational Perspectives and Global Interaction” (ENG), NICOLA WENZEL looks at the right to a healthy environment and warns that superficial comparisons overlook the ECtHR’s rich case law — and risk losing key nuances in translation. JANNIKA JAHN examines how divergent approaches to climate-related obligations unfold across regional systems, UN bodies, and the ICJ, with particular attention to the contours of the European approach. DANA SCHMALZ argues that those attacking the ECtHR for an over-reaching jurisprudence regarding migrants’ rights misconstrue the actual case law. DANIEL THYM outlines four scenarios for the future development of the case law and the possibilities for transformation. ARNFINN BÅRDSEN argues that moving forward, it is necessary to take into account both the inherent features of the technology and the rights that come under pressure by our use of it, mapping out what a potential approach of the ECtHR could look like. MARIA PILAR LLORENS chimes in, warning that when implementing AI tools, Human Rights Courts must ensure that they do not compromise the very rights they are tasked to protect. VERONIKA FIKFAK and LAURENCE R. HELFER add on to this by predicting that more fundamental changes to the process of international human rights adjudication – including at the ECtHR –may ultimately be required. BAŞAK ÇALI celebrates 75 years of the Convention in a personal voice, as a child of this Convention. Closing the symposium, JÖRG POLAKIEWICZ sees us facing two truths as the ECHR turns 75: first, the extraordinary resilience of that promise; and second, the magnitude of the challenges still before us.

We also closed the debate on “Algorithmic Fairness for Asylum Seekers and Refugees”. BEN HAYES looks at the OHCHR’s forthcoming guidance on human rights-based digital border governance and identifies where such guidance can help, and where a significant shift in current State practice is needed. NATALIE WELFENS shows how automation, outsourcing, and fragmented accountability reshape rights protection in migration governance, showing through a case study that existing regulatory frameworks remain insufficient. NIOVI VAVOULA discusses the results of the symposium in a concluding afterword.

So who is this “we” and whom can it hold? Are we also the algorithms we use? KIM LANE SCHEPPELE has reminded us that constitutions work as a system, not as a checklist. What matters is looking at the relationships between the parts. That seems to me a pretty good answer to that question: we should not forget the space in between all our multiple “wes”.

The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments last week about the 2022 agreement governing how U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement can arrest immigrants besides those being specifically targeted in an operation. The consent decree has been in the spotlight amid the Trump administration’s Chicago-area immigration crackdown that’s led to more than 4,000 arrests.

WATCH: Federal judge sharply criticizes immigration crackdown tactics in Chicago

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings, who found the government violated the agreement, ordered the release of more than 600 immigrants on bond, which the appeals court paused. Roughly 450 remain in custody, attorneys say.

In the 2-1 opinion, the appeals court said Cummings overstepped his authority on the blanket release of the detainees without assessing each case individually. The consent decree “carefully maps out what the district judge can or cannot order” to balance enforcement and public safety, according to the opinion. But the ruling also said the Trump administration wrongly categorized all immigrant arrestees as subject to mandatory detention.

Plaintiffs’ attorneys said they were disheartened by the ruling but glad the court upheld the extension of the agreement, which among other things requires ICE to show documentation for each arrest it makes. Federal judges elsewhere including in Colorado have also ruled to limit warrantless arrests.

Attorneys pushed for a quick decision, saying many are being deported without knowing their options. The hundreds of detainees, mostly from the Chicago area, were arrested from summer through the early weeks of the “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration crackdown in the fall. Attorneys have said they have collected information on hundreds of more people they believe were also improperly arrested.

“We will work tirelessly to ensure that people who were unlawfully arrested will be able to return to their families and communities as soon as possible,” said Keren Zwick with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

A message left Thursday for the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned.

The consent decree, which expired earlier this year, was extended until February. The federal government tried to challenge the extension in court.

The agreement was originally reached between immigrant rights groups and the federal government following a lawsuit over 2018 immigration sweeps. It applies to immigrants arrested in six states covered by the ICE field office in Chicago. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Wisconsin.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/2025-11-08T211934Z_831840506_RC2HSHAW1ELS_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-IMMIGRATION-CHICAGO-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:56:58.802507

Also finds 287(g) agreements do not authorize Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals solely on the basis of a civil ICE detainer request

December 12, 2025 (SAINT PAUL) — The Minnesota Attorney General’s Office issued a formal legal opinion today about 287(g) agreements, which are agreements state and local governments may enter into with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to authorize state or local law enforcement officers to perform certain immigration duties. The opinion finds that Minnesota law does not permit sheriffs to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE unilaterally and that the authority to enter into such agreements rests with county boards of commissioners. The opinion also states that 287(g) agreements do not permit law enforcement agencies to detain individuals solely on the basis of a civil ICE detainer request if state law does not otherwise authorize law enforcement to detain them.

Under State law, the Attorney General’s Office may issue a legal opinion upon the request of a limited number of public officials or bodies. The Attorney General’s Office produced today’s opinion on the request of Ramsey County Attorney John Choi, who asked the Office for an opinion on whether Minnesota sheriffs may enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE, and whether such agreements permit local law enforcement officers to detain persons who would otherwise be released from custody pursuant to civil immigration detainers from ICE.

The opinion first reviews what authority the state grants to sheriffs to sign agreements. State law permits sheriffs to enter into contracts to provide police services to towns and cities but does not grant sheriffs the authority to sign such agreements with the federal government. The fact that lawmakers enacted a detailed statute regarding contracts by sheriffs for providing law enforcement services to cities and towns but did not provide for similar contracts with the federal government, implies that the omission of federal contracts is intentional.

Next, the opinion reviews the Minnesota Joint Exercise of Powers Act (the “Joint Powers Act”), which governs agreements between government entities for the cooperative use of their powers. The Joint Powers Act stipulates that contracting parties may only jointly exercise powers “common to the contracting parties or any similar powers.” Since Minnesota sheriffs lack the authority to enforce immigration law absent a 287(g) agreement, they cannot enter into such agreements due to this commonality requirement.

The opinion then notes that, while sheriffs cannot enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE unilaterally, their county board of commissioners can. Subdivision 8 of the Joint Powers Act creates a limited exception to the commonality requirement for counties whereby a county board of commissioners is allowed to enter into an agreement with any other unit of government to “perform on behalf of that unit any service or function which that unit would be authorized to provide, ”allowing a county board of commissioners to vote to enter into a 287(g) agreement.

The opinion then addresses whether operating under 287(g) agreements permits Minnesota law enforcement to detain individuals for the purposes of immigration enforcement. A February 2025 opinion of the Attorney General’s Office found that Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someone based solely on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be required under state law to be released from custody. The previous opinion, however, did not examine whether the presence of a properly executed 287(g) agreement would allow for state and local law enforcement agencies to extend detention for immigration purposes. Today’s opinion addresses that question and concludes that 287(g) agreements do not give local law enforcement officers any broader authority under state law than they otherwise have; that they do not permit state law enforcement from effecting arrests or detentions that would otherwise not be permitted under state law; and that officers operating under a 287(g) agreement must comply with Minnesota arrest law.",https://www.ag.state.mn.us/_Img/Logo_SM.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 04:56:33.290698

(AP) — A pair of lawsuits seeking to redraw congressional boundary lines that currently favor Republicans in Wisconsin are on track to be resolved after the 2026 midterms, even as attorneys for one case argued Friday in court that there’s still time to enact new maps for the November election.

Court hearings in both cases came the day after Indiana Republicans soundly rejected President Donald Trump’s demand that they redraw congressional lines in that deep red state. Trump is waging a national redistricting battle as he tries to preserve a slim Republican majority in the House in next year’s elections.

WATCH: Indiana Republican explains why he defied Trump and rejected congressional redistricting

An attorney for Democrats who brought one of the Wisconsin challenges argued for the panel to issue a ruling by around March 1, the deadline given by the state elections commission in order to have new maps in place.

“It’s absolutely possible,” Julie Zuckerbrod, an attorney with the liberal Elias Law Group, told a three-judge panel in support of the more aggressive timing.

But Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese pushed back on the pressure to act quickly.

“We’ll decide them when we can decide them,” she said of the pending motions to issue a ruling or dismiss the case without further arguments.

Attorneys for Wisconsin’s six Republican congressmen and other conservative defendants pushed for a schedule that would not result in a trial until March 2027.

“Seeking relief in time for the 2026 election would be unfair,” said Kevin LeRoy, an attorney for the congressmen.

The three-judge panel in that case will first decide early next year whether to dismiss the case or rule in favor of those who brought it without further argument.

Both of the Wisconsin cases are before newly assigned three-judge panels, the first time that process has been used under a 2011 law enacted by Republicans. The dual hearings on Friday afternoon were two hours and two floors apart in the same courthouse, just blocks from the state Capitol.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court last month ordered that the redistricting cases be first heard by the three-judge panel over objections from Republicans.

The three-judge panel hearing the case brought by a bipartisan coalition of business leaders set a potential trial date for April 5, 2027, if the case survives a motion to dismiss.

Any final rulings of those panels on the merits of the cases can be appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

The Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy argues in its lawsuit that Wisconsin’s congressional maps are unconstitutional because they are an anti-competitive gerrymander. The lawsuit notes that the median margin of victory for candidates in the eight districts since the maps were enacted is close to 30 percentage points.

“In a 50-50 state, it makes no sense that 75% of Wisconsin seats in the House of Representatives are controlled by one party,” Law Forward said in a summary of its lawsuit on its website.

The other case, filed on behalf of Democratic voters, contends the current maps discriminate against Democrats. They do so by packing a substantial number of Democrats into two districts while breaking up other Democratic areas into six Republican-favorable districts.

In 2010, the year before Republicans redrew the congressional maps, Democrats held five seats compared with three for Republicans. Republicans hold six of the state’s eight U.S. House seats, but only two are considered competitive.

The current congressional maps, which were based on the ones drawn in 2010, were approved by the state Supreme Court when it was controlled by conservative judges. The U.S. Supreme Court in March 2022 declined to block them from taking effect.

A top target for Democrats is the western Wisconsin seat held by Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden. He won in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Ron Kind retired. Van Orden won reelection in the 3rd District in 2024.

The other seat Democrats are hoping to make more competitive is southeastern Wisconsin’s 1st District, held by Republican Rep. Bryan Steil since 2019. The latest maps made that district more competitive while still favoring Republicans.

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today condemned a gross attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Tullos, Louisiana, after Maximiliano Perez-Perez, a criminal illegal alien, savagely bit the officer’s hand while resisting arrest. He is facing charges for assaulting law enforcement.

During the arrest, Perez-Perez attempted to flee by pushing officers. He used his teeth as a weapon and clamped down on an ICE officers’ hand, breaking the skin and drawing blood.

Perez-Perez entered the United States at an unknown date and time and without being inspected or paroled by an immigration officer.

“This criminal illegal alien is being charged with assault after he savagely bit a law enforcement officer in an attempt to evade arrest. DHS law enforcement is facing a 1,150% increase in assaults against them and an 8,000% increase in death threats. This is the reality of what our ICE officers are facing every day as they go to work to simply do their job and enforce the law,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “Many of these assaults, including biting and vehicle rammings, are happening as a direct result of sanctuary politicians encouraging illegal aliens to evade arrest.”

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Rep. Omar demanded immediate answers regarding Operation Metro Surge, an ICE deployment to the Twin Cities that has resulted in widespread racial profiling, unlawful arrests of U.S. citizens, excessive force, and violations of constitutional rights.

Rep. Omar’s letter cites multiple documented incidents in which ICE agents detained people who had identified themselves as U.S. citizens, mocked a woman for wearing a hijab, used pepper spray on bystanders, and refused to provide warrants while carrying out arrests near homes, schools, and a university campus. The New York Times also reported that approximately 100 ICE agents were deployed to Minnesota, at significant taxpayer expense.

In a second letter sent to Secretary Noem, Rep. Omar led Members of Congress in demanding a full explanation of the administration’s threat to abruptly terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali nationals in the United States.

Earlier this month, President Trump publicly claimed he would end TPS for Somalis “effective immediately,” and DHS officials echoed these statements despite a longstanding federal law governing TPS designations. Somalia has been designated for TPS since 1991 due to ongoing humanitarian crises. Ending TPS would put lives at risk and tear apart families who have lived, worked, and contributed to our communities for decades.

The letter, co-led by Representatives Adam Smith(WA-09), Joyce Beatty(OH-03), Betty McCollum (MN-04), Angie Craig (MN-02), Yvette Clarke (NY-09), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Jared Golden (ME-02), Kelly Morrison (MN-03), and Chellie Pingree (ME-01), requests detailed explanations of the legal basis for terminating TPS, the administration’s assessment of current conditions in Somalia, consultations with humanitarian experts, and the potential consequences for regional stability.

As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse.”

Smith called detention conditions appalling.

“No one should be subjected to overcrowded cells, denied medical care, or held in facilities that profit off of human suffering,” he said. “This legislation establishes the oversight and guardrails needed to end these abuses and ensure that people are treated with dignity.”

Since Trump’s return to office, more than 66,000 people have been held in immigration detention, with nearly three-quarters having no criminal convictions. During this time, 23 detainees have died. Reports describe severe overcrowding, inadequate food, withheld medication, and the return of family detention, despite longstanding concerns about harm to children.

CBC News reports: “The House [of Commons] only passed four bills this fall sitting — that includes the supplementary estimates, which need to pass every sitting to keep the government operating. [Members of Parliament] quickly got two bills through the third reading shortly after question period on Thursday [December 11]: C-12, the government’s border security bill, and C-4, which primarily would bring the Liberals’ income tax cut officially into law. Both will now head to the Senate. The government was able to pass the ‘Lost Canadians’ legislation last month.”

The Migrant Rights Network opposes C-12, the Strengthening Canada’s Immigration System and Borders Act. They highlighted: “This bill would allow mass deportations, deny refugees protection, and share sensitive info with foreign governments.” They had also noted: “[This bill] threatens migrant and refugee rights and expands government surveillance.”

It does not appear that Bill C-9, the Combatting Hate Act, passed. Today, The Canadian Labour Congress stated: “Parliament should not pass this Bill without considerable amendment. As drafted, the Bill threatens labour rights, fundamental freedoms, the right to protest, and public accountability.”

Prior to this fall sitting, Bill C-5, the One Canadian Economy Act, passed the House of Commons in June 2025. We continue to watch C-5 as well as the yet-to-be-passed Bill C-2, the Strong Borders Act.

Ecojustice has commented: “Bill C-5 sets a dangerous precedent. It gives sweeping and potentially unconstitutional powers to the federal Cabinet to bypass environmental laws and legal safeguards. The Bill allows decisions to be made about ‘national interest’ projects with little public participation, without robust environmental impact assessments, and without the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples.”

Greenpeace Canada has also explained: “Bill C5 (the Building Canada Act) is likely going to result in a new round of grassroots opposition from Indigenous land defenders and environmental activists to resource extraction projects fast-tracked under the new legislation.”

And they noted: “Bill C2 (the Strong Borders Act) grants the federal government new warrant-less surveillance powers that are not restricted to border-related issues, but can be used any time there is even a suspicion that any Act of Parliament might be contravened.”

Greenpeace further highlights: “The history of RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] surveillance and repression of land defenders (particularly but not exclusively Indigenous) suggest that these powers will be misused.”

We are also watching MP Jenny Kwan’s Bill C-233.

The Canadian Press has reported: “Her private member’s bill C-233, which she’s calling the “No More Loopholes Act,” would add new oversight requirements to exports of parts and components, end permit-free access to the United States for military goods and require companies to obtain end-use certificates from foreign governments. …Debate on the bill is expected to resume in the new year, likely in February.”

PBI-Canada has commented that Bill C-233 would complement the Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act in the protection of defenders that is backed by the PBI-Honduras accompanied Lenca organization COPINH.

Ilhan Omar, calling her “garbage,” and Somalia, the nation she came from, “barely a country.” These words reflect a continued effort to revive race and origin as tools to divide and dictate policy.

In 2017, Trump’s Muslim Ban targeted multiple Muslim-majority nations, including Somalia, under the guise of “national security.” In 2018, he asked why the United States should accept immigrants from “shithole countries,” instead of “places like Norway.” In 2019, he told four U.S. citizens — women of color in Congress, including Rep. Omar — to “go back” to the countries they came from.

Branding African nations as “shithole countries” and Somalia as “barely a country” perpetuates centuries-old narratives that frame majority-Black nations and Black people as inferior and undesirable. Trump’s threat to “permanently pause migration” would disproportionately target African nations, echoing the racial quotas of the 1920s and reinforcing a hierarchy that places whiteness at the center of American belonging. This is the same ideology that once justified slavery, Jim Crow and immigration laws crafted to keep Black people out of America’s promise.

How the History of American Citizenship is Rooted in Anti-Black Policies

Trump’s recent words are part of a long pattern of messaging. His infamous racist slogan, “Make America Great Again,” is a continuum of the Ku Klux Klan’s “America for Americans,” and President Calvin Coolidge’s declaration that “America must remain American,” which then, as now, is a coded affirmation of racial violence and hierarchy that reflects a vision of “America” rooted in whiteness, Anglo-Saxon heritage and Protestant norms.

While the Naturalization Act of 1790 established the rules for U.S. citizenship, it explicitly limited naturalization to “free white persons,” excluding Black Americans and other non-white individuals. This was a deliberate attempt to block enslaved persons and their descendants from laying claim to the land they were forced to live on and cultivate, fueling systemic discrimination and violence for generations. Seventy-six years later, the 14th Amendment introduced and sanctioned birthright citizenship as a corrective to anti-Black exclusion, finally guaranteeing citizenship to all people born on American soil.

However, Trump continues his futile attempt to rewrite history through a lily-white lens. His anti-immigration agenda seeks to undermine a constitutional principle rooted in racial justice. These efforts reveal how immigration policy has long been entangled with anti-Blackness and structural racism, not only through exclusionary laws, but also through narratives that criminalize Black immigrants and erase their contributions. Institutional racism embedded in immigration laws and enforcement has resulted in persistent inequitable outcomes.

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned Chinese immigrants outright. Later laws, like the Immigration Act of 1917 and the Immigration Act of 1924, went even further, banning immigrants from large parts of Asia and setting quotas that favored Europeans. African immigration was almost impossible because quotas were based on existing U.S. populations, where Africans were barely represented due to earlier anti-Black policies.

How Racial Justice Fueled More Humane and Equitable Immigration Laws

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 removed explicit racial restrictions from immigration law. However, meaningful change only accelerated two years later with Brown v. Board of Education, when the concept of “separate but equal” was legally dismantled. In this instance, collective action challenged entrenched racism and expanded access to rights and opportunities for people of all races, helping spark what would be known as the Civil Rights Movement, which continues to this very moment in history. Fear-driven policies harm everyone, while inclusive policies — such as public education, healthcare access and economic stability — benefit all communities.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 followed the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, dismantling the racist quota system and laying the foundation for modern immigration policy that opened doors to immigrants from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Today, immigrants comprise nearly 14 percent of the U.S. population, compared to 5 percent in 1965. This shift has enriched American culture, fueled economic growth, and reinforced civil rights principles by embedding racial equality into immigration law.

While Trump attempted to disparage Rep. Omar and her racial background, her story embodies long-championed American ideals, demonstrating how resilience, opportunity and inclusion can transform lives. She fled civil war in Somalia, became a U.S. citizen and now serves in Congress. Her presence represents the promise of America: that refugees and immigrants not only contribute to, but are, in fact, the foundational pillars of, democracy and leadership

Why Immigration and Racial Justice are Foundational to Democracy

With the barrage of racialized insults and inflammatory language over the last decade of Trump’s rhetoric, it can be tempting to dismiss them for the sake of our collective sanity. But these words are designed to erode our sense of what is acceptable, making harmful actions more likely. We cannot afford to be complacent.

When language is weaponized to erase racial justice and cement racial hierarchy, the very foundation of justice begins to crack. This fascist rhetoric seeks to resurrect the ghosts of Jim Crow and carve inequality into the bedrock of our nation. But as Rep. Omar’s personal history attests, America’s strength lies in its diversity of all human experiences and backgrounds. The days of this country’s legalized caste system are over.

We no longer dream of an inclusive America. We demand it, we build it, and we will not settle for anything less than justice and inclusion for all. The National Immigration Law Center recognizes and asserts that people of all communities — especially those living at the intersections of race, gender, sexuality and ability — are people of inherent value.",https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DACA-ACABlog-Image-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 21:57:36.251263

In New Orleans! A city that for centuries has collected drifters from Europe and dreamers from the Caribbean and schemers from Central America and prisoners from Africa, and has molded all of their descendants into a culture unmatched anywhere else in this plastic country. A city with its own city-sized Vietnamese population. A city that built a statue in Crescent Park to honor the Latino workers who rebuilt it after Hurricane Katrina. You want to bring a bunch of white racist clods in clownish tactical gear to run the immigrants out of New Orleans? The city of gumbo metaphors?

You villains. You dirty dogs.

The entire concept makes the skin prickle in reprehension. Yet here we are. ICE and CBP goons, balaclavas emphasizing the penis-like nature of their heads, have descended on New Orleans. Led by unapologetic Border Patrol boss Gregory Bovino, whose fascist high top haircut and affinity for dark double-breasted trenchcoats cross the line from “unintentionally Nazi-esque” into “Nazi on purpose,” they are all over the streets of America’s Friendliest City, vowing to deport 5,000 (!) people in the name of Purifying America’s Blood or some more publicly acceptable euphemism for that purpose. This is Operation “Catahoula Crunch,” which sounds like an AI-generated name for a Louisiana breakfast cereal. In the first three days of raids, they arrested 38 people, fewer than a third of whom had criminal records. Clearly, the motherfuckers are going to be here for a while. I went to take a look.

This article was originally published on the “how things work”substack. subscribe here for more of Hamilton nolan’s great work!

Friday night, hundreds of drunk kids staggered down Tulane University’s fraternity row, celebrating their football team’s conference championship. Inside a church a few blocks away was more serious business. Fifty or so people filled the pews. Projected on the wall was a slide that read “Solo el pueblo salva al pueblo.” Only the people can save the people. Only we can save us.

This was a training for Ojos, an ICE-watching project aligned with an immigrant support group called Unión Migrante. (Though ICE is only one of the agencies carrying out the raids, their name has become synonymous with this sort of persecution, and they are universally used as shorthand for la migra, the catchall term for immigration police.) As in Los Angeles, and Chicago, and North Carolina, New Orleans has, in a short time, built a remarkably sophisticated region-wide network of citizens ready to film the dirty dogs doing their work. There was an Ojos training like this every single night of the week in different neighborhoods around the city. Here, the regular people learned what they can do in the face of the terror.

The trainers told the crowd how to properly record ICE spottings: date and time, description, exact cross streets. This information can be spread instantly through a network of both citywide and neighborhood-specific group chats that hundreds or perhaps thousands of New Orleanians now participate in. If agents try to arrest someone in Metairie or Algiers or the Mid City or the West Bank, someone will see or hear and this information will in very short order be spread and investigated and verified and then posted online by Unión Migrante, the definitive source that immigrants can use to learn where the danger is today. For an effort that is run completely by volunteers and dependent on the zeal of regular, unpaid citizens, it is a fairly spectacular underground intelligence service.

The training featured an unwieldy role-playing exercise, with 20 people playing roles ranging from teachers to passersby to Ojos watchers, which mirrored the chaos of the actual work. (Those picked to play ICE officers seemed a little unhappy, but they did their duty.) All of us got little Ziploc bags with a whistle the size of a bullet that can be used to alert anyone within several square blocks of a raid in progress. For more than two hours, this earnest group of teachers and tattooed 20-somethings and retirees and musicians and business owners learned how to be cops on the side of righteousness. Then they took their places back in their city and waited for the feds to make their next move.

Once you get into it, the odd similarity between watching cops and being a cop is hard to miss. The primary method that Ojos uses is training enough volunteers that wherever something happens, someone plugged into their network is very likely to be nearby. But this will always mean that the bad thing has already happened once it gets reported. The most useful version of ICE watching would be to be able to track the agents, to monitor them in real time, to serve as an early warning system, to ruin their element of surprise. This is a much trickier proposition.

You could park your car outside the entrance of the Naval Station in Belle Chasse that the agents are using as their headquarters and try to track them when they emerge each morning. But they can be hard to identify, and even harder to follow. They have the assistance of local and state police as well—one Ojos activist was pulled over twice in one day by a Louisiana State Police officer demanding that he stop driving in the vicinity of a convoy of CBP vehicles.

Alternately, you could make an educated guess about where la migra might show up, go there in advance, and drive around hoping to catch them, becoming a funhouse mirror version of a cop patrolling a high crime area. I tried this myself one day. I spent hours driving around Kenner, a working-class New Orleans suburb out by the airport that has so far been the target of more immigration raids than anywhere else in the area. For hours on a rainy Saturday, I circled down Veterans Boulevard and up Williams, stopping at the obvious places where ICE tends to pop up. I went to all three Walmarts in the Kenner area. I went to Lowe’s. I went to Home Depot. I did not see any immigration officers, but I did see Spanish-speaking families out shopping in stores that had translated their signs into Spanish, but had conspicuously not taken any actions to indicate that they disapproved of their customers being kidnapped on their property. Contrast this with small businesses across New Orleans that have posted fliers on their doors declaring that ICE is not welcome there. It makes you think about corporate responsibility, and cowardice, and things of that nature.

Without two-person teams—one to drive, and one to navigate and monitor the chat and alerts and social media in real time—constantly on patrol in each neighborhood hot spot, it takes luck to catch officers in the act. Nor is it easy to know if you are parked right next to one. They tend to roll around in big American-made SUVs. Now go look at a Home Depot parking lot. See any big SUVs there, maybe with a burly guy wearing a baseball cap inside? Yeah. Everywhere!

I found myself peering hard at anyone who fit the profile. I hovered, camera ready, by an oversized white SUV with tinted windows and crash bars parked in front of Walmart, until the doors opened and an elderly Latino couple emerged. In downtown New Orleans, I crept up on a group of a half-dozen brawny white guys with beards, until it became clear that it was a group of gay tourists. Add to this the flood of well-intentioned people sharing rumors online—my friend saw a suspicious car parked outside this hotel, I wonder if they’re staying there?—and it becomes clear that ICE watching is a long game, and an imperfect science. It will require grace from all of us. As a white guy who looks a little bit like I could be a cop, I accept any future sideways looks I get as my tiny sacrifice for the cause.

Considering the challenges, Unión Migrante and Ojos are shockingly effective. Every day they blast out multiple sightings, photos, and videos, all verified and confirmed. Over time, it is likely that this kind of community intelligence will save lives and prevent some families from being torn apart. And, on a much shallower level, it is just satisfying to watch a video of an activist filming agents desperately trying to be inconspicuous in a parked SUV, walking by them and drawling, “I’m with Neighborhood Watch. You guys good? You guys need any help?”

The people of New Orleans are also registering their pissed-off-ness by holding protests against the immigration action on a near-daily basis. I went to one on Saturday night, on the steps of the Hale Boggs federal courthouse on Poydras Street. There were many “CBP OUT OF NEW ORLEANS!” signs and fliers for a teach-in about general strikes and constant honks of support from passing cars. A billboard for Zatarains loomed picturesquely across the street. A couple of right-wing Youtube trolls also attended, prancing around in front of speakers and shouting pro-deportation slogans and aggressively shoving cameras in unwilling people’s faces and generally acting like dickheads. One of these people, a weak-chinned MAGA darling named Nick Sortor, harassed a woman so insistently that a scuffle broke out. In any other setting, he would have gotten his ass kicked, but the security volunteers went out of their way not to do so, just trying to steer him away from people over and over as he cried about being assaulted. All of this while people who were immigrants and who faced very real risks of life-changing government oppression were giving brave and heartfelt speeches just steps away. It really drove home how rude Nazis are. Their own repulsive, racist glee indicts them more effectively than any outside critics ever could.

Before the spotlight descended on New Orleans this month, many had been toiling quietly for years trying to insulate immigrants from the predations of America’s deportation system. One of those people is Angela Davis—not the famous one who wrote Are Prisons Obsolete?, but an attorney who has spent the past decade running Project Ishmael, a nonprofit that gives legal support to immigrant children. In an office above a church off Canal Street, Davis told me that today’s outrages are different only in degree from what has come before.

She has done this work during the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations. Though the work has changed, she said, “Under every single one of those presidents, many, many families are being separated, torn apart, and detained. That has not changed. The immense cruelty of the U.S. immigration system has been consistent.”

Under Biden, at least, her clients with Special Immigrant Juvenile status were able to get “deferred action,” a temporary protection that made it easier for them to work and live here while their applications for lawful permanent residency were processed. In April, the Trump administration ended deferred action and began arresting people, including some of Davis’s clients. Though Project Ishmael’s services are in high demand, it is harder for them to take on new cases now, because every single case requires so much more work than it did when the government was somewhat less hostile.

To have militarized raids layered on top of the bureaucratic hurdles adds an almost surreal level of hardship to New Orleans immigrants’ lives. “People are scared to leave their home,” she says. “We’ve all read Anne Frank, and have very clear images of what it looks like to be in an attic afraid of forces of terror out in your streets. And that is what it is like. Something not too dissimilar.” Davis carries on with her work, though she admits that she has doubts about how faithfully the government will adhere to the rule of law. “There are still wins in courts, and some of them are still enforceable. There are also many things the government just doesn’t follow,” she says.

On my way out, she gave me a copy of the organization’s summer newsletter. In it was a story that a client from Honduras had written in her own words about her experience as an immigrant. She entered the country in 2018, and was imprisoned and separated from her five year old daughter for a month and a half. After being released and reunited, her son joined them here, and she has been dutifully going to all of her immigration appointments for the past seven years. Then, in May of this year, ICE put an ankle monitor on her to track her movements, and began demanding she go to more appointments, making it hard for her to earn enough money to survive. She began living in fear that ICE would track her down and arrest her on the street if she went out.

“If they did that, they could send you away without your children, so it was better for me to leave the United States. I feared for my life returning to Honduras, but I feared being separated from my children again more. I know the United States is about opportunity and I am grateful for my time here, but life is also too stressful and exhausting,” she wrote. She made the decision to risk her life and leave America, rather than risking losing her family. “On our flight back to Honduras, there were five families with me who had deported themselves.”

This, from our current government’s perspective, is a success story. To harass and persecute and terrorize a mother so fiercely that she chooses to bring her children back to an impoverished country where they may be killed is the best possible outcome that Stephen Miller and Gregory Bovino and their nationwide army of masked raiders could hope for. This is what they are about. This is what they accomplish. This is what their legacy will be. This is what they will have to declare at the gates of heaven, or hell.

The most memorable video from the New Orleans immigration sweeps is one taken last week in a residential neighborhood in Kenner, which instantly became famous. It shows federal agents with rifles surrounding a house where men are repairing a roof. As the cops hop out of their cars and approach, one of the roofers snatches the ladder and yanks it up, setting up an hours-long standoff between the agents on the ground and the men working above, unwilling to come down. The men on the roof reportedly got away in the end.

The symbolism in that clip is almost too perfect: hardworking immigrants escaping deportation by pulling up the ladder behind themselves. But I’m pretty sure that the ICE and CBP agents, all children of people who were immigrants at one time or another, are too dumb to see it.",https://www.currentaffairs.org/hubfs/fuck-ice-nola.webp,N,,2025-12-12 23:56:36.499098

In Onondaga County, 42 of the 161 people arrested by ICE were from Ecuador, 27 from Guatemala and 17 from Cuba, and over 80% were men. The data shows 114 of those were deemed “other immigration violator” and 47 had pending criminal charges or criminal convictions. Thirty-six of the 114 without criminal charges have been deported to their originating countries.

The data from the Deportation Project doesn’t include arrests by U.S. Border Patrol agents, so Cayuga County is listed as only having eight ICE detainments even though 57 were detained in Cato following the raid, and Oswego County has five. There is data available on the number of arrests by Border Patrol, but it isn’t broken down by county.

There are eight counties that have 287(g) agreements that allow local law enforcement agencies to work with federal agents, according to ICE's website. Broome, Madison, Nassau, Steuben, Otsego and Niagara all have warrant service officer agreements, meaning that local law enforcement officers can execute administrative immigration warrants on people in their jail systems.

Along with the warrant service agreement, Nassau, Steuben and Niagara counties have task force 287(g) agreements that allow local law enforcement to make immigrant arrests during routine police activities. Cattaraugus County and Camden Police Department, a city department in Oneida County, also have this type of agreement in place.

In 2024, Cattaraugus County had zero ICE arrests but from January to October of 2025, they’ve had 10.

Rensselaer County has a jail enforcement model agreement that allows correctional officers in local jails to interrogate people about their immigration status and notify federal agencies.

On Sept. 4, Cayuga County Sheriff’s deputies worked with federal agents to assist with traffic outside of a raid at the Nutrition Bar Confectioners factory in Cato. The county does not have a 287(g) agreement in place, but following the raid, Sheriff Brian Schenck said they have had a relationship with Border Patrol agents since 2009.

This process will explicitly target individuals from the 19 travel ban countries, including Iran, and even applies to approved green card holders who received their permanent residence since 2021.","The Trump administration is enacting major, discriminatory and open-ended changes to the immigration system.

On November 27, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published a memo announcing a new guidance allowing for negative, country-specific factors to be considered when vetting individuals from the 19 countries targeted in the June travel ban (PP 10949). A few days later, on December 2, USCIS published another memo announcing an indefinite pause on all immigration applications filed by individuals from the travel ban countries. These policy changes are clearly and blatantly based in discrimination on the basis of national origin, and must be halted.

The impact of these harmful, bias-driven policies is already being deeply felt by members of the targeted communities, including Iranians. Application of these new policies will lead to many already-vetted visa holders, along with green card holders, being arbitrarily denied benefits and potentially even arrested and deported by ICE.

Reports have revealed that naturalization interviews and citizenship ceremonies have been abruptly canceled over the last week. Some reports indicated that officers directly asked individuals attending a naturalization ceremony at Faneuil Hall in Boston, MA what country they were from, “and if they said a certain country, they were told to step out of line and that their oath ceremonies were canceled.” This kind of direct targeting is based entirely on national origin, and it is deeply alarming and anti-American.

Likewise, The New York Times detailed how Iranian-born Raouf Vafaei, who has been in the U.S. for eight years, was just days away from being sworn in as a U.S. citizen when he received a four sentence email informing him that his ceremony was canceled. Vafaei described feeling excited for his ceremony, and that his mother even purchased a new dress for the event. However, now it remains unclear when he will reach this key milestone of securing citizenship in the land he is proud to call home. NIAC has likewise received many similar reports from members of the community.

In recent weeks, Iranians who have filed applications for various immigration benefits have also reported receiving Notices of Intent to Deny noting that Iranian heritage is now considered a negative factor. The letters state “USCIS has determined that the positive discretionary factors do not outweigh the country-specific negative discretionary factors USCIS has identified in your request for a change of status.”

NIAC has also heard from Iranians who described living in limbo for years awaiting progress on a visa application only to have their interviews canceled with no indication as to when they will be rescheduled. Additional stories shared with NIAC include asylum applicants who fear what will happen given the administration’s indefinite pause on asylum claims. These changes have left many Iranians in deep uncertainty regarding their futures, putting them at risk of losing job offers, student slots and even putting them at risk of potential arrest and deportation.

In tandem with its recent policy changes, USCIS also announced the creation of a specialized unit dedicated to revisiting past, approved immigration screening and vetting. According to the agency, the unit will “draw on the full spectrum of classified and nonclassified screening and vetting capabilities and provide a more thorough supplemental review of immigration applications and petitions.” Tasked with reviewing both pending applications as well as with re-reviewing approved applications, this unit will turn the recent policy changes into active harm.

Hundreds of thousands of individuals could be put at risk by these recent changes. As stated in the Dec. 2 memo, USCIS will provide a list of individuals for review, interview, re-interview, and referral to ICE and other law enforcement agencies within 90 days. This process will explicitly target individuals from the 19 travel ban countries, including Iran, and even applies to approved green card holders who received their permanent residence since 2021. The memo notes that the re-interview process will be applied to anyone deemed “unable to establish their identity,” which could be interpreted very broadly, given that the June travel ban declared screening and vetting in the targeted countries deficient. It is not clear what will happen to the individuals who are on the forthcoming USCIS-generated list, and if they will be at risk of near-term arrest.",https://niacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/niac-new-favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-13 01:56:50.074876

The framework rescinds the 2024 CBA between TSA and the American Federation of Government Employees, the agency said.
But in response to longstanding concerns about TSA attrition, then-TSA Administrator David Pekoske in 2022 issued a determination that expanded collective bargaining at the agency to mirror the bargaining rights under Title 5.
TSA and AFGE then negotiated and signed a seven-year collective bargaining agreement last year.
The agreement established a streamlined process for grievance and arbitration, expanded official time, fewer restrictions on sick leave, increased uniform allowances and opportunities for local collective bargaining.","The Department of Homeland Security is again moving to rescind a collective bargaining agreement with Transportation Security Administration employees, despite an ongoing court case over DHS’ prior move to eliminate the TSA union agreement.

In a Dec. 12 press release, TSA announced that a new “labor framework” would be implemented starting Jan. 11, 2026. The framework rescinds the 2024 CBA between TSA and the American Federation of Government Employees, the agency said.

TSA said the decision is based on a Sept. 29 determination by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, “Eliminating Collective Bargaining at TSA Due to its Incompatibility with TSA’s National Security Mission and its Adverse Impact on Resources, Flexibility, Mission Focus, Security Effectiveness, and Traveler Experience.”

TSA said Noem’s determination — which it did not release — “establishes that employees performing security screening functions … have a primary function of national security and shall not engage in collective bargaining or be represented for any purposes by any representative or organization.”

Noem also determined that collective bargaining for TSA officers “is inconsistent with efficient stewardship of taxpayer dollars and impedes the agility required to secure the traveling public,” according to the agency statement.

“Our Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) need to be focused on their mission of keeping travelers safe not wasting countless hours on non-mission critical work,” Adam Stahl, senior official performing the duties of TSA deputy administrator, said in the press release. “Under the leadership of Secretary Noem, we are ridding the agency of wasteful and time-consuming activities that distracted our officers from their crucial work.”

AFGE quickly criticized TSA’s announcement. AFGE represents approximately 47,000 airport screeners under the CBA.

“Merely 30 days ago, Secretary Noem celebrated TSA officers for their dedication during the longest government shutdown in history,” AFGE National President Everett Kelley said as part of a statement. “Today, she’s announcing a lump of coal right on time for the holidays: that she’s stripping those same dedicated officers of their union rights.”

AFGE noted that a federal judge earlier this year blocked DHS from dissolving the collective bargaining agreement. The union had brought the lawsuit in response to a previous determination issued by Noem that sought to dissolve the CBA.

In granting the preliminary injunction in June, the judge presiding over the case wrote that Noem’s previous attempt to dissolve the CBA “appears to have been undertaken to punish AFGE and its members because AFGE has chosen to push back against the Trump Administration’s attacks to federal employment in the courts.”

That ongoing case is currently scheduled to go to trial next September.

Kelley said AFGE “will continue to challenge these illegal attacks on our members’ right to belong to a union.” He also urged the Senate to pass the Protect America’s Workforce Act “immediately.”

TSA staff don’t have the same statutory rights as other federal employees under Title 5 of U.S. Code. But in response to longstanding concerns about TSA attrition, then-TSA Administrator David Pekoske in 2022 issued a determination that expanded collective bargaining at the agency to mirror the bargaining rights under Title 5.

TSA and AFGE then negotiated and signed a seven-year collective bargaining agreement last year. The agreement established a streamlined process for grievance and arbitration, expanded official time, fewer restrictions on sick leave, increased uniform allowances and opportunities for local collective bargaining.

In a statement today, AFGE Council 100 President Hydrick Thomas called the decision to revoke the CBA a “slap in the face” to TSA employees

“Prior to having a union contract, many employees endured hostile work environments and workers felt like they didn’t have a voice on the job, which led to severe attrition rates and longer wait times for the traveling public,” Thomas said. “Since having a contract, we’ve seen a more stable workforce, and there has never been another aviation-related attack on our country.”

In its statement, TSA said that agency policy will govern “employment matters previously addressed by the 2024 CBA, and TSA policy will provide for alternative procedures to ensure that employee voices are heard and that legitimate concerns are resolved quickly.”

“An immigration judge (IJ) denied Jovita Cruz-Lopez’s application for cancellation of removal, but granted her request for voluntary departure.
The IJ found that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the statutory standard of ‘exceptional and extremely unusual hardship’ to a qualifying relative—a showing necessary to warrant cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C.

“An immigration judge (IJ) denied Jovita Cruz-Lopez’s application for cancellation of removal, but granted her request for voluntary departure. The IJ found that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the statutory standard of ‘exceptional and extremely unusual hardship’ to a qualifying relative—a showing necessary to warrant cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. §1229b(b)(1)(D). Cruz-Lopez appealed the IJ’s decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), and also moved for termination of the proceedings on the basis that she was served with an allegedly defective Notice to Appear.

“The BIA dismissed the appeal and denied the motion to terminate. Before this court, Cruz-Lopez challenges only the denial of her application for cancellation of removal. For the reasons set forth below, we DENY the petition for review.

“Cruz-Lopez is a citizen of Mexico who unlawfully entered the United States in 1999. She has one child, Eduardo, who is a United States citizen. At the time of the hearing before the IJ in August 2020, Eduardo was 19 years old and worked part-time as a line cook. Eduardo and CruzLopez live with Cruz-Lopez’s sister, as well as the sister’s husband and son. Cruz-Lopez believes that Eduardo would not move with her if she is removed to Mexico.

“During the hearing before the IJ, Cruz-Lopez presented documentary and testimonial evidence in support of her contention that Eduardo will suffer emotional and economic hardship if she is removed. The IJ ultimately found that the alleged hardship did not rise to the level of being exceptional and extremely unusual. Cruz-Lopez timely appealed to the BIA, which agreed with the IJ that Cruz-Lopez had failed to meet the hardship standard. This timely petition for review followed.

“We have not yet decided exactly what level of deference we should give to the BIA’s conclusions on this issue. But we need not resolve that question here because, under any level of deference, Cruz-Lopez cannot establish that Eduardo will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.

“The primary issue before us is whether the IJ and the BIA properly concluded that Cruz-Lopez failed to establish that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to her child, Eduardo. We hold that the IJ and the BIA did not err in so ruling.

“For all of the reasons set forth above, we DENY Cruz-Lopez’s petition for review.”",https://milawyersweekly.com/files/2022/03/MILW_weblogo.png,N,,2025-12-12 18:58:07.033752

The letter claims the hospital ""may be failing to adhere to its HIPAA obligations and its own policies."" Spokesperson for ONA, Peter Starzynski, told KATU that because of this, patients are being put at risk.

""Legacy is not treating ICE the same way they are treating other law enforcement or what is consistent with their policies,"" Starzynski said during an interview with KATU News. ""We believe, and our members believe, that ICE needs to be held accountable when they bring detainees into Legacy hospitals.""

According to Starzynski, nurses have been reporting ICE officials bringing detained people in for medical treatment. ""Most law enforcement, if it's PPD or others, when they enter a hospital, have their badges and identification clearly visible for everybody to see who they are. That has not been the case with ICE. It's been hard to sometimes distinguish ICE from other folks.""

Because of this, nurses say they need immediate action to be taken to help ensure safeguards are in place. This includes what ONA calls ""an ICE credential-verification log"" for agents who come to the hospital.

""Their badges or IDs have not been visible. Even at times, Legacy has made temporary badges that say Legacy Security that ICE is using to affix to them,"" Starzynski said.

Starzynski says he's not able to share why detainees are coming in seeking treatment while in ICE custody.
