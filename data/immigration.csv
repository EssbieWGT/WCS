By Vanguard Staff

SAN FRANCISCO – A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to comply with his earlier ruling restoring Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans and Haitians after the government failed to update its systems and blocked TPS holders from re-registering. The order marked another dramatic turn in a high-stakes case that has left hundreds of thousands of immigrants in limbo.

On Friday, Judge Edward M. Chen ruled that the administration’s actions stripping humanitarian protections from more than a million Venezuelans and Haitians were unlawful. Despite that decision, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website continued to state that TPS for Venezuela had been “terminated.” In court filings, the government further argued it had no obligation to comply with the judge’s ruling because it claimed the order was not yet in effect.

During an emergency hearing in San Francisco, Judge Chen flatly rejected that position. “The order was effective immediately,” he said. His ruling made clear that the administration’s refusal to act was not only unlawful but had already caused harm. He directed the government to update the USCIS website by 5 p.m. Friday to reflect the court’s ruling and ordered officials to reopen TPS registration for Venezuelans for 24 hours.

Declarations filed in court illustrated the human consequences of the administration’s failure to comply. TPS holders described losing jobs, being detained, and even facing possible deportation despite still being legally protected under federal law.

“On Wednesday, I lost my job because the government’s website still said that TPS was terminated,” said Noelia, a former Amazon employee. “I even sent them a copy of Judge Chen’s order, but they would not accept it on its own. I hope that today’s order means that I can get my job back so I can support myself.”

Attorneys for the plaintiffs also argued that the government effectively removed the option to register online for TPS for Venezuela during most of the final day of registration, sparking panic among TPS holders. They said the portal was disabled for a significant part of September 10, which was the final day to register under the earlier Mayorkas extension. The government’s attorney acknowledged that the outage occurred but blamed it on a “coding error.”

Judge Chen found that explanation inadequate and concluded that the government’s actions had unlawfully deprived Venezuelans of the opportunity to maintain their status. He ordered that the registration portal must be reopened for at least 24 hours and that Venezuelans who register during this time will be considered to have registered on time. He also required the government to notify plaintiffs’ attorneys at least four hours in advance of reopening the registration window.

In his written order, Chen rejected the government’s claim that it had an automatic stay that excused it from following the ruling. He clarified that the final judgment “went into immediate effect” and emphasized that failing to implement the order would render it meaningless. He further wrote that even if there had been ambiguity, the court had the authority to make the ruling immediately effective, and he was exercising that authority.

Immigrant rights advocates and community leaders celebrated the decision. “The National TPS Alliance was outraged by the government’s refusal to comply with the court’s order. The court made clear again today that the law must be respected,” said Jose Palma, coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, the lead plaintiff in the case. “We will continue to organize our community to fight for TPS and permanent protections.”

Jessica Bansal, an attorney with the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, called the administration’s argument “troubling, to say the least.” She said, “We are pleased the court rejected it and directed DHS to recognize the ongoing validity of Venezuela’s TPS designation.”

Others said the case underscored how much was at stake for immigrant families. “People’s futures are hanging in the balance, and the Trump administration is playing games with their lives and the rule of law,” said Emi MacLean of the ACLU of Northern California. “Court orders are not optional. Human beings are not political pawns.”

Adelys Ferro, executive director of the Venezuelan American Caucus, said that while the decision was a victory, it was only one step in a longer fight. “Today, once again, justice prevailed. Our fight is far from over, but we will face one battle at a time, together with our brothers and sisters of the National TPS Alliance,” she said. “Venezuelans don’t have a safe country to return to, and we depend on our TPS status to provide us refuge in the United States.”

The ruling highlighted the ongoing tension between the judiciary and the Trump administration on immigration policy. The court’s order not only compels immediate compliance but also requires transparency. Judge Chen instructed the government to file a declaration explaining the so-called “technical problem” that shut down the TPS registration portal on the final day, noting the importance of documenting the issue for the record in case of an appeal.

The decision also reaffirmed that the court sees TPS as more than an administrative measure—it is a legal safeguard that protects immigrants from instability, persecution, or unsafe conditions in their home countries. By insisting on compliance, Judge Chen underscored that federal agencies must respect judicial authority, even as the administration pursues its immigration agenda.

For TPS holders, the ruling provides a temporary reprieve but does not end uncertainty. Advocates say the long-term solution must be permanent protections rather than repeated cycles of litigation.

The plaintiffs in the case are represented by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the ACLU Foundations of Northern and Southern California, the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the UCLA School of Law, and the Haitian Bridge Alliance. Together, they said they will continue pressing for stronger protections and permanent status for TPS holders across the United States.

“This kind of racial profiling is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,” Cortez Masto said.
People are taking inventory of how similarly they line up with “the stereotype that the Supreme Court is targeting here,” he said.
Though she harshly criticized the conservative members of the Supreme Court, Cortez Masto said she wasn’t in favor of expanding the court should Democrats regain control of the White House and Congress.
Citing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cortez Masto said the court shouldn’t be playing politics.","The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for federal agents to stop and detain people based on race, language or even where they work — at least for now. In freezing a lower court’s ruling against the practice, the justices last week signaled a broader reach beyond Los Angeles, sparking alarm that Nevada and other states could soon feel the effects.

“Instead of taking that potential exit ramp on the road to increasing armed aggression against communities, the Supreme Court has basically greenlighted it,” said Michael Kagan, director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic. “When (immigration enforcement agents) do this again in Chicago or Las Vegas or any other community in the country, it would seem a key tool that might have helped constrain the government … has been taken away.”

Kagan and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., both said the order, despite the case being far from over, is already having a chilling effect among Latino Nevadans.

The 6-3 decision, issued Monday without a majority opinion, allows President Donald Trump’s administration “to racially profile and detain anyone they want,” said Cortez Masto, a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. That includes citizens, she said.

“This kind of racial profiling is unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment,” Cortez Masto said. “We have to shine a light on it. We have to make sure that the American people understand what is going on as well. It’s not just our leaders in Congress that need to take a stand. It is all of us.”

U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., shared a similar sentiment in a statement, saying “immigration enforcement that relies on racial profiling is unconstitutional, un-American and immoral.”

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, denied Monday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was targeting people based on “skin color, race or ethnicity.”

Whether it’s a colleague, friend or student, Kagan said he’d had many conversations this past week with people “incredibly scared about” the court’s decision. People are taking inventory of how similarly they line up with “the stereotype that the Supreme Court is targeting here,” he said.

Some of the Latino students that Kagan said he had spoken with don’t fit some of other traits agents can stop people over: They speak “unaccented” English and aren’t in a blue-collar job.

While concerned about themselves, that cohort is more preoccupied with what the decision means for their parents, he said.

“It’s a very ugly kind of conversation to be having,” Kagan said, adding that more people are thinking about carrying documentation proving their citizenship or legal residence.

Cristian Gonzalez-Perez, supervising attorney with immigrant advocacy group Make the Road Nevada, says the “best advice” an attorney can give their Latino clients right now is to carry such documentation, as surreal as that might seem.

That’s more expected in totalitarian countries that many of Gonzalez-Perez’s clients have left, he said.

“The climate and the loss of protections and the active racial profiling that the Supreme Court decision is now allowing will be pretty much requiring people to carry those documents,” he said, adding later that “you wouldn’t expect that to be here.”

Locals attending Make the Road’s monthly family protection plan clinics are increasingly scared, Gonzalez-Perez said. And while the organization has promoted “Know Your Rights” trainings, attendees wonder what would stop the federal government from violating their rights anyway.

People are afraid to go grocery shopping, he said, instead sending their citizen children or a family friend to do it for them.

“And now that this decision came out, it’s just going to explode in the amount of people that we are seeing that are going to be more fearful, especially because of how you look,” Gonzalez-Perez said.

Latino and Asian people feeling compelled to carry documentation proving their legal residency isn’t how the U.S. Constitution is supposed to work, Cortez Masto said.

“Why would you have to carry papers of some sort to prove to some federal agent that you are a United States citizen?” she asked. “That is not how our country is set up, but that’s what the Supreme Court, the conservative members of the court, are basically saying right now.”

Litigation history

On July 2, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, representing local organizations and a group of people stopped or detained during immigration raids in the region, filed a lawsuit to “end unlawful stops and arrests.”

Nine days later, a federal district judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing immigration agents from stopping people on the basis of only race, language, location and occupation. The order was in effect until last week.

While there was no majority opinion accompanying the Supreme Court’s ruling Monday to temporarily void the lower-court order, conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh clarified his position in a concurring opinion.

“To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion,” he wrote. “Under this court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor’ when considered along with other salient factors.”

Kavanaugh called it “common sense” that “those circumstances taken together constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

Kavanaugh also shrugged off concerns organizations involved in the lawsuit have about stops, writing that, if the person stopped is lawfully in the U.S., “that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter.”

“Most people do not carry on them clear documentation of their immigration or citizenship status,” the Immigration Clinic’s Kagan said. “And if you are not Latino, there’s probably still not much reason to worry. But, unfortunately, I think this gives Latinos a very big reason to worry.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by her two fellow liberal colleagues, wrote in her dissent that “we should not have to live in a country where the government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

Sotomayor ended her opinion by noting that the Fourth Amendment is supposed to prevent people from “arbitrary interference.”

“After today, that may no longer be true for those who happen to look a certain way, speak a certain way and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job,” she wrote, calling the situation “unconscionably irreconcilable” with the Constitution.

Cortez Masto said Americans should be concerned with what the decision means for the country, asking people to “call out this outrageous abuse of power” by the Supreme Court and the Trump administration.

As Sotomayor noted in her dissent, senior White House officials in June and early July reportedly pushed officers to “turn the creativity knob up” with their tactics and “push the envelope.” White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller also reportedly told officers to target Home Depot and 7-Eleven locations, Sotomayor noted from submissions the plaintiffs’ attorneys made to the court.

Though she harshly criticized the conservative members of the Supreme Court, Cortez Masto said she wasn’t in favor of expanding the court should Democrats regain control of the White House and Congress.

Citing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Cortez Masto said the court shouldn’t be playing politics.

Cortez Masto said Ginsburg supported keeping the Supreme Court’s makeup at the current nine justices “because it’s about who we put on.”

Meanwhile, the underlying case remains ongoing and actively litigated, with actions unfolding in both district and appellate courts.

“This isn’t the end of the fight,” Cortez Masto said. “This case is going to work its way through the courts. I’ll continue to push for the administration to follow the law. I’m going to monitor this case. My colleagues and I will continue to monitor it.”",https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2025/09/12/0914immigrantsRGB_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4,N,,2025-09-14 07:56:24.637540

The changing positions have not only infuriated his far-right allies, but have also confused those aiming to carry out his deportation policies.
In June, Mr. Trump recognized that his immigration agenda was taking a toll on certain industries, including agriculture.
His comments were celebrated by technology executives who said they relied on the program because they could not find enough qualified American workers.
Despite Mr. Trump’s reversals, Mr. Krikorian said he still believed business interests would not curtail the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.","President Trump entered the White House in January promising both the “largest deportation program in American history” and a “golden age” for American businesses.

But in recent weeks, the tension between those two promises has spilled out into the open, leading Mr. Trump to reverse or contradict some of his most significant anti-immigration policies when they threatened to disrupt the economy.

Mr. Trump has celebrated his success in driving down illegal border crossings and in cracking down on immigration more broadly. But he walks a careful line when his hard-line policies collide with his economic agenda — particularly when it comes to foreign workers, student visas and industries that rely on immigrant labor.

The changing positions have not only infuriated his far-right allies, but have also confused those aiming to carry out his deportation policies.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said in a statement that Mr. Trump “has been incredibly consistent with his immigration policies.” To suggest otherwise, she added, “demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of the president’s agenda.”

Ms. Jackson said that “while anyone in the country illegally is eligible for deportation, the priority remains criminal illegals who terrorize American communities.”

Mr. Trump last week faced an uproar after immigration agents arrested nearly 500 workers, most of them South Korean citizens, at the construction site of an electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia. The raid caused deep anger in South Korea — a key U.S. ally and trading partner — and had the potential to discourage exactly the kind of foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing that Mr. Trump is trying to achieve.

Even though the Trump administration had argued the workers were in the United States illegally, Mr. Trump temporarily paused the deportations to consider allowing the South Korean workers to stay in the United States and help finish the factory, according to officials in Seoul. Most of the workers did end up returning to South Korea.

Mr. Trump similarly appeared to pull back on his hard-line approach to student visas when it risked upending the finances of American colleges and universities. In May, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would work to “aggressively revoke” visas of Chinese students, and that the administration would “enhance scrutiny” of future applicants from China.

Chinese undergraduates often pay full tuition for their education.

Nearly two months later, Mr. Trump shocked his conservative allies when he said he would let 600,000 Chinese students into American universities. “I like that other countries’ students come here,” Mr. Trump said. “And you know what would happen if they didn’t? Our college system would go to hell very quickly.”

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia, responded by questioning why the administration would allow “600,000 students from China to replace our American student’s opportunities?”

“We should never allow that,” she wrote on X.

Laura Ingraham, the Fox News anchor, pressed Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, on Mr. Trump’s turnabout.

“How is allowing 600,000 students from the communist country of China putting America first?” Ms. Ingraham asked Mr. Lutnick, who argued that Mr. Trump was trying to help support colleges.

“His view is he’s taking a rational economic view,” Mr. Lutnick said.

A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe the administration’s approach to student visas, said the 600,000 visas were an estimate of the total number of visas expected for Chinese students over the next two years under the government’s existing policy.

In June, Mr. Trump recognized that his immigration agenda was taking a toll on certain industries, including agriculture.

“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” he wrote on social media.

That same day, ICE officials sent out guidance telling their agents to largely avoid enforcement at work sites in certain industries, including hotels and restaurants. Days later, officials appeared to backtrack on the guidance, and claimed that all operations would remain on the table.

His comments were celebrated by technology executives who said they relied on the program because they could not find enough qualified American workers. But right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer and Stephen K. Bannon, said the program was harmful because it brought in workers willing to accept lower salaries than Americans.

Last year, in an interview with the hosts of a popular Silicon Valley podcast, Mr. Trump backed permanent residency for immigrants who study at U.S. colleges. “What I will do is: You graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card to be able to stay in this country, and that includes junior colleges,” he said.

Hours later, a spokesman walked the comment back and said Mr. Trump would impose an “aggressive vetting process” for foreign students.

Now in office, the Trump administration has rescinded hundreds of student visas and has moved to rescind green cards from pro-Palestinian protesters or scholars.

Mark Krikorian, the head of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports restrictions on immigration, said business interests have for decades swayed Republican administrations, which advocated not just mass deportations but also comprehensive immigration reform.

Despite Mr. Trump’s reversals, Mr. Krikorian said he still believed business interests would not curtail the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

“There’s no question that the concerns of businesses are going to get a hearing in a Republican administration or a Republican Congress, but it’s not going to be the kind of relationship that existed in the past,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/01/24/multimedia/14dc-immig-01/24dc-immig-01-vlwg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:56:29.440701

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson favored the Biden administration by 77 percentage points.
Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown, said there was a distinct ideological split in rulings on emergency applications filed by the two administrations.
Second, more than two-thirds of the Biden administration’s emergency applications took on rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit.
The Biden administration repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to address the issue.","Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh says good judges are like good referees.

“Am I calling it the same way for labor and management, for the business and the environmental interests, for the Republican and the Democrat?” he asked at a judicial conference over the summer. “If you can’t look in the mirror and say, ‘I would do the exact same thing if the parties were flipped,’ then you’re not being a good judge, just like you wouldn’t be a good referee if you were favoring one team over the other.”

A look at the court’s record in emergency rulings does not appear to reflect Justice Kavanaugh’s goal.

Drilling down to individual justices’ votes rounds out the group portrait.

In the 17 cases in which the Biden administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court over four years, for instance, Justice Kavanaugh voted in its favor 41 percent of the time, according to an analysis prepared for The New York Times by Lee Epstein and Andrew D. Martin, both of Washington University in St. Louis, and Michael J. Nelson of Penn State.

By contrast, in the 19 cases in which the court has ruled on applications from the second Trump administration, Justice Kavanaugh voted for the administration 89 percent of the time. That amounted to a 48 percentage-point gap in favor of President Trump.

(The analysis ignored withdrawn applications, treated consolidated cases as a single decision and counted orders granting the president partial relief as a victory. It is also theoretically possible that there were dissenting votes in some of the cases that were not made public.)

Testing whether the justices are treating Democrats and Republicans alike presents challenges, as the cases that reach the justices present varied legal issues based on distinctive facts. But a comparison of the court’s treatment of emergency applications, in particular, can be telling.

The justices rule on such applications quickly and almost always without hearing oral argument. Their rulings are provisional, lasting only while the cases proceed through the courts for a final decision. But they can remain in effect for a year or more, meaning they have significant impact and sometimes effectively resolve the disputes.

Rulings on emergency applications filed by the government, moreover, tend to present the same essential questions: how much deference is due the president and whether temporarily blocking a government program challenged as unlawful would cause more harm than letting it proceed.

In their public appearances, the justices try to counter the perception that they favor the agenda of the party of the president who appointed them by noting the many unanimous decisions they issue in argued cases, along with ones featuring unusual coalitions.

On the far left, the size of the gap was identical, but in the other direction. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson favored the Biden administration by 77 percentage points.

By those standards, Justice Kavanaugh’s voting was among the most balanced, though two members of the court had smaller gaps. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. favored President Trump by 21 percentage points, followed by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, at 26 percentage points.

The cases the two administrations pursued were different, of course, making comparison inexact, and the concentrated volume and sheer ambition of President’s Trump’s applications dwarfed those of his predecessor. The court has so far, on a technically temporary basis, let him fire independent agency regulators, cut funding approved by Congress, dismiss transgender troops and remove protections for hundreds of thousands of migrants. Last week, the court allowed him to pursue aggressive roundups of people suspected to be in the country unlawfully.

Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown, said there was a distinct ideological split in rulings on emergency applications filed by the two administrations. That is not always the case in argued cases, he said, which sometimes produce unusual alliances after the justices receive full briefing, hear oral arguments and draft long and careful opinions.

The court, as the justices will readily admit, does not do its best work when it must move quickly, and the volume of emergency applications has shifted much of its energy to such fast-moving litigation, often resolved in a matter of weeks instead of in a year or more, as is common for merits cases.

Despite the court’s conservative supermajority, the Biden administration did obtain relief in a slight majority of its emergency applications, including ones involving a commonly used abortion pill and “ghost guns,” which are kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms.

But victories like those were influenced by two factors.

Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar, like her predecessor in the first Trump administration and her successor in the current one, made strategic choices about which cases to bring to the court, generally choosing only ones with at least a fair prospect of success.

Second, more than two-thirds of the Biden administration’s emergency applications took on rulings from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Fifth Circuit. Opponents of the administration’s policies and programs often filed challenges in that circuit, correctly anticipating that they would meet a favorable reception with its especially conservative judges. Still, those rulings often proved too conservative even for a generally conservative Supreme Court.

Moreover, in three cases in which the justices initially turned down the Biden administration’s requests for emergency interim relief from Fifth Circuit rulings, the administration ultimately prevailed when the cases were set down on the merits docket for full briefing and argument.

When the justices are moving fast, without a chance to forge consensus, legal experts said, partisanship may be more apt to influence outcomes. “Their rough-cut assessment and instinct is going to go against the Biden administration and for the Trump administration, even if that doesn’t necessarily track their ultimate disposition of the matter,” said Leah Litman, a law professor at the University of Michigan.

While true apples-to-apples comparisons are hard to come by, as the two administrations have pursued different policies, they were united in their opposition to universal injunctions, a tool federal district courts have used to shut down government programs nationwide.

The Biden administration repeatedly asked the Supreme Court to address the issue. The court’s response to one such request in October 2024 was telling.

When the Fifth Circuit issued a universal injunction blocking a program that helped forgive student debt, the administration sought review of two questions: whether the appeals court’s ruling was correct and whether it had “erred in ordering the district court to enter preliminary relief on a universal basis.”

The Supreme Court granted the administration’s petition. But it said it would consider only the first question, on the student debt issue. (The court ultimately dismissed the case last month.)

Five months after the Biden administration’s petition, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to address universal injunctions on an emergency basis in the context of rulings blocking its efforts to limit birthright citizenship. The court promptly agreed, put the case on a fast track and, in June, ruled for the administration, saying that federal district courts had been abusing such injunctions.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/00dc-scotus-ideology1-qgch/00dc-scotus-ideology1-qgch-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-14 07:56:33.786005

She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families - immigrant and non-immigrant alike - with food, housing and educational resources.
Since the raid, Harrison said, “families are experiencing a new level of crisis.” A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid - which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades - were Korean and have returned to South Korea.
People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.
“The worst phone calls are the ones where you have children crying, screaming, ‘Where is my mom?’” Harrison said.","Ever since a massive immigration raid on a Hyundai manufacturing site swept up nearly 500 workers in southeast Georgia, Rosie Harrison said her organization’s phones have been ringing nonstop with panicked families in need of help.

“We have individuals returning calls every day, but the list doesn’t end,” Harrison said. She runs an apolitical non-profit called Grow Initiative that connects low-income families - immigrant and non-immigrant alike - with food, housing and educational resources.

Since the raid, Harrison said, “families are experiencing a new level of crisis.”

A majority of the 475 people who were detained in the workplace raid - which U.S. officials have called the largest in two decades - were Korean and have returned to South Korea. But lawyers and social workers say many of the non-Korean immigrants ensnared in the crackdown remain in legal limbo or are otherwise unaccounted for.

As the raid began the morning of Sept. 4, workers almost immediately started calling Migrant Equity Southeast, a local nonprofit that connects immigrants with legal and financial resources. The small organization of approximately 15 employees fielded calls regarding people from Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Venezuela, spokesperson Vanessa Contreras said.

Throughout the day, people described federal agents taking cellphones from workers and putting them in long lines, Contreras said. Some workers hid for hours to avoid capture, in air ducts or remote areas of the sprawling property. The Department of Justice said some hid in a nearby sewage pond.

People off-site called the organization frantically seeking the whereabouts of loved ones who worked at the plant and were suddenly unreachable.

Like many of the Koreans who were working at the plant, advocates and lawyers representing the non-Korean workers caught up in the raid say that some who were detained had legal authorization to work in the United States.

Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to emailed requests for comment Friday. It is not clear how many people detained during the raid remain in custody.

Atlanta-based attorney Charles Kuck, who represents both Korean and non-Korean workers who were detained, said two of his clients were legally working under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which was created by former President Barack Obama. One had been released and “should have never been arrested,” he said, while the other was still being held because he was recently charged with driving under the influence.

Another of Kuck’s clients was in the process of seeking asylum, he said, and had the same documents and job as her husband who was not arrested.

Some even had valid Georgia driver’s licenses, which aren’t available to people in the country illegally, said Rosario Palacios, who has been assisting Migrant Equity Southeast. Some families who called the organization were left without access to transportation because the person who had been detained was the only one who could drive.

“It’s hard to say how they chose who they were going to release and who they were going to take into custody,” Palacios said, adding that some who were arrested didn’t have an alien identification number and were still unaccounted for.

Kuck said the raid is an indication of how far-reaching the crackdown by President Donald Trump’s administration is, despite assurances that they are targeting criminals.

“The redefinition of the word ‘criminal’ to include everybody who is not a citizen, and even some that are, is the problem here,” Kuck said.

Many of the families who called Harrison’s initiative said their detained relatives were the sole breadwinners in the household, leaving them desperate for basics like baby formula and food.

The financial impact of the raid at the construction site for a battery factory that will be operated by HL-GA Battery Co. was compounded by the fact that another massive employer in the area - International Paper Co. - is closing at the end of the month, laying off another 800 workers, Harrison said.

Growth Initiative doesn’t check immigration status, Harrison said, but almost all families who have reached out to her have said that their detained loved ones had legal authorization to work in the United States, leaving many confused about why their relative was taken into custody in the first place.

After a summer characterized by masked federal agents detaining immigrants in Los Angeles, the California Legislature passed two measures Thursday that seek to force law enforcement officers to identify themselves.

Senate Bills 627 and 805 were among the most controversial to pass in the final days of this year’s legislative session. They would ban local, out-of-state and federal law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, as well as require officers to be readily identifiable, respectively.

State Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat and lead author of SB 627: “As we go through this horrific era of mass deportation and a Supreme Court that allows this authoritarian regime to do whatever the heck it wants to do — including straight-up racial profiling of Latino people — California should lead and put a stop to the secret police.”

The measures passed along party lines, with Republicans in opposition. Police unions also oppose the proposed mask ban.

GOP Sen. Tony Strickland of Huntington Beach, in a statement: “This is a reckless anti-law enforcement proposal that puts law enforcement officers and their families at real risk, undermining the safety of the men and women who bravely protect our communities.”

Though Friday was to be the last day of session, lawmakers were expected to extend their work through Saturday to give final votes to some last-minute deals they struck this week. Those that pass will head to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk for his signature or veto, and those that don’t are dead for the year.

Other proposals awaiting Newsom’s decision, include:

Regulate companion bots: SB 243 would put tighter regulations on online chatbots powered by artificial intelligence to limit their risks on young users.

Higher car dealer fees: SB 791 would raise the cap car dealers can charge to process documents from $85 to $260.

Wage boost for incarcerated firefighters: AB 247 would increase the minimum wage for incarcerated firefighters fighting active wildfires to $7.25 an hour.

Abortion pill protections: AB 260 would help protect California pharmacists, doctors and hospitals from penalties for dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone to out-of-state patients and remove the names of patients and providers from abortion medication prescriptions.

Kill mute swans: AB 764 would make it easier for hunters and landowners to kill the invasive species.

Ban plastic glitter: AB 823 would enforce a first-in-the-nation ban on the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.

Save the bees: AB 1042 would create a health program for managed honey bees that would provide grants to beekeepers, farmers and others for projects and research supporting the struggling population.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b72473/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1194x627+0+80/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F71%2F7e0c642148da979114f5fecf6291%2Fice-mask-ban.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 22:56:49.668385

The Friday ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court order and allows the administration to begin dismantling the program while litigation continues. Humanitarian parole provided temporary legal status and work permits, usually for two years, to people fleeing instability in their home countries.

The court acknowledged the potential consequences for those affected in its ruling. “We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

The ruling marked a legal win for the Trump administration, though it does not immediately alter conditions on the ground. A district court had previously blocked the policy in April, but the Supreme Court lifted that stay in May, signaling that the government had broad discretion to rescind parole programs.

Esther Sung, legal director of the Justice Action Center and co-counsel in the case, criticized the outcome. “People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

Government lawyers argued that parole was always intended as a temporary measure and that the Department of Homeland Security has the authority to revoke it without judicial interference. Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the court that reviewing cases individually would be “a gargantuan task” and would obstruct deportation efforts. “The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” the government’s brief stated.

Plaintiffs countered that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by canceling the program wholesale without considering individual humanitarian claims. Attorneys for the migrants urged the appeals court to uphold the district court’s ruling. “The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” they wrote.

Attorneys for the plaintiffs also described the administration’s decision as unprecedented. They called it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history,” marking the first time the U.S. government has revoked humanitarian parole for such a large group at once.

The Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Friday their agents were targeting Silvero Villegas-Gonzalez for arrest Friday. They said he was a criminal who was in the country illegally, but his attorney Manuel Carednas said that's not entirely true.

Villegas-Gonzalez's family shared a photo of him to a GoFundMe page after his death on Friday, saying he had just dropped his two sons at school that morning. DHS says an ICE agent was trying to arrest him when he resisted and attempted to drive his car into agents. That's when DHS said an agent fatally shot Villegas-Gonzalez.

""When I realized it was our client, first of all I was upset,"" Cardenas sad. ""It didn't seem to fit the person that I knew.""

CBS News Chicago Investigators found the 38-year-old father had four traffic violations between 2010 and 2019 for offenses including speeding, an expired driver's license, not having insurance, and not having a child restraint seat.

Cardenas said he represented Villegas-Gonzales in two of those cases.

""Both of them were resolved favorably, neither of them involved criminal violence,"" he said.

Homeland Security said Villegas-Gonzalez had a criminal history of reckless driving, and said he entered the U.S. at an unknown date and time. President Trump says anyone in the U.S. illegally is a criminal.

Cardenas disagrees.

Of additional concern is the U.S. deportation of migrants to third countries that have deeply problematic human rights records as clearly delineated in the Human Rights Reports, such as South Sudan, Rwanda and Eswatini.
The country report states that there are “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” raising questions about its credibility.
Historically a powerful tool in American policymaking, the Human Rights Reports have traditionally provided an objective source to inform foreign and domestic policy, reflect American values, and project American democratic global leadership.
Any distance between American human rights standards and our handling of migration policy undermines American values and the United States’ position in the world.","The recently released U.S. Department of State Human Rights Reports have stirred significant controversy about notable cuts in length and issue coverage, delayed release, and perceived bias, particularly on countries like Hungary, Brazil and South Africa.

Equally concerning is the disconnect between migration policy and the reports’ coverage of countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Afghanistan and the unduly rosy reporting of countries like El Salvador. Each case highlights this troubling inconsistency, as well as the willingness to deport people to dangerous situations, and — more broadly — a significant divergence from American foreign policy.

The State Department should seriously review the concerns voiced by journalists and democracy defenders about the mischaracterization of human rights situations in countries aligned with the U.S. and those with which tensions exist.

The Department of Homeland Security should carefully review those past or pending deportation cases to highly insecure countries. Given its important oversight responsibility, Congress should investigate whether deported migrants face life-threatening situations due to U.S. deportation, since that would be both inhumane and counter to America’s democratic values.

The inconsistency between U.S. human rights reporting and immigration policy is most clearly seen in efforts to lift protective designations such as temporary protected status for certain foreign nationals in the United States. This provisional legal classification is granted when a home country is considered temporarily unsafe or unable to “adequately” handle the return of its nationals.

Haitians initially received temporary protected status due to a 2010 natural disaster, followed by extensions triggered by extreme security conditions which make return unsafe. The Human Rights Report found that the human rights situation there “worsened significantly” because of “the lack of state capacity to protect civilians from expanding gang violence and individuals’ decreasing rights in areas such as freedom of expression.”

Nevertheless, the administration recently sought to lift temporary protected status for Haitians and has terminated the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela Parole Program that allowed some nationals from those four countries to legally enter and work in the United States temporarily. The courts blocked the effort to remove Haitians’ temporary protected status, but the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela Parole Program termination was allowed to proceed. The administration’s position on these programs illustrates a troubling gap between the reports and humanitarian immigration policy.

Similarly, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced in May that the United States would rescind temporary protected status for Afghan nationals, many of whom supported U.S. objectives in Afghanistan.

“Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country,” Noem argued in determining that the conditions “no longer meet the statutory requirements” for temporary protected status.

But the Human Rights Report stated that there was “significant deterioration in respect for women’s rights during the year” and that Taliban members “reportedly killed persons in retaliation for their association with the pre-August 2021 government.”

This is particularly concerning for those Afghans who served U.S. interests and face a heightened threat of retaliation upon return. Leaving aside the moral argument against sending back Afghans who helped the U.S., the State Department’s report makes the case that deporting them would place them in grave danger.

Similarly, Ukrainians who have fled the brutal Russian war were granted a temporary humanitarian status due to the war. The administration withdrew this status which means over 120,000 Ukrainians will be forced to return to their homeland during an active war if they lack an existing asylum request.

Of additional concern is the U.S. deportation of migrants to third countries that have deeply problematic human rights records as clearly delineated in the Human Rights Reports, such as South Sudan, Rwanda and Eswatini.

In the case of El Salvador, whose president is a close partner in the administration’s deportation efforts, the State Department assessments diverged from widespread evidence by respected sources that there are major human rights violations, including against children. The country report states that there are “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” raising questions about its credibility.

While deporting people from the United States is within the purview of any American administration and removing people with criminal records is standard policy, sending these individuals to countries where they may face significant abuse and danger is a troubling divergence from traditional U.S. standards and simple decency. So is cutting deals and providing U.S. financial and/or political support to problematic regimes and leaders who host deportees but are also sanctioned by the United States, as is the case with South Sudanese leader Benjamin Bol Mel.

Historically a powerful tool in American policymaking, the Human Rights Reports have traditionally provided an objective source to inform foreign and domestic policy, reflect American values, and project American democratic global leadership. Immigration enforcement, including removals, is a necessary component of immigration policy. But it should not undermine American values and foreign policy objectives.

Any distance between American human rights standards and our handling of migration policy undermines American values and the United States’ position in the world. It also damages America’s credibility and ability to secure its interests globally at a time where these interests are threatened by global competitors.

Judge Timothy J. Kelly's decision Saturday keeps the government from removing Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. alone and are currently living in government shelters and foster care through Sept. 16.

Kelly's order said he needed a brief extension to continue to study the issue because up until a hearing on Sept. 10 the facts of the case were still changing. His decision comes after the government during that hearing backtracked on previous claims that the children's parents requested them back.

The court decision stems from a Labor Day weekend operation when the Trump administration attempted to remove dozens of Guatemalan migrant children who had come to the U.S. alone and were living in U.S. government shelters and foster care.

In a late night operation on Aug. 30, the administration notified shelters where migrant children traveling alone initially live after they cross the southern border that they would be returning the children to Guatemala and that they needed to have the kids ready to leave in a matter of hours.

Contractors for Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up the Guatemalan children from shelters and foster care and transported them to the airport. The government has said in court filings that it identified 457 children for possible removal to Guatemala although that list was eventually whittled down to 327. In the end, 76 got as far as boarding planes in El Paso and Harlingen, Texas, early morning on Aug. 31 and were set to depart to Guatemala in what the government described as a first phase.

Immigration and children’s advocates, who had been alerted of possible efforts to remove Guatemalan minors, immediately sued the Trump administration to prevent the children’s removal. The advocates argued that many of these children were fleeing abuse or violence in their home countries and that the government was bypassing longstanding legal procedures meant to protect young migrants from being returned to potentially abusive or violent places.

A federal judge in Washington granted advocates a 14-day temporary restraining order largely preventing the Trump administration from removing migrant children in its care except in limited circumstances where an immigration judge had already ordered their removal after reviewing their cases. Kelly's Saturday order extends that protection three more days.

The government has argued that it has the right to return children in their care and it was acting at the behest of the Guatemalan government.

The Guatemalan government has said that it was concerned over minors in U.S. custody who were going to turn 18 and would then be at risk of being turned over to adult detention facilities.

Children who cross the border alone are generally transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which falls under the Health and Human Services Department. The children usually live in a network of shelters across the country that are overseen by the resettlement office until they are eventually released to a sponsor, usually a relative.

Children's advocates have also asked the Washington court for longer-term protections preventing the government from removing all children in government custody, with a few limited exceptions, while the lawsuit plays out in court. Advocates made that request after hearing reports that the government was intending to remove Honduran children as well. The court has yet to rule on that request.

There are also temporary restraining orders in separate cases in Arizona and Illinois also filed during the Labor Day weekend where advocates sued to restrict the government from removing Guatemalan and later Honduran children, but those cases are more narrow in scope of children they cover than the Washington case.

The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.
“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta.
“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.
We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”","California has secured a court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from barring immigrants living in the country illegally from accessing dozens of federally funded programs, including child care, health care and education services.

As part of the Trump administration’s proposed change, federally funded programs would be required to verify recipients’ immigration status — reversing a Clinton administration policy that extended “public benefit” programs to people living in the country without legal permission. The Trump administration said the change was necessary to ensure taxpayer-funded “public resources are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

The new court order comes a few months after California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other state leaders sued the administration over the policy change in July.

In July, the California-led coalition secured a temporary pause preventing the administration from implementing the changes before Sept. 10. The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.

Programs included in the Trump administration’s restriction would include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors, among others.

The proposed restriction would also include Head Start — a national program that serves more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5-years old across the U.S. The program provides free school meals and medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

Bonta and state leaders said that in addition to causing irreparable harm to vulnerable families, the proposed restrictions barring some immigrants from participation would have a “chilling effect” on all participants of the programs, regardless of immigration status. The states’ lawsuit also said the proposed verification requirements would cost states’ economies hundreds of millions of dollars.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.

While Kirk’s assassination feels like a watershed moment, America is not experiencing its most violent political era.
Yet even the 1960s pale before the Reconstruction Era, America’s true apex of political violence.
What these three eras share isn’t just political violence — it’s the pattern that creates it.
If we let fear of the stranger govern us, it will destroy not only those we despise — it will destroy us too.","Robert F. Kennedy and Charlie Kirk could not have been more different. One was a liberal lion from Massachusetts who championed civil rights and fought poverty; the other was a conservative firebrand from Illinois who built a movement around limited government and traditional values. Kennedy came from political royalty; Kirk rose from suburban obscurity. Kennedy quoted Greek poetry; Kirk quoted the Constitution. They would have disagreed about almost everything.

But on Wednesday, they joined the same tragic American tradition: political leaders killed by bullets. Both men died doing what democracy demands — standing before crowds, speaking their convictions, willing to risk their personal safety for causes they believed in.

The two men defy comparison, but their deaths illuminate something identical: Both lived and died in eras when America’s political divisions became so toxic that disagreement repeatedly turned to violence.

The question haunting us now is the same one that faced America after 1968: Will we let fear of the other side destroy the country we’re all trying to save?

Today’s divisions feel unprecedented, but the nation has been here before — and survived far worse.

While Kirk’s assassination feels like a watershed moment, America is not experiencing its most violent political era. Today’s political violence, troubling as it is, does not approach the systematic bloodshed of the 1960s, when assassins killed President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy within five years. That decade saw 43 people die in riots following King’s murder alone, with hundreds of cities erupting in violence that required federal troops to contain.

Yet even the 1960s pale before the Reconstruction Era, America’s true apex of political violence. Between the end of the Civil War and 1877, organized white supremacist groups systematically terrorized the freed Black population, killing at least 1,000 Black Americans in what amounted to a campaign of political terrorism. The Ku Klux Klan and allied groups overthrew democratically elected governments and drove Black officials from office at gunpoint.

What these three eras share isn’t just political violence — it’s the pattern that creates it. Each period coincided with massive technological and cultural upheavals that fundamentally threatened existing power structures. The Reconstruction Era brought railroads, telegraphs and the end of slavery — changes that remade American society and economy. The 1960s saw television brought into living rooms, while social movements challenged everything from racial hierarchies to gender roles. Today’s era features social media, globalization and demographic shifts that are reshaping American identity itself. In each case, the violence emerged in part from fear of losing a familiar way of life.

The divisions that seem insurmountable today are amplified by new technologies that spread both information and misinformation at unprecedented speed, creating the conditions where political disagreement turns into existential warfare.

Look at what we’re actually fighting about today: artificial intelligence, TikTok ownership, climate policies, gender roles and identities, immigration levels, educational curricula. These are policy questions, not holy wars. But we have let fear merchants transform them into tribal battles where compromise becomes treason and listening becomes weakness.

But history shows us the antidote. It is the same one that built the railroad, won two world wars, put a man on the Moon and created the internet: the radical American idea that strangers can become neighbors, that different voices strengthen rather than threaten the whole, that our diversity is our superpower when we choose cooperation over conquest.

This means our media must reward bridge-building over bomb-throwing. Our laws must protect democratic norms even when breaking them might benefit our side. Our approach to technology must prioritize human connection over corporate profit. Most importantly, we must recommit to the hardest American ideal: listening to those we disagree with, not to change their minds, but to understand why they fear what they do.

Kirk’s assassination is a warning. If we let fear of the stranger govern us, it will destroy not only those we despise — it will destroy us too. But if we choose the harder path of empathy and engagement, if we remember that America’s strength has always come from making room for the next wave of newcomers and their ideas, then, even now, America can remain what it has always been at its best: a country that moves forward together.

Although Cook County officials did not identify him, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Mexican consulate in Chicago identified the ICE victim as Silverio Villegas González.
Eyewitness accounts taken down and reported by WBEZ Chicago said events escalated rapidly after ICE agents approached González, whose fear and panic were clearly visible to everyone nearby.
Immigration authorities also stated that Silverio Villegas González had no criminal convictions or violent offenses.
These tactics have led to repeated confrontations including fatalities like the death of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois.","Silverio Villegas González, a 42-year-old Mexican immigrant and father of three, was shot and killed by an ICE officer in Franklin Park, Illinois, late on Wednesday afternoon.

According to authorities, González was initially stopped by ICE agents who claimed that his vehicle matched the description of one purportedly involved in a prior immigration-related investigation.

Friends and family contested this account, emphasizing that González’s only offense was a minor traffic infraction—an expired license plate sticker—in the quiet suburb just west of Chicago.

The shooting of González took place within days of President Trump’s immigration crackdown campaign launched in the Chicago area. Although Cook County officials did not identify him, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Mexican consulate in Chicago identified the ICE victim as Silverio Villegas González.

Eyewitness accounts taken down and reported by WBEZ Chicago said events escalated rapidly after ICE agents approached González, whose fear and panic were clearly visible to everyone nearby.

The WBEZ quoted several people who were on the scene. Maria Martinez, a neighbor, told reporters, “He was just sitting in his car when two men came up out of nowhere, shouting at him in English. Silverio looked scared—he didn’t understand everything they were saying. We heard them yelling, then, all of a sudden, I heard gunshots.”

Another onlooker, Samuel Ramos, recalled: “After the first shot, Silverio tried to get out of the car, but he stumbled into the street. The officers kept shouting at him—telling him to ‘stay put’—but he was holding his hands up, trying to talk. People started gathering, screaming for help, but we were pushed back by the officers.”

The WBEZ account describes confusion and fear among local residents, many of whom did not realize the men in plain clothes were federal agents until after the incident. María Santiago, who resides across the street, said: “Nobody knew they were ICE. They didn’t identify themselves clearly. It looked like a robbery at first, but then they started dragging Silverio away and blocking anyone from getting close.”

As in every act of police brutality that workers are all too familiar with in American cities, ICE released a statement Thursday morning, claiming González “failed to comply with lawful orders” and “acted in a manner that posed a threat to officers.”

The agency also said the use of deadly force was justified, stating: “The incident is under review by ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility. We regret any loss of life, but our officers were confronting an individual believed to be involved with recent fraudulent document activity and suspected of prior immigration violations.”

The Department of Homeland Security claimed that Silverio Villegas González was an undocumented immigrant. Official statements say he entered the country at an unknown date and was the subject of a targeted ICE enforcement operation in Franklin Park, Illinois. Immigration authorities also stated that Silverio Villegas González had no criminal convictions or violent offenses. The only record with law enforcement against him was a minor traffic violation.

Meanwhile, residents contradicted the ICE narrative of what happened on Wednesday, saying Silverio was not physically threatening anyone. “He wouldn’t hurt anybody,” said Rosa Villegas, his mother. “Silverio was afraid. He was just trying to go home to his kids. I watched his last moments from across the street. There were no weapons, no threats—just confusion and panic. They shot him because they could, not because they had to.”

A next-door neighbor, Jorge Hernández, described Silverio as “a quiet man, a hard worker. He didn’t know what to do when those agents came for him. He was scared for his life, and now he’s gone.”

People close to González spoke of a loving father who had never had trouble with the law. His eldest son, Marco, told reporters: “He worked two jobs, would do anything for us. When those men came for him, he panicked—that’s not a crime. My dad always said he was worried ICE would come someday. He was terrified of being taken away, but he never imagined they would kill him.”

Friends described how González had grown increasingly anxious since the launch of Trump’s immigration sweeps in recent months and took careful steps to avoid trouble. “He stopped going out after dark, just in case,” said family friend Nancy Ríos. “He was just living his life, scared every day.”

Democratic Party Illinois Governor JD Pritzker issued a statement Thursday afternoon, saying “Our state will not allow the unchecked use of deadly force against residents by federal agents,” and “Illinois remains committed to protecting immigrant communities and ensuring accountability for the loss of life.”

Pritzker called for a suspension of ICE raids pending an independent review, but there is no indication that the White House or Department of Homeland Security is going to halt any of the police-state measures being meted out in Chicago and surrounding suburbs.

The Resurrection Project, a Chicago-based immigrant advocacy group, released a statement Thursday evening that read: “Silverio Villegas González is yet another victim of Operation Midway Blitz, a campaign that has placed immigrant families in constant fear and exposed them to violence at the hands of federal agents. … This killing must not go unanswered.”

The shooting comes amid the Trump administration’s escalating immigration enforcement strategies, particularly “Operation Midway Blitz,” a policy announced last year deploying both federal police and National Guard troops in Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other major cities.

The operation, justified by the White House as a measure to crack down on violent crime, is part of the war on immigrants and in neighborhoods across the US with aggressive tactics by federal agents against all residents including US citizens, green card holders and others with legal status to live and work in the US. These tactics have led to repeated confrontations including fatalities like the death of Silverio Villegas González in Franklin Park, Illinois.

The deployment of federal troops in Chicago has sparked protests throughout the last year, with comparisons to the “shock-and-awe” methods used during the illegal wars of conquest carried out by US imperialism over the past three decades.

According to statistics compiled by the American Immigration Council and the Chicago Tribune, shooting deaths of immigrants by ICE officers have been on the rise since 2018 . Over the past five years, according to cases that have been identified by advocacy groups, ICE officers have shot and killed at least 14 unarmed individuals nationwide, with four fatal shootings in Illinois since 2021.

Meanwhile, as of September 2025, at least 14 immigrants have died while in ICE custody this year. This is on track to be one of the deadliest in ICE’s history. By comparison, police killings in the US remain at staggering levels, with over 1,100 deaths per year reported by the Mapping Police Violence project, the majority of whom are working-class, poor and people of color.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/4df29ac0-933c-4061-be41-727a755a9bdf?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-09-13 20:56:58.263851

The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The U.S. Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpí, writing for a three-judge 1st Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpí said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a U.S. financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

According to lawyer Willy Allen, cited by Café Fuerte, “the most affected will be Venezuelans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, but Cubans may also suffer the consequences of this decision.”

By 14ymedio

HAVANA TIMES – The humanitarian parole program (CHNV), created to offer legal entry to migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, could be definitively dismantled following a new judicial setback. A ruling issued this Friday by the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Massachusetts authorizes Donald Trump’s Administration to prematurely cancel the permits granted since 2022 to more than half a million people.

The decision confirms that the government has the authority to end migration programs without reviewing cases individually, even if they are still pending in the courts, something that, in practice, was already happening, with migrants being arrested even at courthouse doors, and allows for immediate detention and deportation of those who have not managed to regularize their status.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm, convincingly laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who arrived legally in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month, a decision that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and legal jobs, and returning to dangers in their countries of origin,” the judges explained.

Nonetheless, they concluded that there was “no strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits” and that “the risk of such irreparable harms alone cannot justify halting the suspension” of parole.

Asked about the ruling by Café Fuerte, immigration lawyer Wilfredo Allen lamented that “we are witnessing the burial of humanitarian parole.” He explained that the measure will particularly impact Venezuelans, Haitians, and Nicaraguans, though Cubans “may also suffer the consequences of this decision.”

Allen reminded that Cuban migrants who arrived in the US through humanitarian parole have the option, after one year and one day of presence on US territory, to apply under the Cuban Adjustment Act, still considered a form of legal admission in the US, but he warned that this does not protect them from “being detained and placed in deportation proceedings.” For this reason, he recommended “that everyone avoid problems while waiting for their legal residency.”

According to official figures, more than 110,000 Cubans have arrived in the US through parole. Most are already in the process of applying for residency, but around 600—who entered between September and December 2024, under the last rounds of parole approvals, have not yet obtained a legal status and are in the most vulnerable position.

The appeals court ruling backs the actions of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which last March abruptly canceled the migration program and revoked all valid permits with just 30 days’ notice. The measure was blocked by a federal judge in Boston, but in May the Supreme Court overturned that protection.

Friday’s ruling sets a precedent by establishing that the Immigration and Nationality Act allows this type of program to be canceled without the need for case-by-case review.

The humanitarian parole program was launched in 2022 with the aim of providing a legal pathway for citizens of crisis-stricken countries to enter the US, and its cancellation was one of Trump’s main objectives in implementing his migration policy upon taking office.

The attempt at mass revocation has been criticized by multiple NGOs and migrant rights advocates, who argued—among other points—that if parole was granted on a case-by-case basis, it should also be revoked in the same manner.

The litigation is not yet over, and lawsuits for violations of due process continue in federal courts. However, in practice, the Trump Administration now has the legal tool to detain and deport those who have not yet secured another legal status in the United States.

On Wednesday, a federal district court judge in Los Angeles issued a sweeping preliminary injunction barring Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officers from “dispersing, threatening, or assaulting” journalists or legal observers, or using crowd control weapons on or shooting projectiles at anyone who doesn’t “pose a threat of imminent harm.”

The Los Angeles area has been rocked by protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids since June 6, when the Trump administration first targeted it for a crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

DHS officers have “unleashed crowd control weapons indiscriminately and with surprising savagery” in “retaliation” for those “constitutionally protected” protests and the related activities of journalists and observers, Judge Hernán Vera, a Biden appointee, stated in his ruling.

DHS does not have “carte blanche to unleash near-lethal force on crowds of third parties in the vicinity. Indeed, under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protestors, legal observers, and journalists—as well as the public that relies on them to hold their government accountable,” Judge Vera wrote. “The First Amendment demands better.”

The judge concluded that “federal agents’ indiscriminate use of force … will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events and protestors seeking to express peacefully their views on national policies.”

As the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) reported in August, journalists in Los Angeles have been repeatedly and severely injured by the actions of DHS, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department (LASD), and the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) while covering protests against ICE raids and the Trump administration’s deployment of Marines and the National Guard to the city.

“Since the federal government began its violent, chaotic invasion of Southern California, our communities have risen together to bear witness and to speak out for their neighbors and loved ones,” said Adrienna Wong, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, in a statement. “This ruling affirms their constitutional rights to do just that.”

“By granting this relief, the court has affirmed the journalistic duty to our communities and the essential role of a free press,” said Ryanne Mena, a journalist and one of the plaintiffs.

“I’ve spent countless hours compiling evidence of police misconduct toward journalists in Los Angeles. The attacks this summer have been relentless,” said Adam Rose, press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club, the lead plaintiff in the case. “It was a relief to hear Judge Vera acknowledge a ‘mountain of evidence’ as we sat in his courtroom last month. This decision affirms our right to be free from violence while doing our jobs.”

The court’s disturbing factual findings about the violence committed by DHS officers include specifically targeting members of the press with “less lethal” rounds even when they were far from protesters; firing on the media even after most protesters had left; and shooting tear gas canisters and pepper balls directly at reporters and others who posed no threat.

“In a disturbing number of cases,” DHS officers shot people in the head, Judge Vera wrote, noting that “less lethal” projectiles are meant to be aimed at the ground and “can—and have—caused severe trauma and death” when “aimed at the head.”

Judge Vera rejected DHS’s “baseless accusations that Plaintiffs themselves participated in violent riots,” saying the agency had failed to produce “a shred of evidence” to support that claim.

The court found that the injunction was necessary because of “strong and persuasive evidence of retaliatory intent” and the likelihood that DHS would continue to violate the First Amendment rights of journalists, legal observers, and peaceful protesters. DHS officers “have injured three members of LA Press Club and NewsGuild” since the denial of a temporary restraining order by a different judge on June 20, Vera noted.

Still, real questions remain as to whether or not DHS will comply with the order. In May, a federal judge in Boston found that DHS had violated a court order by deporting eight men to South Sudan. Members of the LAPD brutalized journalists even after being enjoined against doing so. Nick Stern, who was attacked by officers from both the LAPD and the LASD, said that he is not optimistic that DHS will comply with the preliminary injunction.

“These rulings come down, but when you’re on the ground, they are ignored much of the time,” Stern told CMD. “It seems to make very little difference in behavior. It’s a good administrative success, but whether or not it makes a difference on the streets remains to be seen.”

Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily.

When it passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in June, Congress handed nearly $75 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Some $30 billion of that money will be spent on enforcement and deportation—hiring spree incoming—and another $45 billion will go toward new detention centers, including 50 by the end of the year.

The OBBB immediately supercharged President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, which already had been terrorizing immigrant communities and sending asylum seekers to a hellish prison in El Salvador. But an important part of the detention state ramp-up has flown under the radar: ICE’s increased cooperation with local law enforcement agencies.

On Friday, ICE hit a new milestone: The agency has now signed more than 1,000 so-called 287(g) agreements nationwide. These agreements, which deputize local police and jails to perform certain immigration enforcement functions, have exploded under Trump. At the end of the Biden presidency, ICE had just 135 287(g) deals in place; now there are 1,001—a 641 percent increase.

About half of these agreements are what ICE calls task force agreements, which allow state and local cops to essentially act as immigration agents while fulfilling their regular police duties. If these sound familiar—and familiarly problematic—it’s because they were discontinued in 2012, following a Department of Justice investigation the year before that found widespread racial profiling by Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, then led by the notorious Joe Arpaio. The Trump administration brought task forces back this year, and ICE has signed more than 500 of these particular agreements across 33 states.

As my colleague Laura C. Morel wrote in July, Florida has led the way in signing 287(g) agreements, as part of its larger push to be a leader in Trump’s deportation efforts (see also: the Alligator Alcatraz tent city). In fact, state legislators even passed into law a bill that requires county jails and the sheriff’s offices running those facilities to participate in 287(g). Local advocates told Laura they were worried about what all this would mean for immigrant communities across Florida:

Growing cooperation between ICE and police in Florida will affect the day-to-day lives of immigrant families. “It’s not just about [an immigrant asking]: ‘What happens if I have to have an interaction with a police officer in some sort of criminal context?’” Greer says. “Living your life and existing in this community is now an extreme risk to being able to come home and see your kids, being able to come home and see your family. It is incredibly frightening.”

State cooperation with federal immigration authorities can lead to “rippling harm” on the communities that police are meant to serve and protect, says Shayna Kessler, director of the Advancing Universal Representation Initiative at the Vera Institute of Justice. “It increases distrust in law enforcement. It increases fear in immigrant communities, it decreases the ability of immigrants to take care of their families, to support the economy, and to be strong and stable members of their communities.”

The federal government is already pumping billions of dollars into Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown, unleashing masked agents all across America. But in many places, undocumented immigrants will now also have to worry that any encounter with a police officer could lead to their deportation.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250913_287g.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-13 15:56:38.914984

“ It made me sick and made me cough, and I fell down to the ground,” the retired UC Irvine medical professor said.

He still doesn't know what hit him. And he wasn't the only one.

Injured journalists and protesters together with the Los Angeles Press Club and the media union the NewsGuild sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in June, arguing that federal agents' use of force during anti-ICE protests ""punishes and suppresses the exercise of First Amendment-protected rights."" The press club also sued the Los Angeles Police Department, citing violations of journalists’ rights while covering protests.

In back to-back rulings this week, a federal judge issued preliminary injunctions against the LAPD and DHS, restricting their use of force against the press. The ruling against DHS also protects legal observers and protesters, such as Detrano, from indiscriminate force.

About the ruling against DHS

“The First Amendment demands better,” Judge Hernán Vera of the Central District Court of California wrote in his 45-page opinion.

The judge’s injunction applies to Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

Peter Eliasberg, chief counsel at the ACLU Southern California, called the judge’s decision “incredibly thorough.”

LAist has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment and to see if the government intends to appeal the injunction.

The judge said that federal agents used “the guise of protecting the public” to endanger large swathes of protesters and media.

Agents' indiscriminate use of force “will undoubtedly chill the media’s efforts to cover these public events and protestors seeking to express peacefully their views on national policies,” the judge wrote in his opinion.

He acknowledged that there are actors in protests who look to incite violence, but he wrote that “the actions of a relative few does not give DHS carte blanche to unleash near-lethal force on crowds of third parties in the vicinity.”

In his opinion, Vera wrote that federal agents also used weapons such as tear gas and pepper balls even when protesters tried to comply with orders to disperse.

The indiscriminate use of weapons, he wrote, supports the idea that agents were using force in retaliation against protesters.

About the ruling against the LAPD

In the ruling against the Los Angeles Police Department, the judge wrote, “It is déjà vu all over again.”

Vera wrote the latest protests presented “the latest chapter in a long and unfortunate saga of the LAPD’s use of unlawful force against members of the media.”

The judge wrote that the LAPD appeared to use projectiles to target journalists wearing visible gear that identified them as press.

In an emailed statement in response to the ruling, LAPD said the agency will continue to comply with the court order.

""The LAPD trains our officers to identify and respect working journalists during protest and we remain committed to protecting the rights of the press,"" the statement said.

A win for the First Amendment

The decisions were seen as a massive win for First Amendment advocates. It also comes as local law enforcement agencies — such as the Los Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the Santa Ana Police Department — are under scrutiny for the way they interact with the public during protests.

The judge wrote that the role of the journalist is “critical” in this moment where “the federal government is engaged in sudden and secretive immigration raids, which the public has limited opportunity to observe firsthand and so must rely upon the press.""

Adam Rose, the press rights chair at the Los Angeles Press Club applauded the judge for upholding First Amendment protections.

“ When a reasonable person is afraid to go out and to speak freely, that is about as un-American and unpatriotic as it gets,” he said. “And when DHS is responsible for that, someone has to police the police. That's what the judge here is doing.”

The judge’s preliminary injunction, Rose said, is the first time he “ felt that someone with power and authority was taking this seriously and really trying to act to address the problems” with law enforcement intentionally targeting journalists as retaliation for informing the public.

When law enforcement indiscriminately targets protesters with less lethal weapons, Rose said, it has the effect of “chilling of rights.”

Rose said the LAPD’s response to protests this summer were “painfully familiar” to similar misconduct at protests over the years, including those that followed the death of George Floyd in 2020 and those linked to the Black Lives Matter movement.

“LAPD has failed to police itself for 25 years,"" Rose said. ""Elected officials have failed to police LAPD too. Finally a federal judge has stepped in to do their job for them.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c4cdcd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2625+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3b%2F26%2F5675e44a4d37afb4516e5c7743f8%2Fgettyimages-2218868664.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 18:56:51.262939

Friloux, the commanding general of the Louisiana Army National Guard and the Louisiana Air National Guard. “The Soldiers and Airmen of the Louisiana National Guard are trained professionals who embody the values of our military and understand what it means to protect the homeland.”

This announcement comes only two days after Louisiana officials confirmed that 51 male immigrant detainees had already been transferred to a new detention center on the grounds of the notorious Louisiana State Penitentiary, nicknamed “Angola”. Angola is on the grounds of a former slave plantation, and the mostly-Black prisoner population is still forced to do the same agricultural labor once performed by enslaved Black people on the very same land.

Grassroots activists are organizing a rally in New Orleans on September 16 to protest the deployment of the national guard, comparing the move to the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops in other parts of the country, such as Washington, DC and Trump’s ramped up immigration crackdown in the Chicago area. The enforcement operations in Chicago escalated to fatal levels on September 12: On Friday, ICE agents fatally shot undocumented immigrant Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez after he allegedly drove his vehicle towards the agents.

“Just as in DC, Los Angeles, and now Memphis, Louisiana’s communities will continue to resist this racist police takeover,” said Jade Woods, another New Orleans-based organizer part of the planning for the rally on Tuesday.

“The deployment of the National Guard to assist ICE in Louisiana, it is the latest escalation in an ongoing attack against our immigrant communities,” said Cecilia Paz, one of the organizers planning Tuesday’s rally. “We know that the National Guard only makes bad situations worse just from history. We saw during Katrina that they came in and instead of helping people, they criminalized black working class people who are just trying to survive as looters rather than providing relief,” Paz said of the federal crackdown on looting amid Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in 2005.

“In terms of Angola being used as an isolation facility, we know that Angola prison is literally a site of modern day slavery. It is a former plantation that has been turned into a massive prison. It’s notorious for human rights violations. Prisoners are forced to endure forced labor through the Angola farm,” Paz continued. “At the same time, Louisiana has the second highest number of ICE detention facilities in the country. So this latest attack is an escalation and affirms how the far right uses Louisiana as a black site,” Paz said referencing how pro-Palestine students such as Mahmoud Khalil and Rumesya Ozturk were held in ICE detention facilities far from where both were originally from in the Northeast of the United States.",https://peoplesdispatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice-dhs-louisiana-national-guard.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 15:56:43.751563

The Trump administration's push for deportations isn't deterring the Mexican American community in Chicago from coming out and celebrating their culture.

From downtown to Pilsen and Little Village, expect parades, car caravans, street closures, and large crowds.

Mexican Americans said they feel it's extra-important to show up this year.

With the Mexican flag flying behind his truck, Ricky Medina was getting ready on Friday to lead a car caravan throughout the city.

""I understand they say we fly another country's flag, but it's not another country, it's our culture,"" he said.

It's his way of celebrating Mexican Independence Day.

""We're born here, we're American, but we're proud of our culture as Mexican Americans, and we're going to be out here. You're not going to scare us. We're still going to celebrate,"" he said.

Medina said he's encouraging a weekend of peaceful caravans – long lines of cars that he said started with car clubs in Chicago, and has expanded in recent years to take over much of Chicago's downtown.

In spite of increased fears of enhanced immigration enforcement under ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" while some are staying home, Medina said plenty of crowds will still be outside.

""They're scared that ICE is going to come out,"" Medina said. ""So the more united we are, the less they can with us.""

Last year, the city temporarily closed streets in downtown Chicago to most traffic to avoid the gridlock that had been caused by the car caravans in previous years. They're prepared to do so again, if needed, between Friday and the official holiday on Tuesday.

Depending on the size of any car caravans driving through the city, it's possible the city will limit cars headed into the downtown area by setting up access points at the following intersections:

Chicago Avenue and Green Street

Halsted Street and Washington Boulevard

Halsted and Madison streets

Halsted Street and Jackson Boulevard

Division Street and LaSalle Drive

Roosevelt Road and Canal Street

Taylor and Desplaines streets

18th and State streets

18th Street and Michigan Avenue

18th Street and Indiana Avenue

The city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications said people who live or work in the downtown area should be prepared to show a driver's license or employee ID at one of those access points. Anyone coming downtown for an event or reservation should be prepared to show proof of that, such as a ticket, electronic reservation confirmation, or other documentation.

Meantime, Lincoln United Methodist Church pastor Emma Lozano said many of her congregants have been participating in mass virtually, and she is encouraging anyone else with concerns about ICE activity to do the same for the Little Village parade on 26th Street on Sunday.

""We're telling people that if you feel afraid or at risk, then stay home. We'll try to livestream, it if possible, but we're standing in solidarity for you,"" she said.

Lozano said she will be attending the parade, which she looks forward to each year.

""We expect it to be big, and we're going to celebrate, and we're going to be proud and hold our head up,"" she said.

The Boston-based First US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by US District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The US Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpi, writing for a three-judge First Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpi said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

Esther Sung, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the immigrant rights group Justice Action Center, called Friday's ruling ""devastating"" but narrow, adding that ""there's still room for us to prevail as the litigation continues and moves to final judgement"".

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.
“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta.
“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.
We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”","California has secured a court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from barring immigrants living in the country illegally from accessing dozens of federally funded programs, including child care, health care and education services.

As part of the Trump administration’s proposed change, federally funded programs would be required to verify recipients’ immigration status — reversing a Clinton administration policy that extended “public benefit” programs to people living in the country without legal permission. The Trump administration said the change was necessary to ensure taxpayer-funded “public resources are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

The new court order comes a few months after California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other state leaders sued the administration over the policy change in July.

In July, the California-led coalition secured a temporary pause preventing the administration from implementing the changes before Sept. 10. The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.

Programs included in the Trump administration’s restriction would include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors, among others.

The proposed restriction would also include Head Start — a national program that serves more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5-years old across the U.S. The program provides free school meals and medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

Bonta and state leaders said that in addition to causing irreparable harm to vulnerable families, the proposed restrictions barring some immigrants from participation would have a “chilling effect” on all participants of the programs, regardless of immigration status. The states’ lawsuit also said the proposed verification requirements would cost states’ economies hundreds of millions of dollars.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

“But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay,” they added.

With the ruling, the appeals court will lift the stay issued by the district court and allow the Trump administration to target thousands of migrants for deportation.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center and a co-counsel in the case, says the decision will “hurt everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

The Justice Department had argued that it has the power to revoke the temporary protections and that the Department of Homeland Security should be able to do so without court interference.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

The Guardian has reviewed leaked data from charter airline Global Crossing (GlobalX) that detailed the journeys of tens of thousands of immigrants who have been shuttled around the country before deportation. We also took a close look at an Alexandria, Louisiana, facility run by the Geo Group, a private contractor, that has emerged as Trump’s deportation hub. Here are our findings after a four-month investigation:

44,000 immigrants, 1,700 flights, 100 days

GlobalX carried out more than 1,700 flights for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the vast majority of them between domestic US airports, between January and May. The airline transported nearly 1,000 children, including nearly 500 children under the age of 10, and 22 infants.

For many immigrants, the flight paths were long, with multiple legs and layovers. Nearly 3,600 people were moved around repeatedly, forced to board five or more GlobalX flights.

Immigrants were also moved between detention facilities more than before. The average number of transfers per person has markedly increased in the past six months, and some detained immigrants have been moved as many as 10 or 20 times.

Detainees were moved around the US without notice, to locations far from their families, communities and legal counsel – leading to apparent violations of constitutional due process rights.

Along their journeys, immigrants say they were repeatedly kept in the dark about where they were going. Some say they were threatened by immigration agents with long-distance transfers and separation from their families if they did not accept voluntary deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said that immigrants in custody are informed about their transfers and allowed to contact their families throughout their detention. “Claims that transfers of detainees are being ‘weaponized’ or ‘hidden’ are also categorically false,” the DHS said.

The ‘black hole’ where immigrants disappear

The GlobalX flight manifests show that a small regional airport in Alexandria, Louisiana, has become the transfer and deportation hub of Trump’s mass deportation program. Twenty thousand migrant detainees passed through the Alexandria airport at a rate of almost 200 a day during the first 100 days of Trump’s second term.

The Alexandria staging facility, which opens up directly on to the airport tarmac, allowing immigration authorities easy access to Ice charter flights, is supposed to hold detainees for a maximum of 72 hours.

The Guardian reviewed detailed DHS data, interviewed 10 former Alexandria detainees or their loved ones, and reviewed legal filings and contract documents to reveal that the center is routinely holding people for longer than 72 hours, is accused of a pattern of due process violations, and has been abruptly absolved of certain healthcare standards.

Former detainees told the Guardian they could not change their clothes or underwear at all while detained there, experienced lengthy delays in receiving medication and medical care, and in some cases had no telephone access to call their loved ones or legal representatives. The center does not provide any space for legal visitation or confidential legal phone calls, leading some lawyers to label it a “black box”.

The Trump administration has denied that immigrants are being mistreated in detention and said “Ice has higher detention standards than most US prisons”. The Geo Group said its facility is never “overcrowded”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/004ee3640db0bf92eda6cf52094082fdf4d9fca3/318_0_3175_2540/master/3175.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=896ed9bc85499a434f8f28c866f0e42d",N,,2025-09-13 12:57:45.316987

The family said ICE had previously assured Harjit that she could remain under supervision with work permits.","A large group gathered in El Sobrante to show support for Harjit Kaur, a 73-year-old grandmother and longtime Hercules resident who was recently detained by ICE on Monday.

Her family says Kaur has no criminal record and has complied with immigration check-ins every six months for more than a decade.

About 200 people gathered at the intersection of Appian Way and San Pablo Damn Road Friday evening. Demonstrators carried signs that read ""Hands off our grandma"" and ""She’s no criminal,"" as several cars honked in support.

Family fights for answers and access to care

Kaur has lived in the Bay Area since the early 1990s. Her family says she has worked as a seamstress in Berkeley for decades and has complied with every immigration check-in in San Francisco, every six months, for the past 13 years.

But on Monday, without warning, she was detained at the San Francisco ICE office while returning a travel application requested by ICE. Her family says no explanation was given when she was detained, and they are worried she has not had access to all of her medication.

The family noted that for the first time, during a routine check-in in August, ICE did not allow any family members to accompany her inside the building.

During a rare phone call this week, her daughter-in-law, Manjit Kaur, described Harjit’s deteriorating condition.

""Just the sound in her voice yesterday, I could hear the anxiety, I could hear that she's losing her strength, breaking down, I'm very concerned as far as her health. She's not getting her medication,"" Manjit said. ""Emotionally, she's a mess.""

Harjit was moved from San Francisco to a detention center in Bakersfield, and the family has yet to receive any information on why she was detained.

""She’s been here over 30 years, working, paying taxes. I don’t even think she has a speeding ticket, any type of violation like that. She’s a part of the community,"" Manjit said.

Ikjot Sandhu is her first grandchild.

""My grandmother, she was more like a mother to me. For the last 26 years, she’s been taking care of me,"" Sandhu said.

Her niece, Sukhjit Kaur, expressed frustration and sadness over the situation.

""I feel very sad, I feel helpless, I feel like there’s nothing we can do and this is our only voice,"" Sukhjit Kaur said. ""There are thousands of Harjits locked up, everyone’s grandmas, mothers, families, children whose parents have been taken away from them, innocent people.""

Congressman John Garamendi said his office has sent an inquiry to ICE requesting that Kaur be reunited with her family. In a statement, Garamendi said:

""President Trump initially promised to go after the ‘worst of the worst’ in his immigration policy. Yet this administration’s decision to detain a 73-year-old woman—a respected member of the community with no criminal record who has faithfully reported to ICE every six months for more than 13 years is one more example of the misplaced priorities of Trump’s immigration enforcement. Our office will do everything possible to support her case and her family.""

The family said ICE had previously assured Harjit that she could remain under supervision with work permits.

KTVU reached out to ICE for comment and is awaiting a response.

The migrants have been detained for five days in Ghana in “squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility,” called Dema Camp, the complaint says.
The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, asks a judge to immediately halt deportations to their countries of origin.
The lawsuit was filed a day after Ghana’s president confirmed the arrival of the 14 deportees.
The lawsuit says 14 West Africans were taken from their cells at an ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana.","(AP) — Some West Africans who were deported from the U.S. to Ghana were held in “straitjackets” for 16 hours on a flight during which all passengers were shackled and given only bread and water, according to a lawsuit filed Friday.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington on behalf of five migrants, says passengers were awoken in the middle of the night on Sept. 5 and not told where they were going until hours into the flight on a U.S. military cargo plane.

The migrants have been detained for five days in Ghana in “squalid conditions and surrounded by armed military guards in an open-air detention facility,” called Dema Camp, the complaint says. Conditions are “abysmal and deplorable,” with tents for shelter and little running water.

The migrants are not from Ghana and have been told they will be sent to other countries that have been determined to be too dangerous by U.S. immigration judges — making it the latest legal challenge to the Trump administration’s practice of sending people to countries other than their own, including El Salvador, Panama, Costa Rica and several African nations.

The complaint, filed by lawyers for Asian Americans Advancing Justice, asks a judge to immediately halt deportations to their countries of origin.

“Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work,” it says. “Despite the minimal, pass-through involvement of the Ghanaian government, Defendants’ objective is clear: deport individuals who have been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries of origin to those countries anyway, in contravention to the rulings of U.S. immigration judges and U.S. immigration law.”

The Homeland Security Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The lawsuit was filed a day after Ghana’s president confirmed the arrival of the 14 deportees. Ghana joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the U.S., an approach whose legality has been questioned by lawyers and human rights organizations.

President Donald Trump has been aggressively cracking down on immigrants he describes as criminals and “aliens” from countries whose nationals have overstayed their visas in the U.S.

Lawyers and activists have said the Trump administration appears to be making such requests to the nations most affected by his policies on trade, migration and aid.

None of the 14 deportees were originally from Ghana and the five West-Africans who filed the lawsuit did not have ties with the country or designate it as a potential country of removal, according to the complaint.

Plaintiffs are identified only by initials in the complaint. Four are “in immediate danger of being sent on, within hours, to their countries.” One has already been removed to The Gambia and is in hiding, despite having “repeatedly stated his fear” of returning to his country.

Three plaintiffs are from Nigeria and two from The Gambia. The lawsuit says 14 West Africans were taken from their cells at an ICE detention center in Alexandria, Louisiana.

""We've heard some pretty compelling evidence that people are not being given enough food, not being given sanitary supplies, blankets,"" said Eleanor Reid of Hanover, N.H., before the arrests. ""And since our government is not doing that, we are here to do it ourselves.""

Reid, along with Nastasia Lawton-Sticklor of Leominster and Nathan Phillips of Newton, had approached the field office with baskets of sandwiches, granola bars, fruit and other snacks. They said they were concerned about the welfare of immigrants held at the facility, based on reports from former detainees that they weren't given much to eat while in ICE custody there.

""We're here to deliver food and care packages to the people being held here, and visit with them, if possible, to make sure they're doing okay,"" Lawton-Sticklor told WBUR. ""We have some deep concerns about food, basic necessities, being withheld from them.""

The ICE field office is a large two-story building located in a busy office park near the Burlington Mall. As the agency's New England regional headquarters, it's primarily a place where immigrants go for regular check-ins with officials. But it also serves as an intake center, where people get booked in after an ICE arrest.

Former detainees and immigration lawyers have described conditions inside the field office as ""abysmal"" and ""inhumane."" People were crowded into windowless rooms where, if they even had room to lie down, they had to sleep on cement floors. There was little privacy and no access to showers. And food rations were meager.

ICE has insisted that it provides adequate food and medical care to detainees.

Around 10:30 am Friday, the three activists knocked on the glass door of the building and asked to go inside to deliver the food.

A man wearing a navy jacket with the words ""Police E-R-O"" on the back — which stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations, a division of ICE — told them no visitors are permitted inside the building and they weren't accepting deliveries.

What then unfolded was a tense back-and-forth between the activists and a few federal agents. Officials tried to get the three to leave the front entryway, but they refused. They sat on the far edge of the stairway entrance, where they said they weren't obstructing people from access to the building.

During the 90-minute standoff, several people entered and exited the building. At one point, a man in plain clothes stuck his head out of the front door and told the activists, onlookers and the media to ""go f*ck off.""

A little while later, several Burlington police officers arrived. They also tried to convince the protesters to leave, but the trio sat tight. About 45 minutes later, the officers handcuffed and arrested them.

The trio were charged with one count of trespassing. They were arraigned in Woburn District Court and released on the condition they stay away from the Burlington office. They have a pre-trial hearing scheduled for October.

""We notified them that they were to move, to remove themselves from the operational area of the main doors, and they refused to do that,"" said Captain Hanafin, a Burlington Police Department officer who responded to the scene. ""It's disruptive, and it's frankly a security issue to have people there in protest when there's operational things that happen.""

He went on to call the arrests ""unfortunate,"" saying the department wasn't ""looking to arrest anyone.""

Demonstrators say agents allegedly detained Willian Gimenez on Friday as he was entering a Little Village barbershop near Cermak and Washtenaw with his wife.

His attorney describes him as kind, hardworking and someone seeking asylum in the United States.

""My client's detention and my inability to speak with him and to assure his well-being is intact is not a mistake. He is exactly who the administration fears and targets,"" said Kevin Herrera, Gimenez's attorney.

Gimenez's advocates say the Department of Homeland Security has not notified them where exactly he was taken.

They say when they tried to find him at the Broadview processing facility, but immigration officials would not open the door.

""The community assembled here knows that people hold the powerful to account. We will fight for Willian and see to it that he is free to be with us in Chicago,"" Herrera said.

Advocates say Gimenez's arrest was not an accident, noting that he is reportedly outspoken against targeted arrests on day laborers allegedly carried out by Home Depot and off-duty Chicago police officers working as private security.

""This is a chilling step and a political obsession to round up as many immigrants as they can, mostly hardworking, law-abiding people,"" said Rep. Chuy Garcia.

Gimenez's supporters, who say he is a day laborer himself, said he was denied due process, calling his alleged detainment an abuse of power and an act of retaliation.

""The Department of Homeland Security has become the department of state terror. The department that is responsible for protecting the people from foreign terror has become the department of state terror,"" said Rep. Delia Ramirez.

ABC7 reached out to DHS regarding the allegations made by Gimenez' advocates but did not immediately hear back.

Gimenez's attorneys say they plan to file a petition calling for justice in his case in the coming days.

Saturday's press conference came after protesters gathered outside that ICE detention center on Friday, with video showing what appears to be pepper balls being used against some of the demonstrators that evening. Video also shows at least one demonstrator being dragged away.

Demonstrations were also seen in other northwest suburbs on Friday night after an ICE agent allegedly shot a man to death in Franklin Park earlier in the day.

Federal agents say they were trying to make a traffic stop when Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a man DHS says was undocumented with a criminal history of reckless driving, allegedly drove at the officer, dragging him in the process.

That's when, officials say, the officer fired shots, striking Villegas-Gonzalez, who later died at the hospital.

Cellphone video obtained by ABC7 shows the moment ICE officers removed the man from his crashed car near Grand and Elder Lane. ABC7 froze the video since it is too graphic to show.

DHS said in a statement, in part, ""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement.""

Villegas-Gonzalez' girlfriend and stepdaughter, who asked ABC7 not to show their faces, say he was a working 38-year-old father of three from Mexico who has lived in the United States for more than 20 years.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called Friday's events in Franklin Park troubling.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered Trump’s Republican administration to change its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website after plaintiffs’ lawyers said temporary protected status holders were still in detention centers or unable to return to work even after his Sept. 5 judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Chen said on Thursday his Sept. 5 order in favor of TPS holders went into effect immediately.

That ruling found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had unlawfully canceled temporary protected status, or TPS, extensions granted by President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians.

TPS is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States if their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

William Weiland, an attorney with the Department of Justice, said the judge had not ordered the government to update its website. Weiland also argued in court documents that the Sept. 5 judgment did not take effect immediately unless specifically ordered.

Chen said in his Thursday order that the rule cited by the government did not apply to these types of cases. The previous day, he denied the government’s request to stay his judgment while it appeals.

Lawyers for plaintiffs say people with temporary protected status are at risk of losing their jobs and more. They submitted a court declaration stating that a San Antonio man detained in May was told he will not be released until the website is updated.

Another declaration is from a TPS holder who has worked in an Amazon warehouse for three years. The person was told by human resources that a copy of the Sept. 5 court order and letter from an immigration attorney was not enough to authorize employment.

A federal judge ruled on Friday ICE agents can continue making courthouse arrests in New York City, shutting down a challenge brought by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups.

District Judge P. Kevin Castel, a George W. Bush appointee, found there was not enough evidence to suggest that ICE's courthouse arrest policy changes were ""unexplained, arbitrary and capricious"" after 2021 guidance allowed arrests at or near immigration courts.

Noting the 2025 guidance is more ""expansive and permissive,"" Castel acknowledged ICE made the changes because local correctional facilities and prisons, which are considered ""safe"" locations due to security screenings, are not available due to state and local policies regarding immigration detainers.

FEDERAL JUDGE REJECTS MILWAUKEE JUDGE'S IMMUNITY CLAIM IN ICE OBSTRUCTION CASE

However, the judge did block a Department of Justice policy encouraging immigration judges to dismiss cases so ICE could immediately arrest migrants.

The Trump administration in June launched an initiative to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings.

The tactic stirred controversy, with critics claiming migrants seeking legal citizenship would be less likely to show up to hearings, and those who are arrested after hearings may not have additional criminal histories.

""Every day, our members are forced to choose between being kidnapped and/or put into expedited removal or risking deeper legal consequences because they're too scared to go to court.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta.

We’re grateful that a district court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”","California has secured a court order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from barring immigrants living in the country illegally from accessing dozens of federally funded programs, including child care, health care and education services.

As part of the Trump administration’s proposed change, federally funded programs would be required to verify recipients’ immigration status — reversing a Clinton administration policy that extended “public benefit” programs to people living in the country without legal permission. The Trump administration said the change was necessary to ensure taxpayer-funded “public resources are no longer used to incentivize illegal immigration.”

The new court order comes a few months after California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 20 other state leaders sued the administration over the policy change in July.

In July, the California-led coalition secured a temporary pause preventing the administration from implementing the changes before Sept. 10. The new preliminary injunction — signed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island — blocks the Trump administration from implementing the changes indefinitely while litigation continues.

Programs included in the Trump administration’s restriction would include childcare services for low-income families, adult education, mental health and substance use disorder programs, temporary housing assistance, food banks, cooling centers and shelters for at-risk youth and domestic violence survivors, among others.

The proposed restriction would also include Head Start — a national program that serves more than 750,000 low-income children aged 0 to 5-years old across the U.S. The program provides free school meals and medical screenings, child care, and support and job assistance for parents.

Bonta and state leaders said that in addition to causing irreparable harm to vulnerable families, the proposed restrictions barring some immigrants from participation would have a “chilling effect” on all participants of the programs, regardless of immigration status. The states’ lawsuit also said the proposed verification requirements would cost states’ economies hundreds of millions of dollars.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Attorney General Bonta. “The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back.

Citizen and advocacy groups in New Jersey say they are frustrated by the Democratic legislature’s inaction to protect the state’s vulnerable populations.

Louise Walpin, co-leader of WADEIn New Jersey, said there has been a “blue trifecta of failure” because Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, Democratic State Senate President Nick Scutari and Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin have collectively failed to enact laws shielding the state’s immigrant, transgender and disabled communities from the “White House’s draconian policies.”

“It’s time to stand up like other states have, like California has, like Illinois has,” she said.

She said Garden State residents have been harmed by the ongoing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, President Donald Trump’s directive to cancel gender affirming care for transgender federal employees and White House policies denying disabled people access to needed care.

The three stalled bills

The Immigrant Trust Act, first introduced one year ago, aspired to codify protections currently in place through the Immigrant Trust Directive, a set of rules that limits how much local and state law enforcement officials can cooperate with federal immigration officials. The directive may be revoked, depending upon who the next governor is.

After it was formally introduced, the Immigrant Trust Act was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Assembly Oversight, Reform and Federal Relations Committee, but hearings have not been scheduled in either house.

In June 2024, a bill was introduced to codify protections for necessary healthcare for transgender patients and their providers. It was referred to the Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Citizens Committee, and the Assembly Health Committee, but hearings have not been scheduled in either house.

Last October, legislation to help those with developmental disabilities was introduced in the Assembly. It was referred to the Aging and Human Services Committee, but no hearing has been scheduled, and the measure has not been assigned to a committee yet in the Senate.

Walpin said it’s disturbing that all of these bills have stalled in Trenton.

“Our legislature and our governor are not exercising the power that they do have to protect the most vulnerable among us,” she said. “We need to do this before the election because we do not know for sure whether we will still have a blue trifecta come the election.”

Spokespersons for Murphy and Coughlin declined to comment on pending legislation. Scutari’s office did not immediately respond.

A long and winding road

Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan University Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said it’s not surprising that there has not been movement on these bills because the legislative process is frequently long and complicated.

“There’s some 10,000 bills that are introduced in the New Jersey Legislature each year, and first they have to go to a committee. If it spends money, it goes to an additional committee,” he said.

He said a variety of factors may be considered before a bill can move forward, and that can take weeks or months.

“The Senate president and the Assembly speaker, the two top ranking officials in each body, have the authority to either post or not post the bill,” Dworkin said.

He added that some measures must be considered by two committees, then the bill may have amendments and need to be revisited. Legislation that is passed in committee may also be frozen by the Senate president or Assembly speaker for strategic reasons.

If a bill makes it to the full Senate or the Assembly, it must pass by a majority vote, and the process must be repeated by the other house. He said different issues may be raised in one house that were not considered controversial in the other, and those must be ironed out.

After both the Senate and Assembly pass a measure, it’s sent to the governor for consideration. The governor may sign the measure into law or he can ignore it, or he may conditionally veto it and send it back to lawmakers for one or more changes in language or policy, which can take even more time.

A question of priorities?

Walpin rejects the notion that getting things done legislatively in New Jersey has to be a long, complicated process.

She said when legislators wanted to raise their own salaries from $49,000 to $82,000 last year, a bill was introduced and passed in two weeks.

“When it comes to passing bills that benefit minority citizens,” she said, “then all of a sudden there’s an outcry that these [bills] are controversial and they just can’t possibly pass it.”

Maura Collinsgru, the director of policy and advocacy for New Jersey Citizen Action, agreed that state leaders are not doing enough.

“You know we have people taking to the streets to protect their loved ones, who are being unfairly and inhumanely rounded up, discriminated against, and people are having their health benefits and more cut and taken from them,” she said. “We really need elected leaders to stand up with us and speak out, and engage more directly in the fight.”

Dworkin said the job of legislators is to respond to the voters, but there are different constituencies that have many different agendas.

“The New Jersey Legislature can move quickly when it absolutely has to, but other than that, no, they tend to go pretty slow,” Dworkin said. “While any number of different groups will be advocating on behalf of their worthy causes it doesn’t mean that the legislature will move.”

He said politicians usually want to make sure the public is behind the actions they take.

“They want to make sure they don’t get too far ahead, because that’s when you stop being in the majority,” he said.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually.","BOSTON — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Trump administration can end legal protections for around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

""We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,"" the judges wrote. ""But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.""

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn't change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling ""hurts everyone.""

""People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government's end of the bargain,"" Sung said. ""While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.""

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration's decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a ""gargantuan task"" that would slow the government's efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

""The Secretary's discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,"" lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court's finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

""The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem's action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,"" attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration's decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it ""the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.""",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/haiti_migrants_AP_25014405482822_NAT_0913,N,,2025-09-13 11:00:33.431122

The three-judge panel of the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals — all of them Democratic appointees — said the law does, in fact, give Mr. Trump the power to revoke parole programs root and branch.

The judges also said Homeland Security adequately explained why it was altering course from the Biden administration to revoke the programs early.

Circuit Judge Gustavo Gelpi, writing for the court, said they were cognizant of the potential impact on half a million Venezuelan, Cuban, Nicaraguan and Haitian migrants at issue in the case, but Mr. Trump appears to be following the law in ordering them to wrap up their time here and leave.

The judges’ decision Friday was a significant victory for Mr. Trump, blessing one of his more consequential immigration policy changes.

President Biden had used parole to allow millions of illegal immigrants who lacked visas or formal permission to enter the U.S. to do so anyway.

Previously, parole had usually been used on a case-by-case basis in instances where there was an urgent humanitarian interest or the government had a particular need to let someone in — such as to serve as a witness in a criminal case.

Mr. Biden created near-categorical programs that doled out passes at a rate of thousands a day, justifying it by saying they were going to come illegally anyway and this way they could be funneled into safer and more orderly pathways.

He also suggested some might claim asylum later.

When Mr. Trump took office, he had Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem end the parole programs and go back to only limited grants in specific cases.

District Judge Indira Talwani, an Obama appointee to the court in Massachusetts, said the new administration should have revoked each of the hundreds of thousands of paroles separately.

Judge Gelpi said that’s not the way the law reads.

“The district court held that the statutory text ‘contemplate[s] termination of parole on an individual, rather than categorical, basis.’ We read the statute differently,” Judge Gelpi wrote.

The specific parole program in the case — known by the acronym CHNV for the four nations involved — allowed the migrants to enter as long as they sought someone to promise to be a financial sponsor, and they agreed to fly into U.S. airports, bypassing the actual border.

Other Biden parole programs allowed migrants massed in northern Mexico to enter along the southern boundary as long as they pre-scheduled their arrivals. And the Biden administration used parole to welcome tens of thousands of Afghans and Ukrainians amid turmoil in their countries.

Immigrant rights groups were dismayed by the decision, saying it could undercut all of those programs.

Supporters contend it strengthens border security and creates stronger deterrents against repeated illegal entry.
Imposing longer sentences, the group said, would massively expand the federal prison population without improving border security.
Sentencing Commission that similar proposals, such as “Kate’s Law,” could have increased the federal prison population by nearly 60,000 within five years.","WASHINGTON — The House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly passed H.R. 3486, the “Stop Illegal Entry Act of 2025,” a measure that would impose steep mandatory minimum sentences and even potential life sentences on asylum seekers, teenagers, and immigrant families attempting to reunite.

The legislation, introduced as part of President Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, was among the first taken up after Congress returned from its August recess. While it passed, the margin was close, with dozens of lawmakers breaking from earlier support for mandatory detention bills and signaling growing resistance to the administration’s hardline agenda.

The measure would shift many immigration violations from the civil system into the federal criminal system, expanding penalties to levels normally reserved for violent crimes such as murder. Under its provisions, asylum seekers who attempt to re-enter the United States after being denied could face up to 10 years in prison, and individuals with prior convictions — even for minor offenses such as shoplifting — could face life sentences.

Critics argue that the bill represents one of the most extreme expansions of federal sentencing in modern history, effectively transforming the immigration system into another driver of mass incarceration. Supporters contend it strengthens border security and creates stronger deterrents against repeated illegal entry.

Mike Zamore, National Director of Policy and Government Affairs at the American Civil Liberties Union, condemned the legislation. “H.R. 3486 would supercharge President Trump’s reckless deportation drive, which is already damaging our economy and destabilizing communities,” Zamore said. “This legislation would hand the Trump administration more tools to criminalize immigrants and terrorize communities at the same time they are deploying federal agents and the military to our streets. It would also undermine public safety by diverting more resources away from youth services and prevention programs that actually improve community safety.”

Zamore added that the narrow margin in the House offered some encouragement. “While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the Members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation. At a time when a president is threatening American cities and the Supreme Court is greenlighting racial profiling, it is vital that a growing number of elected officials are standing together in rejecting Stephen Miller’s dystopian agenda to criminalize and demonize people who come to this country seeking a better life.”

Immigrant rights organizations echoed the alarm. Advocates for Human Rights called the bill “costly, dangerous, and a violation of foundational human rights principles,” warning that it would criminalize asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution, force trafficking survivors into prolonged detention, and separate families for decades or even life over immigration status.

The group said the legislation would undermine public safety by driving immigrant communities further into the shadows. Victims and witnesses of crimes, they said, would be less likely to report to police, while law enforcement would be forced to divert resources away from serious investigations to pursue immigration violations. They warned that building new prisons to accommodate the bill’s mandates would cost billions, further fueling what is already the highest incarceration rate in the world.

The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) also urged a “no” vote, describing the bill as “extreme” and “disproportionate.” In its analysis, AILA said the legislation would equate nonviolent immigration violations with crimes such as murder, resulting in incarceration “for long periods of a decade or even life” for people who have no history of violent offenses.

AILA noted that illegal entry and reentry prosecutions are already among the most common federal charges, with more than 40,000 people prosecuted in the first nine months of 2025. Imposing longer sentences, the group said, would massively expand the federal prison population without improving border security. It pointed to earlier estimates from the U.S. Sentencing Commission that similar proposals, such as “Kate’s Law,” could have increased the federal prison population by nearly 60,000 within five years.

The group also questioned the deterrent effect of such penalties, citing a 2015 Department of Homeland Security report that concluded Customs and Border Protection (CBP) could not demonstrate that its “Operation Streamline” program — which rapidly prosecuted unlawful border crossers — was effective in preventing future entries.

AILA warned that the legislation would have far-reaching consequences. Under the bill, the penalty for unlawful reentry after deportation would increase from two years to 10 years. Anyone committing a nonviolent felony or even a minor offense such as shoplifting after reentering could face a mandatory 10-year sentence and possible life imprisonment. Someone denied asylum three times at the border who attempted to return a fourth time could also face up to 10 years in prison.

Advocates argue that rather than expanding criminal penalties, Congress should pursue comprehensive immigration reform that provides legal pathways, invests in immigration courts to reduce backlogs, and focuses enforcement on genuine threats to public safety such as drug and weapons smuggling.

“HR 3486 represents what’s wrong with our current approach to immigration: exceedingly harsh, expensive, and ineffective,” Advocates for Human Rights said in a statement. The organization urged lawmakers to vote no and instead “support comprehensive immigration reform that actually addresses our challenges.”

For immigrants, the stakes are high. Survivors of torture and trafficking could be imprisoned for acts they were forced to commit. Families could be torn apart for decades. And asylum seekers fleeing life-threatening violence could face prosecution simply for attempting to find safety.

Opponents see the bill as a dangerous fusion of mass incarceration and anti-immigrant politics. They say it threatens not only immigrant communities but also broader principles of due process and human rights.

Despite strong opposition, the legislation now moves to the Senate, where its prospects are uncertain. Immigration hardliners have pledged to push the measure through, while advocates are mobilizing to stop what they describe as one of the most extreme immigration laws in U.S. history.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Two housing advocacy groups have filed a sweeping federal lawsuit accusing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of unlawfully hijacking $75 million in permanent supportive housing funds to advance the Trump administration’s social agenda.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness, a Washington-based nonprofit, and the Women’s Development Corporation of Rhode Island filed the 33-page complaint on Sept. 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. They are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to stop HUD from carrying out what they describe as an unlawful and rushed award process.

The lawsuit argues that HUD was prepared to award the funds to qualified projects, having already reviewed applications and even notified members of Congress about which projects were selected. Days before the money was set to expire, however, HUD issued a new notice of funding opportunity with dramatically different criteria. The complaint says the change came with only a one-week application deadline and imposed “an ideological threshold” on applicants.

According to the filing, the new notice “disqualifies from consideration any entity seeking to build housing in a jurisdiction with policies the Administration disfavors.” That includes states and cities that have not adopted Trump administration positions on homelessness, immigration enforcement, and drug policy. The lawsuit alleges that the agency has gone even further by requiring applicants to renounce harm reduction practices such as safe consumption sites, and to affirm the administration’s stance that “sex is binary and immutable.”

The complaint said, “HUD does not have authority to do this—and the Constitutional does not permit it. In our constitutional system, Congress controls the purse strings and decides what funding to provide, for what purposes, and under what criteria. And states and localities decide what policies to adopt and implement in their own local jurisdictions. HUD has transgressed both these bounds.”

The plaintiffs said HUD’s new rules not only intrude on state and local powers but also violate federal statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act, the Spending Clause, the Tenth Amendment, and the First Amendment. The lawsuit contends the new requirements amount to “coercing” states and localities to abandon their own policies in order to secure federal funds.

The groups point to a series of executive orders issued earlier this year by President Trump, which directed agencies to withhold or condition funding from jurisdictions deemed uncooperative on immigration enforcement or insufficiently punitive toward people experiencing homelessness. HUD’s new criteria, the complaint argues, are a direct extension of those orders.

The filing details how the administration’s approach frames homelessness as a criminal issue rather than a social challenge, penalizes jurisdictions with sanctuary policies, and cuts off funding for organizations that provide gender-affirming services or harm reduction programs. The lawsuit alleges these conditions are unrelated to the purpose of the funding Congress appropriated and instead serve to enforce the administration’s political ideology.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness, which represents a broad coalition of providers, government entities, and advocates, said many of its members have been rendered ineligible either because of where they operate or because they refuse to abandon inclusive policies. The Women’s Development Corporation, a nonprofit that develops affordable housing in Rhode Island, was specifically identified. HUD had notified Congress earlier this year that WDC was selected for an award under a prior notice of funding opportunity, but under the September 5 notice, the group is now excluded because Rhode Island is listed among jurisdictions deemed noncompliant on immigration and sex offender registry enforcement.

The complaint describes the timeline as unworkable. Applications were due September 12, just one week after the notice was published, and HUD intends to distribute the funds to the first eight applicants who pass its new “threshold” and “merit” criteria. Plaintiffs argue that such a process leaves virtually no opportunity to redesign projects, secure local approvals, or line up funding partners, especially since the new criteria also narrow eligibility to projects focused on medical respite for elderly and disabled individuals.

The groups also argue that the new “sex binary” requirement directly conflicts with federal civil rights law, including the Fair Housing Act and Title VII, as well as HUD’s own regulations that guarantee access to housing and services based on gender identity. They say HUD’s conditions unlawfully target applicants based on viewpoint and suppress speech outside the scope of federally funded programs.

The plaintiffs warn that unless the court intervenes, they and their members will be irreparably harmed because the funds will be obligated to others by September 15, effectively shutting them out of competition. They are asking the court to block HUD from enforcing the new criteria, preserve the $75 million beyond its expiration date, and allow the funds to be awarded under lawful conditions.

The complaint notes the broader stakes, arguing that the administration is leveraging homelessness funding to reshape local policy nationwide. It says the criteria amount to a blacklist of jurisdictions — including California, New York, Rhode Island, and dozens of other states — and a loyalty test for nonprofits that operate programs serving unhoused people.

The case is being led by attorneys from Democracy Forward Foundation, the National Homelessness Law Center, the ACLU of Rhode Island, and cooperating local counsel. They contend the new HUD process is “shockingly unlawful” and must be halted before it causes further harm to providers and the communities they serve.

Except it never happened. There was no ruling that the foreign offender should be allowed to stay in Britain because his child was a picky eater. An immigration tribunal did initially decide that it would be “unduly harsh” for the boy to be sent to Albania because of his special educational needs, but this judgment was later overturned. A more senior judge rejected the man’s appeal and made absolutely clear that an aversion to chicken nuggets should never be enough to prevent deportation.

‘Withdrawing from the ECHR would have little bearing on stopping asylum seekers from coming’

Prof Francesca Klug

This was not an isolated case. There was the Iranian criminal “spared deportation so he can cut his son’s hair”, the mass murderer who claimed that having access to hardcore porn was his human right and the Afghan migrant who could not be extradited to Belgium “because of mosquitoes” in the prison.

The political debate around human rights law is shot through with myths and misinformation, going back to former prime minister Theresa May’s suggestion in 2011 that an ­illegal immigrant could not be deported because “he had a pet cat”. In fact, the critical factor was his long-term partner.

The ECHR is held up by politicians on the left and the right as the block on everything from tackling the small boats crisis to deporting foreign criminals. But a recent report by the University of Oxford’s Bonavero Institute found that only 0.73% of foreign national offenders had successfully appealed against deportation on human rights grounds.

The number of successful appeals based on human rights is tiny as a proportion of the number of foreign criminals who are deported from the UK each year – around 3.5%, and just 2.5% when looking at appeals on private and family life grounds. The ECHR in Strasbourg, which interprets the convention, has ruled against the UK only three times in the past 45 years in cases relating to immigration rules.

The ECHR, drafted in the aftermath of the second world war mainly by British lawyers and signed in 1950, protects fundamental rights including freedom from torture, free speech, liberty and family life. The Human Rights Act, which embeds the ECHR in UK law, has helped secure justice for the families of those killed in the Hillsborough disaster and uphold the rights of disabled people and care home residents during the pandemic.

Keir Starmer, pictured at his graduation, long considered the ECHR his ‘lode star’, says his biographer

Now, however, the convention has become a defining dividing line at Westminster – a test of ideological purity on the right and a way of demonstrating radicalism on the left. For Eurosceptics, withdrawing from a treaty overseen by a Strasbourg court is unfinished business after Brexit. For Labour MPs with “red wall” constituencies in the north of England and the Midlands, hostility to the ECHR is a way of signalling intent to deal with illegal immigration.

The issue is set to dominate the party political conference season – which kicks off this week with the Liberal Democrats gathering in Bournemouth – as Labour and the Conservatives attempt to see off the threat from Reform UK. Farage has promised that if he becomes prime minister, the “first thing” he will do is “get rid of the ECHR”. Last week Richard Tice, Reform’s deputy leader, pledged to set up an immigration “department of believers” staffed by civil servants who favour severing links with the convention.

Senior Tories expect Badenoch, the Conservative leader, to use her conference speech to announce her support for withdrawal as part of a broader package of reform. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, has long advocated leaving, insisting last year that his party would “die” unless it promised to pull out.

The shadow attorney general David Wolfson, who has been conducting a review of the impact of the ECHR, has produced more than 200 pages of closely argued legal analysis, including around 500 footnotes, which will set out the problems created by the convention and other international treaties. The conclusion is understood to be that leaving the ECHR is “necessary but not sufficient” for the UK to take back control of its borders. “It’s certainly legally possible, and it will make a difference, but it’s not a silver bullet on its own,” one senior Tory says.

The government is close to ann­ouncing its own reforms. Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, is planning a “twin track” approach and intends to move fast, according to an ally. She will introduce legislation within weeks to clarify the interpretation of the ECHR in British courts, particularly the “right to private and family life” protections covered by article 8 of the convention. Over time, she is determined to work with other countries that also want to see wider changes to the ECHR and the way in which it is applied.

Richard Hermer, the attorney general, has become convinced that the government needs to act to deal with growing public concern over human rights laws. He told the Lords constitution committee last week that “nothing sensible or practical or effective will be off the table” to deal with the small boats crossing the Channel.

“There’s definitely scope for reform,” one source close to the government’s main legal adviser says. “His view would be that a lot of the challenges we are facing are about how our domestic courts apply the law, and clarificatory legislation could help... But there is also a longer-term agenda here, as we know mass migration is going to continue, which we should be open to exploring.”

Alex Chalk, the former Conservative lord chancellor, says that when he was in government he detected a “palpable enthusiasm” for change among other countries, including the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany. “There’s no reason why the UK can’t be really quite forward leaning on this and say: ‘This is what we think should happen.’ I know from being in Strasbourg that we have enormous influence there.

“The fallacy is to assume that this is all about the ECHR and you don’t need to worry about the broader context. The truth is the refugee convention needs updating, the international covenant on civil and political rights needs updating, and several other pieces of international law besides. Although there is currently a fashionable fixation on one piece of international law, it would be a great mistake to assume that’s where all the problems reside. Urgent and wholesale reform is required – but it’s got to be coherent and wide-ranging.”

Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice wants to set up an immigration civil servant ‘department of believers’

Professor Francesca Klug, a human rights expert, says: “Withdrawing from the ECHR is like a sacrifice to the gods. It would have little bearing on stopping asylum seekers from coming over on small boats, but it would severely reduce cooperation with other European states.”

There are also practical difficulties. The ECHR is embedded in the Good Friday agreement, which underpins peace in Northern Ireland. Akiko Hart, the director of Liberty, argues that the ECHR has become a “useful political scapegoat”, with rival parties offering “disingenuous solutions”.

David Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, has called for elements of the convention to be suspended temporarily, while Jack Straw, the former foreign secretary, has suggested that the Human Rights Act could be amended to state that British courts do not have to take account of the ECHR.

But Charlie Falconer, the former Labour lord chancellor, says the idea of suspending or withdrawing from the ECHR is “very dangerous” because it makes human rights conditional rather than fundamental.

“The political pressure now is to abandon rights for immigrants, but if the government feels they can do that for asylum seekers then there is essentially no limitation on what the government may do in other areas where there is political pressure. The ECHR is the guarantor.”

Charles Clarke, the former Labour home secretary, believes it would be “madness” to break with the ECHR. “I think this is an entirely false debate. I don’t believe that if we withdraw from the ECHR it would change a thing in the sense that the rights which the ECHR gives to people are broadly speaking the same rights that existed under British law before the Human Rights Act.”

For prime minister Keir Starmer, a human rights lawyer, this is personal. His biographer Tom Baldwin says he “often described the ECHR and the conception of human dignity defined within it as his ‘lode star’ that had guided him through every major decision in his life”.

The PM’s maiden speech as an MP was about how the ECHR can help people with issues such as housing, and he used his first foreign summit at Blenheim – the birthplace of Winston Churchill, who had been instrumental in drawing up the document – to reaffirm his own and the UK’s commitment to the ECHR.

“Both in public and in private since, Starmer has said he has no intention of joining Russia and Belarus as the only countries on the European continent who are not signatories to it,” Baldwin says.

“Those in the Labour party now suggesting that the prime minister should leave the ECHR either have no knowledge of who their prime minister is or perhaps just don’t care.”",https://cdn.observer.co.uk/media/original_images/52966.jpeg,N,,2025-09-13 08:57:40.680285

By Reuters

A federal appeals court rejected on September 12 a challenge by immigrant rights advocates to the decision by US President Donald Trump's administration to revoke the temporary legal status of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans living in the United States.

The Boston-based 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a ruling by US District Judge Indira Talwani, who had decided that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the discretion to end the immigration ""parole"" granted to about 430,000 migrants under Democratic former President Joe Biden.

The US Supreme Court in May put Talwani's April ruling on hold, allowing the parole terminations to take effect while the litigation played out.

Judge Gustavo Gelpí, writing for a three-judge 1st Circuit panel, said Noem's action forced parolees who entered the United States lawfully to have to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the United States and risk being detained and deported.

But Gelpí said lawyers for a class of migrants pursuing the case had failed to make a strong showing that Noem lacked authority under a law called the Immigration and Nationality Act to categorically end their parole. All three judges on the panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.

The Biden administration, starting in 2022, let Venezuelans who entered the United States by air request a two-year parole if they passed security checks and had a US financial sponsor. His administration in 2023 expanded that to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans.

Between October 2022 and January 2025, about 532,000 people received grants of parole through those programs. But in March, Noem moved to terminate the parole programs, affecting about 430,000 migrants.

Esther Sung, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the immigrant rights group Justice Action Center, called Friday's ruling ""devastating"" but narrow, adding that ""there's still room for us to prevail as the litigation continues and moves to final judgment.""

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Justice Department, in asking the 1st Circuit to overturn Talwani's decision, pointed to the Supreme Court's action staying her ruling and urged the appeals court to ""reject the plaintiffs' brazen request to defy the Supreme Court.""

The recent immigration board decision upheld the administration’s stance.
In the nationwide lawsuit, the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project is suing with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union.","Immigrants in the United States “without admission” cannot be granted bond by a judge, a federal immigration board ruled in the case of a Whatcom County resident, currently detained.

That means up to millions of people will have to wait in detention for potentially prolonged periods as they face deportation proceedings. The Board of Immigration Appeals published the decision, which applies nationwide, on Friday, Sept. 5.

Gabriel Harrison, lawyer for the detained resident, said the ruling was a major departure from decades of precedent.

Previously, he said, those who had entered without authorization but “established a life” for themselves in the U.S. could get released on bond based on whether a judge thought they were “a flight risk or a danger to society.”

Aaron Korthuis, attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, agreed. Until recently, the law was long interpreted to allow people who entered the U.S. without inspection and weren’t initially apprehended to have bond hearings, he said.

Immigration judges must comply with the appellate board’s ruling unless it is overturned by the Attorney General or a federal court.

In an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote the decision was a “[b]ig win for our [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] attorneys securing our ability to detain illegal aliens until they are deported.”

She added, “The One Big Beautiful Bill includes significant funding for new ICE lawyers.”

The Trump Administration announced in July that immigrants who entered the country without authorization would have to wait in detention for their deportation case to be resolved. The recent immigration board decision upheld the administration’s stance.

Korthuis noted that because so few people are currently entering the U.S., those impacted by the policy are often those who have lived in the country for years — even decades.

“They have U.S. citizen children, maybe even U.S. citizen spouses or family members, and have worked for years or decades in our agriculture or construction industries,” he said, “and simply are people whose home and identity is here in the United States.”

He added that judges in Tacoma Immigration Court have interpreted the law this way for the past couple years, “out of sync with literally the rest of the country.”

Korthuis and other attorneys at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project have two pending class action lawsuits filed earlier this year, challenging the policy on behalf of those detained in Washington and on behalf of those who entered the U.S. without inspection nationwide.

In the nationwide lawsuit, the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project is suing with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union. Suing the government in federal court is “the only means for relief for people at this point,” Korthuis said.

The Tacoma Immigration Court’s website directs media inquiries to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, an agency of the federal Department of Justice.

In an email, Executive Office for Immigration Review spokesperson Kathryn Mattingly wrote, “Immigration judges adjudicate all matters before them on a case-by-case basis.”

“Immigration judges consider all evidence and arguments presented by both parties and decide each case in a manner that is timely, impartial, and consistent with applicable law, regulations, and case precedent, and consistent with due process,” she continued.

She declined to comment on the recent immigration board decision, writing that “the decision speaks for itself.”

Harrison said the immigration board’s ruling “will affect every single person that comes to us now” who entered without inspection and is detained. He expects many people to give up on their case instead of appealing if they lose initially, rather than wait in detention for potentially years.

Korthuis thinks so, too. Detention, he said, is likely the “single most effective means to force people to leave the country.”",https://www.cascadiadaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-Lelo-Vanderhoef-Tacoma-20250513-SO.jpg,N,,2025-09-13 04:56:23.668135

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration’s decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.”",https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2025/09/68c4a33cab6d18.06367320.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-13 11:00:41.550330

In an interview on Friday evening, the lawyers said the case bore similarities to that of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was wrongfully deported to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year and who continues to fight a labyrinthine legal battle as the administration tries to deport him to various African countries. As in his case, the suit, filed in the Federal District Court in Washington, raised the question of whether the administration had defied judges’ orders protecting the migrants.

The Trump administration has brokered deals with several African nations, Rwanda, Uganda, Eswatini and — most recently — Ghana, to accept deported migrants, many of whom have no connection to those countries. Administration officials, under pressure from President Trump to carry out his promised mass deportation operation, have moved swiftly on these so-called third-country deportations.

Lawyers with Asian Americans Advancing Justice, representing the five migrants, accused the administration of using its agreement with Ghana to ignore the legal protections that prevent deportation to their home countries because they fear torture or persecution. In essence, they argued, the administration has enabled an “end run” around those prohibitions, by first removing them to Ghana, and then claiming it is powerless to stop Ghana from sending them to their home countries.

“Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work,” the lawyers said in their filing. “Despite the minimal, pass-through involvement of the Ghanaian government, defendants’ objective is clear: Deport individuals who have been granted fear-based relief from being sent to their countries of origin to those countries anyway, in contravention to the rulings of U.S. immigration judges and U.S. immigration law.”

One type of legal protection for those migrants includes a status called “withholding of removal,” the same protection that should have prevented Mr. Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador.

The initial effort affected over 500,000 migrants across the nation, and DHS advised that those who did not leave voluntarily ""may be subject to enforcement actions, including but not limited to detention and removal, without an opportunity to make personal arrangements and return to your country in an orderly manner.""

The Supreme Court in May issued a single-paragraph decision, unsigned, that granted a stay against an initial order issued by a judge that halted the deportations pending a decision in appeals court. Democrat-appointed Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

What To Know

Today's two-page decision lifts a district judge's ruling that blocked the Trump administration from canceling the ""humanitarian parole"" programs.

The administration sought to continue its deportations while the legal question played out in courts, which the initial order blocked.

Following the Supreme Court's decision, the administration urged the appeals court to make a similar decision, writing in a brief that ""the Secretary's discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter.""

The three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston delivered a final decision Friday evening. Immigrants who entered the U.S. under the program will now lose their permits to work and are at immediate risk of deportation.

""We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court's order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,"" the judges wrote.

""But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay,"" they added.

Lawyers for plaintiffs maintain the district court that issued the initial block ""applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion.""

We start today's other headlines outside Chicago.

The Department of Homeland Security says an ICE officer shot and killed a suspect who had tried to avoid arrest by driving his car into officers. Authorities say the incident took place in the Franklin Park suburb about 18 miles west of Chicago. One officer was hit by the vehicle, was taken to a hospital, and is now in stable condition.

DHS says the suspect was in the country illegally and had a history of reckless driving. The shooting comes amid a broader federal immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

Meantime, President Trump says he's sending National Guard troops to Memphis to address crime there. On FOX News this morning, the president said the state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor are, in his words, happy about the plan.

Later, at a news conference, Mayor Paul Young confirmed his commitment, but made clear he doesn't necessarily agree with the approach.

Paul Young, Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee: I did not ask for the National Guard, and I don't think it's the way to drive down crime. However, that decision has been made. My commitment is to make sure that we work strategically to ensure that this happens in a way that truly benefits and strengthens our community.

Geoff Bennett:

Other Tennessee officials are more critical. The mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, criticized the move in a social media post, saying: ""No one here is happy, not happy at all with the occupation, armored vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and military personnel in fatigues.""

This week, Memphis police reported a decrease across all major crime categories in the first eight months of 2025 compared to previous years.

Missouri's Senate passed a redistricting plan today that could help Republicans pick up an additional seat in Congress. Once signed by the governor, it would make Missouri the third state to change its maps ahead of next year's midterm elections. Texas has already passed a measure that would help Republicans pick up five seats. California countered with a similar plan to aid Democrats, though it still needs voter approval.

Opponents of Missouri's measure are trying to push back, though. They have launched a petition effort to try to force a statewide referendum on the new map.

The Environmental Protection Agency moved today to stop the collection of emissions data from some 8,000 U.S. facilities. The proposal, which still needs to be finalized, would end a program that requires coal-burning power plants and other industrial facilities to report their greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2010, the government has used this data to assess the environmental impact of those sites.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the requirement is — quote — ""nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality."" Critics say the proposal could hurt efforts to fight climate change.

Many of the nation's universities are on heightened alert heading into the weekend after a series of fake threats led schools to cancel classes and even send students home. At least six historically Black colleges and universities have been the targets of such threats in recent days. A similar incident happened at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

At the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland, a midshipman and law enforcement officer were injured after a false report of an active shooter caused confusion on that campus. Both are now in stable condition. The threats come amid heightened tensions following the murder of Charlie Kirk on a campus in Utah, though the FBI says there have been no credible threats so far.

The U.N. General Assembly says it's endorsing what it calls tangible and irreversible steps for a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Today's declaration was boycotted by the U.S. and Israel. It comes ahead of a gathering by world leaders at the U.N. later this month, where Britain, France, and others are expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state.

Ahead of that, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is heading to Israel next week to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to Israeli security. Meantime, in Gaza today, health officials say Israeli strikes killed at least 40 people, most of them in Gaza City. Residents say they are caught in the crossfire.

Fawzi Medna, Resident of Targeted Neighborhood (through interpreter): People are in the streets. Where are they supposed to go? Please look. Where are the people going? We are exhausted. We are unarmed. We belong to no one. We are civilians.

Geoff Bennett:

The latest Gaza strikes come amid ongoing anger among Arab nations over Israel's strike this week targeting Hamas leaders in Doha. Qatar's prime minister was in Washington today meeting with top U.S. officials to discuss the strike. He's also set to meet with President Trump in New York. Qatar will host an emergency summit of Arab leaders on Sunday.

Nepal has a new interim prime minister following that country's worst upheaval in years. Former Supreme Court Justice Sushila Karki took her oath on live television today. She's the first woman ever to head that nation's government. Karki takes the helm after violent protests over a short-lived social media ban forced her predecessor to resign. Protesters torched government buildings and clashed with police. Officials now say at least 51 people were killed.

Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, filed against the Trump administration in the latter case regarding foreign aid.","The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing two Trump administration emergency requests: one involving the removal of a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member and another regardinga freeze on federal foreign aid.

Why It Matters

The Court currently has a 6-3 conservative majority and has ruled in favor of the Trump administration on many key issues including immigration enforcement and cuts at federal government agencies. Over a dozen emergency requests from the Trump administration have been granted by the Court this term.

The cases examine executive power, including the lawfulness and precedent governing removal of FTC commissioners, and whether a president may withhold congressionally appropriated foreign aid.

What To Know

In Trump v. Slaughter, the administration is requesting the Court to halt a ruling that reinstatesan FTC commissioner that Trump fired, Rebecca Slaughter.

Trump first sought to oust the Democratic commissioner in the spring. She sued, and lower courts ordered her reinstated, citing laws that restrict removal of FTC commissioners to cases involving misconduct or neglect of duty.

The Justice Department has maintained that the FTC and similar agencies fall squarely under presidential authority, allowing Trump to remove commissioners without cause. Slaughter, however, argues that her position is protected by law and by decades of legal precedent.

Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily paused lower rulings and directed Slaughter's attorneys to file their response to the government's arguments by September 15.

The second case, Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the administration is seeking to block billions of dollars in foreign aid. Since inauguration day, Trump has worked to pause foreign aid, issuing an executive order on the matter, which led Secretary of State Marco Rubio to freeze payments from the State Department and then now-dismantled U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

A judge ordered the administration to spend $4 billion in foreign aid by September 30; however, Trump's legal team argues the president has the right to propose a rescission, a cancellation of previously approved funds.

Roberts ordered a response to the application be filed by 4 p.m. on Friday.

Amicus briefs have been filed for both cases. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, filed against the Trump administration in the latter case regarding foreign aid.

What People Are Saying

Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, in an amicus brief filed in Trump v. Slaughter: ""Because the President's limited authority to temporarily withhold funds proposed for rescission under the ICA does not permit the President to withhold those funds through their date of expiration without action from Congress, the district court's injunction imposes no greater burden on the government than already exists under that law. The stakes for Congress and the public, however, are high. The fiscal year ends on September 30, less than three weeks from today.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh at the 6th Circuit Judicial Conference last week: ""We all fall short at times, but I think redoubling our efforts on tone, especially when the tone around us is in the public sphere, in the political world, on all sides, is loud, it's probably important.""

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democratic wrote on X in March: ""Donald Trump just illegally fired two independent commissioners at the FTC who fight big corporations that abuse consumers and workers. Why? Trump's billionaire donors expect a return on their investment. He works for them, not you. The courts must reinstate the commissioners.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said earlier in September regarding a Court case pertaining to mass federal firings, per Reuters: ""Yet another win for the Trump administration affirming the president's lawful actions and dismissing the unlawful ruling by a lower court judge.""

The city is “not aware of federal enforcement activity targeting the parade, a large and very public event,” but decided to cancel it at the request of First District Councilmember Mary Zendejas, city spokesperson Jen De Prez wrote in an email.

The decision comes after months of immigration raids across Southern California, during which several thousand people have been arrested or detained by federal agents.

Civil rights groups and activists allege many of the stops are indiscriminate or based on profiling, including raids at Long Beach car washes.

A federal judge and an appeals panel recently agreed, barring officials from conducting “roving patrols” that the court found were targeting people based solely on their perceived ethnicity, language, location or type of work they were performing, but last week, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that sided with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, reversing the lower court and clearing the way for operations to resume.

Long Beach’s vibrant Día de los Muertos parade typically draws hundreds of visitors to downtown, with dozens of floats, folklórico ensembles and mariachi bands traveling along Pine Avenue to celebrate Day of the Dead, a Mexican tradition that involves people paying respects to their deceased friends and family members.

This year’s parade would have marked the 10th in Long Beach. The Arte y Ofrendas Festival at Rainbow Lagoon Park, a two-day, separate ticketed event organized by an outside vendor, will also not take place this year.

Roberto Carlos Lemus, the marketer for last year’s festival and cofounder of Latino Restaurant Week in Long Beach, said the decision to cancel was “unfortunate.”

But, he said, “I get why they’re doing it.”

While organizing next week’s kick-off event for Latino Restaurant Week, Carlos Lemus said he had to take extra precautions himself.

He ultimately decided to hold it at a private venue “because it’s easier to control who comes in and who goes out,” Carlos Lemus said.

At its meeting on Tuesday, the Long Beach City Council approved a motion from Mayor Rex Richardson to push the funding for this year’s parade to next year, making $100,000 available for the 2026 event.

At the same meeting, the City Council approved a $1.85 million budget for the Long Beach Justice Fund, which provides legal representation to residents facing immigration cases.

“The city deeply values the vibrant cultural diversity of its community and is looking forward to continuing our Día de los Muertos Parade next year,” De Prez wrote.

BOSTON — The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the Trump administration today in Svitlana Doe v. Noem, ruling that the administration’s termination of humanitarian parole was lawful. This ruling impacts the lawful parole status and work authorization for half a million “CHNV” humanitarian parole recipients from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This is the first ruling in Svitlana since the Supreme Court granted the Trump Administration’s extraordinary request on May 30 to reverse the district court’s order blocking the termination — even before the First Circuit heard the case on appeal in July.

This decision is specifically about CHNV humanitarian parole, but it has significant implications for the other humanitarian parole programs at issue in the Svitlana litigation, such as Uniting for Ukraine and Operation Allies Welcome — jeopardizing the lawful status of hundreds of thousands more currently living and working in the U.S.

The lawsuit was filed by 18 welcomers, newcomers, and service members, in addition to organizational plaintiff Haitian Bridge Alliance. They are represented by Justice Action Center and Human Rights First.

“The Trump administration is fighting tooth and nail to delegalize as many people as possible, actively creating a larger class of people who are subject to deportation — made up even of those who followed the exact processes the U.S. government required of them,” said Karen Tumlin, Founder and Director of Justice Action Center. “Today’s ruling is an urgent and grave threat to all of us who believe in due process and equal protection under the law, and it has immediate consequences for hundreds of thousands humanitarian parole beneficiaries, their U.S. sponsors, and the communities throughout the country who have benefited greatly from their contributions. Our fight cannot — and will not — end here. We have already returned to the district court to seek a final ruling in this case finding this premature termination unlawful.”

“This has never actually been about ‘legal’ or ‘illegal’ immigrants, rather it’s about stripping the lawful rights from as many vulnerable communities as possible in order to advance a cruel and lawless agenda. Let us not forget that we are talking about people who have done everything the U.S. government has asked of them, yet continue to be targeted by the calculated cruelty of the Trump administration,” said Guerline Jozef, Executive Director and Founder of organizational plaintiff Haitian Bridge Alliance. “To our brothers and sisters in the CHNV program: we see you, we are with you, and we will continue to stand by you as we fight for justice.”

“This ruling is a devastating blow to hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants and their U.S.-based sponsors who welcomed them into their homes and communities, but this is not the end of our legal fight,” said Anwen Hughes, Legal Director of Human Rights First. “We remain firm in our belief that the Trump administration is needlessly and flagrantly flouting U.S. law, and we won’t let this setback keep us from fighting in the courts to pursue justice for our communities.”

For more than 70 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike have established parole processes to advance important American interests, including promoting family unification, advancing urgent humanitarian interests, and enhancing migration management.

“The role that Travis has as an international distribution center for military supplies, equipment, and personnel is critical to everything the military must do.
We’re in constant communication with the base personnel.” Situating ICE jails on military bases can facilitate the swift removal of immigrants from the country.
ICE officials have been seeking a detention center in Northern California, which has a major ICE field office and three immigration courts — in San Francisco, Concord and Sacramento.","While the Trump administration aggressively expands immigration detention nationwide, including a 2,500-bed private prison just opened in California’s Mojave Desert, a controversial plan to build an immigration jail at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield is now on hold.

Rep. Mike Thompson, whose district surrounds the base on three sides, said he was relieved to get a letter last month from the Department of Defense confirming the proposal has been taken off the table, following strenuous opposition.

“I’m pleased, as is Travis, that they decided not to move forward with the detention center on the base. Nobody wanted it,” the North Bay Democrat said. “The base was against it, the community was against it, two members of Congress from there were against it.”

The push to build a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center on the air base came to light in April through internal federal emails obtained by KQED. The emails showed significant coordination among Department of Defense and Homeland Security officials to expedite the plans and tee them up for approval by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

The plan came as a shock to Thompson and Rep. John Garamendi, another Democrat whose district includes the base. They expressed outrage that the Trump administration had not informed them of the plan and concern that using military resources for civilian law enforcement could violate the Posse Comitatus Act and divert from missions such as supplying weapons to Ukraine and allies in the Pacific.

On May 5, the pair fired off a letter to Hegseth saying: “The decision to use Travis AFB as a migrant detention center would both constitute a dangerous militarization of immigration enforcement and unnecessarily degrade military readiness.”

For weeks, opposition mounted, with protests outside the base, constituents calling the congressmen and many local elected officials speaking out, including the mayor of Fairfield.

At a May 29 meeting of the Travis Community Consortium, Travis’ commanding officer, then-Col. Jay Johnson, reported that there had been talks about establishing an ICE facility on the base, but he said that plan had been taken off the table, at least for the time being, according to Garamendi staff who attended the meeting.

Finally, on Aug. 6, the congressmen received an official reply from Assistant Secretary of Defense M. Roosevelt Ditlevson that read, in part: “While DoD remains committed to supporting the Department of Homeland Security within the framework of applicable legal authorities and through approved requests for assistance, Travis AFB will not be designated for migrant detention-related activities at this time.”

Garamendi and Thompson spoke about the shift in plans to KQED this week.

“The argument that Mike Thompson and I made carried the day. Travis is a critical element in our national security,” Garamendi said. “The role that Travis has as an international distribution center for military supplies, equipment, and personnel is critical to everything the military must do. And a detention facility would degrade that mission.”

Garamendi and Thompson called it a win but said they would remain vigilant, as defense officials have approved immigration jails on military bases in other states, including New Jersey and Indiana and a 5,000-bed installation at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.

“With this administration, you don’t really have a clear understanding of what is going to change from one moment to the next,” Thompson said. “So we’re watching it. We’re in constant communication with the base personnel.”

Situating ICE jails on military bases can facilitate the swift removal of immigrants from the country. Although most deportation flights are conducted with ICE Air charter planes, the administration has also conducted at least 85 removal flights on military cargo planes, a new report from Human Rights First found.

Over the last year in California, ICE has held an average of roughly 3,600 people a day across six facilities, all of them private prison operations in Southern California.

ICE officials have been seeking a detention center in Northern California, which has a major ICE field office and three immigration courts — in San Francisco, Concord and Sacramento.

BOSTON (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Trump administration can end legal protections for around 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

The Trump administration’s decision was the first-ever mass revocation of humanitarian parole, attorneys for the migrants said in court papers, calling it “the largest mass illegalization event in modern American history.”",https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump_Venezuela_Immigrants_21434_18ef51.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-09-12 21:57:45.864848

“An estimated two million people who did everything the government asked of them to come to the U.S. through parole can breathe a sigh of relief today,” said Hillary Li, counsel for Justice Action Center. “The district court issued its ruling after reviewing hundreds of pages of legal filings and overseeing hours of oral argument, and that order is as carefully reasoned as it is accurate. The district court recognized the importance of the declarations from direct service providers detailing the horror and harm of courthouse arrests on people all across the country and the urgency of this case. While we are grateful for this outcome, we will remain vigilant to continue to defend the district court’s win and ensure the government’s compliance.”

“We welcome the court’s decision signaling to the Trump administration that it cannot abduct paroled community members and separate them from their families, violating clear, established due process under the guise of expedited removal,” said Ama Frimpong, CASA’s legal director. “We will continue to fight against the administration’s cruel enforcement tactics to ensure that our entire community is protected from its overreach and abuse of power.”

“We will remain vigilant to ensure that our members and others on whose behalf we sued are not being subjected to expedited removal,” said Carl Bergquist, general counsel for CHIRLA. “This administration has tried to use these policies to cruelly and illegally shuttle people out of the country, and we will fight for people who lawfully entered under parole to be treated in the way that the statute demands.”

This week, Tracey Gronniger, Justice in Aging’s Managing Director of Economic Security and Housing, testified in Congress for a hearing on removing barriers to work and supporting opportunity for people with disabilities. Tracey testified on behalf of both Justice in Aging and the Consortium for Constituents with Disabilities (CCD) Social Security Task Force, which Justice in Aging co-chairs.

During the hearing, Tracey urged Congress to ensure access to vital Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits for older and disabled people who are able to and want to work. She pointed to bipartisan solutions for removing barriers to work, such as the SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act. This bill would increase SSI asset limits, allowing more SSI recipients to keep their benefits while working and saving money for basic expenses and emergencies. Tracey also highlighted the need for adequate staffing at the Social Security Administration.

New Census Data on Senior Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage

The U.S. Census Bureau recently published its annual reports on Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the U.S. While other demographics saw poverty rates fall or remain flat, poverty rates for older adults increased and continued to be especially high for older adults of color.

Data confirms that safety net programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) are critical for reducing senior poverty, with Social Security lifting over 28.7 million older adults above the poverty line. In 2024, under the Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), the poverty rate for older adults was 15%, with older adults having the highest poverty rate among all age groups.

Seniors of color also experienced higher poverty rates. Approximately 24% of Black older adults, 19% of Asian older adults, 22.5% of American Indian and Alaska Native older adults, and 28% of Hispanic older adults were living in poverty. These numbers highlight the need to strengthen and expand the programs low-income older adults rely on, including Social Security, SSI, federal rental assistance, Medicaid, and Medicare so that older adults can age with dignity and the resources they need.

As for health insurance coverage, the Census data shows that in 2024 8.2% of people were uninsured. This is an increase from 2023, when the uninsured rate was at a record-low 7.9% due to COVID-related continuous coverage protections for people with Medicaid and enhanced premium tax credits for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplaces.

The uninsured rate, especially among immigrants, is likely to climb more steeply in the next few years due to H.R. 1, which will take Medicaid, Medicare, and ACA coverage away from 10 million people. Another 4.2 million people—including many low-income older adults—will become uninsured next year if Congress allows the enhanced premium tax credits to expire in 2025.

Preliminary Injunction Stops Federal Agencies from Excluding Older Immigrants from Programs and Services

On September 10, a U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction in State of New of York vs. Department of Justice. The lawsuit was brought by 21 states and the District of Columbia against four federal agencies that issued reinterpretations of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA).

The reinterpretations were issued by the Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Education, and Department of Labor in July 2025 and redefined the term “federal public benefit,” thereby excluding immigrants from eligibility for over a dozen federal programs.

Older immigrants are already severely restricted in the types of public benefits they can access. The HHS notice reinterpreting PRWORA would further impede immigrant older adults’ ability to access health care and other supports by implementing immigration verification requirements for programs such as Federally Qualified Health Centers and recipients of Community Services Block Grants.

The agency received over 500,000 comments from advocates and stakeholders over this action. The preliminary injunction enjoins the federal agencies from enforcing their reinterpretations of PRWORA in the states that are part of the lawsuit.

New Memo Issued on Public Charge, but Underlying Regulations Remain Unchanged

On September 5, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a policy memo to USCIS officers on public charge. The guidance does not change the benefits considered under the public charge test, and the Biden Administration’s public charge rule remains in place.

The new memo emphasizes that officers must strictly follow the relevant authorities when making inadmissibility determinations and reminds immigration officers to be critical of an applicant’s propensity to be dependent on government support. For example, if information is missing from an application for lawful permanent residency or adjustment of status, officers must request that information, and a failure to provide it will result in a denial.

Protecting Immigrant Families (PIF) has created an explainer resource about the memo. Justice in Aging will continue to monitor developments regarding public charge and educate our network about the impacts for older immigrants.

Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, said she was relieved and ""really thankful"" the judge applied his decision nationwide.
It included Head Start as a program that must enforce immigration status as a requirement to participate.
Then in July, the Head Start associations amended the complaint to include stopping HHS' immigrant directive.","The head of the Wisconsin Head Start Association is praising a recent court ruling that prohibits the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from barring immigrant families from accessing Head Start services due to their immigration status.

A federal judge in the state of Washington granted a preliminary injunction Sept. 11 that blocks the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from implementing or enforcing its directive that would prevent immigrant families from participating in Head Start based on their immigration status, a Sept. 11 news release from the American Civil Liberties Union said.

The decision applies to any Head Start agencies, program providers, student or family participants or other similar persons and applies to Head Start nationwide, according to the ruling.

Jennie Mauer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association, said she was relieved and ""really thankful"" the judge applied his decision nationwide.

""I think it makes tremendous sense,"" Mauer said. ""It really just, frankly, allows Head Start to keep doing what it's been doing, which is to serve kids and to allow parents to keep going to work.""

The Department of Health and Human Services said it disagrees with the court's decision and is evaluating next steps, according to an emailed statement from HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon.

Head Start programs are federally funded. They provide child care and health care services to children from birth to age 5, their families, as well as to pregnant women, who meet federal low-income guidelines or participate in public assistance services like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

In July, the HHS announced on its website it rescinded a 1998 interpretation of the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 that HHS said ""improperly extended certain federal public benefits to illegal aliens."" It included Head Start as a program that must enforce immigration status as a requirement to participate. Previously, Head Start and certain other services were exempt from doing so.

In April, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of parent groups and Head Start associations in Washington state, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The lawsuit challenged the Trump administration's actions against Head Start such as stopping funding, closing regional offices, laying off staff and banning activities related to ""diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,"" according to an April 28 ACLU news release.

In May, the ACLU filed a motion asking a judge to grant a preliminary injunction to stop the administration's efforts.

The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest twist in a legal fight over Biden-era policies that created new and expanded pathways for people to live in the United States, generally for two years with work authorization. The Trump administration announced in March it was ending the humanitarian parole protections.

“We recognize the risks of irreparable harm persuasively laid out in the district court’s order: that parolees who lawfully arrived in this country were suddenly forced to choose between leaving in less than a month — a choice that potentially includes being separated from their families, communities, and lawful employment and returning to dangers in their home countries,” the judges wrote. “But absent a strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits, the risk of such irreparable harms cannot, by itself, support a stay.”

In a two-page ruling, the court lifted a stay issued by a district court and is allowing the administration to end humanitarian parole for those groups while the lawsuit plays out. The ruling Friday is a victory for the Trump administration but doesn’t change anything on the ground.

Esther Sung, the legal director of Justice Action Center, a co-counsel in the case, said the ruling “hurts everyone.”

“People who came here from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela did everything the government asked of them, and the Trump administration cruelly and nonsensically failed to hold up the government’s end of the bargain,” Sung said. “While we are deeply disappointed by this decision, we will continue to advocate zealously for our clients and class members as the litigation continues.”

A district court issued a stay in April halting the administration’s decision, but the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order at the end of May with little explanation.

The Trump administration had argued the appeals court should follow the Supreme Court and reverse the district court ruling.

The protections for people fleeing turmoil in their home countries were always meant to be temporary, and the Department of Homeland Security has the power to revoke them without court interference, the Justice Department said in a court filing.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that ending parole on a case-by-case basis would be a “gargantuan task” that would slow the government’s efforts to press for the removal of the migrants.

“The Secretary’s discretionary rescission of a discretionary benefit should have been the end of the matter,” lawyers for the government wrote in their brief.

Plaintiffs, including people who benefited from the legal protections, urged the appeals court to endorse the district court ruling, which found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could not categorically end protections for these groups, but instead had to evaluate each case individually. They also cited the district court’s finding that Noem ignored the humanitarian concerns that led to the legal protections in the first place.

“The district court applied the law correctly and did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Secretary Noem’s action inflicted irreparable injury on the class members (among others) and that the public interest and balance of the equities tip sharply in favor of preliminary relief,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief.

Republican President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail to deport millions of people. Since taking office, he has sought to dismantle Biden administration policies that expanded paths for migrants to live legally in the U.S.

“It is interesting that since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of liberty right, including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict on some of these court cases recently,” Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas, told reporters before a roundtable discussion on migration issues hosted by the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life at Georgetown University.

Trump in May signed an executive order creating a religious liberty commission, which includes Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York and Bishop Robert E. Barron of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota. Bishop Seitz noted their presence on the commission, saying, “a couple of our bishops belong to it; and there’s also an advisory committee, more bishops belong to it.”

“So we’re happy for the opportunity to dialog about these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging to an effort to really preserve those First Amendment rights,” he said. “And we hope, maybe, we’ll have a hearing.”

Religious liberty clashes over church’s need to serve migrants, faithful

The church has faced a number of recent situations where religious liberty challenges have intersected with immigration issues.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has waged an attempt to shut down El Paso’s Annunciation House, a Catholic nonprofit serving migrants.

Another flashpoint occurred over the effort to ensure that detainees at “Alligator Alcatraz,” a controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, have access to the sacraments.

Catholic entities also were among the nongovernmental organizations that appeared subject to a probe by the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security about their work with migrants, although that suggestion was later walked back.

Additionally, the nature of immigration enforcement under the Trump administration has affected the participation of some Catholics in worship and seeking the sacraments, with Catholic churches reporting emptier pews as a consequence.

In May, the Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, issued a reminder to the faithful that they are not required to attend Sunday Mass if they fear for their well-being according to the church’s own teaching and canon law. But in July, over in California, Bishop Alberto Rojas of San Bernardino issued a dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass for the faithful if they fear for their well-being amid concern over immigration enforcement raids in the area.

Additionally, a joint report issued in March by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops‘ Migration and Refugee Services, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and World Relief, found that more than 10 million Christians living in the U.S. would be vulnerable to deportation under Trump administration policies implemented in 2025, and that a majority of them were Catholic.

Sensitive locations policy raises church’s stakes

Ashley Feasley, the legal expert in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at The Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law, noted there is bipartisan support for long-standing restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from making arrests at what are seen as sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals.

But when the Trump administration tried to alter that policy, they changed it for a policy that is “less clear.”

“I think this is an area, particularly if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about, you know, what is this policy?” Feasley said. “What can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and access to … the sacraments?”

“I think there are decision-makers there who would understand it that way,” she said.

At the roundtable discussion, Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia who studies the relationship between Catholicism and democracy, said the principles that “guide our reflection on immigration are threefold, one that human beings do have the right to to migrate, but also that countries such as the United States have the right and even the duty to regulate our borders.”

“But a third principle helps us to hold together those two principles that seem to some to be contradictory, that the work of immigration enforcement should be guided by justice and mercy,” said Flores, who is the author of “The Aesthetics of Solidarity: Our Lady of Guadalupe and American Democracy.”

Pastoral challenges and need for immigration reform

Panelists discussed the policy and pastoral challenges presented by a mass deportation effort.

Archbishop Thomas G. Wenski of Miami discussed traveling with the Knights of Columbus by motorcycle to pray the rosary outside “Alligator Alcatraz.”

“The Knights of Columbus was formed for immigrant Catholics, by the founder, Father Michael McGivney,” he said. “So immigration is part of our Catholic story, and that’s to our shame as Catholics that we forget that our grandparents, our great grandparents, were discriminated against precisely because they were Catholic.”

Archbishop Wenski said immigration critics sometimes claim the bishops support immigration “because they want to fill up their emptying pews.”

But he noted they have consistently advocated for comprehensive immigration reform, because “we have a problem in which we have people being broken by the law, not breaking the law.”

“The administration can say that they are enforcing the laws, and they are,” he said. “They are enforcing the laws, laws that are inadequate and antiquated.”

The Illinois Head Start association filed a lawsuit, along with other Head Start and parent advocate groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, to halt the changes to the rules announced by the Trump administration.
The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.
Congress changed the rules of Head Start since its founding in 1965 several times, but never included any immigration or citizenship requirements for Head Start eligibility, Martinez wrote in a 26-page ruling.

Bush.","Head Start preschool programs will continue to welcome all immigrant children regardless of legal status, federal judges ruled in two separate lawsuits this week as it blocked efforts by the Trump administration to restrict enrollment.

The Department of Health and Human Services announced in July that Head Start and other programs it administered would be limited to U.S. citizens and certain immigrants with legal status, upending decades where the rule has been not to check the immigration status of the participating babies and children too little for preschool.

The Illinois Head Start association filed a lawsuit, along with other Head Start and parent advocate groups and the American Civil Liberties Union, to halt the changes to the rules announced by the Trump administration. Another suit was filed by Illinois and 19 other states with Democratic attorneys general, plus the District of Columbia.

This week in both cases, Republican-appointed federal judges agreed to block the changes.

The rulings come amid this week’s escalation of federal enforcement against immigrants in Chicago, stemming from Trump campaign promises to deport anyone without legal status.

On Wednesday, in the case filed by the attorneys general, U.S. District Court Judge Mary McElroy of Rhode Island, halted the new rules while the lawsuit makes its way to trial.

“The Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly 30 years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has

misunderstood it from the start — at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the Government,” wrote McElroy, a Trump appointee, in her 60-page ruling. “The Court is skeptical of that.”

Then on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez of Washington ruled in favor of the Head Start advocates, issuing a nationwide injunction that prevents the proposed changes from taking effect.

Congress changed the rules of Head Start since its founding in 1965 several times, but never included any immigration or citizenship requirements for Head Start eligibility, Martinez wrote in a 26-page ruling.

“The Directive imposes new obligations on Head Start agencies and strips away rights from

immigrant families,” said Martinez, appointed to the federal bench by President George W. Bush. “Agencies must publish proposed rules and allow the public the opportunity to comment before promulgating substantive rules.”

On behalf of the Illinois Head Start Association and other plaintiffs, Allison Siebeneck, director of the Women’s and Reproductive Rights Project at the ACLU of Illinois, wrote in a statement that the ruling “protects essential early childhood education for families across the country.

Erendira Rendón, chief program officer at immigration and economic justice group The Resurrection Project, said in a statement that the ""horrific incident in Franklin Park shows us the real danger that militarized enforcement creates in our neighborhoods.""

""A community member is dead, and an officer was injured,"" Rendón said. “These are outcomes that serve no public safety purpose and leave entire communities traumatized. Safe neighborhoods depend on trust, not fear. When federal agents conduct unaccountable operations in our communities, everyone becomes less safe.”

The shooting forced administrators at a nearby junior high school to place the school on lockdown.

The local news outlet Block Club Chicago reported that video of the incident was not immediately available.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat who has vehemently condemned Trump's deployment of federal agents—and potentially troops—to Chicago, called for the Department of Homeland Security to release ""a full, factual accounting of what’s happened today to ensure transparency and accountability.""

""I feel very confident that we're going to have a great parade,"" Rita Rodriguez, one of the Fiestas Patrias organizers, told Houston Public Media.

The Fiestas Patrias parade, which celebrates the cultures of several Latin American countries and serves as a kickoff for Hispanic Heritage Month, is expected to have around 100 moving parts, with as many as 3,000 people participating, Rodriguez said.

This will be Houston’s first Fiestas Patrias parade in four years after a hiatus organizers attributed to COVID-19. Rodriguez said the break has contributed to ""a lot of buzz"" on social media.

The event also comes as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement at other Latino-centric events. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that immigration officers may take race into consideration when stopping individuals in the Los Angeles area.

""There's always that possibility because of that recent Supreme Court decision that pretty much gives ICE [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] the green light to arrest anyone that they suspect as being illegal,"" said Sergio Lira, president of a Houston council of the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC. ""That really raises the concerns, raises the bar in terms of our Latino community. Anyone can be suspect and arrested.""

During a weeklong operation in August, ICE agents in Houston arrested more than 800 people, according to a news release the agency shared on Monday.

Plaintiffs challenging the revocation of parole for migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela hadn’t made a strong showing the move was arbitrary and capricious, the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held Friday in reversing a lower court.

The US Supreme Court has allowed the government to move ahead with revoking CHNV parole grants, approving an emergency request by DHS to ignore a district court order blocking removal of those immigrants while litigation unfolds.

Thousands of requests for green cards or other temporary relief are still pending at DHS.

The agency has moved to dismantle a broad swathe of temporary humanitarian programs, discontinuing refugee resettlement, restricting asylum, and suspending entry through several parole pathways besides the CHNV process. It’s also sought to eliminate humanitarian relief for hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the US as part of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda, including many Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans shielded by Temporary Protected Status.

Although it’s fighting multiple court challenges over TPS terminations, the parole litigation is one of the first cases involving temporary immigrant protections to advance to the appellate level.

A Boston district court judge found the terminations were likely unlawful because Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a blanket termination of protections. But the Immigration and Nationality Act “favors an interpretation that the ‘case-by-case’ requirement only limits the Secretary’s discretion to grant parole,” and doesn’t limit terminations, Appeals Court Judge Gustavo Gelpí Jr., a Biden appointee, wrote in the opinion.

The case was also heard by William Kayatta Jr., an Obama appointee, and Lara E. Montecalvo, a Biden appointee. The panel focused on whether the termination decision was shielded from judicial review during July oral arguments. Because the appeals court decided in the government’s favor, it didn’t address questions about reviewability in Friday’s opinion.

The decision vacated a district court stay on parole terminations and remanded the case for further proceedings.

Presidents from both political parties have used parole authority to temporarily admit immigrants on humanitarian or public interest grounds, allowing them to apply for asylum or another form of legal status within the US.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ordered Trump's Republican administration to change its U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website after plaintiffs' lawyers said temporary protected status holders were still in detention centers or unable to return to work even after his Sept. 5 judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Chen said on Thursday his Sept. 5 order in favor of TPS holders went into effect immediately.

That ruling found Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had unlawfully canceled temporary protected status, or TPS, extensions granted by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration for 1.1 million Venezuelans and Haitians.

TPS is a designation that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people in the United States if their homelands are deemed unsafe for return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions.

William Weiland, an attorney with the Department of Justice, said the judge had not ordered the government to update its website. Weiland also argued in court documents that the Sept. 5 judgment did not take effect immediately unless specifically ordered.

Chen said in his Thursday order that the rule cited by the government did not apply to these types of cases. The previous day, he denied the government’s request to stay his judgment while it appeals.

Lawyers for plaintiffs say people with temporary protected status are at risk of losing their jobs and more. They submitted a court declaration stating that a San Antonio man detained in May was told he will not be released until the website is updated.

While criticizing the federal government, the Catholic leaders also explained at a Thursday panel discussion at Georgetown University how they are supporting worried immigrants. With President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda and ramped up immigration enforcement, they said, many families are wary of taking their children to school, going to work or church for fear of being detained and deported.

“The way that the immigration policies are enforced these days are not only destabilizing the life of the particular immigrant, but whole families, businesses, the life of children, whole communities, neighborhoods,” said Auxiliary Bishop Evelio Menjivar-Ayala, of Washington, D.C. “What I’m seeing in people’s eyes, is pain and a deep confusion. … Where do we go from here if we’re not welcome.”

Adding to those fears is a change made at the start of Trump’s second term that gave immigration officers more leeway to make arrests at schools and houses of worship — long considered off limits. This is being challenged in court by teachers and faith groups.

“For me, it’s very personal because I was a stranger and you welcomed me,” said Menjivar-Ayala. He crossed the U.S. border illegally in 1990 after leaving his native El Salvador during the country’s civil war. Now a U.S. citizen, he became the first Salvadoran bishop in the United States.

Helping keep hope alive in struggling families is a critical part of providing support, said Sister Norma Pimentel, a leading migrant-rights activist along the U.S.-Mexico border who spoke on the panel. She runs Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, a respite center for beleaguered migrants in McAllen, Texas.

She recalled visiting immigrant families at a detention center in a “terrible condition,” and being moved to tears.

“I saw Border Patrol agents looking at us, and they, too, were moved and were crying,” she said. “When I walked out of there, the officer turned to me and said, ‘Thank you, sister, for helping us realize they’re human beings.’”

Department of Homeland Security officials have maintained there will be no safe spaces for those who are in the country illegally, have committed crimes, or tried to undermine immigration enforcement. They have consistently said their efforts are intended to safeguard public safety and national security.

Catholic leaders at odds with Trump over immigration

Catholic leaders follow the church’s core doctrine against abortion and same-sex marriage, priorities they share with many political conservatives. But they’ve been at odds with the Trump administration on immigration.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops announced the end of a half-century of partnerships with the federal government to serve refugees and migrant children, saying the “heartbreaking” decision followed the Trump administration’s abrupt halt to funding.

In February, the late Pope Francis also issued a major rebuke to the administration’s plans for mass deportations of migrants, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.

At the panel, Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski highlighted the contributions of immigrants to the country’s economy.

“If you ask people in agriculture, you ask in the service industry, you ask people in health care, you ask the people in the construction field, and they’ll tell you that some of their best workers are immigrants,” said Wenski, who has served on the USCCB’s migration committee. “Enforcement is always going to be part of any immigration policy, but we have to rationalize it and humanize it.”

Wenski joined the “Knights on Bikes” ministry, an initiative led by the Knights of Columbus that draws attention to the spiritual needs of people held at immigration detention centers, including the one in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” He recalled praying a rosary with the bikers in the scorching heat outside its walls. Days later, he got permission to celebrate Mass inside the facility.

“The fact that we invite these detainees to pray, even in this very dehumanizing situation, is a way of emphasizing and invoking their dignity,” he said. “More importantly that God has not forgotten them.”

Los Angeles archdiocese suffers after immigration raids

In Los Angeles County, the Trump administration’s ramped up arrests of people suspected of living in the country illegally has upended life for tens of thousands of people. About a third of the county’s 10 million residents are foreign-born, and many are now trying to live without being noticed.

Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez said on the panel that the fear-inducing effect of immigration raids lowered attendance at Mass, and affected valuable church programs that mostly serve immigrants. The archdiocese is helping those being detained and facing deportation with legal and financial assistance.

“People are really afraid of going out of their homes,” said Gomez, the first Latino to serve as USCCB president. “A lot of the priests are telling me here in the archdiocese that at least 30% of the people attending Mass are not coming anymore.”

Panelists warn of fallout from immigration crackdown

The panel, which included academics and legal experts, lamented the suffering of children separated from their parents. Legal expert Ashley Feasley, who is with Catholic University of America’s Columbus School of Law, noted the millions of children who are U.S. citizens and have parents and other family members in the country illegally.

“When we think about the level of enforcement that is starting, occurring, and will intensify … we have to think about these families. What will they do? How will they handle it if a parent gets detained?” Feasley said.

Trump has portrayed his federal law enforcement surge in Washington as focused on tackling crime. But data from the federal operation, analyzed by The Associated Press, shows that more than 40% of the arrests made over the monthlong operation were in fact related to immigration.

“The president says that he’s enforcing these policies to make our cities safer, but if immigrants, if people are afraid of interacting with law enforcement, with police, reporting crimes, obviously they’re going to become targets of crimes,” said Menjivar-Ayala.

“This is not going to help to make our streets, our communities safer.”

Ministering to immigrants at the border

Mark Seitz, the bishop of El Paso, Texas, said it is crucial to continue informing immigrant communities about their rights

“We don’t stop at praying,” Seitz, chair of the USCCB’s Committee on Migration, told the panel.

“Prayer moves us to action, and that’s what we ought to be doing — to abide by our support, our love, our accompaniment, by being present to people who’ve been terrorized by the actions of the government.”

At end of the panel, Gomez said it’s important to remember that the United States is a country of immigrants.

“I think we’ll have immigrant reform very soon. That’s my prayer and my dream -- that we can get something done, finally, as a solution of these challenges,” he said.

Wearing face masks, they disembarked a chartered plane at Incheon airport and were greeted with cheers from officials, including the presidential chief of staff, before being taken by bus to meet family members.

Their return capped a week of intense negotiations by Seoul to win their release and bring them home after they were taken into custody in handcuffs and shackles — images that shocked many in South Korea, a key US ally.

""We're in an age of new normal in dealing with the United States,"" Mr Kang told reporters.

South Korean businesses have long struggled with obtaining proper visas for specialist staff needed at project sites for months at a time, which has led to some workers relying on grey areas in US visa enforcement.

The two countries are looking at establishing a working group to consider a new type of visa for Koreans, according to South Korea's foreign minister who visited Washington this week.

The workers were met by family members and officials from battery company LG Energy Solution (LGSE), who is partnering with Hyundai Motors to build the plant in the US state of Georgia.

The raid has threatened to destabilise ties at a time when the countries are seeking to finalise a trade deal, which includes a $US350 billion ($527 billion) investment fund to support strategic US industries.

At the arrival gate, a man unfurled a large poster depicting US President Donald Trump wearing an outfit with the initials of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) service and carrying a bag full of dollar bills with a machine gun slung across his chest. The caption read: ""We're friends!""

Workers shackled and put in handcuffs

Returning workers said they were horrified by the September 4 raid conducted jointly by US immigration authorities, the FBI and the Justice Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that rounded up 475 workers at the plant's site.

""It started to look serious because we thought we would be taking the transport vehicle, but then they started putting handcuffs and shackles, and that's when we thought 'Oh, this is not going to be a simple transport,'"" LG Energy Solution engineer Choi Young-hee said.

THIS WEEK IN BRIEF:

Supreme Court upholds “roving patrols” and profiling: A September 8 Supreme Court “shadow docket” decision gave DHS a green light to resume carrying out sweeps and patrols targeting individuals based solely on “profiling” criteria like apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment. The underlying lawsuit seeking to halt this practice continues, but six Supreme Court justices decided to allow profiling to proceed while the case moves through lower courts.

Elsewhere in the courts: Updates on the administration’s effort to swiftly deport unaccompanied Central American children; its agreement with El Salvador for paid imprisonment of deported Venezuelan people; a decision calling for detention of all who entered the U.S. illegally while their immigration cases proceed; and a bit of good news—perhaps—for Venezuelan TPS recipients.

Mass deportation in the U.S. interior: Updates on immigration enforcement surges in Chicago, Boston, and Washington; a new report on abuse suffered by deported Mexican citizens; a surge in ICE deportation flights to Mexico; conditions and deaths in ICE custody; the U.S. military’s role; and the economic impact of administration migration policies.

THE FULL UPDATE:

Supreme Court upholds “roving patrols” and profiling

In a brief September 8 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court gave its approval, pending further consideration by lower courts, for aggressive immigration enforcement targeting individuals based solely on their apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or employment. The decision lifts a July federal district court order to halt such enforcement in Los Angeles, which an appeals court had kept in place during its ongoing review.

As a result, the New York Times explained, “For American citizens of Hispanic descent in Los Angeles—especially people who speak with an accent or work as manual laborers—that means they will continue to risk being stopped and questioned whenever they go out. They may see it as a necessary precaution to always carry documents with them in a way that other Americans need not.”

The high court’s six Republican-nominated judges voted to undo the stay on roving patrols and sweeps by armed, masked agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and supporting agencies, with Justice Brett Kavanaugh writing a concurring opinion. The three Democratic-nominated judges voted to keep the stay in place and wrote a dissenting opinion.

An aggressive operation, halted

Between June 6, when the Trump administration launched a large-scale operation, and late August, ICE and affiliated agencies arrested 5,210 presumably undocumented people in the Los Angeles area, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated. Especially during its first month, the operation featured frequent “roundups of random Hispanic people by armed agents,” as the New York Times described it, many of them caught on mobile phone videos shared widely on social media. Agents paid repeated visits to the same sites, while U.S. citizens of Latino descent reported being stopped more than once within spans of just a few days.

Analyzing ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project, the Cato Institute’s David Bier found in early August that fully one-fifth of ICE arrests since January 20 were of Latino individuals taken off the streets with no prior criminal records and no removal orders. “This policy is a threat to the rights of all people in the United States,” Bier warned.

On June 20, several people caught up in these sweeps, along with Los Angeles-area legal defense groups, filed a potential class-action lawsuit in federal court. (The case is Vásquez Perdomo v. Noem.) On July 11, District Court Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, a Biden appointee, granted the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order, noting a “mountain of evidence” that the sweeps were violating people’s constitutional rights.

This order halted all “detentive stops” by immigration personnel without “reasonable suspicion” of undocumented presence in the United States. It specified that reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on four criteria indicative of racial profiling: “(1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location (e.g. bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, etc.); or (4) the type of work one does.”

On July 28, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously kept the restraining order in place, denying the government’s request to stay it. The four listed factors, the two Clinton-appointed and one Biden-appointed judges found, “describe only a broad profile and ‘do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,’” legal analyst Chris Geidner explained.

ICE arrests dropped by 66 percent in the Los Angeles area following the restraining order, according to mid-August analysis of Deportation Data Project statistics by Cato’s Bier.

The Supreme Court lifts the restraining order

The restraining order is now lifted. The entire Supreme Court majority did not explain the reasoning behind its September 8 decision, which it rarely does when ruling, on its “emergency” or “shadow” docket, whether to keep policies in place while lower courts decide on their legality.

In his solo concurring opinion, though, Justice Kavanaugh asserted that a person’s ethnicity can be used as a “relevant” factor in determining whether an agent might stop someone. Kavanaugh voiced the view that when U.S. citizens are stopped, “questioning in those circumstances is typically brief, and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U.S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.” This does not describe the experience of plaintiffs in the Vásquez Perdomo case, and appears to imply that people at risk of racial profiling must never avoid going out in public without proof of citizenship.

“Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor,” read a dissenting opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”

The case (not the restraining order) continues to move through the courts, with an appellate court hearing set for September 24.

“Going hard”

In the meantime, sweeps and patrols are resuming. Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol sector chief placed in charge of “at large” mass deportation operations in Los Angeles, tweeted, “quite frankly the poorly written ( very poorly) temp restrainig [sic.] order was the worst i’ve ever seen. We are going hard in Los Angeles today and are hitting a location as I write this.“ A DHS tweet promised to “continue to FLOOD THE ZONE in Los Angeles.”

Geidner, the legal analyst who authors the Law Dork newsletter, warned that the high court’s move “makes a mockery of the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches or seizures, with significant worrying consequences for all people in America—whether you lack documentation to be in this country or are a citizen of it.”

A statement from California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) office went further: “Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court majority just became the Grand Marshal for a parade of racial terror in Los Angeles. This isn’t about enforcing immigration laws—it’s about targeting Latinos and anyone who doesn’t look or sound like Stephen Miller’s idea of an American, including U.S. citizens and children, to deliberately harm California’s families and small businesses. Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family.”

“When ICE grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why,” read a statement from the named plaintiff in the case, Pedro Vásquez Perdomo, a U.S. citizen. “I was treated like I didn’t matter–locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the Supreme Court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge.”

Elsewhere in the courts

Unaccompanied Guatemalan children

In Washington DC federal district court on September 10, government lawyers retracted their earlier claims that, when they sought to send 76 unaccompanied Guatemalan children back to their country in the pre-dawn hours of the Sunday before Labor Day, they were granting the children’s families’ wishes to reunite them. Presented with evidence that virtually all of the children feared or were unwilling to return to Guatemala, Justice Department attorneys backed off from “family reunification” claims that they, and other Trump administration officials, had forcefully—and, it turns out, falsely—made on August 31. (See WOLA’s September 5 Border Update for a full narrative.)

The restraining order preventing the Guatemalan kids’ deportation expires on September 14. Attorneys representing the children asked Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee assigned to the case, to keep the deportations on hold more firmly with a preliminary injunction. They are also asking Kelly to add unaccompanied children of other nationalities to the class of plaintiffs. That includes a group of Honduran children who, according to the Arizona-based Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, are at risk of a similarly swift removal.

In a detailed analysis at LawFare, Anna Bower contrasted the August 31 response of emergency on-call Judge Sparkle Sooknanan, who kept the Trump administration on a tight leash to prevent planes from departing with the Guatemalan children, with the energetic but ultimately unsuccessful performance of Washington DC Judge James Boasberg in March, during a similar administration attempt to carry out a secretive, high-speed removal to a prison in El Salvador. Bower argued that the judiciary is on a “learning curve” regarding the executive branch’s overreach and basic trustworthiness.

Venezuelan men rendered to El Salvador

Also before Judge Boasberg is a suit from several migrant defense organizations that seeks to halt and reverse the State Department’s transfer of funds to El Salvador to imprison migrants there after their removal from the United States.

Between March 15 and July 18, 252 Venezuelan men were held in that country’s notorious Center for Confinement of Terrorism (CECOT) prison after the Trump administration sent them there, 137 under the little-used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Since their release and return to Venezuela, the men have shared harrowing accounts of beatings, physical torture, sexual abuse, and other mistreatment.

On September 9, a filing in the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights v. Department of State case revealed a key piece of information: the March 22 written agreement between the Trump administration and the government of El Salvador governing the use of the CECOT.

This document committed the State Department to providing El Salvador $4.76 million from the account of its Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, which is legally authorized to fund anti-drug, crime-fighting, and justice programs—not the foreign imprisonment of migrants without charge. The money is meant to help El Salvador cover “law enforcement and anticrime needs, which may include costs associated with the detention of members of the Foreign Terrorist Organization Tren de Aragua”—approximately 300 of them.

The agreement “did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” noted a statement from Skye Perryman of Democracy Forward, one of the plaintiff groups. However, it did “go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

In a reference to “section 620M of the Foreign Assistance Act,” the agreement with El Salvador signaled diplomats’ awareness that the State Department money had to comply with the Leahy Law, which prohibits U.S. assistance to foreign security-force units that grossly violate human rights with impunity. The Venezuelan men’s accounts of what they suffered in the CECOT (several cited in WOLA’s August 8 Border Update) indicate rather vividly that Salvadoran units did commit gross human rights violations after receiving U.S. aid.

At the New Yorker, reporter Jonathan Blitzer published a thorough narrative of the Venezuelan men’s experience, from their decisions to migrate to what they endured in U.S. and Salvadoran custody. The lengthy article explored the efforts of the Trump campaign and administration to portray Venezuelan migrants as a national security threat, often building on atypical or isolated cases.

Blitzer’s piece includes some new details and elements. It reports that, going back to the Biden administration, Border Patrol was “taking the lead” in elevating the Tren de Aragua threat, voicing a view that may not have been shared by investigative agencies like ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). It also recounts a “blond and light skinned” ICE agent grabbing by the hair, punching in the face, and swearing at a Venezuelan woman aboard one of the El Salvador-bound planes until another guard restrained him (the Salvadoran government rejected the rendition of a handful of women aboard the March 15 flights). And it includes further accounts of the constant beatings the CECOT guards administered: they “became so routine that the Venezuelans scored them on a scale of one to five—the higher the number, the worse the treatment.”

The most well-known of the Venezuelan ex-prisoners, Andry Hernández, gave a September 11 interview to Andrea Castillo of the Los Angeles Times. Hernández, a gay makeup artist apparently accused of gang membership because he had tattoos, recalled his six-month stay at ICE’s Otay Mesa Detention Center outside San Diego. “Immigrant detainees are given blue, orange, or red uniforms, depending on their classification level,” Castillo reported. “A guard once explained that detainees wearing orange, like him, could be criminals. Hernández Romero said he replied, ‘Is being gay a crime? Or is doing makeup a crime?’”

Prohibition of bond

Within the Justice Department, the Board of Immigration Appeals—which can review immigration judges’ decisions and set precedents—issued a decision that could signal a massive shift in immigration policy. The Board upheld a Trump administration policy requiring judges to detain all migrants who entered the United States illegally—such as those who crossed the border between ports of entry—while their cases proceed. This prohibition on bond releases could apply to millions of people.

The decision “is likely to send an immediate chill through immigration courts where judges for decades have released individuals on bond whom they did not deem a flight risk or danger,” the Los Angeles Times reported. In the past, detaining all improper border crossers would have vastly stretched ICE’s detention system far beyond capacity. Now, however, a $45 billion appropriation for ICE detention, part of the “big bill” that Congress passed in early July, has significantly expanded that capacity.

TPS for Venezuela

In a Northern District of California court on September 5, Judge Edward Chen ordered the restoration of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for about 600,000 citizens of Venezuela. This reverses, for now, the Trump administration’s termination of TPS for Venezuelans. Chen argued that the administration did not follow procedure, including a careful review of conditions in Venezuela, when it curtailed TPS.

Judge Chen’s ruling “means 600,000 Venezuelans whose temporary protections expired in April or whose protections were about to expire Sept. 10 have status to stay and work in the United States. It also keeps protections for about 500,000 Haitians,” the Associated Press reported.

“Protections and employment authorization for Venezuelans are back in place until October 2026,” Bloomberg Law reported. “But they’ll have to re-register for TPS by Sept. 10.” However, that has been impossible to do, as DHS “hadn’t updated its website to show that the Venezuelans were still covered by T.P.S. and wasn’t allowing many of them to re-register as they needed to by a Sept. 10 deadline,” the New York Times reported on September 11. A government lawyer cited a “coding issue.”

On September 11, Judge Chen ordered that the website be operational within a day and that TPS recipients have sufficient time to re-register. It is not clear what, if anything, can be done for any Venezuelans who were deported after losing this now-restored status.

Mass deportation in the U.S. interior

As funding from the giant budget legislation approved in July continues to come online, the administration’s operations to arrest, detain, and deport migrants from the U.S. interior continue to accelerate. In what has become a regular component of WOLA’s Border Updates, this section offers links to coverage of some of the principal developments.

Operations in cities

As noted above, agents from ICE, CBP, and other federal law enforcement agencies poured into Los Angeles in June. In August, a surge began in Washington, DC. In both of these cities, the civilian law enforcement deployments came with contingents of military personnel, mainly National Guard, who have been less directly involved in migrant apprehensions.

Now, the administration is launching operations—so far, just with civilian law enforcement agencies, not military personnel—in Chicago and Boston. These are reportedly modeled on the Los Angeles operation. (ICE also carried out a large-scale raid last week at a big Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia, detaining hundreds of mostly Korean citizens and triggering diplomatic tensions with South Korea.)

The administration has officially launched what it is calling “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago. President Trump publicized it with a social media post featuring an AI image depicting himself in the role played by Robert Duvall in the movie Apocalypse Now, twisting Duvall’s famous line into “I love the smell of deportations in the morning” and threatening, “Chicago is about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”

So far, though, there is no indication that Department of Defense personnel are deployed to Chicago, although ICE, CBP, and other civilian personnel who have moved from elsewhere, mainly Los Angeles, are operating out of Naval Station Great Lakes, north of the city. In the operation’s first days, the Chicago Sun-Times reported, “Details were scarce as videos surfaced of masked federal agents taking people into custody, with a smattering of arrests from the South Side to the west suburbs.”

Gregory Bovino, the politically outspoken Border Patrol agent who began 2025 as the chief of the agency’s El Centro Sector and was tapped to lead the Los Angeles operation, is now in Chicago. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a vocal Trump opponent who has called Bovino “a guy who desperately wants to be a reality TV star,” said that the Chief’s reported arrival is “evidence that they have terrible plans for the communities of Illinois.”

Bovino tweeted a photo of himself accompanied by dozens of uniformed agents with the Hollywood sign in the background, with the text “The mean green team is not going anywhere. We are here to stay.” The Chief’s face is the only one not blurred out.

In the past two weeks, Bovino has been profiled by the New York Times, CBS News, and the Associated Press, which noted, “Bovino carefully hones his image, both his own and the one projected to the country that shows well-armed officers moving swiftly into place to make arrests.”

In Boston and elsewhere in Democratic-governed Massachusetts, the administration has launched what it calls “Operation Patriot 2.0”; the “1.0” version was a surge that led to 1,500 arrests in Massachusetts during the spring. “The operation began late this week and was expected to last several weeks,” two sources told the New York Times for a September 6 report.

The most visible aspect of the Boston operation so far has been a war of words with the city’s popular mayor, Michelle Wu, who ordered that “no Boston police or local resources will be co-opted into federal immigration enforcement and their mass deportation agenda.” In a September 6 statement, DHS retorted, “Sanctuary policies like those pushed by Mayor Wu not only attract and harbor criminals but also place these public safety threats above the interests of law-abiding American citizens.”

Washington “has transformed from a place that proudly welcomed immigrants into one primed for their deportations,” with DC Metropolitan Police now working closely alongside ICE agents “who have detained people in front of schools and restaurants,” noted a Washington Post analysis that featured the heavy hands-on role of White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in directing the operation.

In the Virginia suburbs, where most out-of-state National Guard personnel are sleeping in hotels, an ICE raid on a construction site near the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) headquarters led some fleeing workers to try to scale the spy agency’s perimeter fence. The CIA, which ICE did not inform about the nearby operation, closed its gates for more than an hour.

With the school year now well underway, the Washington Post reported on a “walking school bus” that parents have organized to help children from mixed-status families feel at least somewhat safe on their way to and from classes.

Arrests

At her Beyond the Border newsletter, San Diego-based reporter Kate Morrissey noted that, since a court ruling against nationwide “expedited removal” has slowed ICE’s detentions of migrants reporting to immigration court (see WOLA’s September 5 Border Update), agents are now strapping electronic ankle monitors onto thousands who show up for their cases.

Now that it is no longer common for agents to start their workdays with specific individuals to target, NBC News reported that ICE no longer requires agents to complete a “field operations worksheet” with details about their targets. Instead, “broad street sweeps” with no specific targets are becoming the norm. “It’s hard to fill out a worksheet that just says, ‘Meet in the Home Depot parking lot,’” a former ICE official told the network.

Among the many federal agencies losing personnel to the mass deportation effort is the State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service, Wired reported. Of the 2,500 officers on the force, which protects embassies and other U.S. installations, 600 have been deputized “to help with arresting and deporting illegal immigrants” and now must log the time they are spending on that mission.

Deportations

The Kino Border Initiative (KBI), which maintains a shelter near the border in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, released a report on the experience of deported Mexican citizens. Since April, the Mexican government has granted KBI personnel “regular access” to the shelter for deported individuals that it set up in Nogales at the beginning of the year, in anticipation of the Trump administration’s “mass deportation” campaign.

KBI staff conducted 278 brief surveys of returned migrants “to document patterns of repatriation, testimonies, and reports of mistreatment,” and the results are troubling. Fifty-seven percent of them had been living in the U.S. interior at the time of their arrest, as opposed to being apprehended upon arrival at the border: that is up from 5 percent of deported people last year. Of those apprehended in the interior, 57.5 percent had lived in the United States for more than five years, and 56 percent reported being separated from their families, “leaving behind children, partners, and other dependents.”

Since the Trump administration all but dismantled DHS’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) and Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO), the last five complaints—and nine of the previous 16 complaints—that KBI has filed on behalf of migrants who suffered abuse in U.S. custody have gone without even a response. “We have not even received the typical automatic acknowledgment of receipt that was standard in the past.”

At the Guardian, Maanvi Singh and Will Craft dug into leaked flight records and passenger manifests from ICE’s largest aerial deportation charter contractor, Global Crossing Airlines (GlobalX). In just over 100 days, they found, GlobalX operated 1,700 ICE flights, carrying 44,000 people, including nearly 1,000 children and 22 infants; nearly 3,600 individuals were moved five or more times. Secretive transfers, family separations, and flights to third countries complicate the defense of cases in immigration court, including access to attorneys.

The August report of Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor, which takes up the work of recently retired Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, found a sharp rise in ICE deportation flights last month. The project recorded 240 removal flights in August, the most in a month since Cartwright began tracking in 2020. This included a striking 72 flights into Mexico’s interior, up from a January-July average of 21 per month. That is the most flights this project has ever recorded to a single country in one month.

ICE Flight Monitor observed that starting August 28, ICE flights into Mexico ceased and have not resumed. In a likely correlated development, Border Report noted a surge in land-border deportations into Tijuana during the first eight days of September: 74 deported individuals from San Diego each day, up from a February-August average of 36 per day.

Also in Tijuana, Border Report reported, the head of the non-governmental Migrant Pro Defense Council in Baja California, José Moreno, publicly accused municipal police of extorting deported people. Moreno alleged that corrupt cops are shaking down returned migrants outside the federal and Salvation Army shelters.

Spain’s El País reported on the secrecy and opacity of ICE’s deportations to third countries. July flights to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Eswatini “were not reported until weeks after they occurred, and the administration did not provide the identities of the deportees, who remain imprisoned in high-security facilities.” A Jamaican man sent to Eswatini despite the Kingston government’s willingness to take him, Orville Etoria, has disappeared: his lawyers “have been unable to contact him and fear for his safety.”

Eswatini, the monarchy formerly known as Swaziland, is the latest nation to which the Trump administration is threatening to send Salvadoran man Kilmar Abrego García. The Maryland father whom the Trump administration mistakenly sent to the CECOT in March remains in ICE custody in Virginia with a judicial order not to deport him, as he considers applying for asylum: having left and re-entered the country, Abrego García may now be eligible to do so. The administration has stated its view that an asylum application would void Abrego García’s existing withholding of removal status, enabling his deportation to his home country, which he fled due to threats.

The government of Belize (population 400,000) has acknowledged that it is reviewing a proposal from the Trump administration to sign a “Safe Third Country” agreement, which would allow the U.S. government to send asylum seekers from third countries to seek protection within the Belizean system. “As of now, Belize has not agreed to the proposal, and further consultations are expected before any decision is made,” reported the local Love FM.

NBC News reported that downloads of CBP’s “CBP Home” app are dwindling as migrants are apparently choosing not to use it to “self-deport.” During five weeks in March and April, 356 people used the app to register their departures and, at least in some cases, to receive a $1,000 stipend, according to data NBC obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. However, DHS “didn’t respond to repeated requests” for updated figures. An estimated 91,000 people downloaded the app from within the United States, with most of them doing so during its first weeks.

Detention

At the 19th, Chabeli Carrazana documented the detention and deportation of Colombian mother Nicolle Orozco Forero, her husband, and their two young sons from Seattle after spending 21 days in the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, a “family detention” facility that the Trump administration has reopened in Texas. Orozco Forero’s son has a serious kidney condition, but she said that Dilley staff only offered him ibuprofen.

CNN reported on the grim, even subhuman, conditions prevailing in what are meant to be temporary “hold rooms” at ICE facilities, particularly in Miami and New York. The agency’s “policies for decades have required the agency to keep migrants in cramped hold rooms like this for no longer than 12 hours,” but 18 percent of detainees are now in those spaces for more time than that. At the troubled Krome Detention Center in Miami, hold room stays now average more than three days. Mobile phone videos show “Men sleeping head-to-toe on a crowded floor, exhausted detainees blocking out fluorescent lights with face masks, and dozens of people using cardboard boxes as mattresses.”

Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, a 32-year-old Mexican man who had lived in Flagstaff, Arizona, for so long that he had graduated high school there, died on August 31 while in custody at the state’s Central Arizona Correctional Complex in Florence. He had been in ICE custody for three weeks. The cause of death is unknown, though a family member alleged at a GoFundMe page that Batrez Vargas died “alone, likely from complications of COVID-19, and without the medical attention he deserved.” He appears to be the 13th person to die in ICE custody since the Trump administration began.

At the Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf interviewed George Retes, a 25-year-old Army veteran and U.S. citizen who spent days in custody after Border Patrol agents violently arrested him—he said he tried to comply with their orders—in California. “Held in a jail cell for three days and nights, he was not allowed to make a phone call, see an attorney, appear before a judge, or take a shower to wash off pepper spray and tear gas that the agents had used.”

The Washington Post reported on the Trump administration’s plans to reopen prisons and detention centers “that were closed by the federal government years ago over concerns about violence, medical neglect, and systemic understaffing.” Many are located in very remote rural areas, where hiring is challenging, requiring significant overtime, and oversight is difficult. The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff reported on the administration’s fascination with “megaprisons,” guided by a hope that the facilities’ cruel reputations might succeed in “scaring more immigrants into voluntarily self-deporting to their home countries.”

The U.S. military role

The Washington Post and CNN reported on potential morale issues among National Guard personnel deployed to Washington DC. (While President Trump has ostensibly sent the soldiers on a crime-fighting mission, their arrival coincided with the ICE-led migrant detention operations discussed above.) An Army survey of media attitudes about the Guard deployment, accidentally sent to the Post, noted that September 5 social media posts “were assessed to be 53 percent negative, 45 percent neutral and 2 percent positive,” and highlighted “Mentions of Fatigue, confusion, and demoralization—‘just gardening,’ unclear mission, wedge between citizens and the military.” A soldier anonymously told CNN, “We haven’t gotten critically low on morale, but we’re falling fast” as they remain away from jobs and families with little to do in the nation’s capital.

The Trump administration’s plan to use military lawyers as immigration judges is unlawful and “should raise all sorts of alarms,” three former U.S. military Judges Advocate General (JAGs) turned law professors told Ilya Somin of George Mason University Law School. At the Bulwark, Adrián Carrasquillo saw the proposal to transfer them to immigration courts on six-month missions as “an obvious effort to expedite removals.” Seven active-duty and reserve JAGs told the New York Times of their “concern that they would be expected to simply rubber-stamp deportations of migrants as the White House’s desired outcome.”

Public opinion

A local Times-Tribune report from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, one of the state’s three largest majority-Latino cities to vote for Donald Trump, finds residents “grappling with their decision” and objecting to arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants without criminal records. Despite those misgivings, however, many “still largely stand by the president.”

Podcaster Derek Thompson, co-author of the bestseller Abundance, told Vox that, amid deportations and self-deportations, 2025 could be the first year in history to see a decline in the U.S. population. A shrinking immigrant labor force could hit critical economic sectors: “little in life is more fundamental than the right to food, shelter, and medicine. So, it’s pretty important that immigrants play a disproportionate role in each.”

The mass exit of employed immigrants could be masking a deeper weakness in the U.S. economy, the New York Times observed: their involuntary abandonment of paid jobs may be creating openings at the same time that employers are cutting back on other hiring.

Essays

At his newsletter, journalist and author Garrett Graff warned that ICE’s recent expansion and unleashing mark a fundamental shift in American democracy. “We have never in US history seen a federal law enforcement agency operate the way ICE has operated this summer—it marks the arrival of a new style of domestic policing” marked by prioritization of immigration goals alongside weakening of due process, oversight, and accountability.

At the New York Times, Sabrina Tavernise adopted a globally comparative view of ICE and other federal agents’ insistence on wearing masks to hide their identity. “In Russia in the 2000s, I thought of masking as a peculiar feature of a wobbly post-Soviet state. Over time it became clear that it was a harbinger of a new era,” she wrote. “I cannot think of a democratic country with a reliable rule of law where security forces mask themselves,” said Harvard University’s Steve Levitsky, co-author of How Democracies Die. “It just doesn’t happen.”

Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records.","WASHINGTON — A Friday lawsuit from a civil rights group accused the Trump administration of bypassing deportation restrictions on immigrants slated for removal by sending them to Ghana and having the West African nation deport them to their countries of origin, despite credible findings they could face harm there.

The move violates not only the due process rights of immigrants, but circumvents deportation restrictions placed by immigration judges who determined those immigrants could not be returned to their home country, attorneys from the Asian Americans Advancing Justice, wrote in their suit.

“Defendants know that they may not, consistent with U.S. immigration law, directly deport non-citizens to countries from which they have been granted fear-based protection,” according to the brief. “As an end-run around this prohibition, Defendants have enlisted the government of Ghana to do their dirty work.”

The Department of Homeland Security and government of Ghana did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Ghana President John Dramani Mahama confirmed to Business Insider Africa this week that the country struck a deal with the U.S. to accept a group of 14 deportees and send some back to their countries of origin.

The attorneys argued that immigration judges granted their five plaintiffs fear-based deportation protections to their home country under the Immigration Nationality Act and Convention Against Torture.

They are asking U.S District Judge Tanya Chutkan to require the return of the plaintiffs to the U.S.

Chutkan sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

The plaintiffs are nationals of Nigeria and The Gambia.

Third-country removals

A deportation protection, such as a ""withholding of removal,” doesn’t create blanket protections from removal. It requires the U.S. to find what is known as a third country that will accept the deportee.

Certain other requirements do apply. The government must notify the deportee of the country of removal and give them a chance to object if they fear persecution there.

The U.S. government must ensure that a third country that accepts a deportee won’t then conduct a removal to their home country, where U.S. immigration officials have found they could face harm.

The suit says that none of the plaintiffs were notified they would be removed to Ghana and instead they were placed on a U.S. military plane and none were given a credible fear interview of being sent to the West African country.

They were placed in straitjackets and remained on the plane for 16 hours, according to the suit.

The plaintiffs are referred to by initials in court documents.

One, referred to as K.S., “is hiding and fears for his life” in The Gambia.

K.S. was granted protections under the Convention Against Torture, a United Nations treaty, because he is bisexual and fears returning to The Gambia where he could face harm, according to court records. The Ghanaian government deported him to The Gambia on Wednesday, according to the suit.

Four others are detained in Ghana. They are referred to as D.A., T.L., I.O., and D.S in court documents.

Ghana is planning to remove them to their countries of origin by Friday, according to court records.

“The comments by U.S. officials on the plane on the way to Ghana, combined with news reports about Ghana’s involvement in a deal with the U.S. about repatriating non-citizens to their countries of origin in Africa, indicate that the U.S. is deporting people to Ghana with the intention that they be deported to their countries of origin,” according to the suit.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-09/prettyman.jpg?h=9ce42887&itok=cjwvBeJ6,N,,2025-09-12 17:57:27.067366

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said state Attorney General Rob Bonta. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” he said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer.
He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,"" said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin.
Villegas-Gonzalez’s known criminal background included a history of reckless driving, immigration officials said.
Immigration officials said it was unclear how long he had been in the country.","CHICAGO – Federal immigration agents fatally shot a man in the city’s Northwest suburbs who they say was resisting arrest and dragged an agent with his car, officials said on Sep. 12.

U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement officials said that the man they were attempting to arrest ignored commands from federal agents and drove his car into an officer attempting to arrest him. The agent suffered multiple injuries and is in stable condition, according to an agency statement.

DHS said in a statement that the situation arose from an ""enforcement operation targeting a criminal illegal alien"" and that agents had ""conducted a vehicle stop to arrest"" the man.

""We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force, and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,"" said Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, as well as the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.""

The fatal shooting of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez comes about a week into Operation Midway Blitz, a crackdown on immigration enforcement in the Chicago area ordered by President Donald Trump. The White House has said a crackdown is aimed at ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants.

Villegas-Gonzalez’s known criminal background included a history of reckless driving, immigration officials said. Immigration officials said it was unclear how long he had been in the country.

Manuel Antonio Cardenas, a Chicago-area attorney who represented Villegas-Gonzalez in his traffic cases, is calling for a full investigation into the fatal shooting.

Tensions escalated further as protesters and Ice officers began facing off directly.","A man was fatally shot during a vehicle stop on the outskirts of Chicago by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers after attempting to flee the scene, according to officials, and another officer was injured during the altercation.

Ice released the following statement after the shooting: “This morning in Chicago, Ice officers were conducting targeted local enforcement activity during a vehicle stop, the suspect resisted and attempted to drive his vehicle into the arrest team, striking an officer and subsequently dragging him as he fled the scene, fearing for his life, the officer discharged his firearm and struck the subject. Both the officer and subject immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital.”

It continued: “The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital, the officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition, viral social media videos and activists encouraging illegal aliens to resist law enforcement not only spread misinformation, but also undermine public safety, the safety of our officers and those being apprehended.”

The target of the stop in Franklin Park, to the west of Chicago, was Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, who was an undocumented immigrant with a history of reckless driving, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“We are praying for the speedy recovery of our law enforcement officer. He followed his training, used appropriate force and properly enforced the law to protect the public and law enforcement,” said Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary. She then echoed the statement by Ice regarding the dangers of social media videos.

The incident was first reported on X by the CBS immigration correspondent Camilo Montoya-Galvez.

He wrote: “An Ice operation turned deadly in Chicago today, after a suspect resisted arrest and tried to drive his vehicle into agents, prompting an officer to shoot the suspect, who has been pronounced dead, a DHS official tells me. The officer suffered severe injuries but is stable.”

The incident involved a traffic stop to check on what Ice said was an undocumented immigrant. It happened about six miles from where, separately, a day-long protest had been unfolding outside an Ice processing center in Broadview, Illinois, where demonstrators clashed with federal government agents on Friday morning. There were reports a demonstrator was shot in the leg with a pepper ball by enforcement officers.

A worker at a tire shop across the street from where Villegas-Gonzales was killed spoke to BreakThrough News, according to the outlet, saying: “I thought it was your run-of-the-mill car crash, because car crashes have been here all the time, so I thought nothing of it. That’s when my boss came out and told me, ‘Hey, something happened here.’ And I saw a huge police presence, military presence and FBI presence.

“So right now, the community is a bit scared about Ice and the military operations here in Chicago,” he added. “Franklin Park is heavily Latino and Polish, so I didn’t know that they were going to come here one day. It’s just, once it happens, you’re in shock, like you can’t believe your eyes.”

He also provided reporters with security footage from outside the shop, which included audio of what sounds like gunshots.

Police taped off the area and behind patrol vehicles a grey sedan could be seen that the man had been driving. It had crashed into a parked truck, and it could be seen that the driver’s side window was open.

A video taken by a bystander and uploaded to Chitown Crimechasers on Facebook shows Ice agents trying to get into Villegas-Gonzalez’ car. Yanking the car handle and eventually breaking the glass and unlocking the car from the inside.

The Ice agent lays Villegas-Gonzalez’ body on the ground before dragging it to a nearby sidewalk. Another Ice agent joins and both are kneeling next to him. He is seen moving Villegas-Gonzalez’ legs before the video ends.

A neighbor who did not want to be identified spoke highly of Villegas-Gonzalez with a small group of reporters and mentioned that Villegas-Gonzalez was a hard worker and a good neighbor.

One time, the neighbor recalled, Villegas-Gonzalez scraped the neighbor’s car, came over and offered to fix it. The neighbor said it’s been distressing to see social media posts about Villegas-Gonzalez.

“It’s such a sickening world that everybody’s celebrating his death,” the neighbor said. It’s just wrong, you know? He’s a human being.”

When asked about Ice’s arrest of Villegas-Gonzalez and the agency having said Villegas-Gonzalez tried to drive into officers, the neighbor said Villegas-Gonzalez “was scared 100%” and didn’t speak English.

Meanwhile, in nearby Broadview, demonstrations began at dawn and were set to continue until the evening. By late morning, several dozen people had assembled outside the facility, according to CBS News Chicago.

These incidents and some others are part of a surge of immigration enforcement into parts of the Chicago area in the last week as part of a crackdown pledged by Donald Trump, as neighborhoods have braced. He has threatened to send in troops to deal with crime in the kind of unilateral action taken by the administration in WashingtonDC, ongoing, and Los Angeles earlier in the year following protests there against Ice raids.

This would be expressly against the wishes of Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, and the state governor, JB Pritzker, both Democrats, who have condemned the saber rattling and called for resistance. By Friday troops had not been sent.

Crowds in Broadview could be heard and seen on video shouting “shame on you” towards officers and the facility.

The ruling came after Head Start associations in multiple states sued over the Trump change from this spring.

The directive “results in parents losing childcare, risking missed work, unemployment, forced dropouts, and inability to pay life expenses and support families,” Judge Ricardo Martinez said in his ruling.

The Hill has reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs the early childhood program from low-income families, for comment.

The ruling accompanied another lawsuit by Democratic attorneys general that challenged the policy and won a temporary injunction in their own states Thursday.

Head Start has faced a chaotic situation since the Trump administration’s directive and threats to take away federal money from the program.

“As Plaintiffs enumerate, this chilling effect results in the immediate harm of childhood education loss, disability support, dual language instruction, and stable learning environments, leading to long-term harms in development,” Martinez wrote in his ruling.

Those running Head Start programs were encouraged not to take action when the directive first came out due to all the confusion behind it.

“But I think an important point is that it has a chilling effect, regardless, and that if you’re [an] immigrant family, regardless of what your status is in terms of legal permanent residence, or mixed status family or refugee or whatever it is, you’re legitimately scared of sending your child to an Early Head Start or Head Start program,” Melissa Boteach, chief policy adviser for Zero to Three, previously told The Hill.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/school_classroom_teacher_arizona_10262022_GettyImages-1244462780.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-12 16:56:27.339778

ICE officers conducted a traffic stop in Franklin Park, Ill., to detain Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez on Friday morning. Villegas-Gonzalez allegedly resisted arrest and tried to flee the scene, dragging an ICE officer a “significant” distance with his car. The officer opened fire, fatally shooting the immigrant.

An ICE spokesperson said both the officer and immigrant “immediately received medical treatment and were transferred to a local hospital.”

“The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital,” the spokesperson added. “The officer sustained severe injuries and is in stable condition.”

The DHS said Villegas-Gonzalez, who the department said was a “criminal illegal” immigrant with a “history of reckless driving,” was the target of the enforcement operation.

Villegas-Gonzalez entered the U.S. at an “unknown date and time,” the DHS added.

The incident took place as President Trump’s administration is intensifying immigration enforcement in Chicago this week as part of the so-called Operation Midway Blitz.

Democratic state lawmakers have opposed federal intervention and at a press conference on Friday decried the traffic stop that resulted in the death of Villegas-Gonzalez.

“We need to find out exactly what happened here today. This is a perfect example of why we don’t need military action in this city,” Illinois House Speaker Emanuel Chris Welch (D) said. “This was an avoidable tragedy.”

“What happened today should never have happened. ICE’s tactics have led to a loss of life in our community. Trump has created this chaos,” State Rep. Norma Hernandez (D) told reporters. “We will not stand for the lawlessness of these ICE agents.”

Immigration advocates said they will ramp up local community trainings to prevent adverse interactions with law enforcement agents.

“The Trump deportation machine is out of control. We need to remain vigilant in our community,” said Lawrence Benito, executive director for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “ICE’s aggressive actions do not keep our community safe.”

The protest began at 7 a.m., and is scheduled to last until 7 p.m.

Protesters and agents clashed intermittently throughout the day. While agents have mostly stayed on facility property, at times groups of heavily armed officers have emerged from the entrance gates to push protesters back and allow vans carrying detainees in.

During those moments, protesters and agents have clashed. CBS News Chicago saw agents fire a couple of pepper balls into the protesters as well.

Uniformed officers have also been on the roof of the building, armed with long guns.

The demonstrators said the immigrant community is being unfairly targeted. They have chalked the street outside the facility with messages including ""America was built by immigrants"" and ""Love thy neighbor.""

""It is my duty to use my privilege to try to connect those who are most vulnerable,"" said Francis, a protester who did not want to share her last name. ""And I'm here to show that it is inhumane to be snatching people off the streets and using this office building as a detention facility. These are human beings, and we need to show our support and solidarity with them in getting ice out of Chicago and out of our streets.""

A single counterprotester is also at the facility, carrying an American flag.

He said he's here to promote peace and stand up for ICE agents, who he has heard are getting death threats.

Officers will see the headline, not the nuance, and interpret this as a green light to profile Latino communities across the country.
It is an American tradition, one that resurfaces whenever politicians and courts give law enforcement permission to indulge it.
Real safety requires trust between communities and law enforcement.
Information-sharing with local police is routine, which means the culture of profiling will bleed into local law enforcement, spreading fear even further.","Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court quietly made one of the most dangerous immigration rulings in decades. In a 6-3 decision in Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo, the Court used its “shadow docket” to lift a lower court ban on ICE’s “roving patrols” in Los Angeles.

What does that mean in plain language? This means that ICE agents now have the legal cover to stop, question, and detain people based on appearance, language, accent, workplace, or any other marker that “looks suspicious” to them. In other words, the Court just gave its blessing to racial profiling on a massive scale—and they did it without a full briefing or hearing and without explaining their reasoning.

This is not just about undocumented immigrants. This is about every Latino in this country—citizen, resident, or otherwise—who now has to wonder if going to work, speaking Spanish, or standing outside a Home Depot makes them a target. And if the history of racial profiling in this country tells us anything, it’s that law enforcement will almost always lean on the “easiest” factor—skin color, accent, or language—rather than a combination of subtle clues. The Court knows this, and it green-lit it anyway.

The way the Court issued this ruling makes it even more dangerous. It wasn’t through a full hearing or a published majority opinion. The ruling was issued on the “shadow docket,” a process for issuing procedural orders and deciding rare emergency requests for relief but increasingly used to decide major issues—abortion, voting rights, and now immigration profiling.

Unlike cases on the “merits docket,” shadow docket rulings bypass the transparency of full briefing from the parties and oral arguments, and the accountability of written explanations. Without reasoning, there’s no clear legal guidance for lower courts or law enforcement. That vagueness is the point. It allows agents to abuse power while hiding behind the ambiguity of the Court’s silence. Officers will see the headline, not the nuance, and interpret this as a green light to profile Latino communities across the country. When justice is delivered in the dark, rights disappear in the daylight.

The Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect all of us from unreasonable searches and seizures. Immigration enforcement has always lived in a gray zone where “reasonable suspicion” was enough to trigger an investigation. Reasonable suspicion was never supposed to mean race, accent, or the neighborhood you’re standing in. But this ruling opens the door for exactly that.

In his concurring opinion, Justice Kavanaugh even wrote that ICE can consider those factors in combination, as if law enforcement officers don’t already default to race alone when given permission. His argument that people will be fine as long as they carry identification shows a profound detachment from reality. How many of us walk around with a passport, a birth certificate, or even a Social Security card? And even if we did, what prevents ICE from detaining or assaulting someone before they get the chance to show it?

That is exactly what happened to Jason Gavidia, a U.S. citizen born in Los Angeles, who was thrown against a fence and assaulted by ICE agents despite screaming that he was an American. They confiscated his ID and never gave it back. Next time he’s stopped, what proof does he have left? Kavanaugh doesn’t have to worry about being profiled. His race, class, and position shield him. His arguments ignore the reality for millions of people who do not share his privilege.

And we have seen this all before. Arizona’s “Show Me Your Papers” law created open season for Sheriff Joe Arpaio to harass Latinos on nothing more than skin color and accent. New York City’s stop-and-frisk program turned Black and Latino men into daily suspects until courts declared it unconstitutional. Japanese Americans were interned en masse based solely on ancestry. Slave patrols once prowled for free Black people, re-enslaving them on the presumption they “must” be runaways. Racial profiling is not an aberration. It is an American tradition, one that resurfaces whenever politicians and courts give law enforcement permission to indulge it.

Justice Sotomayor understood this when she wrote her dissent. She warned that ICE should never be allowed to stop people just for being Latino. She called the ruling a betrayal of constitutional values and a dangerous normalization of discrimination. She knows that the so-called “combination of factors” argument is just a slippery slope toward the same abuses we have always seen. She knows that this decision will not just sweep up undocumented immigrants but citizens and permanent residents alike. And she knows that once law enforcement is trained to see a community as suspect, that stigma does not disappear—it spreads and infects every part of policing.

Some people will dismiss this case as “just about immigration,” but they are wrong. This ruling destabilizes public safety itself. Real safety requires trust between communities and law enforcement. When entire neighborhoods fear that an accent, a workplace, or a face is enough to trigger detention, cooperation evaporates. Victims and witnesses stop calling 911. Families stop reporting crimes. Neighborhoods retreat inward, not because they don’t care about safety, but because the police have made it unsafe to come forward. ICE does not act alone. Information-sharing with local police is routine, which means the culture of profiling will bleed into local law enforcement, spreading fear even further.

The Supreme Court knows how unpopular racial profiling is when exposed to daylight. That is why they buried this case in the shadow docket, why there was no full hearing, and why there was no majority opinion. They know that if people truly understood what had been decided, the outrage would be overwhelming. Instead, they normalized it quietly, trusting that the next election cycle and the next culture-war distraction would keep most people from noticing.

But we cannot afford to look away. This is not the final word—cases will continue, advocates will fight, communities will resist. But we need to be clear-eyed about what just happened. The Court sent a message to ICE: you are free to profile. And unless we push back, ICE agents will take that freedom and run with it, in Los Angeles, in Chicago, in Queens, and beyond. The question now is not just what ICE will do with this ruling—it is what we will do in response.

Will we accept a country where Latino citizens are forced to prove their citizenship on demand? Where language, accent, or workplace can be turned into suspicion? Where the Constitution bends depending on who you are and how you look? Or will we demand a country where rights are not contingent on appearance, where law enforcement cannot terrorize communities under the excuse of “reasonable suspicion”?

The isolated, Ice staging facility in rural central Louisiana has emerged as a hub of the Trump administration’s deportation machine.
The standards reflect that immigration detention is designed to be non-punitive as it relates to civil rather than criminal charges.
Geo Group, which manages the Alexandria facility, donated $1m to a Trump supporting political action committee during the 2024 election.
But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub.","He arrived in Alexandria exhausted and sick.

It was early April, and Amilcar Lisser-Posadas – shackled at his hands and feet – had been transferred from a nearby immigration detention center to this remote US immigration facility in Louisiana. He feared it would be his last stop before deportation.

He remembered the stench of the place. The packed jail rooms where hundreds of men were warehoused together with little access to showers, which sometimes spouted brown, rusty water – when they worked.

The 29-year-old, a father of two young daughters who are US citizens, had come to the US from Honduras and had previously been protected under the Obama-era program known as Daca (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which halted deportation for many undocumented people who arrived in the US as children. He had entered as a nine-year-old but his Daca protection had lapsed.

In March, Lisser-Posadas was apprehended by police in Shelby county, Tennessee, for driving with an expired license and was turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). He had no prior criminal record. For four weeks he was moved around various Ice detention centers. He filed a legal request to Ice for permission to remain in the country, citing fears of targeted violence in Honduras. He received no response.

The Alexandria Staging Facility – as it is formally called – was “just not a place for human beings”, he said in a phone interview.

The isolated, Ice staging facility in rural central Louisiana has emerged as a hub of the Trump administration’s deportation machine. The center, which has operated since 2014, is run by the private corrections giant Geo Group. It is considered a “black hole”, by many lawyers, advocates and former detainees interviewed by the Guardian. Living conditions are deplorable, many former detainees have alleged, and there is almost no legal access to the center.

A four-month Guardian US investigation into the Alexandria facility has revealed a pattern of alleged due process violations, previously unreported accounts of neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays, despite the center’s intended use as a short-term detention facility. It also found that the facility adopted a temporary and unexplained change to normal medical standards earlier this year that protect detainees’ welfare. Reporters relied on court documents, public records, internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) statistics, 911 calls and interviews with 10 people either formerly detained or deported from the Alexandria facility, or those with loved ones held there.

The investigation also reviewed leaked flight manifests from Ice’s largest airline contractor, Global Crossings (GlobalX). They underscore the critical role the Alexandria facility, which is within the grounds of a small regional airport, has played in Ice’s mission of rapidly transferring and deporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants. The data, which covers roughly 100 days from Donald Trump’s second inauguration, shows that more than 20,000 migrant detainees passed through the Alexandria airport on Ice charters operated by the carrier at a rate of almost 200 a day.

“Louisiana is where people go to be disappeared,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “My concern about the Alexandria facility is [that] it is a black box.”

Visitors are not permitted, and it is the kind of place where mistakes can happen, giving officials “a convenient excuse to wrongly deport people”, Ahmed added.

“The only way to stop that is for people to have access to attorneys.”

In response to the Guardian’s findings, the DHS assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, did not address specific questions but said in a statement: “Any claim that there are inhumane conditions at Ice detention centers are false. Ice has higher detention standards than most US prisons that hold actual US citizens.”

She added: “All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.”

A spokesperson for Geo Group also did not respond to specific questions, but said in a statement that the company was “proud” of the role it had played for over 40 years “to support the law enforcement mission” of Ice.

The statement added that all the company’s “support services” were monitored by Ice and the DHS to ensure “strict compliance” with the agency’s detention standards. When issues are identified by Ice, a company spokesperson said they were “quickly” resolved.

The Alexandria staging facility is supposed to be a short-term center that holds detainees for a maximum of 72 hours. It has a 400-person capacity, and detains only men. It is divided into four large shared rooms holding about 80 people and a separate cell block.

But the center is routinely holding people for longer than the three-day maximum, a Guardian review of anonymized immigration enforcement data reveals. Of the more than 28,000 people who were detained in Alexandria from January 2025 until late July, 20% were held longer than 72 hours. Since October 2023, analysis shows that 742 people have been held there for 10 days or more.

While immigration detention standards are not uniform, centers detaining people for longer than 72 hours are generally required to provide more services – ranging from personal hygiene to recreation to legal visitation rights – than those designated as short-term.

“What this analysis tells us is that there is a requirement for the government to provide 24-hour attorney access at this facility forthwith,” said Ahmed of the ACLU of Louisiana. “It is clearly not a short-term facility any more, if it ever was one.”

Lisser-Posadas was one of those held for an extended period.

He was detained in Alexandria for about 12 days, according to a family member who remained in contact with him throughout, and a review of dated Ice detainee locator screenshots. He described routine lockdowns and a lack of food. He was unable to change his clothes or underwear. He arrived in Alexandria with chest congestion, a fever and an ear infection that worsened over time. He received no medication until the last two days of his stay, he said.

Medical care at the facility is provided by Ice’s health service corps, which is a part of the agency’s enforcement and removals operation.

Lisser-Posadas remembered asking Geo Group guards repeatedly for an update on the status of his legal request to remain in the country.

“I was trying to make sure that I got an explanation. Why I was being brought there? Why they wanted to deport me? Why they were holding me there for so many days?”

Instead, he said, one staff member, a detention lieutenant, looked at him through a secure window. “She would look at me straight, and then start laughing,” he recalled.

Eventually, after staging a small protest by refusing to return to his cell, Lisser-Posadas was moved back to another Louisiana facility in the nearby town of Jena for about four days. He was then brought back to Alexandria and quickly deported to Honduras on a series of GlobalX flights that left Louisiana at 6am on 23 April. His request for deferred removal citing fear of persecution was never resolved.

“My heart broke,” he said. “I saw kids [on the plane], some were still in their school uniform. They were being deported with their families. There were pregnant women as well.”

The leaked flight records confirm there were eight children under the age of 16 booked on the same plane.

Lisser-Posadas spoke to the Guardian from a federal prison where he was being held after he was apprehended at the southern border trying to re-enter the US in May to reunite with his family. He is now facing deportation again.

The Alexandria staging facility is operated under the performance-based national detention standards, an extensive set of guidelines designed to ensure a “safe and secure detention environment for staff and detainees”. The standards reflect that immigration detention is designed to be non-punitive as it relates to civil rather than criminal charges.

Alexandria has been found deficient in a number of these standards, according to a review of Ice inspection reports from 2022 onwards, including specific shortcomings over medical care and the use of force.

But because the standards are not legally binding, deficiencies rarely lead to meaningful consequences.

The facility was inspected by Ice in February this year – the first such examination in Trump’s second term.

A contract seen by the Guardian, agreed between Ice and the local district authority, shows the site was granted a special waiver four days before the DHS inspectors arrived, which absolved it of certain medical screening standards. The standard – which states that all detainees must receive a medical, dental and mental health intake screening as soon as possible, but no later than 12 hours after their arrival at a detention facility – was waived from 21 February to 22 May, according to the contract.

The document notes “there shall be no public disclosures regarding this agreement” without approval by Ice and offers no rationale for the decision.

John Roth, the DHS inspector general between 2013 and 2017, described the revelation as “highly troubling for the population of detainees there”.

“The reason they wrote the performance-based standards is partly to avoid constitutional challenges on the conditions of confinement,” Roth said. “To the extent you are deviating from that in any way, you run into trouble.”

The DHS declined to provide a comment on Roth’s statement.

Alexandria passed the February inspection without any deficiencies. Inspectors with the DHS’s office of professional responsibility noted in their report that 13 detainees had been interviewed who all “reported satisfaction with facility services”.

Roth argued the facility should face an immediate independent audit, describing the most recent inspection as holding “no validity because there is no detail behind it”.

A review of 911 calls, released by local emergency authorities, reveals that the facility has seen a spike in emergency call-outs since 2023, under the Biden administration. This year, between January and the end of May, there was an average of more than two 911 calls per month, a rate that – if it persists – would put 2025 on track as the year with the most calls in recent history. On 19 March, a staff member frantically called 911 to report a detainee had attempted to hang themselves. “We need an ambulance, emergency ASAP,” says a panicked staffer at the facility. “What’s going on in there?” Another person can be heard shouting in the background. Five days earlier the center called to report a man with a history of stroke had passed out. Next month, the facility called requesting an ambulance for a detainee with low oxygen and high heart rate. In May, a call was made after an apparent episode of self-harm.

McLaughlan, the DHS assistant secretary, said: “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters Ice custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.”

She added: “The Alexandria Staging Facility is in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody.”

The Alexandria facility began operations over a decade ago, costing about $20m to construct, at the end of a deportations peak during Barack Obama’s second term. Louisiana now detains more migrants per capita than any state in the US. The facility, one of nine privately operated centers, sits as the effective nucleus in the middle of “detention alley”, the network of remote immigration detention centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

Geo Group, which manages the Alexandria facility, donated $1m to a Trump supporting political action committee during the 2024 election. Its CEO predicted the new administration’s mass deportation agenda could increase revenue by an additional $400m annually. It was reported in May that Trump’s hard-right border czar, Tom Homan, was a paid consultant for Geo Group before joining the administration. A White House spokesperson has said Homan abides by “the highest ethical standards”.

The former acting head of Ice, Todd Lyons, has said the administration wanted to turn Trump’s deportation machine into “[Amazon] prime, but with human beings”. It has already begun attempting to replicate Alexandria’s functionality in other states, with new detention centers in Florida and Texas constructed in close proximity to runways. But leaked GlobalX and detention data indicates the Alexandria facility remains Ice’s primary deportation hub. On 21 July 2025, the facility saw its highest detained population since 2023, with nearly 500 people held there – almost 100 people above its stated capacity.

A spokesperson for Geo Group did not dispute the Guardian’s findings on capacity numbers but said that the company’s facilities “are never overcrowded”.

The detention center is set within the grounds of a second world war-era airpark, once an air force base, and now a minor regional airport complex that sees a small handful of commercial flights each day. In July, the Guardian observed from a third-floor observation deck inside a red-bricked terminal building as a cluster of large Ice charter jets landed in quick succession and taxied towards the detention center out of public view.

Although the entrance to the center is situated on a restricted road, the site is partially surrounded by an 18-hole golf course. From the vantage point of the 13th hole, a reporter observed as dozens of shackled detainees, including a line of young women, were driven on to the tarmac in minibuses and escorted under guard to a queue of six planes. The asphalt shimmered in the searing heat and many bent their heads as they walked towards their flights. Golfers teed off just a few hundred feet away.

Of the 39 Ice flights that day, 23 July, over half either departed or landed in Alexandria, according to tracking data shared with the Guardian by the immigration advocate Tom Cartwright, highlighting its centrality to the mass deportation agenda.

Baldomero Orozco-Juarez, an immigrant community leader and father of one, remembered taking a similar walk across the tarmac when he was deported in the early hours of 14 May 2025.

He had been arrested by Ice less than 24 hours earlier and driven at extraordinary speed from Carthage, Mississippi, 250 miles to Alexandria – the sole passenger in the back of a government SUV.

He repeatedly asked staff in Alexandria to call his family or a lawyer, but was denied telephone access, he claimed. Emails reviewed by the Guardian confirm he was deported before his lawyer could find him. Although facing a removal order, Orozco-Juarez held a valid work permit and a pending legal application to remain in the US.

“They made us walk slowly,” he said in a phone interview from Guatemala. “They just laughed. Laughed at the way we walked. The way we got on the plane. They treated us so badly.”

His attorney, Jeremy Jong, described the deportation as “a targeted kidnapping”.

“And I would ask: is this the system that we want? Where someone can be deported in the middle of the night, without access to their lawyer.” Jong added. “Is that a system that treats everyone with dignity and respect?”

Badar Khan Suri remembered landing in Alexandria with little comprehension of where he was.

He was marched single file in shackles from a jet parked about 50 meters from the detention center and held in a waiting area lined with metal benches for over an hour. He claimed in an interview that a security guard forcefully spread his legs and punched him in the ankles as they eventually removed his restraints and took him to a cell block.

Leaked flight manifests confirm Suri was flown to the staging facility on 18 March 2025 on a packed GlobalX flight from Richmond, Virginia, in mid-afternoon.

Suri, an Indian postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University in the US on a valid academic research visa, was one of a group of immigrant students targeted by the Trump administration for their criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza. He had been arrested in Virginia, detained, and then flown over a thousand miles to Louisiana without the ability to contact a lawyer or his family.

He was held in Alexandria for three days, inside a windowless cell under rolling lockdown, which intensified his claustrophobia and panic. He said he could not recall speaking to a government representative for his entire time in Alexandria and was given no official answers about why he had been detained or where he was being sent. He feared deportation at any moment.

He had not been fully processed into Ice detention, he said, and so was unable to use a phone within his cell block for longer than 20 seconds. He would ring his family back in Virginia at regular intervals and hear their panicked voices, but they were unable to hear him speak as his line was muted, he said.

“I was able to hear my wife’s voice, my children in the background. But they never responded to my call,” he said. “‘Who is there? Can you hear me?’ they would say. And if I wasn’t able to connect to them, I would think: ‘What has happened? Maybe someone has also taken them away too.’”

The staging facility has no space for confidential legal calls, no visitation capacity, or attorney client meeting room, according to multiple attorneys who have visited the center on Ice approved tours. Lawyers who have tried contacting clients held in Alexandria have said the only way to do so is to directly contact the Ice field office director for the entire region to facilitate a phone call.

Ice’s national detention standards on telephone access state detainees and legal counsel should “be able to communicate effectively with each other” and that privacy for legal phone calls “shall be ensured”.

Geo Group said it provides “in-person and virtual legal visitation”, but declined to comment on Alexandria specifically.

Suri’s immigration attorney Hassan Ahmad confirmed he was eventually able to contact him via the Ice field office director. The phone call was brief and the two spoke in Urdu as Ahmad “couldn’t be assured of confidentiality” and could hear an Ice officer present in the background.

Suri was transferred from Alexandria by van to a detention center in Alvarado, Texas, the next day. Eventually, on 14 May, he was released and continues to fight his immigration case back in Virginia. It was the same day that Orozco-Juarez was removed from the US.

“This [center] should not exist,” said Suri. “There should be detention centers with due process.

“At that time [in Alexandria], I realized there is nothing called rights. It was a real black hole. A real disgrace.”

He continued: “Who are the people detained there? Those people are married to American citizens. They have American children. They are an integral part of American society.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de4ab980efb18c5541f5f95f2224a4efd5d8a70/0_1032_2400_1920/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=22bce75bb2643a0b7081b0c768509ff1",N,,2025-09-12 17:57:48.060536

The fourth annual Fiesta Del Rio scheduled for Sept. 20 at Rivergreen Park was set to highlight Hispanic-owned businesses, organizations and cultural programs in Everett.

""We know how much this event means to our city. It's a celebration of culture, music, food and togetherness,"" the city said in social media posts. ""But with the recent ICE raids in our region, many of our friends and neighbors are feeling fear and uncertainty.""

Everett Mayor Carlo DeMaria said it was supposed to be a day of celebration. ""Those who were going to be cooking for us, the food, the restaurants and the entertainment, just felt very uncomfortable,"" Mayor DeMaria said.

""Everybody gets excited to have one month to celebrate the beauty of Latin America. The colors, the flavors, and rhythms,"" said Veronica Robles, executive director of the Veronica Robles Cultural Center.

Robles said that has now been overshadowed. ""People are concerned, are afraid, not only for themselves but for their families and their friends, for their coworkers,"" Robles said. ""We are living in unprecedented times.""

""Patriot 2.0"" operation

Earlier this month, ICE began targeting Massachusetts with another immigration crackdown called ""Patriot 2.0."" The Justice Department has sued neighboring Boston over its ""sanctuary city"" policies and the city's refusal to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

""We believe it would not be right to hold a celebration at a time when members of our community may not feel safe attending,"" the city of Everett said.

Homeland Security said the ""Patriot 2.0"" operation would ""target the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens"" in the state. However, advocates for local immigrant groups have said that the people they serve are scared.

""People are terrified""

""People are terrified, everybody is terrified. I think they are worried they can be picked up for no reason,"" Jeff Theilman, the president and CEO of International Institute of New England, told WBZ-TV.

The city of Everett said, ""We remain committed to celebrating our city's diversity in the future, and we will look for other ways to come together as one community.""

DeMaria said the decision came after a local resident posted a video online showing ICE agents at Rivergreen Park, where the event was scheduled to be held. ""I guess they were using that as a spot to meet,"" DeMaria said.

DeMaria said he was assured by ICE officials that they would not have been in the city on the date of the festival, but with the number of cancellations they received, there would not be enough vendors to have the event.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/12/a072dc25-2aee-453c-910f-926921fec259/thumbnail/1200x630/96ef55e94fe2d3ed07d410a8c4a33c5a/everett-ice.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 18:57:24.296561

Yet that pledge didn’t exempt South Korea from the machinations of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.
It wasn’t even so much that the South Korean workers were detained — it was how they were detained.","On Thursday afternoon, a Korean Air flight carrying more than 300 South Korean workers who’d been previously detained by U.S. immigration officials left Atlanta for South Korea. The flight ended a weeklong diplomatic tussle between the United States and the South Korean government that began when ICE officials raided a Hyundai-LG battery factory in Savannah, Georgia, and arrested nearly 500 people including hundreds of South Korean nationals.

The Trump administration’s obsessive focus on mass deportations is undermining its larger political agenda.

The ICE raid, which came just 11 days after President Donald Trump sat down with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, is having far-reaching implications — and is a glaring example of how the Trump administration’s obsessive focus on mass deportations is undermining its larger political agenda.

Homeland Security officials boasted that the Hyundai raid was the “largest single-site enforcement operation” in the agency’s history. But, not surprisingly, in South Korea the detentions were met with outrage from across the country’s political spectrum.

South Korea is reportedly the largest foreign direct investor in the United States and the country’s sixth largest trading partner. As part of a recently reached trade deal, South Korea agreed to invest $350 billion in the U.S. to help revitalize the country’s manufacturing sector.

Yet that pledge didn’t exempt South Korea from the machinations of Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

It wasn’t even so much that the South Korean workers were detained — it was how they were detained. ICE officials released videos of the workers with shackles on their arms and feet. “Is this any way for the US to treat an ally?” asked the left-leaning South Korean news outlet Hankyoreh, while the country’s most prominent conservative outlet, Chosun Ilbo, labeled the raid a “merciless arrest operation … that cannot happen between allies.”

These were workers with visas that allowed them to be in the United States, but the ICE videos made it appear that they were nothing more than common criminals. In fact, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Seoul’s foreign ministry said the Trump administration wanted to transport the workers in handcuffs but yielded when South Korea objected that they weren’t criminals.

President Lee has suggested that the raid is creating a “very confusing” situation for Korean companies and may lead some to question whether they should be doing business in the United States.

That’s already happening. Korean companies are freezing travel to the United States and recalling staff over concerns about new raids.

But of far greater significance, South Korean businesses have suspended at least 22 U.S. projects in the United States, many of them geared toward opening new manufacturing facilities.

South Korean engineering companies are frequently hired by American companies to set up new manufacturing facilities because it can be difficult to find American workers with the necessary skills.

But once that initial work is done, U.S. employees work the factory floors. The Hyundai-LG facility in Georgia is supposed to employ 8,500 workers. Now, all of that is on hold. Multiply that disruption across nearly two dozen factories, and potentially hundreds of thousands of new manufacturing jobs could be affected.

Korean companies are freezing travel to the United States and recalling staff over concerns about new raids.

Part of the challenge for South Korean companies is that they have struggled to get long-term visas for their employees to enter and work in the United States. Indeed, many of those who were picked up may have been bending visa rules, but rather than look for ways to resolve this issue, the Trump administration sent ICE in.

According to a spokesman for the South Korean foreign ministry, since Trump’s inauguration, it reached out 52 times to administration officials regarding visas for highly skilled workers — but to no avail.

According to Jenny Town, director of the Korea program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, “the longer this situation goes on, the less likely [South Korean] companies will want to bring their employees into the United States. It’s completely self-defeating for what the Trump administration has been lobbying other countries to do as far as investing in the U.S.”

While the repatriation of the South Korean workers is an essential first step, the Trump administration is making little effort to smooth things over with Seoul. When the South Korean foreign minister met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier this week, the State Department readout made no mention of the LG raid. Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, even went so far as to claim that the raid is “a great opportunity for us to make sure that all companies are reassured that when you come to the United States, you’ll know what the rules of the game are.”

Suffice it to say, that is not the view in South Korea. It’s not hard to imagine that other countries looking to invest in the United States will look at what happened in Georgia and decide that the risk to their workers is not worth it.

But there are also larger political implications as well. According to Town, polling in South Korea ahead of the Trump-Lee summit showed little public support for the trade deal with the United States, with many asking, “What does South Korea get out of it?” Those views have metastasized since the LG raid. These events put “greater and greater pressure on Lee’s presidency,” said Town, “and give him less political space to address the U.S. bilateral relationship.” Moreover, the U.S. is South Korea’s largest foreign direct investment destination. “Much of that,” says Town, “may be in jeopardy.”

The Trump administration is making little effort to smooth things over with Seoul.

Or more directly, the Trump administration’s moves to increase manufacturing jobs are taking a back seat to the laser-like focus on deporting as many people as possible. It’s hard to separate the zealousness of the LG-Hyundai raid from the White House diktat, per deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, that ICE meet a quota of three thousand arrests a day.

In fact, Tori Branum, a MAGA congressional candidate in Georgia, is taking credit for tipping off ICE about the alleged issues at the LG-Hyundai plant. For wannabe MAGA politicians, pointing the finger at potential immigration violations takes precedence over the creating jobs and growing the economy.

This is the political bind in which Trump and his supporters have put themselves. They have placed mass deportation at the top of the president’s agenda and seem utterly indifferent to the consequences of that decision. It’s bad enough that ICE is creating a climate of fear across America — though that’s not something that upsets the White House. But the obsessive focus on a never-ending cycle of deportations is undermining one of the country’s key bilateral relationships and undercutting Trump’s stated aim of rebuilding American manufacturing.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250908-hyundai-plant-vl-117p-c91063.jpg",N,,2025-09-12 18:57:28.628998

Friday’s shooting comes days after DHS launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” a new immigration enforcement operation across Chicago and Illinois that the department says will “honor” Katie Abraham, a 20-year-old student at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who was killed in a January car crash.

There are multiple reasons USCIS should restore the cure to deficient signatures: There is lack of clarity on the USCIS signature requirement.
USCIS has historically allowed a petitioner or beneficiary to correct a deficient signature when USCIS deems a signature deficient during the adjudication process.
The Covid-era requirement to retain an original was not carried forward in the updated guidance in the USCIS Policy Manual.","Unlike most federal agencies, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has not transitioned to electronic filing on a widespread basis, but still relies heavily on paper-based filings for most petitions involving work authorization, extension of legal status, and permanent residence. For these paper-based filings, USCIS does not allow electronic signatures such as DocuSign or other electronic services that allow a person to type a name or accept terms which then inserts a script font signature on the document. Instead, USCIS requires a handwritten signature, consistent with how a person signs their name.

USCIS has long recognized that a signature on immigration petitions does not have to be legible, in English, or in cursive so long as it is handwritten1. Also, the USCIS policy has historically recognized that the regulations do not require an “original” or “wet ink” signature on a petition, although in practice USCIS was inconsistent, often requiring original signatures for some petitions but not others2. With the emergence of remote work during the Covid-era, USCIS began universally accepting reproduced copies of signatures for “all benefit petitions.”

Recently there has been an increase in denials, preceded by USCIS issuing a Request for Evidence or Notice of Intent to Deny where USCIS has requested “the original signed document…..that consists of the original wet signature3”. However, these requests are less about USCIS not accepting “scanned” copies of the signed forms and more about USCIS’ interpretation of “handwritten” signatures. Specifically, USCIS requests the “original” form signed by a party to determine whether the person wrote their signature directly on the form or instead applied their handwritten signature.

When a petitioner cannot produce the form with the original handwritten signature directly on the form, the USCIS has denied such petitions, concluding that a handwritten signature that a petitioner digitally “affixes” to a form is not comparable to a petitioner handwriting the signature directly on the form. Even when a petitioner submits replacement pages with a newly-signed original handwritten signature, along with a sworn statement affirming that the original filing contained their signature and they agreed to the petition’s contents, USCIS has still refused to accept it as sufficient to prevent denial.

Unfortunately, a denied case can have severe consequences. While some parties may refile a case by resubmitting a new petition and repaying the filing fees, others have no recourse because of missed deadlines. Even cases where refiling is possible, the consequences can be severe: a foreign national losing employment authorization or valid status. Although those affected by USCIS denials based solely on technical signature issues may seek legal action in court, the real solution lies with USCIS to ensure fairness to the public and avoid additional administrative burden for the agency.

The problem behind the increase in denials based upon signatures is USCIS’s refusal to allow a party to correct alleged signature deficiencies during the adjudication process. This action contradicts long-standing USCIS policy and practice.

In 2016 USCIS issued the “first formal written guidance on the meaning of the regulatory requirement with respect to signatures4”. Among other things, that guidance recognized a distinction between signatures which USCIS deemed deficient upon intake compared to signatures USCIS deemed deficient during adjudication. Thus, USCIS announced its policy that USCIS would reject a petition and return it to the person with the refunded fees; however, if the USCIS had reason to question a signature after a case is accepted for processing, USCIS may ask the person to sign the petition. This recognized that impact of a denied case: non-refundable filing fees, lost time, and personal consequences such as loss of status, employment authorization, and eligibility for certain immigration options.

Despite the long-standing policy and practice of USCIS to allow corrections for deficient signatures, USCIS has shifted its approach. USCIS is referencing updated guidance in the USCIS policy manual which states, “USCIS does not provide an opportunity to correct (or cure) a deficient signature.5” Although that statement in the updated Policy Manual immediately follows the sentence about USCIS rejecting petitions at the time of filing, where fees are fully refunded, USCIS has extended that interpretation to cases where it determines a signature is deficient while adjudicating a petition that has been pending for months or even years.

The solution to the current uptick in denials for deficient signatures is simple: USCIS should reinstate its longstanding policy and practice allowing a party to correct deficient signatures. This would ensure otherwise meritorious cases are not denied solely for technical errors, subjective interpretations, or confusion about the signature requirement.

There are multiple reasons USCIS should restore the cure to deficient signatures:

There is lack of clarity on the USCIS signature requirement. Beginning with Covid-19 and the transition to remote-work, USCIS began accepting reproduced copies of signatures for all petitions6. Some interpreted “reproduced copies of signatures” to mean that a handwritten signature could be reproduced and affixed on a form, whereas USCIS apparently intends it to mean only that a form can be reproduced after a petitioner handwrites their signature directly on the form. Assuming arguendo that USCIS is correct, it’s reasonable for the public to be confused about the meaning of reproduced copies of signatures especially since the USCIS Regulations, the binding authority on signatures, simply state the signature must be “handwritten”, not that it has to be handwritten directly on the form.

The USCIS stance on signatures is more stringent than courts. Courts in the U.S. generally accept electronic signatures because federal laws like the E-Sign Act and state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) give electronic signatures the same legal effect as pen-to-paper or “original” signatures7. In contrast, the USCIS does not allow electronic signature services such as DocuSign, which is why some petitioners who work remotely or otherwise don’t have easy access to a printer and scanner have resorted to handwriting their name and digitally affixing it to a form when needed.

The USCIS stance on signatures is more stringent than other federal immigration agencies. The Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) allows handwritten, digital, and electronic signatures on all documents filed with an immigration court or the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), regardless of whether the filing is by mail, in person, or electronically. The EOIR Policy states that a signature can be a “reproduction of the signer’s handwritten signature.""8 Similarly, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) allows both electronic signatures and reproduced copies of a handwritten signature for Form I-20 and Form I-983, documents related to legal status and work authorization of international students. The ICE policy guidance includes “reproduced copies of a signature,” meaning “a digitally reproduced copy may be a scanned image of a physical signature.” These same forms, I-20 and I-983, are included in immigration petitions with USCIS as evidence of a foreign student’s legal status.

The ability to correct a deficient signature has been long-standing USCIS policy. USCIS has historically allowed a petitioner or beneficiary to correct a deficient signature when USCIS deems a signature deficient during the adjudication process. This policy was memorialized in USCIS Policy Memorandum in 2016, recognizing that an ability to cure does not apply to petitions rejected in the USCIS mailroom and returned to petitioners with a refund, but does apply when USCIS questions a signature in the course of adjudicating a pending application.

The ability to correct a deficient signature has been long-standing USCIS practice. For almost a decade since the USCSI written policy to allow a party to correct a signature during adjudication, USCIS followed that practice. USCIS issued countless requests for evidence and notice of intent to deny requesting the petitioner or beneficiary to “create replacement pages and submit with the original signatures.”

The ability to cure a deficient signature during the adjudication process is equitable. Under current USCIS practice, USCIS timely returns a petition and refunds filing fees for those who are “lucky” enough to have USCIS reject a case upon filing for a deficient signature but retains the filing fees for those deemed deficient during adjudication, not to mention the harm in the time of processing. Due to USCIS processing times, certain cases that are subject to this new USCIS opinion that deficient signatures cannot be corrected during adjudication are cases filed when USCIS was operating under the long-standing policy to allow corrections.

The ability to cure a deficient signature is necessary to prevent irreparable harm. The filing fees for immigration petitions are costly, often thousands of dollars. Refiling a denied petition involves repaying the fees. Worse yet, sometimes refiling is not an option. For example, if USCIS denies an H-1b cap petition after the filing deadline, the petitioner loses the opportunity for that H-1b for the entire fiscal year. Moreover, the impact escalates if the beneficiary does not get selected in the H-1b lottery the following year. Similarly, in immigrant petitions where the priority date is based on the receipt date at USCIS, a denial results in loss of the filing date, which can delay the permanent residence process by several years. With processing times more than one year for I-140 petitions and multiple years for I-130 petitions, having to “restart” the clock by refiling is significant. A denial may also jeopardize a foreign national’s legal status, work authorization, or ability to include a dependent child nearing the age limit on permanent residence application.

The ability to correct a deficient signature is efficient for USCIS. The USCIS denials for alleged deficient signatures results in refiled petitions or appeals - adding work to an agency that is already understaffed and overburdened with volume of cases. Moreover, parties with cases that are not eligible to refile or appear – such as H-1b cap cases that are deadline-sensitive – may opt to sue USCIS, burdening not only USCIS but the court system.

The ability to correct a deficient signature recognizes substance over form. The purpose of a signature is to validate the identity of the signer and the intent/consent of the signer. For petitions with USCIS, a signature signifies the requester’s consent to three things: (1) the person knows of the content of the request and any supporting documents; (2) the person has reviewed and approves of any information contained in such request and any supporting documents; and (3) the person certifies under penalty of perjury that the request and any supporting documents are true and correct. The method of signature should not override the identity and intent of a party.9 Immigration law - including the right to live and work in the United States - should not hinge on a technicality involving the method of a signature when the intent of the signer is clear and verifiable.

Black’s Law Dictionary defines “sign” as “to affix one’s name to a writing or instrument, for the purpose of authenticating it, or to give it effect as one’s act”.10 If USCIS deems a party’s handwritten signature unacceptable because he affixed it to the USCIS form, USCIS should, at a minimum, allow the party to correct the deficiency by re-signing the form during the adjudication process. does not recognize a person’s handwritten signature that he affixes to a petition as acceptable, USCIS should at least allow such a person to correct a deficient signature during adjudication. The real solution – addressing not only denials but also the additional workload on USCIS from re-filings and appeals– is for USCIS to allow a party to correct a deficient signature during adjudication.

This report is part of “Upheaval Across America,” an examination of immigration enforcement under the second Trump administration produced by Carnegie-Knight News21. For more stories, visit https://upheaval.news21.com/.

In the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election, US Army veteran Sae Joon Park kept in mind a warning from an immigration officer: If Donald Trump were elected, Park would likely be at risk for deportation.

Park was just 7 when he came to the US from Seoul, South Korea. A green card holder, he joined the Army at 19 “to serve the country that I believed in,” he said. He received a Purple Heart after being shot twice while deployed in Panama, but after leaving the military, he lived with PTSD. That led to an addiction to crack cocaine and, ultimately, trouble with the law.

In 2009, he was arrested for drug possession. After he jumped bail, afraid he would fail a drug test, he served time in prison and was told he would be deported. However, because he was a veteran, he was granted deferred action upon his release, which allowed him to remain in the US as long as he checked in with immigration officials annually.

For 14 years, he did just that while raising children and building a new life in Honolulu. In June, everything changed.

When Park went in for his regular appointment, he was told he had a removal order against him. After talking things over with his family and lawyer, he decided to self-deport because, he said, he worried he could not survive extended time in detention while fighting deportation.

“I could have ended up in ‘Alligator Alcatraz,’” Park said, referring to the Florida detention center that has come under fire for alleged inhumane conditions. “I was a legal resident. They allowed me to join, serve the country—front line, taking bullets for this country. That should mean something.”

Instead, he said, “This is how veterans are being treated.”

During his first term in office, Trump enacted immigration policies aimed at a group normally safe from scrutiny: noncitizens who serve in the US military. His administration sought to restrict typical avenues for immigrant service members to obtain citizenship and make it harder for green card holders to enlist—actions that ultimately were unsuccessful.

Now, as the second Trump administration engages in a campaign to detain and deport immigrants living in the US, military experts and veterans say service members are once again targets.

“President Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportations, and he didn’t exempt military members, veterans and their families,” said retired Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a lawyer who helps veterans facing deportation. “It harms military recruiting, military readiness and the national security of our country.”

Under the Biden administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a policy stating a noncitizen’s prior military service was a “significant mitigating factor” that must be considered in enforcement decisions, including deportation orders. The policy also offered protection to noncitizen family members of veterans or those on active duty.

In April, under the Trump administration, that policy was rescinded and replaced with one saying that while “ICE values the contributions of all those who have served in the US military … military service alone does not automatically exempt” one from enforcement actions.

The new policy directs agents to ask about military service during intake interviews and to document service. However, local ICE leaders have the authority to proceed with deportations of those who have served, though they may consider factors such as community ties and employment history.

Both policies barred enforcement actions against active-duty service members, absent significant aggravating factors. Under the new policy, noncitizen relatives of service members are not addressed at all.

In the wake of all of this, some service members, like Park, are choosing to self-deport. In other instances, immigrant family members of soldiers or veterans have been detained; those include Narciso Barranco, a father of three US Marines who was arrested in Santa Ana, California, while working the landscaping job he had held for three decades.

“Thousands of families like ours are being ripped apart,” Barranco’s son, veteran Alejandro Barranco, testified in July to a US Senate subcommittee on border security. “I want this committee to understand the human impact of the immigration policies of this administration. I want them to know that the people being ripped from our communities are hardworking, honest, patriotic people who are raising America’s teachers, nurses and Marines.

“Deporting them doesn’t just hurt my family,” he added. “It hurts all of us.”

There is no publicly available data on how many veterans are being affected, though ICE is supposed to track removals of service members and veterans and the Department of Homeland Security is typically required to share that information with Congress.

A 2019 federal report found at least 250 veterans had been placed in removal proceedings between 2013 and 2018, with at least 92 ultimately deported. The report said that while ICE had policies for handling cases of noncitizen veterans, it did not consistently identify and track actions against those individuals.

News21 could find only two DHS reports tracking removals of veterans. One, covering the first six months of 2022, said five veterans had been deported; another, for calendar year 2019, said three veterans had been deported.

In June, US Rep. Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat, and nine other members of Congress wrote to the secretaries of defense, veterans affairs and homeland security seeking the number of veterans currently facing deportation—noting “some estimates” put the overall number of deported veterans at 10,000.

In a news release, Ansari said all veterans “deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, not abandoned by an administration that turns their backs on their sacrifice.” Her office did not return messages from News21. DHS and ICE also did not respond to questions.

In past years, bills to do more to protect immigrant service members and their relatives have been introduced in Congress. One measure, introduced in May, would give green cards to parents of service members and allow those already deported to apply for a visa from abroad. It’s still in committee.

US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and Army veteran, has proposed several measures related to immigrant service members, but those bills have gone nowhere. Last year, for example, she reintroduced a bill to allow deported veterans who have completed the preliminary naturalization process to attend citizenship interviews at a port of entry, embassy or consulate instead of having to obtain parole to come back into the US. It died in committee.

For Duckworth, deported veterans are not a partisan issue.

“This is about the men and women who wore the uniform of our great nation, many of whom were promised a chance at citizenship by our government in exchange for their service,” she told News21. “It’s about doing the right thing and keeping our nation’s promise.”

‘I wanted to serve this country, this beautiful country’

As of February 2024, more than 40,000 foreign nationals were serving in active and reserve components of the Armed Forces, according to the Congressional Research Service. Another 115,000 were veterans living in the US.

Serving in the military has long been a pathway to citizenship, with provisions providing expedited naturalization for noncitizen service members dating back to the Civil War.

During World War I, according to US Citizenship and Immigration Services, foreign-born soldiers made up 18% of the Army. Some units even became known for their immigrant members; for example, the 77th Infantry Division was nicknamed the “Melting Pot Division.”

Since the end of World War I, more than 800,000 people have gained citizenship through military service, according to the CRS report. Since fiscal year 2020, service members from the

Philippines, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria and Ghana accounted for over 38% of service member naturalizations.

Generally, noncitizens who are permanent legal residents and who speak, read and write English fluently may join the armed forces. And during designated periods of hostility, noncitizens who serve honorably for any period of time—even one day—are eligible to apply for naturalization if they meet all criteria. The US is still considered to be in a period of hostility because of the post-9/11 war on terrorism.

Despite that longstanding policy, the Department of Defense, during Trump’s first term in office, tried to make it harder for service members to naturalize by forcing them to complete six months—rather than one day—before obtaining the “certification of honorable service” required to apply for citizenship. Naturalization applications subsequently plummeted by 72% from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2018.

The American Civil Liberties Union sued, and in 2020, a federal judge struck down the change.

Plaintiffs, including then-Army Pfc. Ange Samma, celebrated. Samma, originally from Burkina Faso, had lived in the US on a green card since he was a teenager. In 2018, he enlisted in the Army.

“I wanted to serve this country, this beautiful country,” Samma told News21.

Over 14 months, even after he’d been assigned to Camp Humphreys in South Korea, Samma tried over and over to obtain certification of his honorable service—to no avail. He finally became naturalized not long after the 2020 court ruling.

This year, Samma earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. He’s living in Statesboro, Georgia, while hunting for jobs. Because he now has citizenship, “There are many more opportunities that are open for me,” he said. “It’s very rewarding to have it. You feel proud.”

The Biden administration wound up rescinding the six-month policy, according to ACLU attorney Scarlet Kim. As of now, military members can once again apply for naturalization as soon as their service begins.

However, Kim notes, “If you don’t get your citizenship while you’re serving and then you’re discharged, what has happened is that you can potentially become vulnerable to deportation … despite having served our country in the military for however long.”

That’s exactly the situation facing Army veteran Marlon Parris.

Parris, who was born in Trinidad, has been in the US with a green card since the 1990s. He served in the Army for six years, including two tours in Iraq, and received the Army Commendation Medal three times, according to records filed in federal court.

Before his discharge in 2007, he was diagnosed with acute post-traumatic stress disorder, which was cited when Parris pleaded guilty in 2011 to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to federal prison.

Upon his release in 2016, he received a letter from the government stating he would not be deported, according to the group Black Deported Veterans of America. But on Jan. 22, just two days after Trump’s inauguration, agents detained Parris near his home in Laveen, outside of Phoenix. In May, a judge ruled that he was eligible for deportation.

His wife, Tanisha Hartwell-Parris, told News21 the couple plan to self-deport and bring along some of the seven children, ranging in age from 8 to 26, who are part of their blended family.

“I’m not going to put my husband in a situation to where he’s going to be a constant target, especially in the country that he fought for,” she said, adding that most people have no idea what immigrant service members face.

“People think that just because you’re a veteran … you should automatically have gotten status as a United States citizen,” she said. But the military, she added, “is different for immigrants. …. You’re fighting the same fight, but it’s not the same battle.”

A report published last year by the Veterans Law Practicum at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law noted the connections between PTSD, criminal behavior and the deportation of noncitizen veterans.

More than 20% of veterans with PTSD also have a substance use disorder, the report found, which can result in more exposure to the criminal justice system.

That situation is “the most common scenario in terms of how deportation is triggered,” said Rose Carmen Goldberg, an expert in veterans law who oversaw completion of the report and now teaches in the Veterans Legal Services Clinic at Yale Law School.

The report also noted that even though deportation does not disqualify veterans from health care and other benefits earned through service, “Geographic and bureaucratic barriers may ultimately stand in the way.”

In 2021, the Biden administration launched the Immigrant Military Members and Veterans Initiative (IMMVI) to ensure deported veterans could access Veterans Affairs benefits. The program offered parole on a case-by-case basis to those needing to return to the US for legal counsel or to access care, and it sought to facilitate naturalization services for immigrant service members.

In the program’s first year, 143 veterans living outside of the US reached out to IMMVI staff, according to congressional testimony. A 2022 story by the nonprofit newsroom The War Horse said 102 veterans had been allowed back to the US via the IMMVI parole program, and “over 30” had obtained citizenship.

In response to questions about the status of the IMMVI program, USCIS directed News21 to its website about the program.

Jennie Pasquarella, a lawyer with the Seattle Clemency Project, said the biggest flaw of the IMMVI program is that parole into the US is temporary – a “dead end” if a veteran doesn’t have a legal claim to restore legal residency or to naturalize.

“We had asked the Biden administration to do more to ensure that there was a further path towards restoring people’s lawful status beyond parole,” she said. “Basically, we didn’t succeed.”

A ‘lifeline’ for deported vets

In the absence of aid in the US, more and more veterans are turning to help elsewhere.

After serving in the Vietnam War with the Army, José Francisco Lopez, a native of Torreón, Mexico, experienced PTSD and struggled with addiction. He eventually went to prison for a drug-related crime and in 2003 was deported back to his home country.

For years, Lopez thought he was the only deported veteran in Mexico—until he met Hector Barajas, a deported Army veteran who in 2013 founded the Deported Veterans Support House in Tijuana.

Inspired, Lopez opened his own Deported Veterans Support House in Ciudad Juárez, across the border from El Paso.

Today, Lopez, 80, is a legal resident of the US but splits his time between El Paso and Juárez, providing deported veterans housing, food and advice about how to apply for VA benefits. Since opening the support house in 2017, he’s helped about 20 people.

On a Saturday in June, four veterans stopped by to visit Lopez at the place they call “the bunker.” The gathering felt like a family reunion, with laughter filling the house as they shared memories of holidays spent together and other moments, both good and bad.

Said Ricardo Munoz, who came across Lopez and the bunker in 2019: “It’s kind of like being out in the ocean and someone throws a lifeline at you.”

US Air Force veteran Alfonso, who enlisted in 1976, said he was shocked when he was deported in 2001 after being charged with driving under the influence in El Paso. He said he mistakenly thought he had automatically earned citizenship for serving. Alfonso asked that his last name not be used because he is now trying to naturalize and fears publicity could hurt those efforts.

After living and working in Juarez for decades, Alfonso, with Lopez’s support, obtained parole back to the US in 2024 via the IMMVI program. He got his green card and now lives in El Paso, near his daughter.

For Alfonso, military service was a family affair. His brother served in Vietnam, his niece has done multiple tours in the Middle East, one nephew is in the Coast Guard and another is a Marine.

Citizenship or not, he said, “I was an American already, because I was willing to give my life for it.”

He added, “When you’re willing to give your life for something that, you don’t know, in one second you might be dead—it’s something. It’s important.”

‘It’s a whole new world’

Back in Seoul, Park, 56, is adjusting to life in a country he hadn’t even visited in 30 years. When he first arrived, he said, he cried every morning for hours.

“I just couldn’t stop,” he said. “It’s a whole new world. I speak the language, but I don’t read or write, so I’m trying to really relearn everything.”

For now, he’s staying with his father, but he worries about his family back in the US. His daughter works for the state of California. His son—also a military veteran—lives in Hawaii, where he works in cybersecurity and helps care for Park’s 85-year-old mother.

“I don’t know how many more years she’s got,” Park said. “My daughter, if she ever gets married, I won’t be there for a wedding.”

Park’s attorney started a petition to urge prosecutors to dismiss his criminal convictions, part of an attempt to cancel his deportation order and allow him to return to the United States. More than 10,000 people have signed.

Park said he’s grateful for the support but has little faith that the country he fought for will ever allow him to come back.

“I’m not blaming the military or VA – it’s literally the Trump administration,” he said. “What they’re doing is crazy.

“This is not the country that I volunteered and fought for,” he added. “This is just really wrong.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Immigrant_Troops_01.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-09-12 16:56:37.982446

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful.
Federal, state, and local decisions depend on accurate census data.
Talk us through what kinds of programs and policies use the census count to make decisions.
Terry Gerton That’s really helpful.","Terry Gerton So Ms. Anand, let’s begin with you. As a refresher for the listeners, can you remind us of the legal and constitutional requirements that drive how we conduct our census?

Meeta Anand Yeah, absolutely. So the census is actually mentioned in Article One of the Constitution. It does not use the word census. It calls for an enumeration of all people, which is then used to apportion, or think of the word allocate, the number of seats that each state gets in the House of Representatives. It is further mentioned in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which mandates that every person living in the United States is counted for the purposes of apportionment. Additionally, we have Title 13, which is the portion of the United State’s code which delineates exactly how a census is to be conducted. And as we all know, it happens once every 10 years in the year ending in zero.

Terry Gerton So how did those guardrails shape what’s possible when you think about redesigning the census if you wanted to?

Meeta Anand So, one thing we know is that the 14th Amendment tells us that it’s a count of every person. It doesn’t say every citizen. It doesn’t say every voter. So right there, that’s one guardrail, which is that it uses the term person and not the term citizen or some other term. The other thing we know is that it has to happen every 10 years. And the first one occurred in the year 1790, per the Constitution. So we know that that happens every decade in the year ending in zero. What we also know is that it calls for an actual enumeration of people. So historically that has been interpreted as not a statistical sampling or a administrative records effort, but rather requires this effort of going out and doing a count of each person, which is why you have that familiar trope of census door knockers, where you have people going out and attempting to do that count of each and every person.

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful. So Mr. Fienberg, let me turn to you. President Trump has issued a directive that calls for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants and uses data from the 2024 election. What would that shift mean for the integrity and the independence of federal data collection?

Howard Fienberg So there are some complications there. So from the perspective of the Insights Association, where I also hold my hat in addition to the Census Project, we responded right away very excited about the prospect that the President would be interested in investing more resources into the census, because it’s a massive obligation of federal resources that takes an entire decade to put together in preparation and development. And so we looked at it from that angle. If you take it from a specific angle of holding a mid-decade census — which might be what he was suggesting, we don’t know that for certain — if that is the case, there are restrictions on doing a mid-decade census that present just a simple legal problem in that you can only do it in year five and we’re already running out of time in year five, certainly in the fiscal year, that’s almost over. But also just in the practical year, and putting together and conducting a census, as I said, takes a whole decade. That would be an extremely complicated thing to put together on very short notice, no matter how you’re going to do the count exactly, whether or not it has anything to do with questions of citizenship and immigration status, it doesn’t really matter. It would still be a Herculean task. And on top of that, there is a legal impediment already existing that such a mid-decade census, if you ran it, could only be used for purposes of, say, the divvying up of federal funds, of which trillions of dollars every year are guided by census data. So yeah, that would make sense. You want to get more accurate data for that purpose. That’s cool, but the law says that you can’t use it for purposes of apportionment and redistricting. So based on what presumably he would be looking to do with the data, he would not be able to do that under the course of the law.

Terry Gerton Got it. So, Ms. Anand, let me come back to you. From a practical standpoint, if we did a new census, we probably couldn’t get the mid-year done in 2025, as Mr. Fienberg has just said, but it takes a long time to prepare to do each census. You have the rules, you align everything. If we change the rules in 2025 for the 2030 census and don’t count undocumented immigrants, what does that mean for the actual process, and then what does it actually mean in communities that are already hard to count?

Meeta Anand Thank you for that question. Firstly, any change that historically, any change the Census Bureau makes, it has to do research on the impact of that change on the overall accuracy of the census. The Census Bureau itself says its mandate is to count every person once and only once and in the right place. So you have to see how changes impact that mandate. So if you start doing changes such as looking to exclude people from the count, you would need to add in questions, whether it be a citizenship question or an immigration status question. And that could have the chilling effect. And in fact, we have research that shows that this then has a chilling effect on immigrant communities, regardless of their status, undocumented, long-term permanent resident, children of immigrants. So right there, you start seeing this pressure on response rates that they start to decline with the addition of such questions. To your other point, any change has flow-through effects. So once you add a question, you also have to consider you’re changing the length of the form, you’re changing how the form is designed. And a lot of those things often get researched as well. So there are many steps involved in this. And as you said, and as Howard said, planning takes a long time, the planning for the 2030 census started in 2019. So to the elite person, 2025 may seem like a lot of time, but in 2026, the Census Bureau is extensively conducting field tests. And we also have to prepare for those tests now, which allow for the implementation of new technologies in 2030. So there is a deliberately deliberate process to get everything in place in time.

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with Meeta Anand. She’s Senior Director, Census and Data Equity at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and Howard Fienberg, who’s the co-director of the Census Project and Senior VP for Advocacy at the Insights Association. So Mr. Fienberg, let me come back to you. Assuming that it was possible to change the questions for the 2030 census, what are the risks of discontinuity in the data at this point? If you have not had a question in all along and now you have a new question about citizenship or immigration status, what does that imply or what impact might that have on long-term data trends and compatibility?

Howard Fienberg There will be issues, and such things can be worked out methodologically and on the back end. It certainly changes up depending on the accuracy of what you’re collecting in the census itself. I think Meeta touched on that quite directly, and I think that’s where you would be most concerned in terms of the comparability of the output from the census. We don’t have a specific position one way or another on asking about citizenship or immigration status at the Census Project or at the Insights Association. But there are obviously, like you’ve pointed out, there are some concerns about what you’re going to get in terms of usefulness of data across time. And being able to make those comparisons, yes, very important. And certainly if you’re going to go talk to a statistician, they’re going to be very focused on that issue specifically. I think there were a couple of things I wanted to circle back, if we could, on when we were talking about setting up the new census. It’s not just where we are in the planning stages. And the interesting thing that the President raised in his Truth Social post was the concept that there were ways to improve the census overall with new kinds of data, new kinds of collection, while not knowing what it is exactly that he would have in mind. That is an exciting prospect that the administration would want to be involved in improving the overall count. And yeah, it’s certainly something to be encouraged. And yes, we are already at a stage where we’re rolling out field tests in 2026. This is kind of the last stop where you can do any kind of innovation because once you hit into the 2026 census test, you’re already ramping up really fast from there. So this would be a great time for the administration to engage with the Census Bureau, with the Commerce Department overall, and with stakeholders to talk about what would be involved in improving the census. What kind of things would they like to see and improve? Because now is really the last chance to get in something really meaty.

Terry Gerton And do you see any evidence of that collaboration door swinging open at this point?

Howard Fienberg Not yet, but that might need to wait for at least the nomination of a new director of the Census Bureau, because we have an acting director in Ron Jarmin, but I assume that they would be most comfortable with their own nominee. That hasn’t happened yet, but hopefully that’s something that will happen soon.

Terry Gerton Ms. Anand, I want to come back to you. You mentioned at the very beginning, counting every person, much depends on that census count. Federal, state, and local decisions depend on accurate census data. Talk us through what kinds of programs and policies use the census count to make decisions.

Meeta Anand Sure, absolutely. And I do want to say, while Howard stated the position of his organizations, I do want to say the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights is opposed to the addition of a citizenship or immigration status question, on the basis that it would lead to an undercount of many of our communities that we want to ensure are accurately represented in the data. And that goes to your question directly. Why do we care that people are appropriately represented in data? Well, firstly is representation, as we went through, the number of seats you get in the House, but so many states and localities use the same data to draw district lines within their communities. Then you have the notion of $2.8 trillion of federal funds going to states every year for federally guided programs. So we’re looking at programs like SNAP, we’re looking at Medicaid, we’re looking at Medicare. We’re looking at hospitals. We’re looking at schools. I could go on forever. We’re looking at roads and public transportation decisions. So understanding how many people are in a community and who they are is really important to making these types of decisions about the programs and services they can get. And I would argue there’s a third point, which is less policy and more personal, which is data are the story we tell about our communities and about our country. So in order to truly understand who we are as a country and to tell the story of ourselves, we need to have that accurate and complete representation of who is on the ground.

Terry Gerton That’s really helpful. People, regardless of their immigration status, draw services, I guess is where you wind up. Mr. Feinberg, let’s wrap it up with you. How do you see this proposal playing out? And what should folks be watching for as the conversation unfolds?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Census_Bureau_DOGE_26971-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 13:56:39.033443

Stevens said the jail currently houses 60 ICE detainees and emphasized that the contract is valid under Ohio law.
“We are in full compliance with the Attorney General’s opinion,” Stevens said.
“Partnering with the federal government for Seneca County has been going on for 25 years,” Stevens said at the time.
The Advertiser-Tribune has also submitted a public records request seeking all communications and contracts between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and ICE dating back to 1996.","TIFFIN — A legal and political dispute over immigration detention in Seneca County is intensifying following a recent opinion from Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and a letter from the ACLU Ohio demanding the release of detainees held under sheriff-executed contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The ACLU argues that county sheriffs lack the legal authority to enter immigration detention agreements and that individuals held under such contracts may be unlawfully detained. In a letter sent to multiple counties, including Seneca, Geauga, Butler, Lake and Portage, the organization demanded the immediate release of detainees and a halt to local enforcement actions tied to ICE.

“To the extent that any individual was arrested, is currently being held, or was at one time held without lawful authority, they may have grounds to bring a lawsuit,” the ACLU said in a statement to The Advertiser-Tribune. The organization also criticized the lack of transparency, noting that several sheriff’s offices have refused to release ICE contracts, prompting lawsuits in the Ohio Supreme Court.

The legal debate was sparked by Yost’s formal opinion issued Aug. 26, which concluded that only county commissioners, not sheriffs, have the authority to contract with ICE for detention services. The opinion was requested by Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser after a sheriff there signed a new ICE agreement earlier this year.

Seneca County Sheriff Fred Stevens responded by stating that the county’s ICE contract was originally signed by the Board of Commissioners in 1996 and amended in 2003 to remain in effect indefinitely. Stevens said the jail currently houses 60 ICE detainees and emphasized that the contract is valid under Ohio law.

“We are in full compliance with the Attorney General’s opinion,” Stevens said. “Under no circumstance would any detainees be released into our county. ICE would come and pick them up if we ever ended the contract or if they did.”

Stevens declined to release a copy of the contract, citing federal regulations and the Federal Records Act. He directed inquiries to the federal Freedom of Information Act process, the same route he recommended to the ACLU earlier this year.

In June, The Advertiser-Tribune reported that the sheriff’s office had expanded its federal partnership by joining two additional ICE programs under the 287(g) initiative. These programs, the Task Force model and the Warrant Service Officer model, authorize trained deputies and jail staff to arrest individuals with immigration detainers and serve administrative warrants.

“Partnering with the federal government for Seneca County has been going on for 25 years,” Stevens said at the time. “I see this as just another step of partnering with the federal government to assist with the law.”

The sheriff emphasized that deputies would not actively seek out unauthorized immigrants but would use the training when encountering individuals with detainers during routine calls or traffic stops. He also cited liability protection as a key reason for joining the programs.

The Seneca County Board of Commissioners issued a brief statement via County Administrator Barb Patterson acknowledging Yost’s opinion and said it had asked the sheriff and county prosecutor to review the matter and advise on any necessary changes. The board did not comment on the validity of the current contract or whether it plans to take further action.

The ACLU maintains that without access to the contracts, the public cannot determine whether agreements are valid, who executed them or what they authorize. The organization has filed a public records lawsuit against the sheriff’s office in the Ohio Supreme Court, which is currently in mediation. The most recent action in the case was the court’s referral to its mediation program on Aug. 20. All filing deadlines are currently stayed while both parties attempt to resolve the dispute outside of formal proceedings.

While Yost’s opinion did not direct counties to release detainees, it clarified that only commissioner-approved contracts are valid and that detainees may be held beyond the typical 48-hour limit if such agreements are in place. The ACLU interprets the opinion as reinforcing its position that sheriff-executed contracts are unlawful.

“The collaboration between federal and local law enforcement and exactly what they are doing and if it is lawful is of great public interest,” said Sheila Smith, senior public relations strategist for ACLU Ohio. “The fact that these agencies are going to great lengths to keep these documents hidden should be a matter of great concern to everyone.”

Sheriff Stevens said no changes are expected to transportation or detention procedures, and the jail will continue operating under its current arrangement.

“County jails, particularly ours, should be partnering with the federal government to assist with any housing needs,” Stevens said. “We have a quarter century of partnering with the federal government.”

The Advertiser-Tribune has also submitted a public records request seeking all communications and contracts between the Seneca County Sheriff’s Office and ICE dating back to 1996.

Gavin Newsom’s legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles.

“In Denver, our residents are connected with police who live on the same streets they patrol and with officers who grew up in the same communities they’re sworn to protect. That’s why our crime rates are plummeting,” Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement. “What the Trump Administration is doing in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. isn’t a strategy for fighting crime. It’s a federal police state meant to sow chaos, cause disruption, and strip rights away from local governments and citizens.”

An amicus brief is a legal document that allows a party to provide an outside perspective on an issue under litigation.

In the brief filed on Tuesday, Denver argues that the deployment of military troops for policing purposes “dramatically increases the risk of irreparable injury to constitutional sovereignty promised by the 10th Amendment, the fundamental constitutional rights of residents, and the general welfare of the public.”

The city also asserts to the court that local police departments are better suited to serve residents while protecting their rights under local, state and federal laws.

During an Aug. 27 Reddit “Ask Me Anything” session, Johnston called Trump’s “militarization” of the nation’s cities “unprecedented” and “dangerous.” He promised to take the administration to court “on Day One” should the White House send federal troops to Denver.

“Any first-year law student in America could tell you that deploying the U.S. military on the streets of American cities in times of peace to enforce domestic law is clearly illegal,” the mayor posted. “Denver does not need any help from the National Guard, as we are seeing the largest decrease in violent crime of any top 50 city in the country.”

After the Trump administration deployed thousands of National Guard soldiers and Marines to Los Angeles following protests over immigration raids, Newsom, a Democrat, sued, arguing the president’s actions violated federal law.

On Sept. 2, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer ruled in a 52-page opinion that Trump’s decision to deploy troops in Los Angeles was illegal.

The federal court’s ruling against the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard troops in California does not automatically apply to other states.

Republican strategists contend Democrats are in a bind over how to react to Trump’s directive based on high crime rates in Democrat-led cities. FBI data show that 19 of the 20 cities with the highest murder rates and at least 100,000 residents in 2024 had Democratic mayors.

The National Police Association earlier said it welcomes more “boots on the ground,” referring to Trump’s executive order creating a series of specialized military units within the National Guard that, under the direction of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, would be “specifically trained and equipped to deal with public disorder issues.”

The Trump executive order is a positive step toward rectifying a decrease in “boots-on-the-ground law enforcement” over the past decade, National Police Association spokesperson Betsy Brantner Smith told technology publication Smart Cities Dive.

“The order declares that safe communities depend on a tough and well-equipped police force,” she told the publication. “That’s something that the president has said with some frequency — let cops be cops.”

Denver recently filed a motion to dismiss the Trump administration’s lawsuit against the city and state, claiming it was an unlawful attempt to overturn local policy on immigration. The city has also filed four lawsuits against the administration.

This summer, the city was granted a preliminary injunction preventing Trump’s threats to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in allocated transportation funding.

The city also joined Chicago and Pima County, Arizona, in seeking to recover $24 million in FEMA dollars allocated for the purposes of sheltering and assisting migrants.

That case is still pending.

The city has also received a favorable ruling in two other cases where the administration has threatened to withhold federal dollars – one over so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” and the other over funding to prevent large-scale security threats.",https://www.coloradopolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/johnston-profile.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 17:58:01.856986

More than 300 South Korean workers at an electric vehicle battery factory in Georgia are headed home to South Korea today, a week after being swept up in a massive raid by federal agents. They were among nearly 500 workers detained and accused of working illegally. NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Seoul that the incident shocked South Koreans and could have damaged one of the U.S.' most important economic relationships.

(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD)

ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, released a video of their raid last week on the battery factory in Bryan County, Georgia, run by South Korean firms Hyundai and LG.

(SOUNDBITE OF HELICOPTERS FLYING OVERHEAD)

KUHN: The most jarring images were of Korean workers being handcuffed and chained at the waist and ankles. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told a press conference that if such problems can't be resolved, it could impact South Korean investment in the U.S.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT LEE JAE MYUNG: (Speaking Korean).

KUHN: ""Korean companies will inevitably have to consider,"" he said, ""whether it's worth establishing local factories in the U.S. if it means facing all sorts of disadvantages or difficulties in future."" South Korea has recently emerged as one of the biggest foreign investors in the U.S. Ahead of a summit with President Trump last month, President Lee pledged to invest $350 billion in exchange for lower tariffs on South Korean exports. At that summit, Trump praised South Korea's role in helping to rebuild American manufacturing, but he later defended the raid on the Hyundai plant.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They were illegal aliens, and ICE was just doing its job.

KUHN: President Lee says the U.S. wanted to transport the workers to the Atlanta airport in handcuffs, but South Korean officials flatly refused, and the U.S. side eventually backed down. In South Korea's parliament this week, lawmaker Yoon Hu-duk deplored the raid on the factory.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

YOON HU-DUK: (Through interpreter) In negotiations, the U.S. has encouraged us to invest, and then they stabbed us in the back, to be frank.

KUHN: Hur Jung is an economist at Sogang University in Seoul. He says the Hyundai factory in Georgia was still testing its production lines.

HUR JUNG: (Through interpreter) To make this stage progress efficiently, Korean workers and technicians familiar with the system do test runs and get the line rolling. The factory will eventually hire and transition to a local workforce.

KUHN: Hur explains that the U.S. does not have visa quotas for skilled South Korean workers, so the Hyundai technicians came to the U.S. on short-term visas and got caught in ICE's crackdown. Jang Sang-sik is head of the International Trade Research Institute at the Korea International Trade Association, a private trade lobby group. He sees the raid as a quirk.

JANG SANG-SIK: (Through interpreter) We see this as an unusual clash between U.S. state and federal governments, which are hungry for foreign investment, and the immigration agencies and American public, who view illegal employment or immigration very negatively.

KUHN: Jang adds that South Korea is tamping down its anger at the raid because it needs a lot from the U.S., not just lower tariffs but also help countering threats from North Korea and China. He adds that if the issues raised by the factory raid are properly resolved, it could even boost South Korean investments in the U.S.

The agency now projects 290,000 immigrants will be removed from the country between 2026 and 2029. Economists warned less immigration and negative net migration could create woes for the U.S. labor force and inflation.

President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is resulting in the U.S. population growth shrinking faster than anticipated, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)—a phenomenon economists have warned will lead to a labor shortage, drive up inflation, and, under some circumstances, shrink U.S. GDP growth.

The nonpartisan budgetary agency published a revised demographic outlook on Wednesday, projecting death will exceed births in the U.S. beginning in 2031, two years earlier than it previously projected, as a result of a diminished immigrant population as well as lower fertility rates.

The CBO attributed the revisions in large part to Trump’s 2025 reconciliation act, or “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which provides a total of $170 billion for immigration and border enforcement, including a lump sum of $29.9 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations and the hiring of 10,000 ICE officers.

About 290,000 immigrants will be removed from the country between 2026 and 2029 as a result of the law, the CBO said, and about 50,000 immigrants will be detained per day in the same period. An increase in ICE personnel will lead to 5,500 more arrests in 2026 and 100,000 more in 2029 than if the policy had not been enacted. Another 30,000 are projected to leave voluntarily between 2026 and 2030.

This crackdown will have a direct effect on labor, according to the agency.

“CBO estimates that the additional detentions resulting from the law will have two effects,” the report said. “First, people who are detained will not be available to work and will therefore not be in the labor force. Second, detention increases the likelihood that immigrants who receive an order of removal will be successfully removed.”

The White House did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The economics impact of an immigration crackdown

Trump’s anti-immigration efforts have led economists to sound the alarms about the policy’s impact on the U.S. workforce and subsequent economic health.

While the CBO still expects a positive net migration for 2025, economists have also warned that a negative net migration—which Trump has actively worked for as a result of his policies—could hinder U.S. GDP growth.

A working paper published in July from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative economics policy center, found negative net migration could lead to a loss in consumer spending and a diminishing labor force that could shrink U.S. GDP growth by 0.3% and 0.4%, or roughly between $70.5 billion to $94 billion in annual lost economic output.

“Our workforce is disproportionately made up of immigrants relative to their share of the population, and because of that we…really can’t sustain a high level of job growth with the U.S.-born population alone, because there just aren’t enough bodies, essentially, to do that,” report co-author Tara Watson, a Brookings Institute economist and professor of economics at Williams College, previously told Fortune.

Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said last month the labor force shrinkage, as a result of a narrowing immigration population, could even have inflationary effects, predicting inflation could rise from 2.5% to around 4% early next year if deportations continue at their current rate.

The U.S. Department of Labor reported last month that the producer price index (PPI), which measures wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% from June to July, up 3.3% compared to the period a year ago. The core consumer price index increased 0.2% from June to July. Inflation continued to rise in August as new job numbers slumped.

“Foreign-born labor force is declining, and the overall labor force has gone flat since the beginning of the year,” Zandi told Fortune last month. “That’s causing tightening in a lot of markets, adding to costs and inflation.”

“You can see it in meat prices, agriculture, food processing, haircuts, dry cleaning,” he added. “The fingerprints of the restrictive immigration policy are all over the CPI and PPI numbers we got this week.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eOjihlhJ3TBzpoRnIWZgng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fortune_175/a58f144cf071a8c0302282871fcb324b,N,,2025-09-12 13:56:42.559756

Texas Department of Public Safety officers have helped arrest more than 3,000 undocumented immigrants across the state this year, according to public records obtained by The Texas Tribune that provide the most detailed glimpse yet of how state police are shifting their focus from the border toward aiding the Trump administration’s mass deportation crusade — an effort that state officials have kept largely under wraps.

From late January through early September, DPS recorded 3,131 previously unreported arrests connected to specialty teams created at the direction of Gov. Greg Abbott to help President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the agency’s records show. Roughly 88% of the people arrested were picked up on suspicion of violating federal immigration laws like improper entry into the country, marking what may be an unprecedented use of state resources for a role once performed exclusively by federal authorities.

“Operation Lone Star 2.0 is underway statewide — with DPS personnel working to combat and interdict criminal activity with a nexus to the border,” DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said in an email, referring to Texas’ border initiative under the Biden administration for which thousands of troopers were dispatched to the border.

Amid a sharp fall in illegal border crossings, DPS has moved some of its troopers and investigators onto “strike teams” that work with federal agencies across Texas — including in each of the largest metro areas — to arrest people “who have entered the United States illegally and then gone on to commit crimes in the state,” according to the agency.

The federal government has sole authority to enforce immigration violations under federal law. State and local police can’t arrest someone simply for being undocumented without agreements that extend them limited power to do so. As of late July, DPS had no such agreements in place with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency under DHS’ umbrella that oversees much of the nation’s immigration policing, according to DPS records and an ICE database of active partnerships.

Nolen said DPS officers have jurisdiction across Texas to “protect and serve every corner” of the state, though she noted that officers “must have probable cause” to apprehend someone.

The agency has otherwise remained tight-lipped about its deportation efforts, having yet to offer details about how the strike teams function, how they decide who to target or where the people who have been arrested are located now.

Nolen declined to directly respond to a list of questions about the operations, citing the agency’s policy of not disclosing “operational specifics.”

Department officials do not know the whereabouts of those arrested by DPS’ strike teams because they do not keep track of them once they leave the agency’s custody, Nolen said, also deferring to federal authorities for details about their criminal histories.

The Trump administration has said it would prioritize deporting violent criminals, and DPS’ leader has said state authorities working with the feds share the focus. As of mid-August, DPS had identified nearly 6,500 “criminal illegal immigrants with active felony warrants in Texas for a variety of offenses,” Nolen said, including murder, drug and sex crimes, and human smuggling. Officers from all DPS divisions arrested roughly 30,000 people from the start of the year through July.

“Right now, we're going after the migrants that pose the largest threat to the communities,” DPS Director Freeman Martin told the Public Safety Commission, which he answers to, in February. “And there's a lot of them.”

Reports for seven of the arrests, also obtained through a public information request, suggest DPS officers are using a broad range of tactics to apprehend people and, at least for this limited sample size, targeting those with a mix of serious and nonexistent criminal history.

Among them was a Honduran man in Austin who was riding in the passenger seat of a car stopped for an expired registration after DPS apparently staked out his home. An ICE agent with DPS at the scene detained the man upon confirming he had overstayed a visa. Court records show he had been accused of domestic violence in 2022, but the case was later dropped.

In another case, a man was arrested at a Dallas home, where officers arrived after tracking GPS data, according to an arrest report that provided no further details about the tracking. The man had no previous criminal cases listed in federal or local databases.

Two others were arrested in a targeted probe with the feds that led authorities to $16,000 worth of marijuana, cocaine and meth. Both had faced drug charges in the past, Harris County court records show.

Many of the immigration arrests occurred hundreds of miles from the border. Nearly 700 — at least one in five — took place in either Austin, Dallas or Houston, where left-leaning local officials have historically resisted cooperating with federal immigration authorities. Those figures are almost certainly an undercount because the DPS records did not say where more than 1,000 of the arrests took place.

The focus on crackdowns far away from the border “raises red flags,” said Osvaldo Grimaldo, a policy and advocacy strategist with the ACLU of Texas, which has accused DPS of using racial profiling and focusing on migrants accused of low-level offenses in its recent border policing.

“As DPS is expanding these efforts into parts of the interior of the state, what are the intentions?” Grimaldo asked. “Are they being lawful? Are they collaborating with other agencies at the municipal level?”

Operation Lone Star without the fanfare

The regional tactical strike teams mark the latest plunge into immigration enforcement for Texas’ main public safety agency, whose troopers have long been known for dishing out speeding tickets and warnings for busted tail lights. The sprawling agency also issues driver’s licenses, among other regulatory duties, and often takes the lead on major criminal probes, including the bungled response to the deadly Uvalde school shooting in 2022.

DPS had already ramped up its presence at the Texas-Mexico border over the last decade. Abbott escalated things to new levels four years ago, when he ordered thousands of troopers to be dispatched to the state’s 1,254-mile southern border as part of his Operation Lone Star program to deter border crossings.

At the time, DPS was not making federal immigration arrests. Instead, officers arrested thousands of asylum-seeking immigrants for trespassing on private property, a state offense, as the number of illegal border crossings hit record highs.

Those novel misdemeanor arrests carried a maximum penalty of one year in jail, and became a source of controversy as Texas escalated its immigration enforcement unlike any state had ever done, drawing questions about whether migrants were being denied due process and other constitutional rights.

The number of illegal crossings began tanking last summer and has continued to plunge under the Trump administration. Still, the Legislature earmarked another $3.4 billion for border security earlier this year, giving about one-third of it to DPS with an eye toward immigration enforcement in the state’s interior.

Eight days after Trump took office for his second term, Abbott directed DPS to deploy strike teams that could help the Trump administration “locate and arrest criminal illegal immigrants in the state.”

“After four years of failed policies, Texas finally has a partner in President Trump,” Abbott said. “Together, we will end this crisis and make America safe once again.”

Since then, DPS has issued statements acknowledging individual arrests conducted by the teams but said nothing about their overall productivity — a stark contrast to the highly publicized accomplishments touted under Operation Lone Star.

The governor and agency frequently shared updates on arrests and drug seizures stemming from the border program. They posted photos and videos of migrants being arrested, held press conferences in cities along the border to unveil new initiatives, and along the way drew the Biden administration into a constitutional fight over how much authority a state has to enforce immigration laws.

In comparison, little information is being released or celebrated about the strike teams.

That includes one team’s major raid of a party in Hays County earlier this year, initially detailed by DPS as a bust of alleged gang members and their associates carried out with various federal agencies. Authorities arrested almost four dozen people during the raid, children among them.

But party guests have denied having gang affiliations and said they had rented a big house with a swimming pool to celebrate a pair of birthdays — including that of a kid who instead turned 5 in ICE detention, the Tribune previously reported.

All 35 detainees identified by the Tribune were arrested on suspicion of illegally entering the country. None had previous criminal cases listed in federal or local databases.

An uncertain scope

Such state apprehensions are only part of the deportation efforts underway across multiple layers of government. The tally of immigrants arrested by DPS’ strike teams doesn’t account for those picked up after being stopped by local law enforcement or instances where federal immigration authorities are working on their own.

There are also signs that the scope and scale of DPS' deportation operations extend beyond the more than 3,100 strike team arrests. The DPS spokesperson noted that the agency aided a massive ICE operation last month that led the feds to arrest more than 800 suspected undocumented immigrants; it was not clear if such efforts are counted toward DPS' strike team arrest tally. Additionally, records obtained by the Tribune show that at least one of the detainees was deported along with family members who were not counted among the apprehensions.

That arrest began when a state trooper followed Omar Gallardo Rodriguez’s white truck for about two minutes before pulling him over next to Dobie Middle School in North Austin over a traffic infraction. His wife, Denisse Parra Vargas, was in the passenger seat, according to video recorded by the DPS trooper’s dash camera. The footage showed that, within an hour of being pulled over, Rodriguez was whisked away by a masked officer accompanying five DPS troopers to the scene.

Within a week, federal agents also deported Parra Vargas — who had entered the country illegally seeking protection from a previous abusive partner, advocates say — and their kids, two of whom were born in the United States.

DHS officials have labeled Rodriguez a “serial lawbreaker” in past statements for previous accusations of assaulting a family member, driving under the influence and entering the country illegally four times.

The family’s lawyers declined to comment and Rodriguez did not respond to an email.

Arrests like Rodriguez’s could become more frequent as DPS and its federal partners gain reinforcements next year under a new Texas law that will require most sheriffs in the state to enter agreements with ICE. Roughly 11% of all Texas sheriffs have already inked agreements with the federal agency — according to ICE records from early September — for a controversial program that extends deputies the authority to ask people about their legal status during their routine patrols.

Approximately 2.1 million undocumented immigrants call Texas home, second in the nation only to California. The Trump administration has not regularly published data about its deportation efforts, but recent independent research suggests that for the first time in decades, more immigrants have left the U.S. than arrived so far this year.

Outside of Houston, members with FIEL — an acronym that translates to Immigrant Families and Students in the Fight — have recorded accounts of DPS troopers waiting to stop people for traffic violations off Highway 59 near a massive subdivision north of the city that has been a lightning rod among Republican officials because its developer sells land to undocumented people.

“It’s happening every day,” said Alain Cisneros, a FIEL organizer who knocked doors in the neighborhoods to conduct a survey that found many of the residents are living in great fear.

He said it appeared like a replica of Operation Lone Star — but 400 miles from the Mexican border.

Faith leaders said that for those who believe in human dignity, Soliman's case has become a test not just of one man's fate, but of the values his supporters say America — and people of faith — are called to defend.

""I think our whole sense of human dignity and the individual rights, human rights, enter into this,"" said Franciscan Fr. Al Hirt, pastor of St. Francis Seraph Catholic Church in Cincinnati. ""It seems wrong. The bishops have been pretty good about support for immigration reform and doing it justly but it would sure be nice to see a little bit more Catholic voice supporting a person like this.""

Hirt signed an interfaith clergy letter backing Soliman. The Franciscan priest said it is important for Catholics to speak up in the face of all injustice, but particularly cases like Soliman's.

""I just could not find any reason why this imam lost his asylum status,"" said Hirt, who has worked in parishes in Cincinnati for 35 years. ""It just doesn't make sense. It's just another good person being rounded up, detained, not a criminal. He's not done anything wrong.""

Soliman, 51, came to the United States in 2014, fleeing Egypt after he was jailed and beaten for his journalism during the Arab Spring, pro-democracy and anti-government protests that started in 2011.

Soliman won asylum in the U.S. in 2018 under the first Trump administration. In the final month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke it. Officials cited Soliman's past work with an Egyptian charity with ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, though neither Egypt nor the U.S. lists the group as a terrorist organization. Court records show after Trump returned to office officials formalized the terrorism charges and his asylum was revoked on June 3.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained Soliman at a routine check-in in July. He is challenging the change in his asylum status in court and has won a legal battle to remain in the Butler County Jail near Cincinnati, Ohio, while his case progresses.

Soliman's most recent hearing took place Sept. 3 in Cleveland Immigration Court. An immigration court hearing Sept. 25 will address the merits of his asylum claim.

Doll cited her faith in calling for help for Soliman.

""Our Catholic faith that unites us, Governor DeWine, stands firmly that every human person has the right to life, has a right to dignity,"" Doll said. ""That is not what Ayman is getting. He is being dismally treated and it's wrong. It's morally wrong, and you know it. So please, in the name of God, stand up for this human life.""

Rev. Joel Miller of the Columbus Mennonite Church invoked Scripture stories that call for fair treatment of immigrants, and Jesus' admonition to love our neighbor as ourselves.

""Our faith absolutely compels us to remember who we are and to act accordingly,"" Miller said. ""That's why we're here today in support of Imam Soliman. He is both the good Samaritan and the foreigner, who as a chaplain has tended to the needs of the hurt and even the dying, the very model of a neighbor.""

Bilal Ahmed, an attorney with the Center for American Islamic Relations in Ohio who has worked on Soliman's case, noted that earning asylum status is no easy feat.

""Getting asylum is a yearslong process. There's a number of different hoops you have to go through,” Ahmed said. “You're vetted at every single level. He had passed the asylum threshold and was on the verge of getting his green card, but it was stalled for a number of years … It is concerning to say the least.""

Ahmed said the support Soliman has received from the local community has been heartening.

""I went down to Cincinnati on the day that he was unfortunately detained and just everyone was coming out of nowhere,"" Ahmed said. ""All these people were showing up in support … Since then, there's been a whole coalition in Ohio trying to get him released.

""I was shocked that all these people knew Imam Ayman,"" Ahmed added. ""That's a testament to his interfaith work in the community. He's just going out and helping people regardless of their religious backgrounds.""

Among the many speaking out for Soliman was Rev. Adam Allen, a former Cincinnati Children's Hospital chaplain who said he lost his job after participating in a July 17 prayer vigil for Soliman. He worked side by side with Soliman, visiting children and families experiencing difficult times.

""I proudly worked to be the best chaplain that I can be, but Ayman is on a whole other level that I can only aspire to be,"" Allen said.

During his first week at the hospital, Allen shadowed Soliman.

""He moved fast,"" Allen said. ""He was hard to keep up with. We'd meet with one family, he'd calmly assess their spiritual needs, learn what they were going through, pray with them, and bring them hope. He would move so fast.""

Allen noted Soliman has a pacifying impact on patients. ""Once he had entered the room, all this calm and peace would come with him,"" Allen said. ""Then we'd move on immediately to the next patient. It felt like we were running.""

Soliman speaks Arabic, Spanish and English.

""When an Arabic-speaking family was approaching a difficult prognosis, he would leave the team a note saying, call me anytime, no matter what hour, and I will come in to support this family and he meant it,"" Allen said. ""I would have to tell new people. He really means it. That's what he wants. He'll be upset if you don't call him.""

Outside the hospital Soliman led a biweekly halaqah, or study circle, for Muslim students at the University of Cincinnati, taught the Quran to young Muslims and worked to make sure other volunteers at his mosque were recognized for their contributions.

Soliman also served on Cincinnati Children's ethics committee. Soliman holds master's degrees in Islamic studies and Muslim chaplaincy and is a doctoral candidate in the same field. His focus is on interfaith, islamophobia and bioethics. Soliman has served as an imam for over two decades and is a member of the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America.

Tala Ali, a close friend who attended the same mosque and worked with Soliman in the Association of Muslim Chaplains, said she speaks to Soliman in jail every day. She said he has good and bad days but is encouraged by those telling his story.

""He said, 'I just want you to talk about me; to remember me.' Knowing he's not forgotten is what's keeping him alive and hanging on. He's got so many letters from people who have sent him Quran verses, Bible verses, sharing stories, sharing their prayers. … That has meant the world to him.""

Ali was there when Soliman was taken into custody and has been at the forefront of supporters telling his story ever since.

""I shouldn't have to sell a person for them to have their basic human dignities and rights recognized,"" she said. ""He fights so hard and cares so hard for everyone else's kids, and he has been through what he's gone through and he's so soft.”

As Soliman awaits his next hearing, his friends and supporters say they will continue to speak out, pray and rally for his release.

""He just gives and gives and gives,"" Ali said. ""He holds himself up to a standard that is so high without demanding those standards of others.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/9.12.25%20Ayman%20DeWine%20Press%20Conference.jpg?h=520a578a&itok=CNXYqsPH,N,,2025-09-12 12:56:43.278851

Menjivar, a Washington auxiliary bishop who himself is an immigrant, said immigrants' imploding dreams are because of instability caused by President Donald Trump's pervasive threat of deportation.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.

Speaking to journalists at Georgetown University on Sept. 11, Menjivar said most immigrants to the United States left their home countries because of political or economic instability — just as he did. Menjivar came to the United States as a young adult to escape civil war in El Salvador.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown's Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump's aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services — a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.

The Washington bishop said he sees fear in the eyes of fellow immigrants and that it plays out in ways such as children not being sent to school, or not allowed to participate in after-school activities. They are opting out of school and activities because their parents ""don't want to risk"" their possible exposure to immigration enforcement, Menjivar said.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski has spent time ministering at Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily assembled detention center in Florida that housed immigrants in conditions decried as unsafe and unsanitary as well as for environmental concerns.

In August, a federal District Court judge ordered the administration to wind down operations there by the end of October. On Sept. 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold, pending the administration's appeal.

Wenski said the Trump administration's approach is ""to paint all immigrants as lawbreakers. But the reality is the law is breaking them. The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.""

Many have started businesses and become established. Now they are being told to go ""home,"" Wenski said.

Wenski and Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, who chairs the Committee on Migration of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also spoke to reporters about the challenge of trying to explain Catholic teaching about immigration and human rights in ways that are heard by the people in the pews.

Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said it is ""important to know the prevalence of misinformation about Catholic teachings. There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests.""

Seitz said one way to persuade the Trump administration on inconsistencies on immigration might be through the topic of religious liberty.

""It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,"" the El Paso bishop said. ""We're happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.""

Ashley Feasley, who is in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, pointed to what has been known as the ""sensitive locations"" policy started during the Obama administration and kept during the first Trump administration.

""It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,"" she said. ""Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.""

Feasley said many bishops have spoken nationally about their concern about the ability for immigrants and refugees to receive the sacraments, to come to church.

Feasley noted that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have pursued migrants into church grounds. Bishops have reported that immigrants are afraid to go to church.

""This is an area where, if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about what is this policy, what can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and people's ability to go about their daily lives and attend to the sacraments,” Feasley said.

""Particularly in this time,"" she said, ""our ability to be with our church and our faith is just so crucial. I think there are decision-makers who would understand this.""",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/IMG_0378.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=a4m3TcDh,N,,2025-09-12 14:56:48.984234

Last week, protestors successfully turned an ICE vehicle away as it attempted to enter the facility. The facility became a focus of the efforts of immigration rights advocates ever since the town's mayor confirmed that the location was slated to be the main processing center for expanded ice operations in the Chicago area.

The facility is supposed to operate pretty much 24-hours a day for the next month and a half because of the start of operation Midway Blitz, which federal officials say targets undocumented people with criminal records.

Local immigration rights leaders say although they've not seen a mass surge in arrests by immigration agents, supporters do say there's been an increase in calls for legal help because of the immigration crackdown.

""Hotline call volume has been higher than at any point since January,"" Lawrence Benito, of Illinois Coalition of Immigrant & Refugee Rights. ""This indicates that ICE agents are present throughout the Chicagoland area and we need to remain vigilant with or without the National Guard present.""

The protest is scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. and last until 7 p.m..

Faith leaders, Broadview community members and concerned residents are expected to be out protesting. They said they refuse to be intimidated by what they say is the trump administration's efforts to target and mistreat immigrant communities.

Federal agents arrived on the scene, and Lopez said Funes was taken away.
Family members spoke to Funes Thursday morning, Lopez said, adding, “he gets mistreated verbally.
Meanwhile, Lopez said Funes’ daughter hasn’t been able to sleep.
“He is the main provider for his family, and I think he was just ripped apart from his family, and in a very unfair way,” Lopez said.","The goal was to have his daughter, who’s autistic and non-verbal, get rid of a bit more energy.

On Monday, they left the park and were on their way home when D.C. police pulled Funes over in Northwest D.C.

His sister, Estrella Lopez, said the stop was for an alleged failure to fully stop at a stop sign.

Neighbors, Lopez said, told another family member who got to the scene that they “witnessed my brother calmly asking questions as the officers were pulling him out of the car. My brother was trying to explain to them that my niece is autistic, and if he got out of the car, she was going to be crying in the car, and it was going to put her in a bad place.”

The stop came days before President Donald Trump’s crime emergency in D.C. was scheduled to end. Federal agents arrived on the scene, and Lopez said Funes was taken away.

He’s originally from Honduras, but has lived in D.C. for over 10 years and has applied for asylum. A judge recently gave him a year to find a lawyer and return to court.

“It’s been horrible,” Lopez said. “The only brother I have from mom and dad was taken like a criminal.”

According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement records, Funes is in ICE custody and is currently at the Caroline Detention Facility in Caroline County, Virginia. Family members spoke to Funes Thursday morning, Lopez said, adding, “he gets mistreated verbally. It’s very cold. He says it almost feels like a freezer.”

Relatives are concerned, Lopez said, because Funes has asthma and needs medication “because he gets very anxious. And when he gets anxious, he triggers his asthma attacks.”

Now, they’re contacting various community groups and raising money to hire a lawyer, “so that we can potentially just get him out of there, where he is right now,” Lopez said.

Meanwhile, Lopez said Funes’ daughter hasn’t been able to sleep. She cries a lot, because she’s used to her dad telling her stories around bedtime, Lopez said.

“He is the main provider for his family, and I think he was just ripped apart from his family, and in a very unfair way,” Lopez said.

“He was trying to speak to the officers, telling them that he wanted to stay silent when they asked him for his status. He didn’t want to answer that question, because he felt discriminated. They didn’t stop him to ask him that, he thought they stopped him for something else.”

And no senior aide to Mr. Trump has as long a history working on Latin America policy.
Over 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio pressed three administrations to go on the offense across the region.
But on Latin America, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have long been in sync.
Later that day, Mr. Rubio hailed Mr. Bukele for transforming El Salvador from a country “known for violence” into “one of the most secure in the hemisphere.” The key, Mr. Rubio said, was Mr. Bukele’s leadership, and “the difficult decisions that had to be made.”","For decades across Latin America and the Caribbean, U.S. drug enforcement officials have tried to cut off narcotics trafficking by intercepting boats, trucks and even horses laden with drugs and arresting the smugglers.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said those efforts are not bold enough. He has helped steer the Trump administration toward a much more aggressive — and deadly — tactic: use military force to destroy suspected drug boats and kill the people on board, without a legal process.

“Interdiction doesn’t work,” Mr. Rubio said at a news conference in Mexico City last week when asked about the U.S. attack on a boat in the Caribbean. President Trump had boasted that the strike had killed at least 11 people.

“What will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,” Mr. Rubio added. “And it’ll happen again. Maybe it’s happening right now, I don’t know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.”

Mr. Rubio has cast himself as a top general in that war.

No senior Trump official has spoken more forcefully about the new campaign of violence against Latin American criminal groups and their allies. And no senior aide to Mr. Trump has as long a history working on Latin America policy.

Over 14 years as a Republican senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio pressed three administrations to go on the offense across the region. The son of anti-Communist immigrants from pre-revolutionary Cuba, he was motivated by his loathing for the Castro government and its allies, notably Venezuela — a stance well rewarded by Florida’s sizable population of expatriates from those countries.

Now, as both secretary of state and White House national security adviser, he is seizing his chance to turn words into action.

Mr. Rubio has long sought the ouster of leftist strongmen in the region, particularly leaders of Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua, whose governments he has called “illegitimate.” He has also helped engineer the administration’s mass deportations of immigrants, including to a notorious prison in El Salvador.

And the push for military action and the ouster of national leaders could draw criticism from a vocal wing of Mr. Trump’s movement that advocates greater military restraint in foreign policy. Those conservatives criticize “forever wars” and “regime change,” and some already view Mr. Rubio with suspicion, pointing to a history of “neocon” positions.

However, there are those Trump supporters and aides who applaud Mr. Rubio’s approach. They see him as reasserting an updated version of the Monroe Doctrine, an early-19th-century concept that justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Mr. Rubio hopes to “define a real new paradigm in the Western Hemisphere,” said Juan Gonzalez, who served as the top National Security Council official for the region in the Biden White House.

Mr. Gonzalez said Mr. Rubio’s scathing rhetoric — he has branded Nicaragua’s government “an enemy of humanity” — was meant to establish a “predicate” for further military action in the hemisphere.

His top target for now appears to be Venezuela, whose criminal groups the Trump administration has linked to the country’s autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro.

Last month, Mr. Rubio ordered the State Department to increase a reward to $50 million for any information leading to Mr. Maduro’s arrest and conviction on U.S. drug charges.

During the first Trump administration, Mr. Rubio played a leading role in pushing the president to try to oust Mr. Maduro from power. Now, a recent U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean has prompted speculation over whether the administration will try to invade Venezuela and seize Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Rubio said last week that Mr. Maduro was a fugitive from American justice, after having been indicted by a grand jury in a New York federal court on drug trafficking charges in 2020.

“Nicolás Maduro is not a government or political regime,” he told reporters in Quito, Ecuador. “They are a terrorist organization and organized crime organization that have taken over a country so that they can become the leaders, so that they can become billionaires. And that is why they were indicted by the courts in the U.S.”

Mr. Maduro, who has pointed to Mr. Rubio as his main nemesis in Washington, issued his own warning on Sept. 1, before Mr. Trump announced the strike on the boat.

“Mr. President, Donald Trump, watch out, because Mr. Rubio wants to stain your hands with blood,” he said.

‘Blow Them Up’

Mr. Rubio’s Senate record stands at odds with Mr. Trump’s approach to some key issues. So since joining the administration, Mr. Rubio has softened some of his hawkish views, at least in public, on issues such as Russia and the promotion of democracy.

But on Latin America, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio have long been in sync.

“Rubio and Trump dovetail particularly well on Latin America,” said Mike Watson, the deputy director of the conservative Hudson Institute’s Center for Strategy and American Statecraft.

The two men share a drive to tackle what Mr. Watson called the region’s “chaos and disorder” in the form of narcotics and migrants.

“Under Secretary Rubio, the State Department is working to implement President Trump’s vision to make our region secure, stable and prosperous,” Tommy Pigott, the department’s deputy spokesperson, said when asked for comment for this article. “That means eliminating the cartels, ending illegal mass migration and pushing out China’s exploitative practices.”

When it comes to narcotics, Mr. Trump and Mr. Rubio cast the flow of fentanyl, cocaine and other drugs into the United States as a matter of national security that justifies the use of deadly force.

During his visit to Ecuador, Mr. Rubio said the Trump administration was ready to help partner governments “blow up” criminal groups.

“There’s long been a bipartisan consensus around treating cartels as a law enforcement matter rather than a military matter,” Mr. Watson said. “Trump and Rubio are no longer treating this issue that way. They are happy to use the military.”

And while past U.S. presidents have discussed migration from Central and Latin America mostly in social and economic terms, Mr. Rubio has embraced the notion that the flow of people also “poses a national security threat.”

Citing his own parents, Mr. Rubio once argued for more compassionate federal immigration policies before shifting right on the issue perhaps most dear to the Republican Party’s base: immigration.

Mr. Rubio and his aides argue that migrant trafficking will ebb if crime groups and their allies in governments are dismantled, and that clamping down on migration will choke off a key income source for the gangs.

In keeping with Mr. Trump’s imperial approach to the Western Hemisphere, Mr. Rubio wants to roll back Latin America’s growing economic ties with China. For years, he spoke of Beijing’s global influence as a security threat, though he has tempered that language recently as Mr. Trump seeks a summit with China’s leader.

After becoming secretary of state, Mr. Rubio began his first official trip with a visit to Panama, where he toured the Panama Canal and pressed Panamanian leaders over the operation of two ports on the waterway by a Hong Kong company. Following Mr. Trump’s threats to seize control of the canal, the company agreed in March to sell the ports to a U.S.-led investment group, although the Chinese government has objected.

Mr. Rubio also raised the issue of China’s presence during his second trip to the region, visiting Jamaica, Guyana and Suriname in March.

And Mr. Rubio is on a mission to bolster the standing of right-wing figures in the region. He has taken up a pet cause of Mr. Trump: the defense of Jair Bolsonaro, the conservative former president of Brazil who was officially charged with plotting a coup. Mr. Rubio announced on social media on Thursday that the United States would respond to the decision earlier that day by Brazil’s Supreme Court to convict Mr. Bolsonaro and sentence him to 27 years in prison.

Mr. Rubio has tried to quell concerns among some leaders who worry the United States is once again flexing its imperial muscle. In Mexico, where Mr. Rubio has designated several cartels as terrorist groups, President Claudia Sheinbaum has warned Washington for months against any attempt at unilateral U.S. military action on Mexican soil.

During his visit to Mexico City last week, Mr. Rubio stressed that the two governments had “reached a level of historic cooperation” in recent months — one he said “respects the integrity and the sovereignty of both countries.”

Drugs and Deportations

As a senator, Mr. Rubio was a passionate champion of human rights and the rule of law abroad.

In a speech a decade ago, he called for a U.S. foreign policy built on military and economic strength, along with “clarity regarding America’s core values,” which he said included “a passionate defense of human rights” and “the strong support of democratic principles.”

But in going on the offensive in Latin America, Mr. Rubio has muted those views.

In addition to the boat attack, Mr. Rubio has played a major role in other aggressive policies that encompass actions without due process, including the deportation of hundreds of people he and the president say are members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based gang that they have designated a foreign terrorist organization. A vast majority did not have criminal records or clear, documented links to the gang, and courts have blocked further summary removals for now.

Under a deal Mr. Rubio reached with President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador in February, many of those deported have been sent to a prison that human rights groups call dangerous and “inhumane.”

Mr. Rubio has flatly dismissed the criticism as “anti-Bukele propaganda.”

A U.S. government document released in court this week said the Trump administration agreed to pay $4.76 million to El Salvador to temporarily accept up to 300 “members” of Tren de Aragua.

Rights groups have also harshly condemned Mr. Bukele’s government more broadly for what they call mass detentions, torture and a crackdown on democratic institutions.

His approach, though, has drastically reduced once-rampant crime and gang activity in the country.

That makes Mr. Bukele a model leader, in Mr. Rubio’s view.

After visiting Panama in February, Mr. Rubio traveled on to El Salvador to greet Mr. Bukele. The 44-year-old president, who projects a casually cool image, wore aviator sunglasses and a shirt unbuttoned low on his chest as he hosted the American diplomat at his bucolic lakeside compound.

Later that day, Mr. Rubio hailed Mr. Bukele for transforming El Salvador from a country “known for violence” into “one of the most secure in the hemisphere.”

The key, Mr. Rubio said, was Mr. Bukele’s leadership, and “the difficult decisions that had to be made.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/11/multimedia/00dc-rubio-01-tqfb/00dc-rubio-01-tqfb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 10:57:59.750857

Allowing the social group ground to function as intended—filling gaps in protection—is not equivalent to adding a new protected ground.","On July 18, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), the highest administrative immigration tribunal in the United States, issued a decision, Matter of K-E-S-G-, holding that a “particular social group” (PSG), a key term in the legal definition of a refugee, cannot be defined by sex (the term used in the decision in lieu of “gender”), whether alone or in combination with nationality.

The asylum seeker in this case, a young Salvadoran woman, was terrorized by members of the MS-13 intent on forcing her to submit to them sexually. She fled the country only after the police refused to respond to her pleas for help, and her efforts to shake off her tormentors by relocating twice were unsuccessful.

The ruling in K-E-S-G- is unpersuasive, yet it is also entirely consistent with a decades-long trajectory in BIA jurisprudence. As someone who has litigated these cases since the 1990s, I can say that for years, the Board has pursued two related objectives – rendering the PSG ground virtually impossible to satisfy by imposing ever-more rigid and illogical requirements, while ensuring an interpretation that would place most women fleeing gender violence outside the ambit of refugee protection. These goals have the full support of the Trump administration, which took aggressive steps during its first term to do the same. The administration’s position is especially significant because immigration and BIA judges are not independent decision-makers, as are Article III judges, but are employees of the Department of Justice, required to follow Attorney General rulings. In his second term, the Trump Justice Department has continued its restrictive rulings on social group and gender. Following shortly on the heels of the BIA’s decision in Matter of K-E-S-G-, Attorney General Bondi issued two additional rulings which continue this trend by limiting social group and gender claims; respectively, Matter of R-E-R-M & J-D-R-M- and Matter of S-S-F-M-.

Moving Goalposts of the “Particular Social Group” Definition

Under U.S. law, derived from the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, a refugee is an individual with a well-founded fear of persecution “on account of” race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. The Convention drafters did not elaborate on the meaning of “particular social group,” but international refugee scholars have commented that its inclusion was to fill a possible gap in protection for claims not captured by the other four grounds, and subsequent case law in the United States and other jurisdictions has been consistent with that reading.

In 1985, the BIA had its first opportunity to interpret particular social group in Matter of Acosta. Noting the absence of interpretive guidance, the Board applied the doctrine of ejusdem generis which provides that a general term, included in a list of more specific terms, should be construed consistently with the specific terms. Reasoning that the other four Convention grounds refer to traits that a person cannot change, or should not be required to change to avoid persecution, the Board concluded that a “particular social group” is defined by immutable or fundamental characteristics, giving examples such as “sex, color, or kinship ties” or “shared past experience such as former military leadership or land ownership.”

Acosta’s immutable/fundamental approach, often referred to as the “protected characteristics” test, was cited approvingly by tribunals in other countries, including Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. At the same time as Acosta was decided, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) began highlighting the relevance of the particular social group ground to claims by women seeking protection in its guidance. In three directives issued in 1985, 1991, and 1993, UNHCR recommended that although gender is not one of the five Convention grounds, women facing gender-based persecution could qualify as a particular social group and come within the refugee definition. UNHCR issued comprehensive guidance in affirmance of sex or gender based social groups in its 2002 Gender Guidelines. Although UNHCR guidance is not binding, the Board and other courts interpreting U.S. refugee law often look to UNHCR as persuasive authority, given that it provides authoritative interpretation on the international Convention from which U.S. law derives.

The BIA’s first published gender decision in 1996, Matter of Kasinga, was consistent with both Acosta and UNHCR guidance. It applied its immutable/fundamental analysis to grant protection to a woman fleeing female genital cutting, finding that she was a member of a social group defined by gender combined with other characteristics, including ethnicity and uncut status.

But only three years later, in Matter of R-A-, the BIA began to backtrack. It reversed a grant of asylum to a Guatemalan woman fleeing domestic violence, ruling that Acosta’s immutable/fundamental test was only a threshold, and that applicants must also show the proposed social group “was recognized and understood to be a societal faction,” which the BIA ruled, the applicant had failed to do. Attorney General Janet Reno vacated Matter of R-A-. She directed the BIA to decide the case once proposed regulations addressing gender claims which her Department of Justice had issued, were finalized – which, unfortunately, never occurred. (Notably, a February 2021 Executive Order committing to the promulgation of regulations on social group and gender claims by the Biden administration also never came to fruition.)

Beginning in 2006, the BIA formally ruled that a PSG could no longer be defined solely by immutable/fundamental characteristics. In a series of decisions, it added two additional requirements – particularity and social distinction. Particularity requires that a group be defined in a way that provides a “benchmark” for who is in, and who is out, while social distinction, previously referred to as “social visibility,” requires proof that the group is “perceived as a group by society.” In a previous article with Stephen Legomsky, we explained why we and other scholars disagree with the Board’s imposition of these two requirements.

Requiring proof of particularity and social distinction had a draconian impact on the success of social group claims, including those based on gender. The BIA’s only positive social group decision following the adoption of these criteria was Matter of A-R-C-G- in which the government stipulated to the cognizability of the social group.

The decision in A-R-C-G– was an early casualty of the first Trump administration. It was vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who wrote that “[h]ad the Board properly analyzed the issues,” rather than accepting the government’s stipulation, “it would have been clear that the particular social group was not cognizable.” During Biden’s term, Attorney General Merrick Garland reinstated A-R-C-G- as precedent, but Bondi vacated A-R-C-G- once again, by way of Matter of S-S-F-M- mentioned above.

What’s Next in K-E-S-G-?

The K-E-S-G- case was sent back to the immigration court for consideration of another form of relief, however its flawed reasoning will be challenged on appeal as it begins to be applied in other cases. In contrast to the BIA, a number of circuit courts have repeatedly recognized social groups based on gender, including groups defined solely by gender and nationality. In a series of decisions as early as 2005 and continuing to the present, courts have accepted gender plus nationality groups across a range of claims involving domestic violence, femicide, sexual assault, ritual harm inflicted on widows, and female genital cutting.

If upheld, the decision in K-E-S-G- would seriously undermine protection for women fleeing violations of their most fundamental human rights. But the weight of authority runs counter to its holding, and the decision’s rationales are particularly unconvincing.

The BIA disregards the growing body of contrary precedent, acknowledging only two of the many circuit court decisions that have recognized social groups defined by gender and nationality. It then attempts to discount one of those two by erroneously claiming that it was decided under a “prior definition” of social group.

The BIA leans heavily on the Third Circuit’s decision in Chavez-Chilel, which rejected the proposed group of “Guatemalan women.” But Chavez-Chilel is a confused and deeply flawed opinion. It misstates the governing law by holding that, for a group to be cognizable, every member must possess a well-founded fear of persecution. That has never been the standard. This reasoning improperly collapses two distinct elements of the refugee definition: the existence of a protected ground and the well-foundedness of the applicant’s fear. Numerous decisions have affirmed that each element must be considered separately.

The Board’s application of the social group requirements to the case before it – Salvadoran women – is perhaps the least persuasive aspect of the decision. While it concedes that the group’s defining characteristics are immutable, it rejects the claim on the basis of particularity and, having done so, declines to address social distinction. In effect, the entire rejection rests on its particularity analysis. The Board concludes that the group lacks particularity because it could encompass women of “varying ages, socioeconomic statuses, marital statuses, family backgrounds, and lifestyles.” Yet particularity requires only that a group be defined with sufficient clarity to establish its boundaries, and “Salvadoran women”—despite internal diversity—constitutes a group with clear and ascertainable limits. This is consistent with other findings of PSG in similar cases, such as the 1990 decision in Toboso-Alfonso, ruling that “Cuban homosexuals” is a cognizable group, which the BIA has more recently referenced as meeting the particularity and social distinction requirements.

In concluding—and perhaps in tacit recognition of the weakness of its legal analysis—the BIA turns to a quasi-policy justification for rejecting gender and nationality groups. It asserts that recognizing sex and nationality based social groups would amount to creating “another protected ground” under the statute, and that nothing in domestic law, the Refugee Convention and Protocol, or their negotiating history supports such an intent.

Whether the BIA genuinely believes that recognizing such groups would have this effect is debatable. In any event, the argument is peculiar. Allowing the social group ground to function as intended—filling gaps in protection—is not equivalent to adding a new protected ground. If it were, the recognition of every cognizable social group would constitute the creation of a new ground, a claim that has never been made.

Equally confounding is the BIA’s invocation of the Convention, the Protocol, and their negotiating history. UNHCR has for decades urged recognition of gender-defined social groups. Moreover, numerous State parties, through both legislation and jurisprudence, expressly recognize gender alone or gender-nationality groups.

The BIA’s efforts to justify its rejection of gender nationality social groups are ultimately unpersuasive. But K-E-S-G- will not be the final word. It is now up to the federal courts to address the issue. After the Supreme Court’s decision in Loper Bright, the federal courts are no longer bound by Chevron deference to “reasonable” agency interpretations of ambiguous statutory terms. One can only hope they reach the same conclusion as the First Circuit in de Pena-Paniagua.

[I]is not clear why a . . . group defined as “women” or “women in country x” – without reference to additional limiting terms – fails either the ‘particularity’ or “social distinction” requirement. . . . [I]t is difficult to think of a country in which women are not viewed as “distinct” from other members of society. . . It is equally difficult to think of a country in which women do not form a “particular” and “well-defined” group of persons.

In the meantime, the BIA is obligated to decide each case on its own record, so attorneys should continue to argue gender/nationality groups, along with narrower groups which may be more likely to be accepted.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-11391582461.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 10:58:03.950332

They landed in Seoul on Friday afternoon local time — only after sitting in limbo for 24 hours while President Trump told his government to consider letting them stay and train American workers, South Korean officials said.
ICE planning documents suggest that agents were not necessarily targeting temporary South Korean workers last week.
“It was an accident” that ICE picked up the South Korean workers, Mr. Kuck argued.","Almost 500 people were detained during a raid of a Georgia battery plant owned by two South Korean manufacturers last week, the largest immigration enforcement operation at one location in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.

But in at least one instance, officials admitted a worker was employed legally and forced him to leave the country anyway, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.

The Times obtained internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest records for 11 of the detained workers. Six entered the country with B1 or B1/B2 visas, which are issued for business trips of up to six months. Four entered through the visa waiver program, which allows travel for 90 days. In one case, the worker’s status was unclear. The records stated that all but one of the 11 were working unlawfully at the time of the raid, but did not provide details about why.

In the one exception, agents said that although the worker “has not violated his visa,” the local ICE field office director “mandated” that he be considered someone who was voluntarily departing the country. The file noted that he worked for the South Korean engineering firm SFA, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Two-thirds of the people arrested on Sept. 4 were South Koreans, and nearly all of them were flown back to their home country this week. They landed in Seoul on Friday afternoon local time — only after sitting in limbo for 24 hours while President Trump told his government to consider letting them stay and train American workers, South Korean officials said.

“What ICE is doing here is illegal, and people should be held to account,” said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta immigration lawyer who is representing some of those who were detained. “If we’re turning from ‘let’s enforce the law against people who violate the law’ to ‘let’s enforce the law against everybody regardless of their legal status,’ I think we’ve changed the kind of country that we’ve become.”

The fallout from the operation at the plant was the latest example of the dragnet-like nature of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy and how it can conflict with other stated policy objectives, such as bolstering production in the United States. It also highlighted a strategy used by multinational firms to temporarily import workers into the United States to establish new operations.

The question of who will perform both the heavy manual labor and sophisticated technical jobs associated with advanced factories has taken on greater urgency in recent years as the federal government has pushed advanced manufacturing, often led by foreign companies.

The Trump administration has told its trading partners to either make their goods in America or pay steep tariffs, and leveraged hundreds of billions of dollars in investment commitments from South Korea, Japan and the European Union. The plant, which is owned by the carmaker Hyundai and the battery supplier LG Energy Solution, is weeks from completion. Contractors were installing the sophisticated equipment needed to make batteries for electric vehicles.

Representatives from the battery plant joint venture did not return requests for comment, nor did spokespeople from the White House and the Department of Homeland Security.

The B1 and combination B1/B2 visa — the kind held by several Georgia plant workers — is commonly used for business and tourism-related travel lasting less than six months, especially for consulting technical or scientific roles. A total of 4,906 B1/B2 visas were issued to South Koreans in the first five months of this year, according to government records, a small slice of the 2.86 million issued to all countries over the same period.

Robert Marton, an immigration lawyer with auto manufacturer clients other than Hyundai, said he had relied on B1 visas more in recent years as other programs for bringing in foreign workers had become more competitive.

Companies routinely bring in employees from elsewhere with H-1B visas, which allow someone to stay for several years. But those are capped in number, expensive to apply for and in high demand.

“The H-1B program has been restrictive as it’s been for years,” Mr. Marton said. “So I think lawyers like us are looking at workarounds and getting people in quickly.”

Obtaining a B1 visa requires submitting proof of the worker’s credentials, such as degree certificates, and proof of employment in someone’s home country. It is supposed to be used for consulting with business associates, negotiating contracts or attending conferences.

Jongwon Lee, a lawyer in Duluth, Ga., who has worked with South Korean companies operating in the state, said the official guidance left little clarity on how expansively the B1 visa could be interpreted.

“Installing software, giving instructions of how to set up machines, is that consulting or not?” Mr. Lee said. “Nobody knows. No update, no instruction, no case law.”

Instead, enforcement can play out in real time. ICE planning documents suggest that agents were not necessarily targeting temporary South Korean workers last week.

The original warrant for the raid listed only four Hispanic individuals. According to Mr. Kuck, agents did not have any Korean speakers on hand during the raid and had to use apps to translate.

“It was an accident” that ICE picked up the South Korean workers, Mr. Kuck argued. “They just transported everybody to the jail to sort it out later.”

The raid was part of an expansive deportation effort that the White House has choreographed throughout the United States this year, roping in several agencies that typically did not handle immigration matters as a way to meet Mr. Trump’s campaign promises. Stephen Miller, the White House’s deputy chief of staff, has targeted 3,000 arrests a day. Work site enforcement is seen as a way to put large numbers on the board.

Nearly all of the 317 ​detained South Korean workers had planned to return home to rest but may consider returning to the construction site later, officials in Seoul said this week.​ One worker chose to stay in the United States with relatives who have green cards.

Typically, when foreigners accept a “voluntary departure,” it means they have acknowledged that they violated immigration laws and will not be allowed back into the United States. In this case, removal documents did not contain an admission of wrongdoing, and South Korean officials have demanded that the workers not face adverse consequences.

Along with the South Koreans, ICE agents picked up workers from Japan, China and Indonesia at the Georgia plant. The Mexican Consulate in Atlanta said 23 of its citizens had been detained, and the Colombian Consulate said it was aware of 19 Colombians.

Some of those from Central and South America, according to lawyers and an organization called Migrant Equity SouthEast, had valid work permits and were legally present in the country with Temporary Protected Status or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Both are programs that the Trump administration has sought to dismantle.

Short-term business visa programs have been abused in the past — by employees who overstay their limits, as well as by employers. A pending class action lawsuit alleges that a contractor for a Hyundai subsidiary recruited engineers and technicians to work at a Georgia warehouse on TN visas. That visa category is intended for educated professionals from a prescribed list of occupations, but the workers say they were instead forced to do security, cleaning and packaging jobs.

It’s not clear whether anything similar was underway at the Hyundai-LG plant. Julia Solórzano, the legal and policy director of the Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, an immigrant rights group that helped bring that case, has been coordinating the response to the raid. Unlike workers in such operations in the past, she said, those who were not flown back to Seoul have not been released on bond.

“In this raid, it is notable that they seem to have taken so many of the workers into detention,” Ms. Solórzano said. “It makes it very hard to support people, and it creates conditions that make it hard for workers to fairly assess their immigration options.”

But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen.
The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket.
The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.","Washington — More than 300 lawsuits challenging many of President Trump's second-term plans and his administration's actions have been winding through the federal courts over the past few months. But a handful now may be poised for review by the Supreme Court, or are getting close to it.

The cases involve major policies enacted by Mr. Trump in the months since he returned to the White House, and several of them have already been before the high court, though during earlier stages in the proceedings.

In those instances, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to grant it emergency relief, allowing it to enforce its immigration policies, in some instances, or terminate officials at independent agencies, in others.

In the wake of those interim decisions, lower courts have continued to hold proceedings and issue rulings addressing the merits of the Trump administration's actions. If the Supreme Court agrees to step into these disputes, they will present the initial opportunities for the justices to address the legality of Mr. Trump's plans.

""I'm expecting this to be the term of Trump,"" Dan Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the new Supreme Court term set to begin Oct. 6.

The justices are already set to hear blockbuster cases on redistricting, campaign finance and state laws barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.

Many of the disputes involving Mr. Trump's actions test the limits of the president's power, and rulings could have massive implications for his policies on the economy and immigration, as well as his reshaping of the executive branch.

The Trump administration has sought emergency intervention from the Supreme Court roughly two dozen times so far, and it has fared well in its bids to continue enforcing its plans while legal challenges continue.

But whether the president will prevail when the Supreme Court examines the lawfulness of his actions remains to be seen. Still, in some instances — like his efforts to fire certain executive officers — the Supreme Court has signaled that Mr. Trump may have the power to terminate members of certain independent agencies.

""What's at stake is the country's commitment to the rule of law,"" Epps said. He added that the new term could also bring a ""huge sweeping victory"" for executive power, particularly if the Supreme Court finds that courts should give broad deference to the president on matters like immigration.

Tariffs

The dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed on nearly every U.S. trading partner will be the first in which the Supreme Court will decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's key policies.

The high court said Tuesday that it is taking up two cases involving the global tariffs, which question whether Mr. Trump has the power to impose the sweeping duties under a federal emergency powers law. The justices will hear arguments in early November, a rapid timeline for the court.

The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled late last month that many of Mr. Trump's tariffs issued under the emergency powers law are illegal.

The Federal Circuit divided 7-4 in finding that the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, did not authorize the president's global tariffs. But the duties remain in place for now, as the Federal Circuit wiped away a permanent injunction granted by a lower court that blocked the Trump administration from imposing the levies.

The dispute tests a major centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, and the Justice Department has warned that a ruling against the government would put the frameworks of trade deals negotiated with half a dozen countries at risk.

Termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants

Soon after Mr. Trump took office, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took steps to end legal protections that had been granted to hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants by the Biden administration through a program known as Temporary Protected Status.

In response to a lawsuit filed by the National TPS Alliance and seven individuals who were shielded from threat of deportation, a federal judge granted preliminary relief and postponed the date Noem's plan was set to take effect.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined to put that decision on hold while proceedings moved forward, but the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration emergency relief, allowing Noem to end the legal protections for now.

Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit heard arguments in July on the Trump administration's effort to terminate the TPS designation for Venezuela, and late last month, a three-judge panel sided with the plaintiffs.

The judges found that the TPS holders were likely to succeed in their argument that Noem lacked the authority to set aside an earlier extension of the program for Venezuelan migrants.

The impact of that decision, however, is limited because the interim relief granted by the Supreme Court at an earlier stage in the case is still in place.

Alien Enemies Act removals

Mr. Trump issued a proclamation in March that invoked the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport Venezuelan migrants who are suspected of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua. The Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants it claims are gang members under the wartime law, which gives the president the authority to remove citizens of a ""hostile nation"" if it is engaged in an ""invasion or predatory incursion"" of the U.S.

A ""60 Minutes"" investigation found that many migrants deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act didn't have criminal records.

The proclamation immediately sparked litigation, including two court fights that have already been up to the Supreme Court on its emergency docket. In the first case, brought in federal district court in Washington, D.C., the high court said any challenges to removals under the Alien Enemies Act must be brought in the judicial district where a migrant is being held.

But the Supreme Court also said that migrants at risk of deportation under the 1798 law must receive notice that they are subject to removal and the opportunity to challenge it.

In the wake of that decision, judges in Texas, Colorado, New York and California have blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants being held in their regions.

The second case to reach the Supreme Court arose when Venezuelan migrants detained by immigration officials at a facility in the Northern District of Texas sued to challenge their removals under the Alien Enemies Act.

The high court temporarily blocked the migrants' deportations in April and later sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit for further review after finding the Trump administration had not provided the migrants with enough notice — 24 hours — of their impending deportations.

The Supreme Court did not address the lawfulness of the removals under the Alien Enemies Act.

After holding additional proceedings, a divided three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit rejected Mr. Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove Venezuelan migrants in the Northern District of Texas. The court said in its 2-1 decision that there was no predatory incursion or invasion by Tren de Aragua — preconditions to invoking the law.

The 5th Circuit is the first appeals court to address whether Mr. Trump properly invoked the 18th century-law.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the Trump administration will appeal, saying the 5th Circuit's decision ""will not be the final say on the matter.""

Firings of members of independent agencies

Mr. Trump has spent his months back in the White House pushing the bounds of executive power, including by firing officials at independent agencies appointed by former President Joe Biden.

Mr. Trump's attempts to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission, to name a few, have all led to legal challenges by the ousted officials.

In cases brought by Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, members of the NLRB and MSPB, respectively, a lower court ordered them to be reinstated to their roles. Federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled their firings violated federal laws that shielded them from being terminated without cause and cited a 1935 Supreme Court decision that said Congress could enact removal protections for members of multi-member boards that met certain criteria.

The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing it to fire Wilcox and Harris while their cases proceed, and the court gave the president the green-light to remove the officials for now.

Meanwhile, the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard oral arguments on Mr. Trump's bid to fire Wilcox and Harris in May but has not yet issued a decision.

But in a different case, involving Mr. Trump's attempt to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the removal protections for members of the trade commission violate the separation of powers. The administration wants the high court to take up the dispute over Slaughter's removal before the appeals court has ruled.

At least one justice, Brett Kavanaugh, believes it's time for the Supreme Court to address the legality of removal restrictions for members of independent agencies. In a concurring opinion in a case involving Mr. Trump's firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, Kavanaugh said there is a ""at least a fair prospect"" that the Supreme Court will either narrow or overrule Humphrey's Executor v. United States, that 1935 decision that upheld removal protections for certain executive officers.

""[W]hen the question is whether to narrow or overrule one of this Court's precedents rather than how to resolve an open or disputed question of federal law, further percolation in the lower courts is not particularly useful because lower courts cannot alter or overrule this Court's precedent,"" he wrote.

Birthright citizenship

The president's plan to end birthright citizenship has already been before the Supreme Court, but the justices did not address the constitutionality of his executive order. Instead, the dispute involved whether federal judges have the ability to issue nationwide injunctions, or orders that universally block enforcement of a policy beyond the plaintiffs in a case.

The high court said judges are limited in their ability to grant that sweeping relief, but left open other avenues like class-action lawsuits or challenges to an agency rule brought under the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing the agency rule-making process.

Following that June decision, several groups of plaintiffs amended their initial lawsuits and asked district courts to certify as classes children covered by Mr. Trump's executive order and would be denied birthright citizenship.

In one of those cases, brought by a group of four states — Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon — a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled 2-1 in July that Mr. Trump's executive order is unconstitutional.

The White House said in response to the decision that it looks forward to ""being vindicated on appeal.""

The ruling from the 9th Circuit was the first from an appeals court to address the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/10/fd1f2e69-29e9-45d4-b0f6-1444933fab09/thumbnail/1200x630g2/ae08fc9338409810347b1e40bcf793d3/gettyimages-2222462629.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 06:57:04.981625

In the weeks leading up to July 9, Ayman Soliman told friends he was terrified of losing the sanctuary he’d found after fleeing Egypt in 2014 and building a new life as a Muslim chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.

Soliman, 51, was to show up at 9 a.m. on that date for his first check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement since losing his asylum status. He’d been granted the protections in 2018 under the first Trump administration. Then, in the last month of the Biden presidency, immigration authorities moved to revoke them based on sharply disputed claims of fraud and aid to a terrorist group. Once President Donald Trump returned to office weeks later, court records show, immigration officials bumped up the terrorism claims and formalized the asylum termination June 3.

By the time of Soliman’s ICE appointment, friends said, he was distraught over the prospect of being returned to the regime that had jailed him for documenting protests as a journalist. He arrived at the agency’s field office in Blue Ash, Ohio, accompanied by fellow clergy and a couple of Democratic state lawmakers.

“I didn’t come to America seeking a better life. I was escaping death,” he said in a video filmed just before he entered.

Inside, Soliman’s attorneys said, he was shocked to find FBI agents waiting for him. They interrogated him for three hours about his charity work more than a decade ago in Egypt, the basis for the Department of Homeland Security accusations of illegal aid, or “material support,” to Islamist militants.

His lawyer eventually emerged from the ICE office holding a belt and a wallet. Soliman had been swept into custody, joining a record 61,000 people now in ICE detention. As he awaits an immigration court trial Sept. 25, he is being held in a county jail run by a sheriff who posted a sign outside reading, “Illegal Aliens Here.”

Legal observers are watching the chaplain’s case as a bellwether of the Trump administration’s ability to merge the vast federal powers of immigration and counterterrorism. The case is also a reminder, they say, of sweeping post-9/11 statutes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have been accused of abusing, especially in cases involving Muslims.

Material support laws ban almost any type of aid to U.S.-designated foreign terrorist groups, extending far beyond the basics of weapons, personnel and money. Prosecutors describe the laws as an invaluable tool against would-be attackers, but civil liberties groups have long complained of overreach.

Over the years, successive administrations have faced legal challenges over how they wield the power; a milestone Supreme Court decision during the Obama administration upheld the laws as constitutional. Now, however, there are particular fears about the material support “sledgehammer,” as one legal scholar put it, in the hands of Trump, who has been openlyhostile toward Muslims and determined to deport a million people who are in the United States without permission.

“These statutes are written extraordinarily broadly with the unstated premise that discretion will be exercised responsibly. And one thing this administration has shown is that it doesn’t understand what it means to exercise discretion responsibly,” said David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor who argued high-profile material support cases and served as national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union.

At issue are DHS allegations that Soliman’s involvement with an Islamic charity provided material support to the Muslim Brotherhood. But neither the charity nor the Brotherhood is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, and an Egyptian court found no official ties between the groups.

Faith leaders call on Ohio governor to speak on behalf of jailed cleric

The Biden-era DHS, which first flagged the issue, said it would revoke Soliman’s asylum if “a preponderance of the evidence supports termination” after a hearing, according to the December notice. At the time, court records show, the material support allegation was listed as a secondary concern after more common asylum questions about the veracity of official documents and his claims of persecution in Egypt.

Once Trump came to power weeks later, Soliman’s attorneys said, the material support claims metastasized, with U.S. authorities declaring the Muslim Brotherhood a Tier III, or undesignated, terrorist group and adding new arguments about ties to Hamas. The Brotherhood, a nearly century-old Islamist political movement, renounced violence in the 1970s, though Hamas and other spinoffs are on the U.S. blacklist. In addition to the Egypt-related concerns, DHS filings about Soliman had noted warrants for “murder and terrorism” in Iraq — a country Soliman says he’s never visited.

By elevating the national security argument, Soliman’s lawyers said, DHS was able to bypass an immigration judge and order the chaplain held without bond as “potentially dangerous.” An established terrorism nexus means less transparency for immigrants — and more power for the authorities.

“DHS is judge, jury and executioner,” said Robert Ratliff, one of Soliman’s attorneys.

The idea of Soliman as a secret militant has outraged residents who know him locally as “the interfaith imam” and the first Muslim on the pastoral care team at Cincinnati Children’s, a top-ranked pediatric hospital. Colleagues described a popular chaplain with nicknames for the tiny patients and soothing words for their bleary-eyed parents.

Judy Ragsdale, the former pastoral care director who hired Soliman in 2021 shortly before retiring, said she wrote a letter to hospital leaders imploring them to speak out against the allegations that could return him to certain persecution in Egypt. He lost authorization to work in June, when his asylum was terminated.

“This is a ‘Schindler’s List’ moment,” Ragsdale said she told hospital leaders. “And if you don’t stand up for Ayman, you’re complicit in what’s happening to him.”

Some fear DHS is parlaying the scope and secrecy of counterterrorism laws into a weapon to boost the president’s mass-deportation mission.

Immigrant rights groups say a sped-up campaign with fewer guardrails for due process is already leading to removals based on evidence that hasn’t been fully vetted. If DHS is successful in test cases like Soliman’s, they say, material support claims could be more easily applied to immigration cases with even tenuous links to militant factions, including newly designated cartels.

The White House referred questions to Homeland Security, which routed a request for comment to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; a spokesperson there said in a statement that the agency generally “does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”

“An alien — even with a pending application or lawful status — is not shielded from immigration enforcement action,” the statement said. The FBI declined to comment.

Jeffrey Breinholt, an architect of the material support statutes who spent three decades as a federal terrorism prosecutor, defends the laws as crucial to closing loopholes that were exploited by foreign militant groups and their domestic sympathizers.

Breinholt, who retired in 2024, said he has no concerns about the widening scope as it converges with Trump’s deportation push. The designation of cartels, he said, “is a natural outgrowth of the success we have had with ‘material support’ crime.”

To Cole and other critics, however, the Soliman case could be “the canary in the coal mine.”

More Than a Chaplain

Within a few hours of Soliman’s detention, dozens showed up for an impromptu rally and news conference in the ICE center parking lot. That backup has since grown into a hundreds-strong campaign to refute the DHS allegations, which supporters call a resurgence of anti-Muslim fearmongering that has persisted across party lines since the 9/11 attacks 24 years ago this month.

“Any time you have a brown man or a Muslim man and you use the words ‘FBI’ and ‘red flag,’ you don’t have to say any more,” said Tala Ali, a friend of Soliman’s who heads the board of a Cincinnati mosque where he sometimes led prayers.

Voices calling for Soliman’s release include parents who met him in the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit. The families are in disbelief that the chaplain they’d grown close to is now jailed in a high-stakes international case. They knew he’d fled Egypt but said they were learning details of his ordeal through the campaign to free him.

“It would be very easy to be resentful and be angry with the world when you have to live through that kind of trauma, and he’s not like that at all. He’s taking on other peoples’ trauma,” said Heather Barrow, whose infant daughter, Mya, died in the NICU last year.

She said Soliman stepped in to spare her grieving family the heartache of making funeral arrangements for a 5-month-old. He attended Mya’s celebration of life and, later, a butterfly release on June 7, which would’ve been her first birthday. A month later, he was in an ICE cell.

“I was like, how is this happening? He was just at our house,” Barrow said.

Another couple, Taylor and Bryan McClain, also came to rely on Soliman when their newborn, Violette, arrived at Cincinnati Children’s last year with life-threatening complications. The chaplain steadied them during their 271 days in the NICU, which Taylor said felt like “a roller coaster in a tornado and it’s on fire.” The McClains call him “family.”

“I say with full confidence: Violette is alive because of the advocacy that Ayman gave us,” Taylor said one recent afternoon as she held her daughter, now just over a year old.

Clergy members make up another bloc of support — so many that they built a spreadsheet to divide visiting hours among imams, rabbis and pastors. Immigration advocates and Ohio civil rights leaders have added their names to petitions. So have University of Cincinnati student groups including the Ornithology Club and the Harry Potter Appreciation Club.

More than a dozen people faced criminal charges stemming from a melee after a rally in Soliman’s support; demonstrators and police blame each other for the violence July 17.

Two of Soliman’s fellow chaplains at Cincinnati Children’s, Adam Allen and Elizabeth Diop, said they lost their jobs for refusing to keep quiet about their jailed colleague. Meanwhile, the hospital, a cherished local institution, is taking heat for its silence. Soliman’s supporters launched a letter-writing campaign demanding a response from the hospital, which has said it does not discuss personnel issues.

Signs appeared outside the hospital. “Missing Chaplain,” they said. “Abducted By ICE.”

Cincinnati Children’s Hospital did not return messages seeking comment. In an internal memo published by The Cincinnati Enquirer, hospital CEO Dr. Steve Davis told employees that the lack of response “should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.” As a nonprofit, Davis stressed, the hospital has strict rules about “activities that could be characterized as political.”

Soliman’s supporters press on. One recent Sunday evening, about 200 filled a Cincinnati church where preachers from several faith backgrounds urged them to demand his freedom.

“The trial that Imam Ayman is going through is our trial,” Abdulhakim Mohamed, head of the North American Imams Fellowship, told the crowd. “His justice is ours to own. The injustice is also ours to bear.”

Escape From Egypt

Soliman’s entanglement with the Egyptian security apparatus began in 2000 when he joined fellow college students to protest repressive laws, he said in asylum papers.

He was periodically locked up and intimidated after that, he said. The persecution worsened more than a decade ago during uprisings that remade the Middle East by toppling dictators — including Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak — but in some places spiraled into civil war.

Soliman worked as a freelance journalist covering pro-democracy revolts in Egypt and neighboring Libya. Friends say he was also studying to become an imam and served on the board of a local chapter of the Islamic charity Al-Gameya al-Shareya, which is known for its network of hospitals and orphan programs throughout Egypt.

The charity, whose name has multiple English spellings, launched in 1912 and is often described as “one of the most established national Islamic organizations.” Scholars have written that early leaders came from the Muslim Brotherhood, archenemy of Egypt’s current military leadership, but that ties ended around 1990 under government pressure.

In the years since, researchers found, the group maintained smooth relations with the government as its more than 1,000 chapters nationwide encompass Egyptians of all political leanings. That delicate balance faltered briefly in 2013 when a military-led counterrevolution quashed the nascent democratic movement and deposed elected leaders who were part of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Egypt’s military rulers declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization and shuttered any organization it suspected of ties. Al-Gameya Al-Shareya was among more than 1,000 civil society groups blacklisted in the crackdown, court filings say, and chapters suspected of helping the Brotherhood during elections were dissolved. The group resumed operations the next year, when an Egyptian court lifted the ban, ruling that the charity “has no ties to the Muslim Brotherhood,” according to news reports.

Egypt’s return to zero tolerance for dissidents made Soliman’s activism dangerous, he said in court papers. As a journalist and Islamic scholar, he represented two fields the Egyptian government views as existential threats: a free press and religious organizing.

Soliman fled to the United States in 2014 on a visitor visa and later filed a petition for asylum, describing how security forces over the years had locked him up on false charges and tortured him with electrical shocks. In one incident, his attorney said, Egyptian forces with machine guns stormed into an apartment where Soliman was asleep with his wife and young child. (Through attorneys, Soliman asked to withhold details about his family because they remain in Egypt.)

“For me, it’s life or death,” Soliman later told a U.S. immigration officer of his need to escape.

Officials in Cairo referred questions to the Egyptian Embassy in Washington, which did not respond to requests for comment.

The asylum application asked whether Soliman had belonged to political parties or other associations in his home country. Ratliff, the attorney, said Soliman marked “yes” and attached a statement that mentioned Al-Gameya Al-Shareya and his role in fundraising for the local chapter.

Friends said Soliman rejoiced when he was granted asylum in 2018, under the first Trump administration, and sought permanent residency as the next step toward reuniting with his family. But the process stalled. “Bureaucratic hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle,” Ratliff said.

Then came a more serious snag. In 2021, Soliman learned he was on a federal watchlist when a background check for a chaplain job at an Oregon prison showed that the FBI had flagged him, court papers show.

His attorneys said they have no idea why. It could’ve been about a specific piece of intelligence. It could’ve been a misspelling or mistaken identity, simple errors that have landed ordinary Muslims on opaque “war on terror” watchlists that are nearly impossible to get off.

Soliman, friends say, insisted on trying to clear his name. With the help of the Muslim Legal Fund of America, he sued government agencies including the FBI and the Transportation Security Administration. That route led to open-ended legal battles that yielded no clear answers and no green card.

Instead, his place in the country became more vulnerable. In December, the final stretch of the Biden administration, Soliman received notice that the government intended to terminate his asylum based on “inconsistencies” in his claims of persecution and concern that his charity work made him inadmissible based on “possible membership in a terrorist organization.”

Some of his friends are convinced it was payback for the lawsuits, but attorneys say there’s no telling what triggered a review.

“What Ayman has experienced is something that, post-9/11, has been the reality of Muslims in this country,” said Ali, his friend and advocate. “All he did was try to get answers and accountability for what he’d been put through.”

Big Claims, Little Transparency

Contested asylum cases like Soliman’s were prime targets when Trump took office the next month and supercharged deportations, a top campaign pledge. Since his return to office, ICE arrests have doubled.

Soliman was called to an asylum hearing in February, a month into the new administration, for a last shot at defending his eligibility. A DHS officer asked about claims in the Biden-era notice alleging “discrepancies in date and number of times he suffered harm” and raising doubts about a handwritten Egyptian police report and letters authenticating his journalistic work.

A transcript shows Soliman explaining that he sometimes got confused when describing traumatic incidents from years ago in English, his second language. He said the police report was a rough translation included by mistake and submitted statements verifying his journalism.

Then the DHS officer’s questioning took a turn: “When did you start supporting Al-Jameya Al-Shareya?”

For the rest of the meeting, the transcript shows, the officer drilled down on Soliman’s knowledge of the charity: fundraising, chapter size, support for violence and whether he had been aware of a Brotherhood link.

Another of Soliman’s attorneys interrupted when the immigration officer said the Brotherhood had been a Tier III group since 2012. That’s not how it works, the attorney countered — only top-tier terrorist organizations like al-Qaida or the Islamic State are given dates of designation. Tier III, she said, is for undesignated groups and is determined on a case-by-case basis, with the burden of proof on the government.

“Counsel, I’ll give you an opportunity at the end to make a closing,” the DHS officer said.

“I understand,” the attorney replied, “but we’re talking about something factual.”

The next time Soliman heard from DHS was the official termination of his asylum, effective June 3. This time, there was no hedging in language that declared he was ineligible based on “evidence that indicated you provided material support to a Tier III terrorist organization.” A few weeks later, he was taken into custody and notified of his pending removal.

Soliman’s legal team sued, arguing that he was stripped of asylum on illegal grounds because the designations had been made “without proper findings” and based on no new evidence.

Court filings show DHS attorneys introducing, then withdrawing or amending, materials to build a case linking Soliman to the Brotherhood through the charity.

“It looked like, ‘What can we put here to get to there?’” said Ratliff, a former immigration judge.

Among the supporting evidence filed by the government are three academic reports by scholars with deep knowledge of Islamic charities in Egypt. Soliman’s legal team filed statements from all three balking at how DHS had cherry-picked their research.

Steven Brooke at the University of Wisconsin-Madison detailed “important mistakes of fact and interpretation.” Neil Russell, an academic in Scotland, called the U.S. conclusions “a mischaracterization of my findings.” Marie Vannetzel, a French scholar who has conducted field research with Al-Gameya Al-Shareya, rebutted what she called “a dishonest manipulation of my text and my work.”

Vannetzel wrote that she rejects the idea that Soliman, “simply by virtue of his activity in the association, could be accused of providing material support to the Muslim Brotherhood.”

Observers of Cairo’s unsparing campaign to uproot Islamist opposition say the matter is clear-cut: If the charity survived the scrutiny of Egyptian intelligence, then it’s not Muslim Brotherhood. “It’s really striking that this group is not proscribed,” said Michael Hanna, an Egypt specialist and U.S. program director of the nonprofit International Crisis Group.

Soliman’s attorneys also criticized the government’s assertion in court filings that he, as a board member of one local branch, would’ve been aware of any Brotherhood affiliation of chapters nationwide. “If a Rotarian in Seattle commits murder, we don’t go charging Rotarians in Des Moines with conspiracy,” Ratliff said.

Separate from U.S. attempts to tie Soliman to the Brotherhood was a puzzling footnote about Iraq that appeared in a later filing. Without detail, DHS attorneys alluded to warrants for “murder and terrorism activities.” Ratliff said a DHS attorney later confirmed to him in a phone call that it wasn’t about Soliman, but didn’t explain why it was there.

The error remained uncorrected in filings until Sept. 3, when DHS attorney Cheryl Gutridge acknowledged in court that it was an “inadvertent” reference to another case, Ohio news outlets reported. The original wording suggesting that Soliman faced murder charges in Iraq had been included in the government’s successful argument for keeping him in custody.

DHS did not address questions about the Iraq reference.

A close friend, Ahmed Elkady, said Soliman told him on a jail visit he was stunned to be linked to Iraq, a place he’s never been: “He said, ‘How can I become a virtual terrorist?”

A Sheriff’s ICE Fiefdom

As he awaits trial in immigration court, Soliman is in custody at the Butler County Jail, about 30 miles outside of Cincinnati, past cornfields and a German social club and the Town and Country Mobile Home Park.

For more than 20 years, this outpost has been the domain of Sheriff Richard Jones, a cowboy hat-wearing firebrand who keeps a framed photo of Trump in his office. In the run-up to the 2024 election, Jones mused that a Trump victory might put him “back in the deportation business.”

From 2003 to 2021, the jail had been contracted to house immigration detainees until the arrangement dissolved in the Biden era. As predicted, the county entered into a new agreement with ICE in February, after Trump returned to power, to hold around 400 detainees: $68 a day per person, plus $36 an hour for the sheriff’s office toward transportation.

Jones celebrated the restored partnership by posting a fake image showing inflatable gators outside the jail, a nod to ICE’s “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center in Florida. A Black Lives Matter group in Dayton issued a statement calling the sheriff’s post an “egregious act of cruelty and historical mockery.”

Advocate: Ohio’s county jails are no place for migrants

As it returns to deportation work, the jail still faces a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in 2020 by two ICE prisoners who said they endured beatings and discrimination. One plaintiff, a Muslim, said a jailer called him a “fucking terrorist” and threatened to throw his prayer rug in the toilet. Jones has disputed the claims.

The sheriff is in the news again because of Soliman. In court filings, the Muslim chaplain says he was denied access to a space where he could lead communal prayers and then placed in “isolation” for nearly a week with only an hour of phone access between midnight and 1 a.m.

Soliman’s attorneys say in court papers that the episode was related to “targeted harassment” over his religion. The sheriff’s office told local outlets that it respects religious freedom and said Soliman was placed in isolation because he was “argumentative” and “threatening.”

After agreeing to an interview with ProPublica, Jones later decided he was “no longer interested,” the sheriff’s spokesperson, Deputy Kim Peters, wrote in a text message.

As he languishes in jail, Soliman’s empty apartment in Cincinnati has become a way station for an inner circle of supporters, who said they felt like “intruders” when they first gathered there. Soliman is known as an elegant dresser, but his apartment was in bachelor-pad disarray, a reflection of his long hours at the hospital and the abruptness of his detention, said his friends, also clerics. The imams laughed when one confessed that he first thought the FBI had ransacked the place.

Over water bottles and energy drinks scavenged from Soliman’s fridge, they talked about the deportation threat. In Egypt, pro-government news outlets already have trumpeted the case as proof that Soliman was leading a secret Brotherhood cell in America.

Despite Soliman’s predicament, they said, being in limbo here is preferable to the alternative.

“You think I’m afraid of being here in jail?” Soliman told fellow imam Ihab Alsaghier during a recent visit. “Every moment I’m alone, I imagine I’m on a flight back to Egypt.”",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Ayman-Clapping.jpg,N,,2025-09-12 05:58:22.020255

They're the armed officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), often masked and unidentified, wearing plain clothes under protective vests, arresting people in towns and cities across the country.
Critics have slammed the Trump administration for ICE's tactics of randomly apprehending non-white men, particularly Latinos, in sweeps where undocumented migrants live or work.
The Trump administration insists its approach is working.
During a White House briefing on Tuesday, when a reporter asked about American citizens' concerns that they could be swept up in the immigration enforcement, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off the question.","They're the most visible symbol of what U.S. President Donald Trump pledges will be ""the largest mass deportation in history.""

They're the armed officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), often masked and unidentified, wearing plain clothes under protective vests, arresting people in towns and cities across the country.

ICE made roughly three times as many arrests from May through July compared with the same period last year, according to the latest government figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request by the Deportation Data Project, led by the University of California Berkeley School of Law.

But those same figures do not show a comparable increase in the number of people with a criminal history getting picked up by ICE. Roughly half of the 61,000 people currently held in immigration detention in the U.S. have neither a criminal record nor face a criminal charge, according to the data.

The evidence belies the Trump administration's claim that its immigration crackdown is targeting ""the worst of the worst,"" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst and attorney at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.

Bush-Joseph says the statistics reflect the tactics ICE officers are using to dramatically ramp up their arrest numbers under direction from the White House.

""They're going to places where they think there will be lots of unauthorized immigrants and trying to arrest as many people as they can there,"" she told CBC News, ""people who are going to U.S. immigration courts for their asylum hearings and asylum offices are being arrested and detained.""

Supreme Court endorsement

The data shows immigration arrests nationwide averaged roughly 300 per day throughout 2024. Following Trump's inauguration in January, arrests doubled almost overnight to roughly 600 per day, then spiked again in May, reaching more than 1,000 per day in June.

Critics have slammed the Trump administration for ICE's tactics of randomly apprehending non-white men, particularly Latinos, in sweeps where undocumented migrants live or work.

A decision by the U.S. Supreme Court this week endorsed such tactics — at least for now.

In a 6-3 decision, the court's conservative majority lifted a California judge's order that had temporarily banned agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

But the Supreme Court's decision is not the final word on the case.

The courts have yet to hear full arguments about whether the tactics violate the U.S. Constitution's protections against unreasonable arrest. A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 24 in a district court in California, and the case is widely expected to end up in the Supreme Court's hands in the coming months.

Mike Fox, a legal fellow with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank in Washington, says ICE is using unconstitutional methods to ramp up the number of migrants it's arresting.

""The numbers are going to be a lot lower if you're actually focusing on the violent people that you should be focusing on,"" said Fox. ""It's a lot easier to just stand outside a Home Depot and round people up.""

Fox says he believes most Americans want ICE to target violent offenders for deportation, not ""someone who came here for a better life… trying to make an honest living.""

The Trump administration insists its approach is working.

""As a result of this unprecedented effort, scores of gang members and national security threats have been taken off our streets,"" said a White House news release on Tuesday.

During a White House briefing on Tuesday, when a reporter asked about American citizens' concerns that they could be swept up in the immigration enforcement, Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off the question.

""They should not be concerned because this administration is focused on the detention and deportation of illegal alien criminals who broke our nation's immigration laws,"" she said.

""When ICE goes out to conduct a targeted operation to deport illegal criminals from our community, they are doing so with intelligence… in most cases with the backing of local law enforcement who know exactly where these illegal alien criminals and drug traffickers and drug dealers are hiding in plain sight.""

While the White House likes to highlight examples of violent criminals picked up by ICE and trumpet the drop in illegal crossings of the border with Mexico, reaching its reported goal of deporting one million migrants per year appears impossible without going after people who have no criminal history.

According to ICE's own figures, made public in a letter to a congressman last September, the agency was tracking about 425,000 immigrants with criminal convictions who were not in detention and another 222,000 with pending criminal charges. (Roughly 20 per cent of the combined total was convicted or charged with traffic offences.)

Even if every one of those immigrants with convictions or charges is detained and deported within a year, that leaves the administration some 350,000 short of the target.

""As immigration enforcement increases, the per cent of those arrested who are convicted of a crime decreases,"" said the Immigration Research Initiative, a non-profit, non-partisan think-tank funded by the NEO Foundation charity, in its analysis of data from the first six months following Trump's inauguration.

Another non-partisan, non-profit organization found the administration ramped up its volume of immigration-related arrests in an ""indiscriminate and unfocused"" way.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.5239582.1751063770!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/u-s-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-officers.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-12 06:57:01.168837

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a restraining order from a judge that had restricted immigration agents from stopping people around L.A. solely based on their race, language, job or location. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was quick to criticize the decision and argued it could lead to officials targeting “anyone who looks Latino.”

When The View panelist Sara Haines asked Ferrera her reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision, the Barbie actress responded, “First of all, thank God for Justice Sotomayor.”

Ferrera, who is an activist for immigration rights, went on to say she was grateful for “people who still speak with a voice of reason and the values we recognize as American values” amid the decision.

“As an American, I’m angered and terrified to watch our constitutional rights be eroded by the Supreme Court. Everyone should be angered and terrified by it,” she said. “If any American can get pulled over because of the language they speak or the color of their skin or because they work in a low-wage job, who’s safe? So, as an American, I’m pissed off.”

She also spoke about being “a daughter of immigrants who grew up in California.”

She said that the family often had “conversations about immigration,” though they weren’t “close to what we’re living in now.” Ferrera continued, “I remember what it felt like to be a child in elementary school, going to school hearing whisperings and not knowing what that meant.”

“What I know right now is there are children that are terrified. There are children that are terrified, there are families that are terrified of their lives being destroyed in a moment,” Ferrera said. “I think about them, and I think we all have an opportunity to remember who we are and what we believe and what our values are and what we care about and to recognize that there are people suffering and that we all have the capacity to be human and to reach out and to care for each other.”

Ferrera opened up about the topic just two days after Sotomayor appeared on the Tuesday episode of The View. During her appearance, panelist Sunny Hostin asked Sotomayor about her recent dissents, including the one in the court’s immigration stops ruling earlier this week, and what she thought Americans should take away from what she wrote.

“Read the decisions, and not just my dissents, but the other side, too. Become informed citizens and not just reactive, because people will say things that are simply not there, or say things and misconstrue them,” Sotomayor urged the public. “The price we pay is whatever is happening today, as I indicated it’s going to affect a lot of people, but it affects your future and it affects the conduct of leaders in the future, because what we permit today is not going to be duplicated exactly tomorrow, it’s going to be something different.”",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-19088688002.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1,N,,2025-09-12 04:56:43.697841

“There is no rule saying that just because you work with federal government, you’re exempt from all state law,” Mr. Wiener said.
The California State Senate passed the bill on Thursday, two days after the State Assembly approved the legislation.

That bill was less controversial, and while some law enforcement agencies opposed it, the legislation received support from the major association representing local police officers in California.","California state lawmakers passed a bill on Thursday that would bar most law enforcement officers from covering their faces while interacting with the public, a direct response to immigration raids by masked agents who have been difficult to identify.

California’s Legislature is believed to be the first to pass such a bill, though similar proposals have been introduced in other states and Congress.

The legislation now goes to Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose support is not certain. The legislation, passed by Democratic lawmakers who control both houses of the State Legislature, would apply to local and federal agencies, and questions have been raised about whether the state has the legal ability to regulate federal agents.

“We’re looking at the constitutionality of it,” Mr. Newsom said in July in an interview with the Tennessee Holler, a liberal news site.

The Democratic governor explained at the time that he understood that officers may need masks to protect their safety in limited circumstances, but that he thought it was “insane” how widespread the practice had become.

Supporters of the bill said on Thursday that the ban was even more urgent in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this week that allowed federal agents to resume immigration stops based on factors including ethnicity and if someone is speaking Spanish.

“We are in a truly disaster of a situation where we have secret police, effectively, on our streets,” said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who wrote the bill.

“It’s tearing apart the fabric of society,” he added. “You have communities in Southern California where people are scared to go out on the street, they’re scared to go to work, they’re scared to bring their kids to school. And now is the time for us to say what the rules are.”

Mr. Wiener’s legislation would bar officers from wearing face coverings that shield their identities, such as the ski masks, balaclavas and neck gaiters that have become common in recent months during President Trump’s immigration crackdown. It does not apply to medical masks, clear plastic face shields, respirators, eye protection or other safety devices.

The bill would take effect in January if signed by Mr. Newsom. The governor has until Oct. 12 to act on the legislation.

Numerous lawmakers described fear and anxiety in California’s many Latino communities. Sasha Renée Pérez, a Democratic state senator from the Los Angeles area, said that one of her constituents was so afraid of immigration agents that he ran onto a freeway and died. She said that her own family members have begun carrying their passports at all times.

“That’s a very strange reality,” Ms. Pérez said.

Opponents of the California bill, including numerous law enforcement agencies, argued that officers must have the choice to cover their faces to protect themselves and their families from retaliation. Limiting the ways officers can keep themselves safe will make it harder to recruit people to work in law enforcement, they said.

“Bad guys wear masks because they don’t want to get caught. Good guys wear masks because they don’t want to get killed,” said Kelly Seyarto, a Republican state senator from Riverside County. “It’s that simple.”

He also argued that the state doesn’t have the power to regulate federal agencies, so that part of the bill is likely to be thrown out in court, and that the bill would wind up creating new civil liability for local officers because of how it would be enforced.

Mr. Wiener pointed to an opinion from the legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, who argued that the policy is constitutional because it does not only apply to federal agencies. State and local governments can require that federal agencies comply with general laws, Mr. Chemerinsky wrote, such as speed limits and restrictions on the use of force.

“There is no rule saying that just because you work with federal government, you’re exempt from all state law,” Mr. Wiener said.

The California State Senate passed the bill on Thursday, two days after the State Assembly approved the legislation.

Similar bills have been introduced in other states — including New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Michigan — but have not yet passed.

California lawmakers also passed a companion bill on Thursday that would require local, state and federal agents to wear identifying information such as their name or badge number. That bill was less controversial, and while some law enforcement agencies opposed it, the legislation received support from the major association representing local police officers in California.

While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees.","McCOOK, Neb. — Frustrated by a dearth of information coming her way, a Nebraska lawmaker showed up unannounced this week at the state prison system’s Work Ethic Camp more than four hours from her home district.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha has been an outspoken critic of Gov. Jim Pillen’s plan to repurpose the state prison in McCook into an ICE detention center, which he announced Aug. 19. The planned prison conversion in this rural community of about 7,200 residents came at the State of Nebraska’s request in response to the Trump administration’s deportation push.

Upon her arrival Wednesday, Juarez was provided a guided tour, which the Examiner was not allowed to join. Afterward, she said she was impressed with the grounds and the prison property’s current use: preparing low-risk inmates with programming to ease their reentry into society.

However, she shared concerns. Among them: worries about crowded conditions — both for a future migrant population and for the broader state prison system that will likely absorb the 186 Nebraska inmates being relocated to other prison facilities from a rehabilitative setting in southwest Nebraska.

“There is no way that I believe 300 people could be housed in that McCook facility,” she said, noting that an area of the prison currently used for teaching appeared to be one of the likeliest spaces for expanding bed space. “I can just see them squeezing these double bunk beds into these rooms.”

Midwest hub for ICE

Pillen has said up to 300 migrants awaiting deportation are to be housed in the repurposed center, which the state will run in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The governor has said he envisions the facility as a Midwestern hub for ICE.

As of Thursday, the Work Ethic Camp had 155 of its 186 state inmates left to relocate. State senators have said the McCook facility, which opened in 2001, was originally designed for 100.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said the state anticipates that the McCook facility will begin housing its new population of migrant federal detainees in October.

After talking with current Work Ethic Camp inmates about their circumstances, Juarez said she wants the state to consider early release rather than relocation for incarcerated people within a year of completing their criminal sentences.

“To me this circumstance is so unique,” Juarez said. “I’m advocating for as many people to be released as possible. If there are men there that are ready to be let go, I think they should be able to go home.”

Juarez discussed her interaction with one McCook inmate, who told her he had six months until his scheduled release and had earned a spot helping in the prison’s kitchen, where he said he was picking up cooking skills. He told her he was anxious that he could be transferred to a facility with fewer privileges.

Said Juarez: “What kind of setback are these guys going to be enduring when they get moved?”

A prison system spokesperson, in response, said the department does not have the authority to release individuals early. (That’s up to the Parole Board.)

Spokesperson Dayne Urbanovsky said all Correctional Services facilities have a “robust offering” of rehabilitative services.

“As much as possible, NDCS will work to ensure individuals who have started programs at WEC can finish those at other facilities,” she said in a written response.

Furthermore, Correctional Services is partnering with an engineering firm to “safely repurpose (McCook’s) multi-purpose spaces to accommodate additional beds,” Urbanovsky said.

Closed-door briefing

Juarez is not the only state senator to have recently visited the McCook facility. Two members of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, State Sens. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln and Wendy DeBoer of Bennington, stopped in earlier this month.

A day after their visit, the Judiciary Committee held a closed-door meeting with certain state officials. The briefing about the conversion plan was organized by Pillen’s Office and Bosn.

DeBoer, a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, did not sign a letter from 13 progressive state senators , including Juarez, requesting a public hearing about the McCook project before the Judiciary Committee.

Unanswered questions remain about Nebraska-ICE jail after private legislative briefing

After Bosn said the request for such a meeting was premature, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who also signed the letter, announced that the legislative committee he chairs, the Urban Affairs Committee, would hold a public hearing Friday for people to air opinions. That meeting begins at 9 a.m. in room 1507 of the State Capitol.

The Urban Affairs Committee oversees building codes issues, and McKinney said he is concerned about overcrowding.

In a letter Thursday, Kenny Zoeller, Pillen’s director of policy research, told McKinney that the administration would not participate in Friday’s hearing. He wrote that the Urban Affairs Committee lacks legal jurisdiction and oversight authority on the matter.

Zoeller also challenged McKinney’s assertion about prison crowding, writing that the state law cited by the lawmaker does not apply.

“An emergency declaration is only required when the department’s system-wide inmate population is over 140% of operational capacity,” Zoeller wrote. “The current average daily population for all NDCS facilities is approximately 115% of system-wide operational capacity.”

Zoeller said the Pillen administration believes it has taken the appropriate action in informing Judiciary Committee members of its plan.

Juarez, a Democrat in her first year as a state lawmaker for South Omaha, said she’s felt frustrated and still wants more details about the McCook-ICE project. She said her visit to the facility better prepares her for future conversations.

“The only reason that I found out as much as I did was because I physically went down there,” she said.

Juarez said it was her understanding that state law, in addition to giving Nebraska state senators access to prisons without prior notice, allows lawmakers to take phones inside to take photographs and videos. She said she was asked to leave hers in a locker.

While her goal is to squash the use of a state prison as a federal immigration detention center, she said she also learned how she might help future migrant detainees. For example, she said Work Ethic Camp staff pointed out the current library book selection is written in English.

Juarez said she could assist in gathering reading material in different languages. She said she also wants to know if the proposed ICE detention center would continue to offer, as do state prisons, mental and other health care services.

No signed agreement yet

State officials have acknowledged that many details about the facility have yet to be ironed out. As of Thursday, there still was no signed agreement between ICE and Nebraska’s Department of Correctional Services for the detention center federal officials nicknamed “the Cornhusker Clink.”

Among lawmaker questions is whether the executive branch, Pillen’s administration, has authority to let the feds use the state prison facility. Since 1875, the Nebraska Constitution has given the Legislature exclusive authority in the oversight of “general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental reformatory and penal institutions.”

Pillen, however, has cited an article in the Nebraska Constitution saying that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.” He also argues state statute gives him authority through its creation of the Department of Correctional Services.

What’s in a name? Fed moniker for Nebraska immigration jail draws ire and defense

From the start, Pillen has said he felt a responsibility to support the president’s immigration agenda and wanted Nebraska to do its “fair share.” He has said that he and other Republican governors have heard President Donald Trump’s call to “step up” — and that he was proud to also empower the state’s Nebraska National Guard and Nebraska State Patrol to become a part of Trump’s mass deportation mission.

Many Republican state senators in the officially nonpartisan Legislature also have expressed support for the governor’s position on immigration.

A University of Nebraska-Lincoln law professor who studies the impact of detention said the project offers “spectacle, not safety or stability.” Danielle Jefferis, in an opinion piece Thursday in the Nebraska Examiner, said the Nebraska prison system has traditionally argued that “rehabilitation matters” but that the state is all but eliminating a rehabilitative facility and replacing it with detention beds.

“That choice is not only about corrections policy,” she wrote. “It is about what Nebraska’s leaders value, how the state defines itself and how much control it is willing to cede to the whims of Washington.”

Skeptical of future

In an interview with the Examiner Wednesday outside of the Work Ethic Camp, Juarez said she was less anxious about what might be ahead for ICE detainees after she saw the prison’s grounds, including an outdoor recreational courtyard.

“I felt a little more calm than I had anticipated once I was inside,” she said.

But she said she was unclear and remained skeptical about how operations might change under an ICE contract and said her visit would be the first of more. Her underlying feeling, she said, is that migrants working in the U.S. without a criminal or violent past shouldn’t be held behind bars.

After her tour of the work camp, Juarez dropped off some “We are Friends of Immigrants” signs to local residents who had requested them from an Omaha group that has protested the ICE facility. Juarez told McCook residents that she planned to continue to monitor the changes.

“I’ll be coming back,” she said.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_3755-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 22:56:41.183374

The government singled out an email from Mr. Mandelson to Mr. Epstein in 2008, in which Mr. Mandelson lamented Mr. Epstein’s conviction for soliciting sex from a minor and gave him advice about his legal troubles.
In the book, he called Mr. Epstein his “best pal,” and added a photo of himself clad in a white bathrobe, laughing with Mr. Epstein.
When Mr. Trump announced the outlines of a trade deal with Britain in May, Mr. Mandelson stood behind him in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump spoke by phone to Mr. Starmer.
In the late afternoon, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation lowering the flags to half-staff in Mr. Kirk’s honor through Sunday.","“These conditions have nothing to do with homelessness,” said Ann Oliva, chief executive of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, one of the organizations that filed the suit. “It’s carrying out a political agenda in a program that should never be partisan.”

The suit contends that the conditions violate the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to dictate spending, and conflict with grant-making rules. The housing department did not respond to a request for comment.

King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, filed a similar lawsuit this year when the administration attached conditions to homelessness funds that had already been awarded, including compliance with Mr. Trump’s executive orders on abortion and transgender rights. A federal judge in May temporarily blocked the federal government from enforcing those demands.

Beyond escalating the administration’s maximalist tactics, the latest rule revision underscores the slow pace of federal aid, despite levels of homelessness often deemed an emergency. Though Congress approved $75 million to build supportive housing in 2023 (and added $100 million the next year), none has been awarded, much less spent.

The administration of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ran a competition for the homelessness grants through HUD that concluded in late 2024 but announced no winners before Mr. Biden left office. The Trump administration ran the competition again and notified members of Congress of the winners in August, but it never publicly announced the awards. Last Friday, the administration started a new competition, with applications due in a week because the money expires at the end of the month.

The new, last-minute application reorients the program, called CoC Builds, to help seniors and the disabled and imposes a set of ideological screens, some of which are beyond applicants’ control. It disqualifies groups located in any city, county or state that fails to enforce homeless-encampment bans or cooperate with federal enforcement of immigration laws.

In addition, it penalizes programs that operate clean needle programs for drug users, that are based in places that do not map sex offenders or that “promote the notion that sex is a mutable or chosen characteristic.”

While it is not clear how HUD will judge compliance, an analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates that programs in only nine states, all Republican strongholds, are likely to fully meet the conditions.

The second plaintiff in the suit, the Women’s Development Corporation in Providence, R.I., was among the groups that thought they had won the first competition run by the Trump administration. Last month, the group received a congratulatory call from the office of Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, saying it would receive $7 million from HUD to build 14 new apartments and provide services for the homeless.

Mr. Reed’s office was so confident in HUD’s notification of the funding that it issued a news release. But the official HUD announcement never came, and a new competition was announced.

Frank T. Shea, the group’s executive director, said the new conditions would prevent it from reapplying because Providence lacks an encampment ban and Rhode Island is at odds with the administration on immigration enforcement. In addition, he said, the group would be penalized for having transgender people on its staff.

“None of these factors are relevant to whether this would be a good project, and some we have no control over,” he said.

Internal State Department and U.S.A.I.D. documents and correspondence obtained by The New York Times show that several international organizations, including the Gates Foundation and the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, had offered to buy or accept a donation of the contraceptives. The government would have incurred no costs or might have even been able to recoup taxpayer funds under those scenarios.

Instead the administration decided to proceed with destroying the products, an operation that was estimated to cost $167,000.

On Thursday, a spokeswoman for U.S.A.I.D. — which is now being wound down by Russell Vought, the head of the White House Office of Management and Budget — said in a statement to The Times that the contraceptives had been destroyed, and falsely suggested that they induced abortion.

“President Trump is committed to protecting the lives of unborn children all around the world,” the statement said. “The administration will no longer supply abortifacient birth control under the guise of foreign aid.”

U.S.A.I.D. is prohibited by law from procuring abortifacients. None of the products held in the warehouse in Belgium were abortifacients, according to inventory lists obtained by The Times. The listed products, such as hormonal implants, stop pregnancy by preventing ovulation or fertilization.

This fact had repeatedly been made clear to State Department officials by veteran global health program staff, the documents show.

It is not clear exactly when or where the destruction took place, and administration officials did not respond to requests for further comment.

“The deliberate destruction of nearly $10 million worth of contraceptives, under the blatantly false pretense that they are abortifacients, is an outrageous act of cruelty,” said Beth Schlachter, director of U.S. external relations for MSI Reproductive Choices, an organization that had repeatedly offered to take over the distribution of the supplies rather than see them destroyed.

“This decision will cost lives, derail progress in global health and strip millions of people of the basic tools they need to plan their families and protect their health,” she said.

In early February, Secretary of State Marco Rubio took over U.S.A.I.D., which was established in the 1960s as a separate agency under Congressional mandate, and began overseeing its closure, a goal sought by several top Trump aides. The few foreign aid contracts that officials kept were moved into the State Department. Employees of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the group formed by Elon Musk, were sent to lead the process.

The destruction of the contraceptives was ordered in June by Jeremy Lewin, the State Department’s senior official in charge of foreign assistance, humanitarian affairs and religious freedom. In an email, he directed department employees to arrange destruction of the contraceptives as “the cheapest option that best reflects the administration’s significant concerns with funding these activities.”

But for a time, it seemed as though the American government was not following through on the plan.

The Belgian government staged a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to prevent the contraceptives from being incinerated at a medical waste facility. The foreign minister, Maxime Prévot, wrote to Mr. Rubio to try to prevent it, according to a Belgian foreign ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the diplomatic matter.

More recently, authorities in Flanders, the region where the warehouse is, had been trying to invoke a legal ban on incinerating still-usable medical products to prevent the destruction.

Those overtures seemed at least to delay the planned incineration. The stockpile did not appear to have been burned by the end of July, as earlier reports had suggested that it would be.

On July 31, Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman, said at a news conference that the agency was in the process “of determining the way forward.”

As recently as this week, Flemish authorities had not learned of the destruction and remained hopeful that they might reach a solution.

“We did not receive a formal derogation request to allow incineration,” Tom Demeyer, a spokesman for the Flemish environment and agriculture minister, said in an email on Thursday. “We are waiting for the outcome of the legal and technical analysis to see which channels for reuse are viable.”

Belgian authorities had hoped that they might be able to help facilitate a sale of the products, given ample interest from potential buyers. Belgian and Flemish authorities did not immediately comment on the news that the Trump administration had proceeded with the incineration of the birth control supplies.

U.S.A.I.D. employees had informed the administration that seven different organizations were willing to take charge of some or all of the products, and to cover the costs of storing, shipping and distributing them.

A draft memo prepared by veteran U.S.A.I.D. staff members who had worked on family planning programs through multiple administrations recommended that Mr. Lewin sell the products to the United Nations Population Fund because it would recoup at least $7 million and incur no further cost to taxpayers. The other options presented including selling to other organizations or donating the products.

Using the acronym USG for U.S. government, that memo noted that the cost of destruction “is estimated to be a loss of $9.9 M in USG funding,” and said that was “coupled with an estimated $167,000 in destruction costs.”

“Additional funding will likely have to be obligated to cover the destruction costs,” the memo said.

However, political appointees at U.S.A.I.D. instead presented a different memo recommending that the materials be destroyed “due to the absence of eligible buyers” and to avoid contravening an administration directive “halting support to organizations involved in coercive reproductive practices.”

Fourteen minutes after receiving that memo, Mr. Lewin ordered the destruction.

Former U.S.A.I.D. staff members who had moved to a new global health division at the State Department swiftly set about organizing the destruction. Clint Branam, U.S.A.I.D.’s deputy chief of staff for programs, wrote to his colleagues, “I understand this likely wasn’t the outcome you’d hoped for and it’s contentious, but Jeremy said it best reflects the administration’s significant concerns with funding these activities.”

In the list of potential arguments against a sale, officials invoked policies preventing the U.S. government from providing aid to overseas nongovernmental organizations that provide or help with access to abortions, based on a rule that the Trump administration reinstated. U.S.A.I.D. staff members offered solutions to donate the supply that they argued did not conflict with this policy.

At other points, the documents show that government staff members worried that a sale “could appear to be in conflict with administration priorities and attract external scrutiny.” Mr. Rubio transferred the remnants of U.S.A.I.D. from the State Department to Mr. Vought in August so Mr. Vought could oversee the final shutdown of the aid agency.

The State Department referred questions to U.S.A.I.D. on Thursday.

In this case, Republicans resorted to the move in an effort to steer around Democratic obstruction of Mr. Trump’s nominees, which has created a backlog of more than 100, angering the president and frustrating his allies in Congress. They framed it as a necessary step to grease the wheels of a chamber mired in partisan rancor and to return the Senate to its longstanding norm of confirming lower-level nominees without individual votes.

“For two centuries, most presidential nominees have sailed through this chamber by voice vote and by unanimous consent,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Republican. “That was the gold standard of advice and consent. Senator Schumer and Senate Democrats abandoned it.”

Democrats, vocally opposed to Mr. Trump’s policies and tactics, have demanded that every position be subject to individual consideration, delaying the approval of the president’s nominees and cluttering the Senate schedule. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said the change would do irreparable damage to the Senate and its constitutional prerogatives, rendering it “a conveyor belt for unqualified Trump nominees.”

“We are supposed to debate and take votes on nominees, especially when the executive branch is grossly breaking norms by sending us woefully unqualified, unscrupulous, and in some cases deeply dishonest individuals for powerful and important positions,” he said.

The rule change, which is expected to be finalized next week after a series of procedural votes, will allow the Senate to confirm an unlimited number of lower-level executive branch nominations at a time without the threat of a filibuster. That means Republicans will no longer be forced to negotiate with Democrats to agree on which nominees are deserving of speedy confirmation, as the majority currently must do, but will instead be able to steer around any opposition and push through dozens with a single vote.

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, began the process on Monday by introducing 48 of Mr. Trump’s nominees together to allow them to be confirmed as a group.

That bloc covers a variety of positions, such as assistant secretaries in several cabinet departments, the inspector general at the C.I.A. and ambassadors, including Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former fiancée of Mr. Trump’s eldest son whom the president chose to be the ambassador to Greece.

The breadth of the list illustrates the far-reaching consequences of the rules change. Previously, senators needed 60 votes to bring a bloc of nominations to the floor, all but guaranteeing that both parties would haggle over who might be included.

Now, the party in power will have the ability to unilaterally approve dozens of executive branch nominees with little resistance. And while nominees must still win approval from Senate committees, there will be even less incentive for presidents to choose people who can draw bipartisan support, since members of the minority party will be presented with even fewer opportunities to delay or block anyone’s confirmation.

Republicans, who currently hold 53 seats in the Senate, pushed through the rules change on a 53-to-45 vote, turning to a tactic known as the “nuclear option” to set a new precedent that overrules what has been done in the past.

The dramatic name refers both to the extreme nature of the move and its assurance of mutual destruction: Republicans and Democrats alike must suffer the consequences when they find themselves in the minority.

It was once seen as so devastating to the Senate’s spirit of bipartisan compromise that leaders often threatened it but rarely followed through.

There were signs on Thursday that such concerns remained alive on Capitol Hill. Even after the Senate began voting on Mr. Thune’s initial step to begin the rule change, a bipartisan group of senators continued to haggle over an agreement to avoid the nuclear option, holding open the vote for much of the afternoon while they engaged in frenzied talks.

Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said he believed there was a “considerable, good-faith desire to come to a rules change that is bipartisan and agreeable to most all of us.” He urged senators to cooperate to prove they could turn down the political temperature in the wake of the shooting death of the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk.

The proposal that senators were discussing would have capped the number of nominations that could be grouped together at 15. But those negotiating the deal would have needed the consent of all 100 senators to move forward, and while Democrats sought to work into the weekend to persuade their colleagues, Republicans were skeptical that a deal could be reached and instead moved ahead unilaterally.

“We were achingly close to a deal,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said on the Senate floor. “But I am afraid that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have run out of patience.”

But Mr. Thune, visibly frustrated, argued that Democrats had had months to come up with a deal to end their roadblock on nominees. “How much time is enough?” he said, addressing Mr. Schatz.

Currently, more than 1,000 executive branch positions require Senate confirmation. Traditionally, many picks below the cabinet level have been confirmed through voice votes or by unanimous consent, essentially an agreement by all senators to bypass debate. But senators in the minority retained the ability to block an individual nominee they found objectionable, slowing the process and allowing more time for the Senate to scrutinize them.

“We are steadily handing away most of the significant constitutional powers of the Senate,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. “That is very dangerous. What happened today with a narrow Republican majority to change the rules of the Senate and make it easier to confirm dozens and dozens of nominations just weakens our Constitution.”

Even with the rules change, some limits will remain. The new Senate precedent will not allow for group confirmations that include judicial appointments or high-profile jobs such as cabinet secretaries.

It does allow for group confirmations of federal prosecutors, at a time when Mr. Trump has pushed to install loyalists and erase the Justice Department’s independence from the White House.

Currently, another longstanding Senate tradition, the “blue slip,” allows home-state senators to essentially veto nominees for U.S. attorney in their home states. But Mr. Trump has demanded that Republicans abandon that custom, raising fears that it, too, could vanish in the face of a highly polarized political atmosphere.

That increased partisanship has seized the Senate, prompting party leaders to make rules changes that were once viewed as beyond the pale.

In 2013, Democrats lowered the filibuster threshold on most nominees to a simple majority, out of mounting frustration that Republicans were blocking Obama administration appointees to an influential court.

Four years later, Republicans retaliated by lowering the threshold for Supreme Court nominees. That move allowed Mr. Trump to put three justices on the bench during his first term.

In its motion, the Justice Department explicitly asked the judges to decide “by the close of business on Monday.” That is the day before the Fed’s voting members — including Ms. Cook — will begin a two-day meeting to determine whether to lower borrowing costs.

In a reply filed hours later, lawyers for Ms. Cook urged the court to reject that request, warning it plunge the Fed’s meeting “into turmoil” while carrying the “real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets.”

Mr. Trump has demanded for months that the Fed lower interest rates, but the central bank has kept them unchanged out of concern that the president’s policies could stoke inflation. At next week’s meeting, the Fed is widely expected to restart interest rate cuts that it paused at the beginning of the year, although officials are unlikely to approve a reduction as deep as Mr. Trump would prefer.

Interest rates at the Fed are set by the seven members of the Board of Governors, on which Ms. Cook serves, as well as a rotating set of five presidents from the regional reserve banks. The government is arguing that Ms. Cook should not be in attendance at that meeting.

The Fed, which is listed as a defendant in Ms. Cook’s lawsuit to block it from carrying out the president’s orders, has said it will abide by any court decision.

Mr. Trump announced he would fire Ms. Cook in late August, claiming that she had engaged in mortgage fraud, even though she has not been charged or convicted of a crime. Still, the president said that the allegations alone met the threshold to dismiss her for “cause” under the Fed’s founding statute.

A District Court judge disagreed, and issued a preliminary injunction on Tuesday blocking Mr. Trump from proceeding while the court considers the legality of the matter. In doing so, the judge, Jia Cobb, said that the law did not allow the president to fire Ms. Cook for alleged conduct that took place before the Senate confirmed her to the Fed in 2022.

Mr. Trump has spoken openly about his desire to remake the roster of the central bank with political loyalists who share his views on interest rates. This week, he gained an early victory in the Senate, where Republicans took the first steps toward confirming Stephen Miran, one of Mr. Trump’s top economic advisers, to fill an opening at the Fed created by the sudden departure of Adriana Kugler.

The expedited timeline could open the door for Mr. Miran to be confirmed in time for next week’s meeting.

“This testimony will help inform congressional efforts to ensure that our banking system has adequate safeguards against illicit activity,” the senators wrote in the letter.

Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, is the ranking member on the banking committee.

The request for a hearing comes after an article was published this week by The New York Times Magazine examining JPMorgan’s more than 10-year banking relationship with Mr. Epstein during a period when the disgraced financier was found to have sexually abused teenage girls. The report found that the bank had repeatedly disregarded red flags, including large cash withdrawals and other suspicious transactions, involving Mr. Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019, and his associates.

The letter to Mr. Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, noted that Deutsche Bank, which became Mr. Epstein’s main lender after JPMorgan severed ties with him in 2013, repeated many of the same errors.

“Testimony from JPMorgan and other institutions that processed Mr. Epstein’s transactions would provide valuable insight on where controls in the system failed,” the senators wrote. “The American people deserve to know what happened at JPMorgan and other banks that financed Mr. Epstein.”

Patricia Wexler, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, said in a statement, “We now know in hindsight that any association with him was a mistake and we regret it.” She added, “We would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was engaged in an ongoing sex trafficking operation.”

Ms. Wexler said the bank fired Mr. Epstein as a client six years before his arrest on federal charges, and suggested the bank could have terminated the relationship earlier if the federal government had gone public with “damning information” obtained in the investigation that led to Mr. Epstein’s 2008 plea deal on state charges.

In recent weeks, a growing number of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties have called for greater transparency with regard to records the federal government has on Mr. Epstein.

On Wednesday, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, introduced a bill aimed at compelling the Treasury Department to turn over copies of all suspicious activity reports filed by JPMorgan and other banks for thousands of transactions by Mr. Epstein, as well as dozens of his associates or business partners.

Also on Wednesday, Senate Republicans narrowly blocked an attempt by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files compiled by law enforcement agencies.

The revelations about Mr. Mandelson, and the fact that the government was caught off guard by them, are a stinging embarrassment to Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was already reeling from the resignation last week of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, after a tax imbroglio.

It casts a shadow over the planned state visit to Britain next week of President Trump, who has praised Mr. Mandelson and met with him at the White House this week. Mr. Trump’s ties to Mr. Epstein have also come under renewed scrutiny after the release of documents by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.

Mr. Trump has denied drawing and signing a lewd greeting to Mr. Epstein for his 50th birthday, brushing aside questions about his association with Mr. Epstein as a Democratic conspiracy. But the British government has taken the disclosures more seriously, making Mr. Mandelson one of the most prominent political casualties of the Epstein affair.

The government singled out an email from Mr. Mandelson to Mr. Epstein in 2008, in which Mr. Mandelson lamented Mr. Epstein’s conviction for soliciting sex from a minor and gave him advice about his legal troubles.

“I think the world of you and I feel hopeless and furious about what has happened,” Mr. Mandelson wrote in an email obtained by Bloomberg News. “I can still barely understand it. It just could not happen in Britain.”

Such an expression of solidarity, sent when it was clear that Mr. Epstein was going to serve a prison sentence, made Mr. Mandelson’s position untenable, the Foreign Office made clear in a terse one-paragraph statement.

“Peter Mandelson’s suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information,” the statement said. “In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein’s crimes, he has been withdrawn as ambassador with immediate effect.”

Mr. Starmer ordered Mr. Mandelson’s dismissal in a brief meeting with his foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, who took her post only last Friday after a cabinet shake-up. In her previous job as home secretary, she introduced measures to strengthen the response of the police to violence against women and girls.

Mr. Mandelson’s friendship with Mr. Epstein was no secret. Government officials insisted they had vetted him before announcing his appointment last December. But they were clearly blindsided by newly revealed emails, published by Bloomberg on Wednesday night, in which he stood by Mr. Epstein even after his first conviction of state prostitution crimes in Palm Beach, Fla.

Mr. Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex charges, in what was later ruled a suicide. Mr. Starmer had come under mounting pressure from opposition leaders and members of his own Labour Party to respond to the questions about Mr. Mandelson and share details of the government’s vetting.

The emails between Mr. Mandelson and Mr. Epstein were not available, either to the British officials vetting him or to Mr. Mandelson himself, because they came from an email account long since closed, a British official said on Thursday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the matter on the record.

Mr. Mandelson’s abrupt departure leaves vacant perhaps the most sensitive diplomatic post in the government. Among the names circulating as possible replacements is that of David Miliband, a former Labour foreign secretary.

Mr. Mandelson did not respond to a request for comment on his dismissal on Thursday. But he wrote in a message to The New York Times that Britain and the United States would announce a partnership on advanced technology next week, which he described as his “pride and joy” and his “legacy.”

He has long expressed regret in other interviews for his association with Mr. Epstein and voiced “profound” sympathy for his victims.

Speaking to Harry Cole, a journalist for The Sun tabloid, this week, Mr. Mandelson said it was “very embarrassing” to see his words published in a book of birthday greetings to Mr. Epstein. In the book, he called Mr. Epstein his “best pal,” and added a photo of himself clad in a white bathrobe, laughing with Mr. Epstein.

But Mr. Mandelson, 71, noted that the words were written “over 20 years ago.” He said he never witnessed wrongdoing while he was with Mr. Epstein, whom he visited at Mr. Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.

“I accepted assurances he had given me about his original indictment — the original criminal case in Florida,” Mr. Mandelson said to Mr. Cole. “Like very many people, I took at face value what he said.” He added, “I regret very much that I fell for his lies.”

When Mr. Starmer named Mr. Mandelson as his envoy to Mr. Trump’s Washington, political analysts said it was a bold choice but not without risk. Mr. Mandelson has had a long, checkered career in British politics. He helped craft the New Labour message that propelled Tony Blair into 10 Downing Street in 1997.

But Mr. Mandelson was forced to resign twice from the cabinet, once for failing to disclose a home loan he had taken, and a second time after allegations that he had tried to influence a passport application. (An official inquiry later cleared him of acting improperly over the passport dispute.)

His appointment as ambassador initially drew fierce criticism from allies of Mr. Trump. They pointed to statements he made during the president’s first term when he derided him as a “white nationalist” and a “danger to the world.” Mr. Mandelson apologized for the statements in an interview with Fox News.

He has since revised his characterization, positioning himself as one of the more sympathetic interpreters of Mr. Trump for a skeptical European audience.

“The president may not follow the traditional rulebook or conventional practice,” he said in a lecture last week at the Ditchley Foundation, outside London. “But he is a risk taker in a world where a ‘business as usual’ approach no longer works. Indeed, he seems to have an ironclad stomach for political risk, both at home and abroad.”

Mr. Mandelson made quick inroads after arriving in Washington. He became a fixture in social circles and a regular visitor to the White House. When Mr. Trump announced the outlines of a trade deal with Britain in May, Mr. Mandelson stood behind him in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump spoke by phone to Mr. Starmer.

After Mr. Trump invited him to say a few words, the president told him, “What a beautiful accent.”

Stephen Castle contributed reporting.

Charlie Kirk, the conservative influencer and close Trump ally, had been shot while speaking at a Utah college campus. They briefed the president on the initial reports about Mr. Kirk, who had been struck in the neck.

In the hour that followed, the apparently shocked president asked for updates and took calls from a few reporters on his cellphone. Mr. Kirk, the president said, was a terrific man.

He was already speaking of Mr. Kirk in the past tense.

By then, Mr. Trump and White House aides knew that Mr. Kirk had not survived the shooting, according to two people familiar with the situation. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Mr. Kirk’s death would be confirmed publicly a short time later.

Mr. Trump had a close relationship with Mr. Kirk, whose ability to galvanize young conservatives with his criticisms of the left had been crucial to rallying support among a new generation of voters. Mr. Kirk was also close friends with several people in the president’s orbit, including his eldest son, Donald Jr.

But by Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump’s shock had turned to fury. In a video address from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump declared it a “dark moment for America” and faulted the media and the “radical left” for language used to describe people like Mr. Kirk.

“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” said Mr. Trump, who one day earlier had been face-to-face with protesters in Washington who called him Hitler. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.”

The fact that Mr. Trump faced two assassination attempts in 2024 — one of them a near miss at a rally in Butler, Pa. — is never far from the minds of his team, and Mr. Trump referenced the Butler shooting in his video. A handmade portrait hanging in the White House shows Mr. Trump being lifted to his feet on the rally stage in Butler, blood streaming from his ear as he pumped his fist.

Earlier at the White House, the corridors of the press offices — an area where reporters are able to move with relative ease — were quiet, as staff there absorbed news about a man many of them were either close with or admired.

Televisions affixed to walls in different rooms blared minute-to-minute coverage of Mr. Kirk’s shooting and then his death, as well as the ongoing search for the killer. Some staff members appeared to have been crying.

In the late afternoon, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation lowering the flags to half-staff in Mr. Kirk’s honor through Sunday. At around 5:30 p.m., a worker in black pants and a black shirt walked to the giant flagpole that Mr. Trump had installed on the North Lawn and cranked the flag down; he repeated the same move with the flag on top of the White House minutes later.

The president was still on track for a visit to New York on the anniversary of the last significant event to unite nearly all Americans across parties: the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Though it failed, Mr. Schumer’s proposal brought the contentious debate over the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, which has roiled the House, to the chamber that has largely avoided it.

Republicans in both bodies have sought to avoid a politically precarious vote on the Epstein files. President Trump has dismissed concerns over the Epstein files as a “Democratic hoax” and urged his right-wing supporters to move on, but his administration’s handling of the issue has inflamed many in the right-wing base.

Though lawmakers hoped the issue would die down over their August recess, it was revived this week when a key House committee released a note and sexually suggestive drawing addressed to Mr. Epstein that contained what appeared to be Mr. Trump’s signature.

Mr. Schumer proposed his Epstein measure as an amendment to an annual defense policy bill and then, using a maneuver available to him as the minority leader, teed up a procedural vote.

“If Republicans vote no, you’ll be saying to the American people that they should not see the Epstein files,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor on Wednesday. “I ask my Republican colleagues: After all those years you spent calling for accountability, for transparency, for getting to the bottom of these awful crimes, why won’t you vote yes?”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, told reporters that Mr. Schumer’s measure was a “stunt” and promised to dispense with it. The Senate voted 51 to 49 to table it.

Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said she opposed Mr. Schumer’s measure because a similar amendment had been adopted on a spending bill that would fund the Justice Department. That bill has not yet been passed by the Senate, but Ms. Collins said it was a more appropriate vehicle for a measure on the Epstein files.

“It does not belong on the Department of Defense policy bill,” she said.

Mr. Schumer was not the first Democrat to try to force the Epstein issue through the Senate. But other efforts, including two from Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona and one from Jeff Merkley of Oregon, used different procedures that allowed them to be defeated without Republicans recording votes.

Mr. Schumer’s proposal was similar to a bipartisan resolution introduced in the House by Representatives Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Ro Khanna of California. The pair appear within weeks of being able to force a vote on their measure on the House floor, a move that would require the signatures of 218 House members on what is known as a discharge petition.

Their effort got a boost on Wednesday night, when Representative James Walkinshaw, Democrat of Virginia, was sworn in after winning a special election. Mr. Walkinshaw has vowed to sign the petition, which would bring the number of signatories to 217.

“Given the large amount of sensitive data under S.S.A.’s control, I consider the protection and security” of the information “to be a matter of first importance,” Mr. Crapo wrote.

The letter signaled that Republicans were examining the allegations made by Mr. Borges. He sat down last week with Republican and Democratic staff members of the Finance Committee, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private session.

In his whistle-blower complaint, Mr. Borges said that members of the Department of Government Efficiency had uploaded a copy of a crucial Social Security database to a vulnerable cloud server. The database contained records of all Social Security numbers issued by the federal government, in addition to names, addresses and other details that could be used to steal identities.

Mr. Borges said that DOGE had bypassed the “independent security monitoring” normally required under agency policy for such sensitive data, putting it at risk of being leaked or hacked.

Mr. Crapo’s letter was addressed to Frank Bisignano, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration. It asked him for information about how the agency had responded to Mr. Borges’s concerns, and whether it had followed normal risk-assessment protocols in allowing DOGE to copy the data to the server. The agency was asked to respond by Sept. 23.

Andrea Meza, an attorney at the Government Accountability Project, a whistle-blower group representing Mr. Borges, said in a statement that she welcomed Mr. Crapo’s letter as an “initial step.”

But she said it did not go far enough in seeking answers about the specifics of Mr. Borges’s complaint. She pointed out that Mr. Crapo was not seeking documents from the agency.

“Later this week, we will provide Congress with a recommended list of records to request that would offer far more insight than any self-assessment by the agency accused of wrongdoing,” Ms. Meza said. “If everything was proper, those documents reviewed by an independent investigator will show it.”

Mr. Borges’s complaint, which was first reported by The New York Times, did not indicate that the server set up by DOGE had been breached. A Social Security Administration spokesman said that the agency was not “aware of any compromise” to the database and that it was “dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data.”

Mr. Borges resigned three days after submitting his complaint, saying the agency had made it “impossible” for him to perform his duties “legally and ethically.”

Democrats on the Finance Committee this week called for Mr. Crapo to hold a hearing about Mr. Borges’s allegations and the broader state of Social Security. The agency was thrown into turmoil by Elon Musk, then the leader of DOGE, and his team of young software engineers, who advanced false claims of widespread fraud as they sought extraordinary power over closely guarded data.

Taylor Harvey, a spokesman for the Democratic members of the committee, said Mr. Crapo had not yet responded to their request for a hearing.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.
Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life.
The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump’s aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services – a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.
“It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,” she said.","The dreams of immigrants are “just collapsing,” Bishop Evelio Menjivar said before joining a panel of Catholic activists critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policy.

Menjivar, a Washington auxiliary bishop who himself is an immigrant, said immigrants’ imploding dreams are because of instability caused by President Donald Trump's pervasive threat of deportation.

The government's immigration policy is among the biggest pastoral challenges in trying to attend to the needs of Catholics, the bishop said.

Speaking to journalists at Georgetown University on Sept. 11, Menjivar said most immigrants to the United States left their home countries because of political or economic instability — just as he did. Menjivar came to the United States as a young adult to escape civil war in El Salvador.

Menjivar was one of the immigration specialists and Catholic leaders participating in a panel held by Georgetown’s Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life. The legal and Catholic social teaching specialists noted that Trump’s aggressive pursuit of immigrants near churches and schools was frightening migrants away from religious services – a form of breach of religious liberty that the administration purports to champion.

The Washington bishop said he sees fear in the eyes of fellow immigrants and that it plays out in ways such as children not being sent to school, or not allowed to participate in after-school activities. They are opting out of school and activities because their parents “don’t want to risk” their possible exposure to immigration enforcement, Menjivar said.

Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski has spent time ministering at Alligator Alcatraz, the hastily assembled detention center in Florida that housed immigrants in conditions decried as unsafe and unsanitary as well as for environmental concerns.

In August, a federal District Court judge ordered the administration to wind down operations there by the end of October. On September 4, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals put that ruling on hold, pending the administration’s appeal.

Wenski said the Trump administration’s approach is “to paint all immigrants as lawbreakers. But the reality is the law is breaking them. The law is inadequate to meet the needs of the nation. The law is antiquated, the law is ineffective and because of the ineffectiveness we have people living in this country for 20 years, 30 years, many with a legal work permit.”

Many have started businesses and become established. Now they are being told to go “home,” Wenski said.

Wenski and Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso, Texas, who chairs the Migration Committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also spoke to reporters about the challenge of trying to explain Catholic teaching about immigration and human rights in ways that are heard by the people in the pews.

Nichole Flores, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia, said

it is “important to know the prevalence of misinformation about Catholic teachings. There is really straightforward Catholic teaching on this matter and it is misconstrued, bent and folded in lots of ways that are convenient for various political interests.”

Seitz said one way to persuade the Trump administration on inconsistencies on immigration might be through the topic of religious liberty.

“It is interesting, since the administration has put a large amount of emphasis on all kinds of rights including religious liberty, that we find ourselves in this conflict,” the El Paso bishop said. “We’re happy for the opportunity to dialogue on these issues and to point out where we see inconsistencies that are damaging.”

Ashley Feasley, who is in residence at the Immigration Law and Policy Initiative at the Columbus School of Law at the Catholic University of America, pointed to what has been known as the “sensitive locations” policy started during the Obama administration and kept during the first Trump administration.

“It allows for, absent exigent circumstances, you cannot do immigration enforcement at schools, hospitals, places of religious worship,” she said. “Within the first few days of the [second] Trump administration they rescinded the policy and put forth a policy that is much less clear.”

Feasley said, “many bishops have spoken nationally about their concern about the ability for immigrants and refugees to receive the sacraments, to come to church.

Feasley noted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection officers have pursued migrants into church grounds. Bishops have reported that immigrants are afraid to go to church.

“This is an area where, if the Trump administration is talking about religious liberty, that would go a long way to talk to the bishops about what is this policy, what can be done, particularly as it relates to houses of worship and peoples’ ability to go about their daily lives and attend to the sacraments,” Feasley said.

“Particularly in this time,” she said, “our ability to be with our church and our faith is just so crucial. I think there are decision makers who would understand this.”",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/IMG_0378.JPG?h=71976bb4&itok=a4m3TcDh,N,,2025-09-11 21:56:57.200772

The offer marks a turnaround from the raid last week, when Trump urged foreign companies to ""please respect our nation’s immigration laws"" and ""hire and train American workers.""

FORMER DHS OFFICIAL HAILS ICE RAID ON GEORGIA EV PLANT AS 'GREAT DETERRENT' AGAINST HIRING ILLEGALS

Some 300 South Koreans were arrested last week along with 150 others at a Georgia construction site for a $4.3 billion Hyundai and LG Energy Solution factory to build car batteries.

The raid was touted by Trump administration immigration authorities but came at a delicate time in the relationship between the U.S. and its ally South Korea. The two nations are engaged in trade negotiations, and Trump has been encouraging South Korea to build plants in the U.S.

Lee said South Korean businesses operating in the U.S. were in a ""serious state of confusion.""

South Korean companies have said for years that they’ve struggled to obtain short-term work visas for their specialists and had come to rely on a lax interpretation of the immigration law that previous administrations had allowed for them.

After the raid, Washington and Seoul will engage in discussions about establishing a new visa category for Koreans, the nation’s foreign minister, Cho Hyun, said.

""While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation.""
Speaking on the House floor, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), an immigrant herself, called the bill ""Republicans' latest attempt to scapegoat and fearmonger about immigrants.""
US Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) also spoke out against the bill, saying on social media: ""It does nothing to protect communities or make us safer.
""I am deeply concerned that HR 3486 will lead to more violent attacks and unlawful arrests by ICE of the people I represent.","Eleven Democrats voted with Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Thursday to advance the so-called Stop Illegal Entry Act, which critics have condemned as ""dangerously overbroad"" as well as ""dehumanizing and horrific.""

The final vote was 226-197. The 11 Democrats who joined all GOP members present in backing the bill were Reps. Henry Cuellar (Texas), Don Davis (NC), Laura Gillen (NY), Jared Golden (Maine), Vicente Gonzalez (Texas), Adam Gray (Calif.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (Mich.), Frank Mrvan (Ind.), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (Wash.), Tom Suozzi (NY), and Gabe Vasquez (NM).

Introduced by Congresswoman Stephanie Bice (R-Okla.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), HR 3486 would increase sentences for undocumented immigrants who repeatedly enter the United States illegally or enter the country and then commit a felony. The bill still needs Senate approval to reach the desk of Republican President Donald Trump, who supports it.

After Thursday's vote, Mike Zamore, the ACLU's national director of policy and government affairs, warned that ""HR 3486 would supercharge President Trump's reckless deportation drive, which is already damaging our economy and destabilizing communities.""

""This legislation would hand the Trump administration more tools to criminalize immigrants and terrorize communities at the same time they are deploying federal agents and the military to our streets. It would also undermine public safety by diverting more resources away from youth services and prevention programs that actually improve community safety,"" Zamore said. ""While the House narrowly passed this bill, we thank the members of Congress who held the line and voted against this harmful legislation.""

""At a time when president is threatening American cities and the Supreme Court is greenlighting racial profiling, it is vital that a growing number of elected officials are standing together in rejecting Stephen Miller's dystopian agenda to criminalize and demonize people who come to this country seeking a better life,"" he added, calling out the White House deputy chief of staff for policy infamous for various anti-migrant initiatives from Trump's first term, including forcible separation of families.

Speaking on the House floor, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), an immigrant herself, called the bill ""Republicans' latest attempt to scapegoat and fearmonger about immigrants.""

US Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) also spoke out against the bill, saying on social media: ""It does nothing to protect communities or make us safer. Instead, it piles on cruel mandatory minimums, explodes prison costs, and treats families seeking safety like violent criminals. We need real immigration reform, not another zero-tolerance failure.""

Congressman Dave Min (D-Calif.), the son of immigrants, said in a statement that ""in talking with local and state law enforcement officers, I learned that this bill will potentially make it harder for them to do their jobs. By increasing the scope of crimes that local police officers might be expected to enforce, while not providing any funding for this, HR 3486 would effectively reduce the resources our local law enforcement has to keep our communities safe and potentially lead to increases in violent crime.""

Min also pointed to the US Supreme Court's Monday ruling that allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to engage in what critics have called ""blatant racial profiling.""

""This bill, combined with the Supreme Court's clearly wrong decision allowing ICE to detain people based on ethnicity, race, language, or place of employment, will give sweeping new authorities to ICE to perpetuate the mass incarceration of immigrants,"" he said. ""I am deeply concerned that HR 3486 will lead to more violent attacks and unlawful arrests by ICE of the people I represent.

Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented.
She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time.
Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have likely increased it.
While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., has been reported.","From her home-based day care in Washington D.C., Alma peers out the door and down the sidewalks. If they’re clear and there are no ICE agents out, she’ll give her coworker, an undocumented Latina who lives nearby, a call letting her know it’s safe to head in for work.

They have to be careful with the kids, too. Typically, she took the five children she cares for to the library on Wednesdays and out to parks throughout the week, but Alma — who is also undocumented — had to stop doing that in August, when President Donald Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district. Now, two of the kids she cares for are being pulled out of the day care. The parents said it was because they weren’t going outside.

Trump has deployed the National Guard and a wave of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents into the district. ICE arrests there have increased tenfold. The situation has thrust the Latinas who hold up the nation’s child care sector into a perpetual state of panic. Nationwide, about 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrants, but in D.C. it’s closer to 40 percent; about 7 percent nationally are undocumented. Nearly all are women.

Many are missing work, and others are risking it because they simply can’t afford to lose pay, providers told The 19th. All are afraid they’ll be next.

“What kind of life is this?” said Alma, whose name The 19th has changed to protect her identity. “We are not delinquents, we are not bad people, we are here to work to support our family.”

Alma has been running a home-based day care for the past decade. She’s been in the United States for 22 years, working in child care that entire time. With two kids being pulled, she will have to reduce her staffer’s hours as she tries to find children to fill those spots.

Her four school-age children also depend on her. This month, she had to write out a signed document detailing what should happen to her kids if she were to be detained. Her wish is that they be brought to detention with her.

“I can’t imagine my kids here without me,” she said.

She said she understands the president’s approach of expelling immigrants with criminal convictions from the country, but teachers who are working with kids? Who haven’t committed any crime?

By targeting them, she said, the administration is “destroying entire families.”

The Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association in D.C., which works with Latina child care providers, has seen this panic first hand for the past couple of weeks as more and more Latinas in child care have stopped coming into work. The center also helps workers obtain their associate’s degree in early childhood education, and since the semester started in mid-August, many teachers have asked for classes to be offered virtually so they don’t have to show up to campus at night.

Latinas have flocked to the child care industry for multiple reasons: Families seeking care value access to language education, and Latinas have a lower language barrier to entry, said Blanca Huezo, the program coordinator at the Multicultural Spanish Speaking Providers Association.

“In general, this industry offers them an opportunity for a fresh start professionally in their own language and without leaving behind their culture,” Huezo said.

Though the number of undocumented child care workers has historically been low, recent changes from the Trump administration to revoke or reduce legal protections have likely increased it. This year, the administration has narrowed opportunities for claiming asylum at the border, tried to bar certain groups from obtaining Temporary Protected Status and temporarily paused humanitarian protections for groups of migrants, thrusting more workers into the “undocumented” category.

The changes, coupled with increased enforcement, has fostered fear among Latinx people regardless of immigration status. That fear among workers is deepening a staffing crisis in an industry that already couldn’t afford additional losses, Huezo said.

“There is a shortage — and now even more,” she said. “There are many centers where nearly 99 percent of teachers are of Hispanic origin.”

Washington, D.C., has been a sanctuary city since 2020, where law enforcement cooperation with immigration officials was broadly prohibited. Earlier this year, however, Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed repealing that law and, in mid-August, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department Police Chief Pamela Smith gave officers leeway to share information with ICE about individuals they arrested or stopped.

“There was some peace that living in D.C. brought more security,” Huezo said. Now, “people don’t feel that freedom to walk through the streets.”

Child care centers are also no longer off limits for ICE raids. The centers were previously protected under a “sensitive locations” directive that advised ICE to not conduct enforcement in places like schools and day cares. But Trump removed that protection on his first day in office. While reports have not yet surfaced of raids in day cares, ICE presence near child care care centers, including in D.C., has been reported.

A similar story of fear and surveillance has already played out in Los Angeles, where ICE conducted widespread raids earlier in the summer. Huezo said her organization has been in touch with child care providers in L.A. to learn about how they managed those months.

In the meantime, the best the organization can do, she said, is connect workers with as many resources as possible, including legal clinics, but the ones that help immigrants are at their maximum caseload. The group has put child care workers who are not leaving their homes in touch with an organization called Food Justice DMV that is delivering meals to their doorsteps. Prior to last month, people who needed food could fill out a form and get it that same week. Now, the wait time is two to three weeks, Huezo said. For those in Maryland and Virginia, it’s closer to a month.

Thalia, a teacher at a day care, said her coworkers have stopped coming to work. It’s all the staff talks about during their lunchtime conversations. When she rides the Metro into work, she looks over her shoulder for the ICE agents, their faces covered, who are often at the exits.

“They are hunting us,” she said.

Thalia, whose name has been changed because she is undocumented, has been living in the United States for nine years and working in child care that entire time. Like her, many of the Latina teachers she works with have earned certifications and degrees in early childhood education.

“We are working, we are cooperating, paying taxes,” she said. “We are there all day so other families can benefit from the child care.”

As a single mother, Thalia has also had to consider what would happen to her three children if she was detained. This past month, she retained a lawyer who could help them with their case in case anything were to happen. Her school-age kids know: Call the lawyer if mom is detained and get tickets to Guatemala to meet her there.

This is what she lives with every day now: “The fear of leaving your family and letting them know, ‘If I don’t return, it’s not because I am abandoning you.’”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dc-childcare_2.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 21:57:07.996270

More than 300 South Korean workers were released from U.S. custody and are expected to arrive back in their home country on Friday, according to the nation’s foreign ministry.
“For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people,” Muñoz said, per CNBC.

“This is going to give us minimum two to three months delay, because now all these people want to get back [to South Korea],” Muñoz said in Detroit, as reported by Bloomberg. “Then you need to see how can you fill those positions, and for the most part, those people are not in the U.S.”

When completed, the factory, jointly operated by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is expected to hire thousands of American workers. It was originally slated to come online later this year.

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) carried out its largest single-site enforcement operation ever on Sept. 4, detaining nearly 500 people — mostly Korean nationals working on the technical components of building out the factory.

More than 300 South Korean workers were released from U.S. custody and are expected to arrive back in their home country on Friday, according to the nation’s foreign ministry.

“For the construction phase of the plants, you need to get specialized people,” Muñoz said, per CNBC. “There are a lot of skills and equipment that you cannot find in the United States.”

That has thrown company officials into a rush to fill in the gaps, the automaker executive said.

During a speech Sunday marking his first 100 days in office, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called on the Trump administration to adjust visa rules for some skilled positions or risk losing future investments in the U.S.

“It’s not like these are long-term workers,” the South Korean leader said. “When you build a factory or install equipment at a factory, you need technicians, but the United States doesn’t have that workforce and yet they won’t issue visas to let our people stay and do the work.”

Hyundai Motor Group Chair Euisun Chung also called for visa reform at the Detroit event Thursday, per Bloomberg’s report.

“I’m really worried about that incident and we’re really glad they’re returning home safely,” he said. “Our government and the U.S. government are working closely, and the visa regulation is very complicated.

(CN) — Three women held in immigration detention smiled, quietly broke into tears and hugged their lawyers in a federal courtroom Thursday after a judge ordered their release on bond.

“It’s so exciting to be able to reunite the individuals with their families,” said Grant Friedman, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska, which represented one of the women. “This order shows the commitment to due process that needs to be respected.”

The women — Nicandra Ozuna Carlon, Yurenia Genchi Palma and Felipa Lorenzo Perez — were among those arrested in the June 10 immigration raid on Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha and had been detained despite immigration judges ruling that they could be freed.

Federal authorities had continued their detention, though, citing what plaintiffs describe as a novel interpretation of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy on bond eligibility. Federal authorities now argue that only those already admitted to the U.S. can be released during removal proceedings, while everyone else must be detained under U.S. code.

Plaintiffs in these cases often describe this as a policy reversal. Previously, most individuals subject to removal proceedings who are found not to be a risk to the community could be released.

In Thursday’s cases, the women sued, and Senior U.S. District Judge Joseph F. Bataillon ordered their release during a hearing at the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Courthouse in downtown Omaha.

It was not exactly a surprise. Bataillon has issued the same order for at least three other plaintiffs in similar cases related to the raid.

Still, there had been a new development: a decision on Friday by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the senior U.S. immigration law administrative body, which found that those already in the United States who have entered without authorization are subject to mandatory detention and that immigration judges have no authority to change their custody status.

But following arguments by attorneys, Bataillon agreed with the plaintiffs that he should release their clients anyway since they were being held under the same circumstances as earlier plaintiffs and that the board’s opinion was flawed.

“I disagree with their analysis, and my holding is the same as it was,” Bataillon said.

Eric W. Synowicki, an assistant United States attorney arguing for defendants, had told Bataillon there is a consensus among immigration judges in Nebraska that they can no longer issue bond and that the Board’s ruling applied in the three cases.

“Immigration judges lack authority to grant bond,” he said. “It applies. It is lawful.”

ICE has said many of those arrested engaged in identity theft to get their jobs. Plaintiffs in these cases often point to their own lack of a criminal record in making their claims.

The raid on Glenn Valley Foods rocked Omaha, a city partially built on the backs of immigrant meatpackers since the late 19th century. It came at the heels of video circulating around the city of ICE agents arresting a man in the dining room of a local restaurant in front of patrons during Sunday brunch.

The scene of the Glenn Valley raid was tense, with some throwing rocks at a line of SUVs carrying federal agents, shattering a window, according to some reports.

Immigration has continued to be a contentious issue in Nebraska.

Jorge Cruz came to the US from Mexico City at the age of five after the death of his grandmother and caretaker, and began street vending when he was 11. Over the past two decades, he has grown his solo business into a thriving enterprise, Del Mar Fruits and More, with 25 food carts and 10 employees who sell frutas, elotes, hot dogs, and aguas frescas throughout Santa Monica.

In 2023, Cruz participated in Ruben Ochoa’s installation at Frieze LA, selling fruit to peckish fairgoers. It was the first of several collaborations between Cruz and Ochoa at cultural events, including KCRW’s concert series at the Hammer Museum and the Inner-City Arts Gala, both in 2023, and the 2024 Snapchat Summit. Ochoa views these culinary activations as a form of support and advocacy for street vendors and a way to showcase the critical yet undervalued role they play in LA’s cultural and financial economy.

“As a child of tortilla vendors myself, I can attest to the strong work ethics of many in the vending community who have contributed vital and oftentimes underappreciated roles as providers of affordable quality foods,” Ochoa wrote in a letter of support for Cruz reviewed by Hyperallergic.

“Even though street vendors are statistically more likely to be targeted, harassed, or physically harmed compared to a brick-and-mortar store, Jorge Cruz and many business owners like him continue to work long hours to support themselves and their families,” Ochoa continued. “ I support Jorge Cruz as a person and a small business owner, and in doing so, I support my city.”

Erika Hirugami had invited Cruz to work at the upcoming reception for Concrete Hope, a photography exhibition she curated exploring diverse Latine and Indigenous identities, on October 14. In a call with Hyperallergic, she described Cruz as “essential to the arts community.”

Then, on the morning of August 27, as Cruz and his wife Carmen were returning home from dropping their four kids off at school, they were confronted by approximately six ICE agents.

“We were in our truck. One of their cars got in front of us, the other car got in back. ‘We have an order of arrest for Jorge Cruz,’ they said,” Carmen told Hyperallergic, recounting the incident. “[Jorge] was calm. They arrested him, put him in the car, and took him.”

Cruz called his wife a couple of hours later to tell her that he was in a detention center in downtown LA. The next day, he was moved to a detention center in Adelanto, about 90 miles (~144.8 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, where he is still being held. ICE has not yet responded to Hyperallergic‘s request for comment.

Carmen said she believes the reason for her husband’s abduction stemmed from a verbal altercation he had with another vendor several months ago. Police arrested both men, but the charges were dismissed.

“He went to court, and they gave him a paper saying the case was never filed,” she said. “He had no criminal charges, he was happy.”

Even so, this incident put a target on Cruz’s back, according to Mackenzie W. Mackins, an immigration attorney representing Cruz.

“They don’t care if it’s dismissed. Any contact with law enforcement puts you at the top of the list,” Mackins told Hyperallergic.

Cruz was undocumented when he arrived in the United States as a child, but was protected from deportation under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). He married Carmen, a US citizen, in 2014, and received his green card, which made him eligible to file for citizenship after three years. Mackins has been working with Cruz for years to help him become naturalized, but old arrests, mostly minor infractions related to unpermitted street vending, have made that difficult.

“We’ve been fighting this battle for a long time,” she said, explaining that immigration authorities were already trying to pursue removal because of his past record. “Our argument is, ‘He’s here. He has children, a wife. What’s the point of dragging this on?’”

Cruz is scheduled to have a bond hearing tomorrow morning, September 12. Mackins suggested that statements of support could help the case, and Hirugami started a letter-writing campaign in hopes of sending 200 letters to his lawyer to present in court. Those interested in attending Friday’s hearing at 8:30am PST can do so virtually.

However, due to recent changes to immigration law, anyone who entered the country illegally can be denied bond, according to Mackins. “He’s in a different category because he’s a lawful permanent resident,” she argued. “They should let him go back to his previous status, fighting his removal.”

Cruz’s story may be distressing and maddening, but it is sadly by no means unique. Since Trump took office this year, ICE arrests have reportedly doubled, and the number of people in detention has reached record highs.

“We see it firsthand — people trying to do the right thing to become part of the formal economy through pathways that advocacy groups have made possible,” Patrick Lennon of Revolution Carts told Hyperallergic. The company, which has partnered with Ochoa for several projects, manufactured the first-ever hot food push cart for vendors approved by the LA County Health Department in 2021, and counts Cruz among their first customers.

“[We] see someone like Jorge going through the citizenship process, paying taxes, when all of a sudden they’re picked up and detained,” Lennon said.",https://hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/jorge-cruz.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 18:56:52.918453

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled once again on Thursday that the automatic stay provision is unconstitutional.
But in his order releasing the three women on Thursday, he did not address whether or not it was lawful and instead focused only on the automatic stay.
Grant Friedman, an attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska who represented Genchi Palma, said he anticipates that detainees in Nebraska and elsewhere will challenge the Board’s decision in federal court.
“I anticipate the landscape will be slightly different, because they wouldn’t be detained under an automatic stay,” Friedman said after Thursday’s hearing.","At a federal courthouse in Omaha on Thursday, three women tearfully embraced their attorneys and each other after they were ordered to be released from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement custody.

Like the six others who had previously been released in nearly identical cases, the three women were detained during the June ICE raid on Omaha’s Glenn Valley Foods meatpacking plant. They were granted bond by an immigration judge but were kept in ICE custody after the agency filed its intent to appeal the bond determination. That resulted in an “automatic stay,” which kept them behind bars as the appeal was decided.

U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Bataillon ruled once again on Thursday that the automatic stay provision is unconstitutional. Yurenia Genchi Palma, Nicandra Ozuna Carlon and Felipa Lorenzo Perez will be released from custody within the next 24 hours.

Their release comes after last week’s decision from the Board of Immigration Appeals that found the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are subject to mandatory detention without a bond hearing regardless of how long they lived in the U.S. or their community ties. Advocates and attorneys say that interpretation goes against decades of precedent.

Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security had argued in both immigration court and federal court that any undocumented immigrant encountered within the U.S. may be treated as an “arriving alien” under Section 235 of the Immigration and Nationality Act and thus subject to mandatory detention.

For decades, Section 235 was understood to apply to people encountered while crossing the border or shortly thereafter, while Section 236 was understood to apply to undocumented immigrants who are encountered in the U.S. after residing in the country. People detained under Section 236, like those arrested during the Glenn Valley raid, were entitled to a bond determination hearing.

On July 8, interim guidance issued by ICE said the agency had “revised its legal position on detention and release authorities” and categorized every undocumented immigrant under Section 235.

That legal position was frequently rejected by immigration judges in Nebraska and elsewhere. Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is the highest administrative body for interpreting immigration laws.

While the Board’s decision is binding on immigration courts – meaning that most undocumented immigrants will not be eligible for bond hearings regardless of how long they’ve lived in the country – federal courts are not bound by the decision.

Bataillon said from the bench that he disagreed with the board’s analysis and decision. But in his order releasing the three women on Thursday, he did not address whether or not it was lawful and instead focused only on the automatic stay.

“The Court need not determine the validity of the government’s argument that petitioner should be mandatorily detained under [Section 235] nor the applicability of the BIA’s decision,” Bataillon wrote. “For the time being, the court is concerned only with the lawfulness of the automatic stay.”

That’s likely to change as more people sue after they are denied the opportunity for a bond hearing because of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision. Grant Friedman, an attorney with the ACLU of Nebraska who represented Genchi Palma, said he anticipates that detainees in Nebraska and elsewhere will challenge the Board’s decision in federal court.

“I anticipate the landscape will be slightly different, because they wouldn’t be detained under an automatic stay,” Friedman said after Thursday’s hearing. “We will continue to see lawsuits across the country on this issue as more and more immigration judges start denying bond.”

The nation’s two largest teachers unions joined a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging the Trump administration’s immigration policy change allowing enforcement on school grounds and other sensitive locations.

Administrators of a private early childhood school in Oregon also joined the lawsuit, saying their jobs and the education of the children they serve were interrupted as a result of the administration’s policy change after Immigration and Customs Enforcement apprehended a parent on school grounds.

The court documents describe “a violent ICE enforcement action on the school grounds” in mid-July that included law enforcement officers shattering the car window of a student’s father and detaining him while he was dropping off his 2-year-old. Following the incident, Oregon’s Guidepost Montessori School saw a drop in student attendance and in interest from new families, the new parties in the lawsuit claim.

The lawsuit was originally filed in April on behalf of parties including Latinx farmworker labor union Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. It is among a string of legal challenges seeking to undo the U.S. Department of Homeland Security policy change. The original lawsuit, as well as the document filed this week, claim that “attendance rates dropped in half and school administrators saw an influx of parents picking their children up from school in the middle of the day after hearing reports that immigration officials were in the area.”

K-12 leaders and lawsuits are increasingly reporting a significant and sometimes direct impact on students and parents as a result of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

In Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, ICE activity has included failed attempts to enter two elementary schools after officers allegedly lied about having parents’ permission to speak to students. In that incident, administrators denied the officers’ requests.

More recently, a high school student with disabilities was handcuffed and held at gunpoint “in an alleged case of mistaken identity” just prior to the start of the school year, according to LAUSD officials.

Many of the recorded incidents have taken place during student pickup or drop-off hours on or near school grounds.

Such incidents have created trauma and school avoidance, educators and immigration rights advocates said during a virtual press event last week.

But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.
U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who's no longer welcome in the country.
She would be completely lost there,"" an attorney wrote in a 1999 letter to immigration officials.
Starting from scratch back in Brazil Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women's shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.","It sounded like freedom, like a world of possibility beyond the orphanage walls.

Maria Pires was getting adopted. At 11 years old, she saw herself escaping the chaos and violence of the Sao Paulo orphanage, where she'd been sexually assaulted by a staff member. She saw herself leaving Brazil for America, trading abandonment for belonging.

A single man in his 40s, Floyd Sykes III, came to Sao Paulo to meet her. He signed some paperwork and brought Maria home.

She arrived in the suburbs of Baltimore in the summer of 1989, a little girl with a tousle of dark hair, a nervous smile and barely a dozen words of English. The sprawling subdivision looked idyllic, with rows of modest brick townhouses and a yard where she could play soccer.

She was, she believed, officially an American.

But what happened in that house would come to haunt her, marking the start of a long descent into violence, crime and mental illness.

""My father — my adopted father — he was supposed to save me,"" Pires said. Instead, he tortured and sexually abused her.

After nearly three years of abuse, Sykes was arrested. The state placed Pires in foster care.

By then, she was consumed with fury. In the worst years, she beat a teenager at a roller rink, leaving him in a coma. She attacked a prison guard and stabbed her cellmate with a sharpened toothbrush.

In prison, she discovered that no one had ever bothered to complete her immigration paperwork. Not Sykes. Not Maryland social service agencies.

That oversight would leave her without a country. She wasn't American, it turned out, and she'd lost her Brazilian citizenship when she was adopted by Sykes, who died several years ago. But immigration officials, including those under President Donald Trump's first administration, let her stay in the country.

After her release from prison in 2017, Pires stayed out of trouble and sought help to control her anger. She checked in once a year with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and paid for an annual work permit.

But in the second Trump administration — with its promise of mass deportations, a slew of executive orders and a crackdown targeting those the president deemed ""the worst of the worst"" — everything changed. Trump's unyielding approach to immigration enforcement has swept up tens of thousands of immigrants, including many like Pires who came to the U.S. as children and know little, if any, life outside America. They have been apprehended during ICE raids, on college campuses, or elsewhere in their communities, and their detentions often draw the loudest backlash.

In Pires' case, she was detained during a routine check-in, sent to one immigration jail after another, and ultimately deported to a land she barely remembers. The Associated Press conducted hours of interviews with Pires and people who know her and reviewed Maryland court records, internal ICE communications, and adoption and immigration paperwork to tell her story.

U.S. immigration officials say Pires is a dangerous serial criminal who's no longer welcome in the country. Her case, they say, is cut and dried.

Pires, now 47, doesn't deny her criminal past.

But little about her story is straightforward.

A new chapter of childhood, marked by abuse

Pires has no clear memories from before she entered the orphanage. All she knows is that her mother spent time in a mental institution.

The organization that facilitated her adoption was later investigated by Brazilian authorities over allegations it charged exorbitant fees and used videos to market available children, according to a Sao Paulo newspaper. Organization leaders denied wrongdoing.

Pires remembers a crew filming a TV commercial. She believes that's how Sykes found her.

In his custody, the abuse escalated over time. When Sykes went to work, he sometimes left her locked in a room, chained to a radiator with only a bucket as a toilet. He gave her beer and overpowered her when she fought back. She started cutting herself.

Sykes ordered her to keep quiet, but she spoke almost no English then anyway. On one occasion, he forced a battery into her ear as punishment, causing permanent hearing loss.

In September 1992, someone alerted authorities. Sykes was arrested. Child welfare officials took custody of Maria, then 14.

Maryland Department of Human Services spokesperson Lilly Price said the agency couldn't comment on specific cases because of confidentiality laws but noted in a statement that adoptive parents are responsible for applying for U.S. citizenship for children adopted from other countries.

Court documents show Sykes admitted sexually assaulting Maria multiple times but he claimed the assaults stopped in June 1990.

He was later convicted of child abuse. Though he had no prior criminal record, court officials acknowledged a history of similar behavior, records show.

Between credit for time served and a suspended prison sentence, Sykes spent about two months in jail.

Sykes' younger sister Leslie Parrish said she's often wondered what happened to Maria.

""He ruined her life,"" she said, weeping. ""There's a special place in hell for people like that.""

Parrish said she wanted to believe her brother had good intentions; he seemed committed to becoming a father and joined a social group for adoptive parents of foreign kids. She even accompanied him to Brazil.

But in hindsight, she sees it differently. She believes sinister motives lurked ""in the back of his sick mind.""

At family gatherings, Maria didn't show obvious signs of distress, though the language barrier made communication difficult. Other behavior was explained away as the result of her troubled childhood in the orphanage, Parrish said.

""But behind closed doors, I don't know what happened.""

Years in prison, an eventual release

Pires' teenage years were hard. She drank too much and got kicked out of school for fighting. She ran away from foster homes, including places where people cared for her deeply.

""If ever there was a child who was cheated out of life, it was Maria,"" one foster mother wrote in later court filings. ""She is a beautiful person, but she has had a hard life for someone so young.""

She struggled to provide for herself, sometimes ending up homeless. ""My trauma was real bad,"" she said. ""I was on my own.""

She became angry and violent. She would fight anyone who crossed her.

At 18, she pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for the roller rink attack. She served two years in prison, where she finally learned basic reading and writing skills. It was then that authorities — and Pires herself — discovered she wasn't a U.S. citizen.

Her criminal record meant it would be extremely difficult to gain citizenship. Suddenly, she faced deportation.

Pires said she hadn't realized the potential consequences when accepting her plea deal.

""If l had any idea that I could be deported because of this, I would not have agreed to it,"" she wrote, according to court records. ""Going to jail was one thing, but I will lose everything if I am deported back to Brazil.""

A team of volunteer lawyers and advocates argued she shouldn't be punished for something beyond her control.

""Maria has absolutely no one and nothing in Brazil. She would be completely lost there,"" an attorney wrote in a 1999 letter to immigration officials.

Ultimately, the American judicial system agreed: Pires would be allowed to remain in the United States if she checked in annually with ICE, a fairly common process until Trump's second term.

""How's your mental?""

Pires didn't immediately take advantage of her second chance.

She was arrested for cocaine distribution in 2004 and for check fraud in 2007. While incarcerated, she picked up charges for stabbing her cellmate in the eye, burning an inmate with a flat iron and throwing hot water on a correctional officer. Her sentence was extended.

Pires said she spent several years in solitary confinement, exacerbating her mental health challenges.

Her release in 2017 marked a new beginning. Through therapy and other support services, she learned to manage her anger and stay out of trouble. She gave up drinking. She started working long days in construction. She checked in every year with immigration agents.

But in 2023, work dried up and she fell behind on rent. She felt her mental health slipping. She applied for a women's transitional housing program in Baltimore.

Pires thrived there. With no high school diploma and only second-grade reading skills, she qualified for a state-run job training course to polish and refinish floors. Photos show her smiling broadly in a blue graduation gown.

Friends say Pires may have a tough exterior, but she's known for thinking of others first. She often greets people with a cheerful question: ""How's your mental?"" It's her way of acknowledging that everyone carries some sort of burden.

""This is a person who just yearns for family,"" said Britney Jones, Pires' former roommate. ""She handles things with so much forgiveness and grace.""

The two were living together when Pires went to downtown Baltimore on March 6 for her annual immigration check-in. She never returned.

A crackdown on ""the worst of the worst""

When President Donald Trump campaigned for a second term, he doubled down on promises to carry out mass deportations. Within hours of taking office, he signed a series of executive orders, targeting what he called ""the worst of the worst"" — murderers, rapists, gang members. The goal, officials have said, is 1 million deportations a year.

In March, Pires showed up at the immigration office with paperwork listing all her check-ins over the past eight years. This time, instead of receiving another compliance report, she was immediately handcuffed and detained.

""The government failed her,"" attorney Jim Merklinger said. ""They allowed this to happen.""

Given that she was adopted into the country as a child, she shouldn't be punished for something that was out of her hands from the start, he said.

Her March arrest sparked a journey across America's immigration detention system. From Baltimore, she was sent to New Jersey and Louisiana before landing at Eloy Detention Center in Arizona.

She tried to stay positive. Although Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric made her nervous, Pires reminded herself that the system granted her leniency in the past. She told her friends back home not to worry.

A deportation priority

On June 2, in an email exchange obtained by AP, an ICE agent asked to have Pires prioritized for a deportation flight to Brazil leaving in four days.

""I would like to keep her as low profile as possible,"" the agent wrote.

Her lawyer tried to stop the deportation, calling Maryland politicians, ICE officials and Brazilian diplomats.

""This is a woman who followed all the rules,"" Merklinger said. ""This should not be happening.""

He received terrified calls from Pires, who was suddenly transferred to a detention facility near Alexandria, Louisiana, a common waypoint for deportation flights.

Finally, Pires said, she was handcuffed, shackled, put on a bus with dozens of other detainees, driven to the Alexandria airport and loaded onto an airplane. There was a large group of Brazilians on the flight, which was a relief, though she spoke hardly any Portuguese after so many years in the U.S.

""I was just praying to God,"" she said. ""Maybe this is his plan.""

After two stops to drop off other deportees, they arrived in the Brazilian port city of Fortaleza.

Starting from scratch back in Brazil

Brazilian authorities later took Pires to a women's shelter in an inland city in the eastern part of the country.

She has spent months there trying to get Brazilian identification documents. She began relearning Portuguese — listening to conversations around her and watching TV.

Most of her belongings are in a Baltimore storage unit, including DJ equipment and a tripod she used for recording videos — two of her passions.

In Brazil, she has almost nothing. She depends on the shelter for necessities such as soap and toothpaste. But she maintains a degree of hope.

""I've survived all these years,"" Pires said. ""I can survive again.""

She can't stop thinking about her birth family. Years ago, she got a tattoo of her mother's middle name. Now more than ever, she wants to know where she came from. ""I still have that hole in my heart,"" she said.

Above all, she hopes to return to America. Her attorney recently filed an application for citizenship. But federal officials say that's not happening.

""She was an enforcement priority because of her serial criminal record,"" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email. ""Criminals are not welcome in the U.S.""

Every morning, Pires wakes up and keeps trying to build a new life. She's applied for Brazilian work authorization, but getting a job will probably be difficult until her Portuguese improves. She's been researching language classes and using her limited vocabulary to communicate with other shelter residents.

In moments of optimism, she imagines herself working as a translator, earning a decent salary and renting a nice apartment.

She wonders if God's plan will ever become clear.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250911-maria-pires-mb-1430-968659.jpg",N,,2025-09-11 18:56:57.657550

On September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court agreed to expedited review of two appeals concerning the legality of the Trump administration's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), including fentanyl and immigration-related tariffs on products of Canada, Mexico, and China (Trafficking Tariffs), and the reciprocal tariffs imposed on products of most countries (Reciprocal Tariffs) (together with the Trafficking Tariffs, the IEEPA Tariffs). Recent court decisions, including the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision finding that the IEEPA Tariffs exceeded the president's authority, represent a significant setback for the administration's efforts to use the executive's emergency power under IEEPA to impose tariffs.

Despite the Federal Circuit's decision, and similar holdings from the district courts, the IEEPA Tariffs remain in effect pending review by the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court overturns the lower court decisions on this issue, the IEEPA Tariffs will remain in effect. The Supreme Court could also remand without deciding whether the tariffs are legal, leaving the lower courts to continue addressing them on a case-by-case basis. Even if the IEEPA Tariffs are struck down by the Supreme Court, importers will face an uncertain timeline to recover funds already collected by the government. Importers therefore need to be proactive in preserving their rights while these cases are pending.

Importers should take steps to maximize their chance of obtaining tariff refunds. This includes closely monitoring the liquidation of entries on which IEEPA Tariffs were paid, asking U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to extend the liquidation timeframe for those entries, and filing protests when the entries are liquidated.

What Tariffs Are at Issue?

The plaintiffs have sued President Trump and other administration officials in the Court of International Trade (CIT) and the District Court for the District of Columbia for improperly invoking IEEPA to impose tariffs on products from Mexico (Executive Orders (E.O.) 14194 and 14198), China (E.O.s 14195 and 14228), and Canada (E.O. 14197) based on presidential declarations of national emergencies concerning drug trafficking and migration (the aforementioned Trafficking Tariffs). The cases also challenge the universal reciprocal tariff program based on a presidential declaration of national emergency concerning the trade deficit (E.O. 14257) that imposed a baseline 10 percent tariff on most countries and the country-specific rates that followed (the aforementioned Reciprocal Tariffs). The pending litigation also addresses subsequent amendments to the IEEPA Tariffs programs under separate executive orders.

There are also several other recent tariff measures, including some levied under IEEPA, that have not been directly challenged under the current proceedings. These tariffs include the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, automobile parts, and copper, which were imposed under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and section 301 tariffs on certain China-origin goods imposed under the Trade Act of 1974.

Further, the plaintiffs in the proceedings before the courts have not explicitly challenged several tariffs issued under IEEPA, including the 40 percent tariff on Brazil-origin goods and the 25 percent tariff on India-origin goods. However, those tariffs are similarly at risk of being overturned if the Supreme Court determines that IEEPA does not authorize issuance of tariffs.

The table below lists all Trump administration tariffs in chronological order.

What Have Federal District Courts Said About IEEPA Tariffs?

Two district court decisions have addressed the legality of IEEPA tariffs.

First, in V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00066 (Ct Int'l Trade, Apr. 14, 2025), the CIT held that IEEPA does not grant the president authority to ""impose unbounded tariffs"" (with respect to the Reciprocal Tariffs) or to impose tariffs on lawful imports in response to an unrelated trafficking and crime problem (with respect to the Trafficking Tariffs). The CIT ordered a universal, permanent injunction on the challenged tariffs, which was stayed by Federal Circuit during the government's appeal and remains stayed now as the case proceeds to the Supreme Court. The CIT's decision was recently upheld by the Federal Circuit in the V.O.S. Selections decision discussed below.

Second, a federal district court in Washington, DC, similarly held that the IEEPA Tariffs exceed the president's authority. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, No. CV 25-1248 (RC), 2025 WL 1525376, at *6 (D.D.C. May 29, 2025), the court held that IEEPA does not grant the executive the authority to impose tariffs, and therefore, that the government's tariffs are in violation of the non-delegation doctrine and separation of powers, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) – a ruling that goes still further than the CIT in invalidating the IEEPA Tariffs. The district court also found that the CIT did not have jurisdiction to address the legality of the tariffs.

Both decisions are now on appeal and have been consolidated for joint review by the Supreme Court.

What Have the Courts of Appeals Decided?

On August 29, 2025, in a per curiam decision signed by seven of the 11 judges who heard the case, the Federal Circuit affirmed the CIT's decision while vacating the universal permanent injunction on the IEEPA Tariffs and remanded the case for further evaluation of whether a universal injunction is proper.

In upholding the CIT's decision striking down the IEEPA Tariffs, the panel emphasized that the power to levy taxes, including tariffs, is expressly delegated to Congress under Article 1 § 8 of the Constitution. Further, for much of the nation's history, statutory delegations of tariff authority to the president were highly limited, involving only the authority to reduce or increase tariff rates through international agreements, rather than the authority to create new tariffs from whole cloth.

Then, addressing the text of IEEPA, the panel noted that, although IEEPA ""bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, [] none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.""

In contrast, the panel noted that other trade laws that grant authority to issue tariffs have done so explicitly, in ""clear and precise terms."" And despite the fact that IEEPA was promulgated nearly 50 years ago, and has been invoked frequently by presidents, no past president has used IEEPA to impose tariffs on imports or adjust tariff rates. Taking these facts together, the panel explained that:

whenever Congress intends to delegate to the President the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly, either by using unequivocal terms like tariff and duty, or via an over-all structure which makes clear that Congress is referring to tariffs. This is no surprise, as the core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution; when Congress delegates this power in the first instance, it does so clearly and unambiguously.

Because IEEPA has no such unambiguous delegation of authority, the court concluded that the administration's tariffs issued under IEEPA were contrary to statute, and as such, unlawful.

Notwithstanding this decision, the panel vacated the universal permanent injunction on enforcing IEEPA Tariffs that was ordered by the CIT, remanding the issue for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's June decision in Trump v. Casa. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that universal injunctions ""likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts."" The Federal Circuit therefore directed the district court to determine whether a universal injunction was permitted under the equitable principles addressed in Casa.

While joining in the majority decision, Judges Cunningham, Lourie, Reyna, and Stark also submitted an additional opinion stating their view that ""IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose any tariffs"" at all. The concurrence based this conclusion on the plain language of IEEPA, finding that any tariff issued by the president under IEEPA would exceed Congress's delegation of authority.

Finally, Judges Taranto, Prost, Chen, and Chief Judge Moore dissented, stating the view that ""IEEPA's language, as confirmed by its history, authorizes tariffs to regulate importation"" under statutorily defined conditions, including ""unusual and extraordinary threat, having foreign sources, to the national security or foreign policy or economy of the United States, the threat declared as a national emergency..."" According to the dissenting judges: ""IEEPA embodies an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign-affairs realm, which unsurprisingly extends beyond authorities available under non-emergency laws,"" and includes authority to issue tariffs like those in question here.

The Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was set to hear oral arguments in Learning Resources on September 30, 2025. However, both plaintiffs and the government have agreed that the DC Circuit should hold the case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court case.

What Are the Next Steps in the IEEPA Tariff Appeals?

On September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court granted the government's request for expedited review of the V.O.S Selections decision. The Supreme Court also consolidated the DC and Federal Circuit cases and set a deadline of October 30, 2025, for completion of all briefing. Oral argument is calendared the first week of November 2025 and a decision is likely to follow shortly thereafter. In light of this order, the Federal Circuit's ruling in V.O.S. Selections is stayed automatically. The DC Circuit is also likely to stay proceedings in Learning Resources.

Despite lower court orders finding the IEEPA tariffs unlawful, those tariffs will remain in effect until a final determination is reached. Further, as noted above, the appeal before the Supreme Court does not apply to tariffs issued under other laws, such as the 50 percent tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from other trading partners, which were issued under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

What Are Possible Outcomes to this Litigation?

There are several possible outcomes to the ongoing tariffs litigation, each with different implications for importers. Here are a few of the potential paths forward:

The Supreme Court could find that the IEEPA Tariffs are valid and imposed within the president's emergency authority under IEEPA. If it does, we expect the IEEPA Tariffs to continue under their existing parameters and importers will be required to pay these duties on all imports until the IEEPA Tariffs are lifted.

The Supreme Court could remand one or both cases without deciding the legality of the IEEPA Tariffs challenged on appeal. Although IEEPA had never been used to impose tariffs before the current administration, the Supreme Court may find that IEEPA authorizes the executive to regulate trade by imposing tariffs, without deciding specifically whether the administration's tariffs are lawful. If it does so, the Supreme Court may use this opportunity to establish parameters that provide boundaries on the use of IEEPA's authority. These parameters could include, for example, being narrowly tailored to fit the stated emergency or further defining what qualifies as an ""usual and extraordinary threat."" With these guiderails in place, the Court could remand the issue to the lower courts to address whether the IEEPA Tariffs satisfy the criteria.

The Supreme Court could also avoid deciding the legality of the IEEPA Tariffs altogether by deciding the case solely on a jurisdictional basis. The Supreme Court may find that the CIT holds exclusive jurisdiction (or conversely, that the DC district court has general jurisdiction) over the tariffs matter and remand these cases to the appropriate lower court without making a finding on the merits. This is a key point where the Federal and DC Circuits differed (and a key reason why the matters have been consolidated to appear together before the Supreme Court): The Federal Circuit determined that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction to review litigation related to the validity of tariffs, while the DC district court found that the CIT did not have any jurisdiction because the executive's powers under IEEPA did not include ""the power to tariff."" A jurisdictional ruling could side-step the merits of the IEEPA Tariffs but would have the effect of upholding the lower court's holding. From there, the lower court would have to determine the scope of equitable relief appropriate under the standard in Trump v. Casa.

The Supreme Court could hold that IEEPA does not grant the president the power to enact any tariffs. As noted above, the Federal Circuit held that only the tariffs specifically challenged in the V.O.S. Selections litigation were unlawful; however, the concurrence went further and held that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of any tariffs. If the Supreme Court follows the concurrence, CBP would be required to refund the IEEPA Tariffs and end further collections.

The government has argued that this outcome would impose an extraordinary burden. An order striking down the IEEPA Tariffs would also call into question the trade agreements made with other nations in response to the recently enacted tariffs, particularly the Reciprocal Tariffs. In an August 11, 2025, letter to the Federal Circuit, the government noted that ""[t]he President believes that our country would not be able to pay back the trillions of dollars that other countries have already committed to pay, which could lead to financial ruin,"" including ""a 1929-style result.""

The Supreme Court could hold that some (but not all) of the IEEPA Tariffs are illegal. There are several tariffs under consideration, and the Court may find that only certain tariffs – or certain elements of the IEEPA Tariffs – are valid under IEEPA. In that case, the remaining portions would be struck down, and the government would no longer have authority to collect tariffs outside those authorized by the Supreme Court's decision. CBP would also have to find a mechanism to refund previously collected, but now invalidated, tariffs.

If Plaintiffs Win On Appeal, Will Importers Be Able to Collect Refunds for Tariffs Already Paid?

If the Supreme Court finds that some or all of the IEEPA Tariffs were implemented unlawfully, the government will face demands to refund the IEEPA Tariffs that were already collected, which could amount to hundreds of billions of dollars.

The government has argued that this outcome would create an extraordinary burden, but it has acknowledged that if the IEEPA Tariffs are overturned, the tariffs already paid would need to be returned. On September 7, 2025, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent agreed that ""[the Treasury] would have to refund roughly half the tariffs, which would be a major blow to the Treasury."" Bessent also stated that ""[i]f the court rules that way, we'll have no choice but to comply.""

However, there is significant uncertainty about how the government would implement such refunds, what procedural hurdles importers would face in claiming the funds they are owed, and how long it would take to receive any payments. Further, the Supreme Court's decision may not resolve the legality of all IEEPA Tariffs, leaving continued uncertainty about the payment obligations for any tariffs that remain in effect. In light of these factors, importers are advised to take steps to protect their ability to obtain tariff refunds.

How Can Importers Protect Their Ability to Recover Tariffs They Have Already Paid?

Given the myriad paths forward in the IEEPA Tariffs litigation, importers should consider taking steps to preserve their rights and ability to claim timely refunds.

Track entry liquidations. While Supreme Court review is pending, importers should ensure that they have an internal process to track the liquidation (i.e., the final calculation of duties) of entries on which IEEPA Tariffs were paid. Importers are encouraged to maintain records of all documents associated with those entries, including entry summaries, commercial invoices, and proof of payments made to CBP.

Request extensions to pending liquidations. 19 U.S.C § 1504 requires CBP to liquidate entries within one year of the date of entry. However, under statute, this period can be extended by up to three years if an importer requests such an extension and shows good cause. An extension would give CBP additional time to apply the final legal outcome to the entries. It would also delay the start of 180-day statutory timeline to file protests on liquidated entries.

File protests if extensions are denied. Entries are typically liquidated 314 days from the date of entry. Because the tariffs were imposed earlier this year, most affected entries have not yet liquidated. When they do, and if extensions to pending liquidations are not granted, importers should consider filing protests to challenge CBP's liquidation of the entries. Importers should also consider requesting that the protest review be suspended until the IEEPA cases reach a final merits-based resolution.

If protests are denied, consider legal action. If the Supreme Court grants a favorable outcome, but does not establish a process for refunds, and protests are denied, then importers that have paid IEEPA Tariffs may consider filing their own lawsuits challenging the tariffs and seeking reimbursement. Pending the scope of relief resulting from this litigation, importers may want to keep an eye on class action lawsuits that potentially unfold that challenge the grounds of these IEEPA tariffs.

There are many possible paths forward and a decision by the Supreme Court may not be the final word in IEEPA Tariffs litigation. It is important that the import community closely follow the developments in this litigation and take action to preserve the ability to seek refunds if the IEEPA Tariffs are found to be unlawful.

“Head Start programs in Washington see every day how Head Start strengthens families and uplifts entire communities.
With so many attacks against our immigrant community, ensuring they do not lose access to Head Start is a tremendous win for children and families.
Below are statements from litigators: “Today the court was clear: HHS does not have the authority to impose an immigration-based restriction on Head Start families,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU.
“Under the law, access to these critical programs has never been — and should never be — based on immigration status.”","SEATTLE – In a win for working families, a federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction effectively blocking an exclusionary directive of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS), which sought to shut out immigrant families from participating in Head Start based on their immigration status for the first time in the program’s history since it was created in 1965. The ruling prevents the HHS directive from going into effect and enjoins the government from implementing or enforcing it against any Head Start agencies, program providers, student or family participants, or other similar persons.

“This ruling is a powerful affirmation that every child, no matter their background or immigration status, deserves access to early education and support,” said Joel Ryan, executive director of theWashington State Head Start & Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program. “Head Start programs in Washington see every day how Head Start strengthens families and uplifts entire communities. The court’s decision allows us to keep serving the children and families who need us most.”

“Today’s decision is a powerful step toward protecting access to early education and care for Head Start children and families all across the nation,” said Candice Williams, executive director of Family Forward Oregon. “This ruling ensures some stability for families and caregivers during a tumultuous time in our country. With so many attacks against our immigrant community, ensuring they do not lose access to Head Start is a tremendous win for children and families. This is only one win of many to come! We will not stop fighting.”

The directive, which was issued this past July, aimed to reinterpret the definition of “federal public benefit” under the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) to include Head Start — effectively making many immigrant children ineligible for the first time in the program’s history. This action has created confusion and fear among providers and families alike, leading young children to lose critical education.

In April, the American Civil Liberties Union’s Women’s Rights Project, the ACLU of Washington, the ACLU of Illinois, the Impact Fund, filed a lawsuit on behalf of Parent Voices Oakland and Family Forward Oregon, and the Head Start Associations of Washington state, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

In July, plaintiffs sought emergency relief to stop HHS’ latest directive, which seeks to exclude many immigrant families from accessing early childhood education by restricting participation in Head Start based on immigration status.

Below are statements from litigators:

“Today the court was clear: HHS does not have the authority to impose an immigration-based restriction on Head Start families,” said Jennesa Calvo-Friedman, senior staff attorney in the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU. “No child and no family should have to fear accessing critical early learning services, and we will continue to defend the families that Head Start aims to serve.”

“Our Constitution establishes a three-part system of government to make sure there are checks and balances on the power of any one branch to radically undermine American values and democracy,” said Lori Rifkin, litigation director at the Impact Fund. “Today, the court protected our democratic process by upholding the goals of Congress in establishing the Head Start program and rejecting the Trump Administration's illegal attempt to deny children crucial educational opportunities based on immigration status.”

“The court today protected the children and families that rely on Head Start across Washington state. Head Start programs provide crucial early learning support not only to the children and families that participate in them, but also entire communities facing barriers created by systemic inequality and racism,"" said Brent Low, ACLU of Washington staff attorney. “Under the law, access to these critical programs has never been — and should never be — based on immigration status.”",https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/themes/aclu-wp/img/content-types/fallback-press-release.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 16:57:48.935581

Barnhart, other local officials and immigration advocates said they did not condone the slashing of the tires.
The city first passed a resolution in 1986 in support of refugees and limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities.","When immigration agents went to a roofing job site this week in Rochester, New York, they were quickly met with a crowd of protesters who came out to defend workers who stayed on the roof of a home, according to officials and advocates at the scene.

A group of men were working on the roof of a private, multifamily house when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other federal law enforcement arrived midmorning Tuesday, according to a statement to NBC News from Democratic Assemblymember Jen Lunsford, who was at the scene and spoke to witnesses there.

A local resident saw what was happening and called a rapid response network, which alerted immigration advocacy groups, protesters, faith leaders and officials who arrived at the home, Lunsford said in the statement.

Rachel Barnhart, a Monroe County legislator, told NBC News that recently ICE has been “very active” in the Western New York region and taking workers into custody. But this was the first time that the local community was alerted in real time and more than 100 people, including Barnhart, were able to come out as the event was happening, she said.

“I saw two people sitting on the roof. It was frankly heartbreaking. The ICE agents were in the backyard, and in the front, a crowd was gathering,” she said. “People were displaying hand signs to the men. They were telling them to stay strong. It was a very peaceful crowd.”

One worker was arrested, but two other men remained on the roof as protesters gathered, according to Maria Garcia, the program director of the Western New York Coalition of Farmworker Serving Agencies, a nonprofit that supports farmworkers and migrant families.

Garcia said that with the permission of the homeowner, she went onto the roof to talk with the two men and offer to speak with ICE agents on their behalf. The coalition also provided them with water and snacks as they remained on the roof.

Garcia said immigration officials told her they did not have warrants for the business, property or individuals.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that on Tuesday it arrested Jacinto Mayancela Guallpa, an Ecuadorian immigrant who the agency said was in the country illegally.

As ICE was making the arrest, two others “fled up to a rooftop and refused to come down,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.

McLaughlin said the men had confirmed to law enforcement that they did not have legal status to be in the U.S. She said an attorney for the men on the roof agreed to bring them to an ICE processing center later that day.

She described the crowd as “violent rioters” who “attempted to prevent law enforcement from exercising their sworn duties.”

“These dangerous rioters vandalized and slashed the tires of a border patrol vehicle. For their own safety, officers left the scene,” McLaughlin said.

She added that an attorney never showed up at the ICE office with the other workers. The department did not respond to a request for comment on whether the agents had a warrant.

As the immigration officials were leaving, it was discovered that someone had slashed the tires on a Border Patrol vehicle, Barnhart and others said.

Barnhart, other local officials and immigration advocates said they did not condone the slashing of the tires.

Garcia and others disputed DHS’ claim that the protesters were violent. She said the crowd was simply exercising its First Amendment rights.

“People are just hurt. They’re angry. Families are being separated. Communities are being torn apart. It becomes personal,” she said. “So I can see why it could be misconstrued, but it was peaceful all around. It was a beautiful sight to see.”

Barnhart said the crowd was “very restrained” and “peaceful.”

“There were a lot of elected officials, there were a lot of pastors, a lot of elders in the community, a lot of neighbors, community leaders,” Barnhart said.

Lunsford said in her statement that she was told the man who was arrested had a valid work permit. She was told he has been in the U.S. for 25 years with no criminal history and has a family.

“When civil rights are indiscriminately violated, it is a threat to the rights of everyone, everywhere,” she said.

Barnhart said that “people felt jubilant that ICE left, but are still horrified at what’s going on in our country right now — mass deportations and the lack of due process.”

“At least in that case, the community was able to come together in a way that was really meaningful and show solidarity,” she said.

The Trump administration sued Rochester earlier this year over its sanctuary city policies. The city first passed a resolution in 1986 in support of refugees and limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. It passed an updated resolution in 2017.

Rochester codified an expanded sanctuary city policy last month that also added protections for the LGBTQ community.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/25-826-ice-agent-ch-1117-b6bb08.jpg",N,,2025-09-11 16:57:54.666313

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

“ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement.
Students who are undocumented immigrants or live in mixed-status households are not the only youth impacted by the immigration crackdown.","When Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested a 38-year-old chiropractor while he was dropping his daughter off, they reportedly smashed out the windows of his car. The arrest, which happened on July 15, took place outside the child’s preschool in South Beaverton, Oregon. The father, originally from Iran, is married to a U.S. citizen who said he has applied for a green card to remain in the United States legally, according to Oregon Public Media.

Randy Kornfield, who witnessed the arrest while taking his grandson to the same school, told a reporter it was “heartless” to arrest a father dropping his kid off. ICE said in a statement that the child was “unharmed.”

“These poor kids don’t know what’s going on,” Kornfield said at the time.

School principal Amy Lomanto witnessed the violent arrest and managed the school’s emergency response to the incident. The arrest has led to a decrease in attendance and “has shaken our community to the core,” according to a statement from the school and a complaint filed in federal court on September 10. Along with the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers, two unions representing about 5 million educators, Lomanto is among the latest plaintiffs to join a lawsuit challenging immigration enforcement in spaces where safety is considered a sacred value, such as hospitals, houses of worships, and schools

Originally filed in April by a coalition of churches and community groups, the lawsuit challenges a Trump administration policy implemented in January that allows ICE agents to make arrests at school and churches, which were previously considered off limits. With students returning from summer break, educators and parents are calling on school boards to swiftly take steps to protect children and their families from ICE in and around schools as President Donald Trump’s accelerating mass deportation campaign spreads fear of racial profiling and state violence.

“By targeting schools, Donald Trump’s ICE is creating fear and chaos, and our students, their families and communities are paying the price for these traumatic and extreme immigration actions,” said Becky Pringle, president of the National Education Association, in a statement on September 10. “We have a professional and moral responsibility to keep our students safe.”

As the challenge makes its way through the legal system, education and racial justice advocates are searching for other ways to protect school communities from ICE. Leidy Robledo, a youth development specialist at the Alliance for Education Justice, said school leaders should demand that local police and city leaders do not work with ICE and provide staff with protocols and training for what to do if ICE agents show up at school. School officials and city leaders should also invest in counselors and after school programs for kids, not surveillance, punishment, and policing, Robledo said.

“ICE has been reported outside of schools, at bus stops, and in neighborhoods where children are walking to and from class,” Robledo said during a webinar on September 10. “For immigrant students, simply walking into school can feel like stepping into danger, and we believe that no young person should have to choose between their education and their family’s safety.”

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, issued a statement on September 9 accusing the media of “force-feeding” the public stories about children and parents being “scared to return to school” and claimed that ICE does not “raid or target schools.” The statement includes screengrabs from news reports about educators navigating fear of ICE among students and parents and preparing for potential encounters with immigration police as the new school year begins.

“ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement. “Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest.”

However, McLaughlin and DHS provided no evidence that “criminals” are using the nation’s schools as a hiding place. About 70 percent of the more than 61,000 people currently by ICE have no criminal convictions, and many others were convicted only of misdemeanors, including traffic tickets. While large-scale immigration raids have swept up people in public areas and adults at places of work, ICE is also arresting people at immigration hearings inside public buildings, and reports of ICE agents targeting parents dropping kids off at school and detaining high school students have sparked fear and confusion in communities across the country.

Students who are undocumented immigrants or live in mixed-status households are not the only youth impacted by the immigration crackdown. Adaku Onyeka-Crawford, senior attorney and director and of the Opportunity to Learn Program at Advancement Project, a civil rights group, said the Trump administration policies aimed at terrorizing immigrant families have made schools less safe for all students.

“The latest Supreme Court decision allows ICE to use racial profiling to violate the constitutional rights of Black and Latine Americans, disrupting the lives of immigrant families across the country when they should be celebrating their children at the start of the new school year,” Onyeka-Crawford said.

On September 8, the Supreme Court paused a ruling by a federal judge in Los Angeles that imposed restrictions on federal agents making immigration stops and arrests that plaintiffs and critics say amount to blatant racial profiling. The initial ruling was made on July 11 by a federal judge for the Central District of California, and barred ICE and Border Patrol agents from stopping people without “reasonable suspicion” that they are undocumented.

The judge ruled that “reasonable suspicion” cannot rest solely on any combination of four factors: “apparent race or ethnicity,” speaking in Spanish or accented English, being present at a location where immigrants “are known to gather” (such as Home Depot locations, where day laborers often come together and which have become noted areas for ICE raids), and working at specific jobs, such as landscaping or construction. The Supreme Court’s liberal justices dissented with the decision to overturn the lower court order. In a 21-page opinion. Justice Sonia Sotomayor described the decision as “yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket.”

“We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job,” Sotomayor wrote. “Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.”

Trump’s mass deportation campaign is a nationwide effort, but the administration has singled out Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and other large cities with Democratic leadership for immigration sweeps and raids, which has sparked mass protests and community self-defense efforts.

As litigation over the administration’s crackdown continues, advocates say immigrants — and people who are perceived as immigrants — are at risk of being disappeared into remote immigration jails without due process, as viral videos of masked agents making violent arrests fuel fears. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus announced a new “Learning Without Fear” campaign on September 9, an effort to call attention to drops in school registration and attendance “caused by fear of irresponsible federal immigration enforcement.” The caucus announced the campaign on social media but did not elaborate on what it would accomplish. Research shows that anxiety and fear around immigration status fuels disparities in academic achievement among students who are undocumented or live with undocumented family members.

As a result of Trump’s crackdown, children are afraid to leave home, parents are making plans in case they are disappeared, and teachers across the country are adopting protocols in case of an encounter with ICE, according to Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the immigrant rights group America’s Voice.

“This is the high cost of Trump’s mass deportation agenda — not just economic devastation, but educational chaos and psychological scarring,” Cárdenas said in a statement on Wednesday. “The worst part? It’s by design.”

Robledo said educators are stepping up to the challenge, but they need support from school boards and local political leaders, who should loudly oppose cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement.

“If one [school] district can protect immigrant youth, all districts must,” Robledo said.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2229329769-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 17:56:50.059917

On Friday, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove (D-Calif.) introduced the Limiting ICE’s Nationwide Encroachment Act (LINE Act), which would prohibit the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from sharing Medicaid records with immigration enforcement.

The bill explicitly bars the disclosure of individually identifiable health information collected through Medicaid enrollment — including home addresses and medical histories — to ICE or any other agency for immigration purposes.

Her colleague Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) rolled out the Home Together Act, which would prevent the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from disclosing public housing records for immigration enforcement. The measure also prohibits HUD from compelling local housing authorities to share resident data and requires a public accounting of any prior disclosures to immigration officials.

The twin bills arrive just weeks after the Trump administration announced new interagency agreements giving DHS unprecedented access to personal data held by HHS, CMS, and HUD. Those agreements, according to administration officials, would allow ICE to identify undocumented residents by combing through benefits databases — a move Democrats blasted as a weaponization of the social safety net.

“These bills are about drawing a line in the sand,” Kamlager-Dove said at a press conference unveiling the legislation. “Trump wants to turn doctors, nurses, and housing officials into extensions of ICE. We’re saying no. Medicaid and housing assistance exist to help families survive, not to help deport them.”

Vargas underscored the risk to families already facing a housing crisis. “If immigrants fear their housing records could be weaponized against them, they will retreat into the shadows,” he said. “That makes our communities less safe, less stable, and more unequal.”

The administration’s moves have already sparked alarm among privacy advocates. A POLITICO investigation last month found that immigration enforcement agencies are increasingly tapping into massive personal data troves — while Congress has lagged on passing comprehensive data privacy laws.

Together, the LINE Act and Home Together Act reflect an emerging Democratic strategy to blunt Trump’s deportation campaign by choking off access to federal databases — a front line in what is quickly becoming Washington’s fiercest fight over data, privacy, and immigration enforcement.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!grc7!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd501c058-323b-42d7-b201-67f9440dc44b_2560x1384.png",N,,2025-09-11 18:56:48.095749

Across August, an average of 45 ICE flights took off per day, either to deport immigrants or move them elsewhere within the United States, per the ICE Flight Monitor housed at the nonprofit Human Rights First, making it the busiest month since records began in 2020.

Newsweek reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment via email Thursday afternoon.

Why It Matters

President Donald Trump promised his administration would carry out the mass deportation of millions of illegal immigrants once he returned to the White House in January. While slow to begin with, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, gave a multi-billion-dollar boost to ICE's budget, providing funding for extra staff and detention capacity.

What To Know

ICE Flight Monitor said that between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the Trump administration carried out at least 7,454 enforcement flights, marking a 34 percent increase over the same period in 2024 when President Joe Biden was in office.

In August alone, there were 1,393 ICE flights, the data showed, with around 240 of those counted as removal, or deportation, flights out of the country. That number had only moved above 200 in May, when 209 were recorded.

The other flights included in the monitor's totals—gathered through independent tracking due to no official government data—are removal-related flights, meaning planes linking up deportation efforts, and domestic ""shuffles"", referring to ICE flights which move detainees between the agency's various detention centers.

More shuffle flights have been recorded under the Trump administration, likely due to a rapidly growing detention center line-up and a record number of ICE detainees.

Most of the flights leaving the U.S. were headed for Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and El Salvador, with nationals from those four countries making up some of the largest shares of known undocumented immigrants in the U.S. New destinations recorded under the second Trump administration included: Greece, Pakistan, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Chile, and Kazakhstan.

Human Rights First raised concerns about the conditions on board the planes, with many deportees held in handcuffs or shackles for the entire flight, which can stop off in multiple countries and last more than 30 hours.

The Trump administration has insisted that ICE detainees receive high standards of care, while also maintaining that those being deported have broken U.S. laws and must be sent home or to a third country.

What People Are Saying

Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First, in a press release: ""Behind every flight are families torn apart, people disappeared without due process, and human rights violated on an industrial scale. The Trump administration's deportation campaign is unprecedented in scope and cruelty and is a clear attack on due process, the rule of law, and overall transparency of our immigration system.""

Human Rights First President and CEO Uzra Zeya, in a press release: ""U.S. democracy is strengthened when Americans know where their tax dollars are going – in this case, a mushrooming deportation machine fueled by an unprecedented $170 billion cash infusion to DHS and its components. We need Congress and the courts to rein in this anti-democratic enforcement overreach.""

A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official on the arrests of alleged illegal immigrants in late August: ""We've said it before, and we'll keep saying it: If you come to our country illegally and break our laws, we WILL find you, arrest, you, and deport you. The days of letting dangerous criminals terrorize American citizens are over. President Trump and Secretary Noem will continue to do everything in their power to fulfill the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country.""

(AP) — A federal judge in Arizona temporarily blocked the Trump administration from removing dozens of Guatemalan and Honduran children living in shelters or foster care after coming to the U.S. alone, according to a decision Thursday.

U.S. District Judge Rosemary Márquez in Tucson extended until at least Sept. 26 a temporary restraining issued over the Labor Day weekend. Márquez raised concern over whether the government had arranged for any of the children's parents or legal guardians in Guatemala to take custody of them.

Laura Belous, attorney for the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, which represents the children, said in court that the minors had expressed no desire to be repatriated to their native countries of Guatemala and Honduras amid concerns they could face neglect, possible child trafficking or hardships associated with individual medical conditions.

Lawyers for the children said their clients have said they fear going home, and that the government is not following laws designed to protect migrant children.

A legal aid group filed a lawsuit in Arizona on behalf of 57 Guatemalan children and another 12 from Honduras between the ages 3 and 17.

Denise Ann Faulk, an assistant U.S. attorney under the Trump administration, emphasized that the child repatriations were negotiated at high diplomatic levels and would avoid lengthy prohibitions on returning to the U.S.

Nearly all the children were in the custody of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement and living at shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson areas. Similar lawsuits filed in Illinois and Washington, D.C., seek to stop the government from removing the children.

The Arizona lawsuit demands that the government allow the children their right to present their cases to an immigration judge, to have access to legal counsel and to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in their best interest.

The Trump administration has argued it is acting in the best interest of the children by trying to reunite them with their families at the behest of the Guatemalan government. After Guatemalan officials toured U.S. detention facilities, the government said that it was “very concerned” and that it would take children who wanted to return voluntarily.

Children began crossing the border alone in large numbers in 2014, peaking at 152,060 in the 2022 fiscal year. July’s arrest tally translates to an annual clip of 5,712 arrests, reflecting how illegal crossings have dropped to their lowest levels in six decades.

Guatemalans accounted for 32% of residents at government-run holding facilities last year, followed by Hondurans, Mexicans and Salvadorans. A 2008 law requires children to appear before an immigration judge with an opportunity to pursue asylum, unless they are from Canada and Mexico. The vast majority are released from shelters to parents, legal guardians or immediate family while their cases wind through court.

The Arizona lawsuit was amended to include 12 children from Honduras who have expressed to an Arizona legal aid group that they do not want to return to Honduras, as well as four additional children from Guatemala who have come into government custody in Arizona since the lawsuit was initially filed on Aug. 30.

Judge Márquez said she found it “frightening” that U.S. officials may not have coordinated with the childrens' parents. She also expressed concern that the government was denying the children access to review by an experienced immigration judge, and noted that legal representatives for the children were notified of preparations for child departures with little notice, late at night.

“On a practical matter, it just seems that a lot of these things that (the Office of Refugee Resettlement) has taken upon themselves to do — such as screening and making judicial determinations that should be made by an immigration judge with expertise and time to meet with a lawyer and meet with a child — is just surpassed by saying ‘we’re reuniting them’” with parents, Márquez said in court as she pressed Faulk for more information.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/sooleader/images/sooleader/sooleader_shareimage_1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:57:20.716122

The Trump administration’s latest ask of Congress called for a stopgap funding bill, also known as a continuing resolution (CR), to keep the lights on through January. But some Republicans worry the move would stick federal agencies with another year of flat funding.

“I just think that we get into January, get into the new year, that it’s less likely we’ll do any appropriation bills and we’ll have a yearlong CR,” Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a GOP spending cardinal, told The Hill on Tuesday.

Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), who also serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday that while he recognizes Oct. 1 “is not a doable date” for appropriators to finish their annual funding work for fiscal 2026, he’s not “prepared to support a CR that’s a long-term extension.”

GOP appropriators in both chambers have been pushing for a stopgap to last through sometime in November, at the earliest, to keep pressure on lawmakers to finish their annual funding bills.

There’s also been bipartisan interest in using the coming deadline as pressure for lawmakers to hash out a bicameral funding deal that could allow Congress to approve three of its 12 annual funding bills by the end of the month and knocking out the rest with the stopgap.

“I don’t want to take the heat off of the Senate or the House and just getting our work done,” Rounds said. “And it’s a terrible thing to do to the Department of Defense to have continuing resolutions, which don’t allow us to actually move forward with some very critical new projects.”

Talking to reporters Tuesday, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who has pitched a stopgap through part of November, was noncommittal to reporters shortly after the White House’s request for a Jan. 31 deadline when pressed about the timeline Republicans might land on for a CR.

“I think that sentiment is probably still leaning toward something shorter, and that’s pretty much on both sides, and it’s basically with the idea to keep a sense of urgency,” he said, adding he thinks there’s some flexibility on the timeline.

“We’re not going to try to do something that Democrats are opposed to. We’re not trying to jam them here. We’re trying to work together with them,” he also said.

But there is growing appetite in the party’s right flank for another yearlong stopgap, similar to the outcome of Congress’s last shutdown fight in March, in a bid to reduce government spending, and they have expressed skepticism about ongoing efforts to pass fiscal 2026 funding bills in the coming weeks.

“If we want to do a very short CR into the middle of October to see if we can negotiate that minibus, that’s fine,” Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), a senior appropriator, said ahead of the White House’s request Tuesday. “But beyond that, I think you got to go into next year.”

He also expressed doubts about efforts for a bicameral deal on the full-year fiscal 2026 funding plan for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) — the bill crafted by the Appropriations subcommittee he chairs.

“If the purpose is to see if we can negotiate a successful minibus, but again, I’m skeptical about whether that can be done on the [agricultural funding bill], in terms of the level funding issue,” he said.

The bill is one of the three full-year funding plans that Republicans have been looking to pass as part of a minibus some are hopeful will ride alongside a stopgap this month. The two bills include annual funding plans for the Department of Veterans Affairs and the legislative branch operations.

This week, top Republicans pushed for what they’ve described as a “formal conference” to negotiate the funding bills. Cole also told reporters such a move would allow for more involvement from members.

“A formal one, everybody’s involved,” he said. “You get a much better reflection.”

“If you do an informal one, basically, it’s the subcommittee chairmen negotiating, the Big Four, sorting it out,” he said, referring to the four top funding negotiators in the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle. “I would prefer much more member involvement, and I know the Speaker would.”

Congress is facing a tight crunch on legislative time. Cole also acknowledged the timing constraints the Senate could face as part of the process.

“I don’t think that’s a reasonable possibility, because time,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a senior appropriator, told The Hill on Tuesday when asked about hopes of conferencing three funding bills to pass by the end of the month.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), the upper chamber’s funding chief overseeing USDA funding, said Tuesday that discussions are ongoing at the staff level in both chambers when asked about the chances of a bicameral deal on his subcommittee’s annual funding plan.

“Our staffs are working on it right now, OK, and trying to find out all the areas of agreement between our bill and theirs and any disagreement, and if we can include them, that’d be great.”

“But yeah, I think it’s going to be challenging,” he said.

With less than 20 days standing between Congress and the month’s end, tensions only seem to be rising.

In recent days, Democrats have warned their GOP colleagues not to expect a similar outcome for this month’s funding to what Washington witnessed in March — when Senate Democrats took a beating from their base for helping Republicans pass a GOP-crafted plan to keep the government open through early fall.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/moranjerry_050825gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-11 17:56:41.181235

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-vote majority but need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster on legislation.","The House passed a bill Thursday with some bipartisan support that would boost prison sentences for migrants convicted of repeatedly entering the United States illegally or entering the country and committing a felony.

Eleven Democrats joined Republicans in a 226-197 vote to pass the legislation, which is part of a wider tough-on-immigration push from President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers.

Among other changes, the bill would set a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years, and allow up to a life sentence, for migrants who either improperly enter or attempt to improperly enter the United States and then are convicted of a felony. The bill also would increase the maximum term of imprisonment from two to five years for repeated improper entry.

Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice, who sponsored the bill, issued a statement after the vote that the measure is necessary to respond to the immigration policies of former President Joe Biden, whom conservatives have criticized for allowing an influx of migrants into the United States.

“These individuals included people from countries designated as state sponsors of terror, with 400 illegal aliens on the Terrorist Watch List being encountered at the border,” Bice said. “We must deter future illegal immigration and give our law enforcement and border patrol officers the tools they need to remove dangerous criminals.”

All 11 Democrats who voted for the bill represent battleground seats and are Republican targets next year. They were Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas; Don Davis of North Carolina; Laura Gillen of New York; Jared Golden of Maine; Vicente Gonzalez of Texas; Adam Gray of California; Kristen McDonald Rivet of Michigan; Frank J. Mrvan of Indiana; Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez of Washington; Tom Suozzi of New York; and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.

Democrats who opposed the measure said penalties are already in place for migrants who commit felonies in the United States and the legislation would bolster the harsh immigration policies of the Trump administration.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said in floor remarks that migrants who enter the country and commit heinous crimes already face state penalties such as life in prison and the death penalty.

“I understand that it might be satisfying for us to say we’re just going to increase all these penalties, but we’re not in any way connecting with the worst of the worst,” Raskin said. “What are we really doing? We’re saying that we’re going to hold people who have done nothing other than enter the country illegally for much longer periods of time, for five or 10 years. And again, we see this as very wasteful in terms of public tax dollars.”

The bill also has provisions to increase prison sentences for migrants convicted of reentry after they have been removed multiple times from the United States, or who were convicted of crimes before their removal.

Rep. Brad Knott of North Carolina, a Republican and member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said in floor remarks that the legislation “profoundly enables law enforcement to protect us” from crimes perpetuated by those who enter the United States illegally.

“No matter the type or category, all crime is made worse by illegal immigration,” Knott said. “Theft, assault, murder, drug trafficking, human trafficking, violent crime, property crime, you name it. Illegal immigration makes it worse. What is perhaps most unfortunate is that many of the worst offenders in this specific category return to the United States after being deported due to gaps in the current immigration law.”

Knott, a former prosecutor, said he saw in that role that the deportation process alone was insufficient to stop migrants who seek to come into the United States for illegal purposes.

“I have investigated, tried and convicted many individuals who have been deported two times, three times, four times, and some even beyond 10 times, yet they continue to illegally return with the sole intent,” Knott said.

The bill now heads to the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-vote majority but need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster on legislation. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has introduced a companion bill, also known as Kate’s Law.

In response, some protesters started Occupy ICE LA, a 24-hour protest collective set up across the street from the detention center, which documents and accosts DHS agents throughout the day.
According to the LAPD’s Central Division X account, the LAPD arrested eight people for “various offenses,” and no one was injured during the unlawful assembly.","Homeland Security agents deployed less-lethal weapons at anti-ICE protesters at the Metropolitan Detention Center in the evening following a Labor Day sit-in at City Hall, resulting in eight arrests, one person requiring an ambulance, and multiple injured protesters and journalists.

“This is fascism on display,” said Joe Harmon, a teacher who Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents arrested at the protest. “You have people, the most vulnerable people in our society, including a lot of my students, being affected by all the Trump nonsense. And these guys are here (National Guardsmen), willingly or not, defending it.”

According to Harmon, he was arrested for failing to comply with an order; an agent told him to move from a bollard on the sidewalk and he refused, remarking that it was a public sidewalk. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Response Unit responded by swarming Harmon, firing less-lethal rounds into the crowd as he fled.

The sound of projectile launchers and federal agents yelling conflicting orders disoriented the space. Protesters ran as rubber bullets flew by and pelted people on the head.

Kea Lane, who claims ICE is “kidnapping and disappearing” her community members, said this occurrence is common. Lane is an activist who routinely attends the 24-hour protest at the detention center.

“They target specific protesters they deem to be threats, regardless of what they’ve done. They make untruthful claims and charges against people,” Lane said.

Since June, DHS — with National Guardsmen on standby — has skirmished almost nightly with protesters outside the detention center, a migrant-holding facility, in response to mass deportation efforts in Los Angeles County.

In response, some protesters started Occupy ICE LA, a 24-hour protest collective set up across the street from the detention center, which documents and accosts DHS agents throughout the day.

Protesters haven’t left the encampment in weeks despite almost nightly skirmishes with DHS and multiple removals by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).

According to LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell, the LAPD doesn’t assist with immigration enforcement and hasn’t since 1979. In a June press statement, McDonnell reiterated the policy to “make it clear.”

Since then, the LAPD has regularly dispersed anti-ICE protests, including at ICE immigration raids. DHS started mass deportations sweeps in Los Angeles County by arresting 44 migrants on June 6; this was followed by additional raids targeting farm workers, day laborers and street vendors. ICE is also appearing at schools, churches, and mandated immigration check-ins at federal facilities.

Occupy ICE LA held a sit-in at City Hall at 4 p.m. before marching through downtown. Activists delivered speeches on the lawn regarding ICE, the Palestinian genocide in Gaza by Israel, as per the International Association of Genocide Scholars, and the struggle of Indigenous people.

According to Trisden Shaw, a professor of ethnic studies at Santa Monica College, these topics are interlinked through colonialism. Shaw said the U.S. dominates the world through colonization, which is why the country is militarily involved in different places.

On the South Lawn, an activist who has been involved in the Abolish ICE movement since 2018 said during a speech, “I have never seen the amount of aggression that I’ve seen at these protests.” He called them “mercenaries” and demanded ICE to “get the fuck out of L.A.,” before telling the crowd they should be concerned.

“Even if you’re not directly affected by it, it is your problem. It’s your issue because this is more than just an immigration issue; this is a human rights issue,” he said. “People’s human rights are being violated left and right.” This protester was later arrested.

After the speeches, protesters spilled onto west First Street in front of the LAPD Headquarters. Protesters displayed their signs, waved flags and danced alongside the road.

People on motorcycles dashed around the street, performing burnouts and wheelies to a crowd of cheering protesters. Incoming traffic honked and drivers raised fists in solidarity as they drove by. Protesters chanted and marched towards the detention center around 7 p.m.

A few people banged, kicked, and rattled the newly installed black, metal, anti-climb fence at the detention center, but most just shouted from the street. One protester shot a firework, while another kicked the gate until it opened. People cheered and mocked as DHS approached, but most maintained their distance, and no one stepped onto federal property.

According to Shaw, “a peaceful protest can be deemed violent very quickly. Repressive and violent actions from police could spiral out of control quickly. Organizers have to ensure that people aren’t reacting, but human beings are human beings. One action is enough to deem it a violent protest; when that label comes, it opens the floodgates for tear gas, rubber bullets.”

A man holding a Mexican American flag helped close the gate. Then, a DHS agent fired a pepper ball, a hard plastic sphere filled with a chemical irritant that bursts on impact, into the fence, covering protesters in irritant.

Protesters fled, seeking cover, but they returned to the gate, yelling “peaceful protest.”

After a DHS agent fired a pepper ball, two protesters jumped on the fence, catching agents’ attention, and raised their middle fingers in opposition before spray-painting “Fuck ICE” under fire. Protesters threw water bottles from the crowd as pepper bullets exploded off the fence, with some pepper balls making it through and hitting non-protester cars idling in traffic.

DHS and ICE’s Special Response Team then moved onto the sidewalk to commence dispersal tactics on the other side of the fence. Most protesters retreated and journalists wearing “PRESS” markings moved forward, waiting for action. Before coming out, one federal agent stuck his arm out of the gate and pepper-sprayed the vicinity, including identifiable journalists.

Protesters threw stink bombs at the agents’ feet as they exploded out of the gate, ambushing people and shooting less-lethal rounds into the crowd.

“They were shooting at innocent protesters, innocent civilians, who came up to document them violently detaining and snatching people off the street,” Lane said. “This should be far past the point of alarming.”

Protesters managed to lift a fence panel off its hinges and lay it on the floor during a skirmish. A person with a megaphone then jumped on top of the panel and said, “Look at this shit, they couldn’t even get a better fucking fence.”

DHS and protesters skirmished for hours. Agents would explode out of the gate and swarm the crowd, tackling people and creating mass panic before retreating. Women with megaphones walked up to the DHS skirmish line and called agents “cowards,” “slave catchers,” and “human traffickers.”

LAPD arrived before 10 p.m. and declared an unlawful assembly. Officers set a perimeter on the intersection of North Alameda and East Aliso Street, then formed a rolling police line, carrying plastic handcuffs and 40-millimeter sponge round launchers. They pushed protesters towards East Temple Street, away from the detention center, shouting “move,” as they stepped in unison.

Protesters yelled, “You’re not supposed to be helping them,” “The bad guys are behind you,” and “Why don’t you care about them shooting us?”

LAPD officers shouted at protesters and threatened to arrest journalists for not complying with the dispersal order, despite a still-standing temporary restraining order (TRO) granting increased protections to journalists.

According to federal U.S. District Judge Hernan Vera’s order, “the likelihood of repeated confrontations” coupled with the LAPD’s “sustained pattern of conduct,” merited the TRO. LAPD can’t restrict journalists’ movement, shoot them with less-lethal weapons or obstruct, assault or arrest journalists during protests.

William Gude, known online as Film the Police LA, recorded an LAPD sergeant disregarding the TRO. Gude later identified the sergeant as Jose L. Vazquez from the Hollenbeck Division after he refused to identify himself and didn’t have it displayed on his helmet.

Gude reminded Vazquez of the court exemptions for journalists. Vazquez said, “It doesn’t matter right now,” and threatened to arrest Gude.

The confrontation caught the attention of an LAPD captain, who corrected Vazquez after he refused to let Gude talk to a superior officer.

“You’re absolutely right,” the captain said to Gude. Vazquez protested before waving off the captain and walking away.

Most protesters left around 10 p.m., but some people stayed across the street. Both parties stood still, facing off on different street corners. And in quick, random bursts, a dozen officers sprinted across the corner and arrested people.

In one instance, police chased a man who evaded them. While returning, an officer found an older woman huddled in a dark alleyway. Officers swarmed and arrested her. They later arrested another protester who smiled and laughed as LAPD officers escorted him away.

According to the LAPD’s Central Division X account, the LAPD arrested eight people for “various offenses,” and no one was injured during the unlawful assembly. LAPD and the officials at the detention center declined the Corsair’s request for comment.

The freedom of protest is the right to assembly and petition. These are guaranteed protections under the First Amendment in the United States, but it “Doesn’t always play out that way,” according to Shaw. Sometimes protesters don’t get what they want.

As of August 2025, ICE Flight Monitor is officially housed at HRF.","Washington, D.C. — A new report released today by ICE Flight Monitor, housed at Human Rights First, reveals that August 2025 marked a record-high number of U.S. immigration enforcement flights, underscoring the unprecedented scale and intensity of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.

The latest report documents at least 1,393 immigration enforcement flights in August alone—an average of 45 flights every day—the highest monthly total ever recorded since tracking began in 2020. In total, between January 20 and August 31, 2025, the administration carried out at least 7,454 flights, a 34 percent increase compared to the same period in 2024.

“These numbers are absolutely staggering and deeply concerning in light of their connection to the increased arrests, detentions, and removals of people in our communities,” said Savi Arvey, Director of Research and Analysis, Refugee Protection at Human Rights First. “Behind every flight are families torn apart, people disappeared without due process, and human rights violated on an industrial scale. The Trump administration’s deportation campaign is unprecedented in scope and cruelty and is a clear attack on due process, the rule of law, and overall transparency of our immigration system.”

Human Rights First President and CEO Uzra Zeya added, “In the face of escalating harms perpetrated against immigrants throughout the United States, ICE Flight Monitor is an essential tool for transparency and holding our government to account. U.S. democracy is strengthened when Americans know where their tax dollars are going – in this case, a mushrooming deportation machine fueled by an unprecedented $170 billion cash infusion to DHS and its components. We need Congress and the courts to rein in this anti-democratic enforcement overreach.”

Additional key findings in the August report, include:

Increase in Removal Flights: At least 240 removal flights took place in August 2025, driven largely by an increase in flights to Mexico. The Trump administration has now carried out at least 1,279 removal flights since returning to office—20 percent more than during the same period last year.

New Destinations and Increased Multi-Country Flights: The Trump administration has sent removal flights to at least 66 countries, including first-time flights to Greece, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. It also expanded multi-country flights, where people remain shackled for days across multiple stops.

Third Country Transfers: In August, ICE Flight Monitor tracked the first deportation flight to Rwanda under a newly established U.S.–Rwanda agreement, part of a broader expansion of third-country removals.

Increased Domestic Transfer Flights: The administration conducted at least 805 domestic detention transfer flights in August 2025 alone, including 81 flights to offshore detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, where individuals are held in isolated detention facilities on the military base.

The report warns that these practices, many of which federal courts have already deemed unlawful, not only endanger vulnerable people but also erode democratic accountability.

(AP) — Immigrant detainees have started arriving at a former Tennessee prison that’s been turned into a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, the facility’s operator said.

CoreCivic Inc. said late Wednesday that it has begun receiving detainees at the West Tennessee Detention Facility in the rural town of Mason, located about 40 miles (60 kilometers) northeast of Memphis.

The arrivals come after Mason officials approved agreements with ICE and CoreCivic on Aug. 12, despite loud objections from upset residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.

For years, the prison served as an important economic engine for Mason. It was closed in 2021 after President Joe Biden ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to stop renewing contracts with certain detention facilities. President Donald Trump reversed that order in January.

The contracts were approved amid a push by Trump for mass deportations of immigrants. Trump has touted a detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” where allegations of mistreatment of detainees have drawn lawsuits from civil rights advocates and environmental groups.

Opponents of the Tennessee detention center, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, have expressed concerns that detainees could be subjected to abuse and neglect.

Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman has said the ICE facility will bring jobs and economic development to the town, which has struggled with financial problems and needs infrastructure improvements.

The ICE facility is expected to create nearly 240 new jobs, including positions for detention officers at a pay rate of $26.50 per hour, according to CoreCivic. The facility would also generate about $325,000 in annual property tax revenue and $200,000 in an annual fee for Mason that could be used for schools, infrastructure improvements and other projects, the company has said.

In 2022, Mason reached a deal with the state of Tennessee after it attempted to take over the city’s finances following years of alleged mismanagement. Some members of the public who spoke at the August meeting said Mason is a majority-Black town with a history of being ignored and treated with disrespect.

Tennessee’s corrections agency has fined CoreCivic $44.7 million across four prisons for violations from 2022 through February, including for understaffing. Records obtained by AP also show the company has spent more than $4.4 million to settle about 80 lawsuits and out-of-court complaints alleging mistreatment — including at least 22 inmate deaths — at four Tennessee prisons and two jails from 2016 through September 2024.

The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge’s finding that National Guard members were illegally used for civilian law enforcement.","Three months after the Trump administration first sent troops to Los Angeles, a federal judge ruled that their National Guard deployment was illegal. As President Trump considers extending the federal takeover of Washington D.C. and ordering troops to Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans, LA residents are still recovering from the public safety, economic, and social impacts of this deployment – illustrating what may be in store for other major U.S. cities soon.

Why did Trump send troops to LA?

This spring, federal immigration enforcement in the LA region skyrocketed, with immigration arrests quadrupling between April and June. Immigrants without criminal convictions made up an increasing share of monthly arrests, jumping from 35 to 69% and challenging the Trump administration’s claims of targeting criminals for deportation. Evidence of racial profiling by federal immigration officers in LA initially resulted in a court order barring them from stopping someone based solely on race, language, job, or location, which the U.S. Supreme Court later overruled.

In early June, protests emerged in pockets of LA, following weeks of escalating immigration raids across the city, reports of inhumane detention conditions, and racial profiling concerns. Local officials, responding to isolated clashes between local law enforcement and some protestors, issued overnight curfews in downtown LA as they worked to lower tensions. Over objections from local and state leaders, President Trump then deployed 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA, ostensibly to protect federal personnel and property from protestors.

How did troops impact public safety?

By August, the Trump administration removed all but 250 troops from LA, claiming victory and restored public safety. The operation resulted in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charging just 26 individuals for crimes relating to protests over immigration raids. Notably, DOJ prosecutors dismissed eight of these charges shortly after filing, five because of false statements made by U.S. immigration officials. As the dust settles, it’s also clearer how this deployment posed its own threats to public safety, both during the protests and beyond.

From the start, state and local officials in California pushed back against the deployment as unnecessary and inflammatory. Even at the height of the protests, LA Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell insisted that, “We’re nowhere near a level where we would be reaching out to the governor for the National Guard.”

It marked the first time since the 1960s that the National Guard was deployed without a governor’s consent. Governor Gavin Newsom later sued the Trump administration, claiming in separate filings that the deployment unlawfully bypassed the governor’s permission and violated federal law by using troops for civilian law enforcement. Critics of the deployment emphasized it undermined public safety by escalating local tensions, diverting National Guard resources from critical work, including counterdrug operations, intimidating communities, and eroding public trust in the U.S. military.

Records disclosed in court unveiled that U.S. military leaders shared major concerns about this deployment and questioned whether troops were adequately trained for a domestic operation. They noted the operation could spur new protests, posing a significant risk to both LA residents and troops. National Guard members themselves also voiced concerns about being sent to LA with reports of decreased troop morale, amid a lack of work to do, and concerns over how the deployment could hurt military recruitment efforts for the next several years.

Who bears the costs of this deployment?

The U.S. Department of Defense initially estimated that the deployments would cost U.S. taxpayers at least $134 million. The operation’s exact costs remain undisclosed, with requests pending from California’s U.S. senators and governor to the federal government to get a more accurate picture of official expenses. In the meantime, Governor Newson’s office produced their own estimates, reporting $120 million in deployment costs so far.

This price tag for American taxpayers, however, is only a fraction of the full costs of the deployment.

In California, residents shoulder additional economic and social impacts, between the increase in immigration enforcement actions and the military deployment. Small businesses throughout LA are hurting from steep declines in foot traffic and sales. Employees weigh the risks of showing up to work, student attendance is in decline, and healthcare visits by immigrant patients have dropped off. The vibrancy of the city has become duller this summer, as communities are gripped by fear.

What comes next?

From the original 4,100 troops, now 250 National Guard troops remain in LA as the state’s lawsuit against the deployment continues. The Trump administration has appealed a federal judge’s finding that National Guard members were illegally used for civilian law enforcement. Locally, LA city and county officials are launching funds to help communities rebuild from raids and city leaders have established new school protection measures for immigrant families.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Shutterstock_2640406581.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 13:57:22.840841

As a result of these findings, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) agreements with both counties.
The reimplementation of the 287(g) TFM may open the gates to new remedies against illegal immigration enforcement actions.
Publicized incidents of civil rights violations have led to political pressure prompting sheriffs to leave the 287(g) agreement or be ousted at the ballot box.
Harrison ran again in 2022 and notably campaigned on the promise of not rejoining the 287(g) agreement.","On Sept. 8, the Supreme Court stayed a district court injunction that had found Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents violated the Fourth Amendment by relying solely on an individual’s race and ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, location (such as a car wash or bus stop), and type of work as grounds for immigration arrests. The reversal permits ICE agents, at least in Los Angeles, to treat these factors as sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion of unlawful status.

In the sole concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh characterized the encounters with ICE as “brief investigative stops” during which agents “promptly let the individual go” if they learn that the individual being questioned is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the country. This account is inconsistent with the increasing incidents of ICE agents violently detaining and arresting U.S. citizens, at times resulting in their wrongful detention for weeks. And while Kavanaugh’s opinion suggests that remedies remain available for any Fourth Amendment violations that occur during these raids, in practice, ICE agents and the agencies that oversee them remain largely insulated from legal accountability.

Federal agents, however, are not operating alone. While ICE is bolstering its reach with a recently expanded budget, it still lacks the capacity to achieve Trump’s goal of 1,000,000 ICE deportations in his first year. Given this, the administration has enlisted the help of sheriffs across the country by reimplementing the 287(g) Task Force Model (TFM) program—which authorizes local law enforcement officers to function as federal immigration agents—for the first time since it was disbanded for violation of civil rights in 2012.

Unlike ICE, these local agencies are not immune from liability. The return of the 287(g) TFM opens a critical legal avenue for civil suits against sheriffs and municipalities whose officers violate the law, serving as a method of recourse for individuals and a necessary check against potential overreach by the Trump administration.

The 287(g) Program

The 287(g) program was created in 1996 through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA), an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). It was designed to provide ICE with a “force multiplier” by permitting state and local police to assist in immigration enforcement. More specifically, it allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into formal agreements with state and local agencies, which deputize officers to carry out certain immigration enforcement functions, including interrogating individuals about their immigration status, issuing detainers, and initiating removal proceedings.

Initially, the program operated through three models: the Jail Enforcement Model (JEM), the Task Force Model (TFM), and the Hybrid Model (HM). The JEM permits law enforcement to interrogate and assist in the removal of noncitizens already in federal custody. The TFM, in turn, allows officers to proactively identify, question, detain, and arrest individuals based on suspected immigration violations during patrols in the community. And the HM gave officers the authority to perform immigration enforcement duties under the JEM and TFM. The government terminated the TFM in 2012 for civil rights violations but continued the JEM. The fundamental civil rights issue with the TFM is its structure: Officers are instructed to seek out noncitizens, but unlike criminal behavior, immigration status is not readily observable. Without clear markers of legal status, race can easily act as a proxy for suspicion of legal status. Officers who carry out the TFM, like all other officers, cannot use race as the sole factor to stop and question an individual. They are bound by federal, state, and local laws that stipulate that “reasonable suspicion,” required for detainment, cannot be built solely on race.

Later, in 2019, the government introduced the new Warrant Service Officer Model (WSOM), which allows local officers to execute ICE immigration warrants on already incarcerated individuals. Despite civil rights concerns, days after beginning his second term, President Trump reinstated the TFM in its original form, reigniting civil rights concerns that led to its previous termination. Unlike the other 287(g) models, the TFM allows local officers to initiate immigration enforcement during routine patrols, absent an ICE warrant or underlying criminal custody. This degree of discretion heightens the potential for racial profiling and other forms of unlawful detainment or imprisonment.

A History of the Program’s Civil Rights Violations

Various Department of Justice investigations have documented patterns of civil rights abuse by sheriff’s offices that implemented the TFM. For example, a 2011 Justice Department investigation concluded that the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office in Arizona “engaged in a pattern or practice of misconduct that violated the Constitution and federal law” in its execution of the 287(g) task force. This included sending dozens of officers to predominantly Latino neighborhoods to make minor traffic stops with the ultimate goal of questioning individuals’ legal status and turning them over to ICE (resulting in a 9-to-1 racial disparity in traffic stops). In a separate 2012 investigation, the Justice Department found similar violations in Alamance County, North Carolina. There, investigators determined that sheriff’s deputies were instructed to “go hunting” for Latino individuals and to set up checkpoints in front of Latino churches and businesses. As a result of these findings, the Department of Homeland Security terminated its 287(g) agreements with both counties.

Oversight Challenges

The risk of civil rights violations is compounded by the lack of proper training and oversight, as documented by governmental oversight agencies. A 2009 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report criticized ICE for failing to articulate goals for the program and how local partners were to use their 287(g) authority. Deputized officers did not receive adequate training, and ICE failed to evaluate whether participating agencies complied with the agreements.

A 2010 report from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that ICE and its local law enforcement partners had not complied with the terms of their 287(g) agreements. It determined that the standards by which deputized officers were assessed contradicted the stated objectives of the 287(g) program, that the program was poorly supervised by ICE, and that additional oversight was necessary.

Following the 2009 GAO report, the Department of Homeland Security established an advisory board to evaluate agency applicants and vote on whether they should be accepted. This board included a representative from the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties who monitored and advised agencies’ histories of civil rights abuses, acting as a safeguard against partnerships with those that had poor records. President Trump dissolved this board in early 2025, clearing the path for all law enforcement agencies, regardless of patterns of misconduct, to enter into an agreement.

Even as the TFM remained inactive for over a decade, the JEM and WSOM continued to suffer from inadequate oversight. A 2018 OIG report found that ICE was not ensuring that deputized officers completed required training. A 2021 GAO report found that ICE had failed to establish performance goals for the JEM and WSO 287(g) program. As of June 2025, ICE has not taken actions necessary to satisfy the recommendations from GAO, raising red flags about its ability to manage a more expansive, field-based enforcement model such as the TFM.

Additionally, while deputized TFM officers are currently required to undergo four weeks of training before going out into the field, “border czar” Tom Homan announced in February that he intends to cut the training period down to about one week.

Recourse Under 287(g) Task Force

Typically, there is little or no recourse for individuals whose rights are violated by immigration officials. Patrolling for illegal immigrants has historically been carried out by federal officers, including ICE. The Supreme Court, in its 1971 Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents decision, recognized an implied cause of action against federal officers for damages arising from the Constitution, terming it a “Bivens action.” In 1980, the Court stopped extending the theory to new factual scenarios, and since 1983, the Court has retreated from the theory altogether. In 2017, the Court narrowed the scope of Bivens claims to cases that have the same facts as prior cases and that do not involve any special factors that were not present in those prior cases. In the 2022 case Egbert v. Boule, the Court collapsed this new test into one question: “whether there is any reason to think that Congress might be better equipped to create a damages remedy.” As a result, under current law, individuals who violate constitutional rights while acting under federal authority are effectively immune from civil liability.

The reimplementation of the 287(g) TFM may open the gates to new remedies against illegal immigration enforcement actions. While the individual deputized officers are “considered to be acting under color of federal authority for purposes of determining the liability, and immunity from suit,” the local agencies and municipalities that oversee deputized officers are not afforded the same protections. By entering these agreements, sheriffs, counties, and municipalities may be held liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a federal statute that allows individuals to sue state and local officials for constitutional violations, when the plaintiffs’ injuries stem from policies or customs of the law enforcement agency. They may also face liability under state tort law. Many states have tort frameworks that mirror § 1983, allowing broad liability for agencies or municipalities. Some state constitutions protect rights beyond those recognized by the U.S. Constitution, thereby expanding the scope of actionable claims. For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2020 that the state constitution requires a warrant for persistent surveillance outside a home using a pole camera, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has found such surveillance permissible under the federal Constitution. Additionally, in 2017, the Iowa State Supreme Court ruled that an officer must terminate a valid traffic stop when the underlying suspicion is no longer present, and cannot go on to demand identification. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has determined that officers can check identification even when the suspicion for the stop has dissipated so long as it does not measurably extend the stop’s duration.

The legality of suing local agencies and municipalities for TFM actions is evidenced by the litigation against the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, which ultimately cost the county over $300 million in settlements. Even the more restrained JEM and WSOM have produced costly lawsuits for municipalities and sheriff’s departments. Those that have paid plaintiffs for civil rights abuses in the past several years include the Monroe County sheriff, El Paso County, San Juan County, Los Angeles County, Plymouth County, Henrico County, Nobles County, Allegheny County, Lehigh County, Bexar County, and Arapahoe County. This year, a federal judge ruled that Suffolk County could be held liable for up to $60 million in damages for officers’ execution of unlawful immigration detainers, and another judge found that Monroe County Sheriff Rick Ramsay violated a U.S. citizen’s rights by holding him on an ICE detainer.

Lawsuits can act as a deterrent to police departments’ participation in the 287(g) TFM through two primary and interrelated mechanisms: financial consequences and public pressure. Police agencies generally have the choice to enter into these agreements, and when the cost is too high, they may choose to opt out entirely or adopt stricter policies and training to ensure that their officers will not violate constitutional norms.

Municipalities nationwide generally purchase insurance to indemnify themselves against liability for the acts of their law enforcement officers. These insurance policies shield them from financial responsibility in civil lawsuits. Because insurers control both the availability and the cost of coverage, they hold significant influence over police department practices. Insurance companies frequently leverage this power by requiring policy or procedural changes when they identify patterns of risk. Following high numbers of civil rights lawsuits, insurers typically raise their rates, demand changes in law enforcement personnel and policies as a condition of continued coverage, and, in some cases, remove coverage altogether. If the TFM model produces a surge in lawsuits, insurers are likely to respond with a demand in policy shift, induce higher rates, or reduce coverage, all of which may prompt agencies to reconsider their participation in the program.

Publicized incidents of civil rights violations have led to political pressure prompting sheriffs to leave the 287(g) agreement or be ousted at the ballot box. For example, Plymouth County (Massachusetts) Sheriff Joseph McDonald chose not to renew his office’s 287(g) agreement in 2020 following a suit from a coalition of civil rights groups. Donnie Harrison—who served as the sheriff for Wake County, North Carolina, from 2002 to2018, and first implemented the 287(g) program in 2007—lost his 2018 bid for reelection after his support for the WSOM and JEM became a focal point of the race. Harrison ran again in 2022 and notably campaigned on the promise of not rejoining the 287(g) agreement. What’s more, Joe Arpaio was Maricopa County’s longest serving sheriff. He was ousted in 2016 by a Democratic challenger following the numerous lawsuits against the department for violations of civil rights in its implementation of the 287(g) program, both when it had 287(g) authority and after Homeland Security ended their agreement. The following year, Arpaio was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for violating a federal judge’s order to stop racially profiling Latinos in traffic stops while he was sheriff.

When the TFM was first suspended in 2012, only 27 law enforcement agencies had active agreements with Homeland Security. As of July, that number has increased to an unprecedented 473 with an additional 12 pending agreements. To meet President Trump’s ambitious deportation goals, even more local agencies will likely need to join.

While the reinstatement and expansion of the program, with its history of abuse and minimal oversight, raises the danger of widespread rights violations, it also provides a novel avenue for accountability. Pursuing civil lawsuits against rights violations by local law enforcement will act as a safeguard against unlawful immigration enforcement practices and ensure the protection of civil liberties.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-11 14:57:10.262674

In July, Attorney General Ellison joined 20 other attorneys general in challenging the federal government’s reinterpretation of a decades-old law governing access to social services. A federal court granted the coalition’s request for a preliminary injunction, blocking sweeping new rules that threatened to strip funding from programs like Head Start, Title X family planning clinics, food banks, domestic violence shelters, adult education, and community health centers.

""Cutting off essential social services to people who cannot prove their immigration status is cruel and would have caused immense harm to folks across Minnesota, including kids from low-income families,” said Attorney General Ellison. “It is morally wrong to turn a child away from a food bank because of their family’s immigration status, and I’m pleased to have stopped the Trump Administration from doing exactly that. I don’t believe in the politics of division and cruelty, and most Minnesotans don’t either. We’re a state that believes in helping one another and treating others with respect, and that’s exactly what I will continue fighting for as your attorney general.”

Earlier this summer, four federal agencies – the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Education (ED), Labor (DOL), and Justice (DOJ) – issued a coordinated set of directives abruptly redefining longstanding policy under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA). For nearly 30 years, Republican and Democratic administrations alike interpreted PRWORA to allow states to offer vital public health, education, and anti-poverty programs regardless of immigration status. The Trump administration’s sudden reversal would have forced states to impose immigration status verification on countless services, threatening catastrophic funding losses and program closures.

The court’s decision halts implementation of those new directives in the plaintiff states while litigation proceeds, ensuring that millions of families can continue to access critical services without fear of denial or disruption. With this ruling, the judge is acknowledging that the administration likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by issuing sweeping new mandates without lawful rulemaking, grossly misreading PRWORA, and failing to consider the devastating impacts on states and communities.

In Minnesota, the changes to social services were expected to affect a variety of programs. One of the most prominent is Head Start, an early education program for low-income families that provides comprehensive services ranging from school readiness to parental engagement to nutrition and more. Another of the programs expected to be targeted funds the operation of shelters for homeless individuals, provides services for residents of those shelters, rapidly re-houses families to prevent them from becoming homeless, and more. Delivery time for some of these services, like emergency shelter during life-threatening weather conditions, can make the difference between life and death. Delaying these services to verify immigration status could have a devastating impact on recipients. Furthermore, given the transient nature of homelessness, many of the individuals served by this particular program do not have documentation of any kind.

I’m grateful to those of you who are already paid subscribers, and I hope that those of you who aren’t will consider a paid subscription if and when your circumstances permit:

The Court has already made a lot of news this week, but Justice Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Monday’s otherwise-unexplained stay in the ICE roving patrols case (Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo) is a truly remarkable writing in any number of respects. And although I feel a little bad for devoting yet another issue of the newsletter specifically to Kavanaugh, he is, to his genuine credit, the only justice in the majority who seems interested in publicly defending the Court’s (or, at least, his) behavior in these cases. That is a good thing, and I’ve devoted plenty of (virtual) ink to why the other justices need to be writing. But it should follow that the writings ought to be at least somewhat persuasive. Whatever Justice Kavanaugh was trying to accomplish here, it’s hard to conclude anything other than that it fails.

Below the fold, I walk through Kavanaugh’s concurrence one argument at a time—in an effort to show exactly how he ends up in such a radically different place from both the district court and the unanimous court of appeals panel, albeit without making any effort to explain why those four judges were (all) wrong. Some of it is because of slipperiness with the facts; some of it is because of slipperiness with the relevant precedents. Some of it is because Kavanaugh seems to think things are true doctrinally that (in some cases, thanks to him), just aren’t. But what it all drives home is how much the justices in the majority in these cases seem to be twisting themselves—to say nothing of the facts and/or the law—into pretzels in order to rule for the Trump administration.

To be sure, there are far more overt ways in which the justices have shown disrespect toward lower courts in their recent spate of rulings on Trump-related emergency applications. But just because this one is more subtle doesn’t make it any less serious—or any more defensible.

California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision Wednesday by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling Wednesday, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s Office. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” she said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of Wednesday’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.

In a new twist, on September 5, 2025, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, holding that DHS' revocation of the 2023 Venezuela TPS designation, and a partial revocation of a TPS designation for Haiti, violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Venezuelan and Haitian TPS beneficiaries cannot celebrate yet, however. DHS immediately moved for a stay pending appeal, which the district court has not decided.

""We're going to be announcing another city that we're going to very shortly,"" he said after dining at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. ""We're working it out with the governor of a certain state that would love us to be there, and the mayor of a certain city in that same state would love us to be there.

With the president suggesting another city could see a National Guard instead, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's sources inside the White House have signaled Chicago might no longer be the primary focus of the Trump administration's National Guard effort.

""They're not calling us now, which I think is a good sign. It is a sign that they are not hearing things that are suspiciously like we're going to see military troops coming,"" Pritzker said. ""I take it that the silence of the last day or two from those folks is an indication that maybe there's some other place or other focus that the president is putting his attention.""

Pritzker said it's a good sign a troop deployment isn't imminent in Chicago, but stressed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement efforts in Chicago are just getting started, with agents netting more than a dozen arrests in recent days.

On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security touted the arrests of 13 people as part of ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

""In just the last few days in Chicago, ICE has arrested pedophiles, rapists, abusers, armed robbers, and other violent thugs,"" Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the federal government still has not provided any official communication with the city on their immigration crackdown in Chicago.

""Nothing has been communicated with us, and that's what the problem has been,"" he said.

Johnson said the rollout of a new website will be coming soon to help anyone in Chicago feeling under pressure by ICE raids.

In Pilsen, box trucks have been spotted with large video boards displaying scrolling ""know your rights"" messages to equip residents with information in case ICE knocks on their door.

Illinois leaders said they're hopeful the president's threatened National Guard rollout has been delayed or canceled, while reiterating the ICE efforts are just getting going.

""They clearly have not gone out in full force yet here, with seemingly the number of people from ICE that they intended to have on the ground working. We haven't seen all of those folks yet, but I anticipate that we will,"" Pritzker said.

Pritzker said, to his knowledge, approximately 200 ICE agents and 100 ICE vehicles have been deployed in and around Chicago in recent days.

As for Chicago apparently being put on the back burner of the president's National Guard deployments, Pritzker said it's good news, but he's not convinced the White House won't send troops in eventually.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/09/02/f97644f1-61b3-411f-a684-6449800ecdd7/thumbnail/1200x630/9412dfb1290062610b8bbb7a066d3236/cbsn-fusion-judge-says-trump-administration-violated-federal-law-with-la-national-guard-deployment-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 12:57:38.095885

As President Trump’s immigration crackdown intensifies, many immigrants who have lived, worked and paid taxes in the United States for years are getting snatched by masked agents and disappeared into a vast network of jails across the country.

In Vermont, a small but growing group of young attorneys have thrown themselves into the fight to defend the immigrants’ rights. Newly minted lawyers, including recent graduates of Vermont Law and Graduate School, are now going head to head with lawyers from Trump’s Justice Department.

The attorneys have been going into Vermont’s jails and encountering terrified immigrants, many of whom are being repeatedly shuffled between states in what appears to be a deliberate effort to frustrate their attempts to obtain effective legal representation. Some detainees do not even know where they are.

Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (VAAP), headed by immigration attorney Jill Martin Diaz, has been a driving force behind the effort to mobilize lawyers and defend immigrants. VAAP has grown from one staff member in 2024 to what will be a staff of eight by November, including four new attorneys who are part of the national Immigrant Justice Corps. VAAP recently received a $100,000 grant from the recently established Vermont Immigration Legal Defense Fund to hire staff, bring in attorneys and train Vermont lawyers to handle immigration cases.

Martin Diaz formerly taught immigration law at Vermont Law and Graduate School, directed its Center for Justice Reform Clinic and practiced at Vermont Legal Aid. They currently are a lecturer in the department of social work at the University of Vermont. In 2023, Martin Diaz was named by the LGBTQ+ Bar Association as one of the 40 best LGBTQ+ lawyers under 40.

I visited VAAP’s headquarters in Burlington, where I interviewed Martin Diaz, staff attorney Leah Brenner and volunteer staff attorney Andy Pelcher.

“I’m looking around at our office that’s not even unpacked and we barely have lights and WiFi. How are we holding our own against Trump’s Department of Justice that just got a big, beautiful raise?” marveled Martin Diaz, who described fighting the Trump administration as akin to David vs. Goliath.

Martin Diaz said that immigrants are “canaries in the coal mine.”

“People are really starting to look at what’s going on in the immigration system as a microcosm for what could happen to our democracy if left unchecked, not just for noncitizens, but for everyone.”

Pelcher, who graduated Vermont Law and Graduate School in 2018 and went on to get an LLM, or master of laws, described a recent visit to Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans, where he encountered a Palestinian man who was a survivor of torture who “had been bounced around to a number of facilities during the 14 months that he had been detained.” Somehow he landed in a Vermont jail.

“People are being frequently transferred from facility to facility, seemingly as a means to deny access to counsel, family, local networks of support, and any other means by which these individuals can meaningfully prepare for their defense against removal,” said Pelcher. VAAP, together with the Association of Africans Living in Vermont, took on the man’s case.

VAAP’s experience finding and aiding immigrants in Vermont’s jails has led Martin Diaz to oppose the idea of closing Vermont’s jails to ICE. “I would not advocate for more beds, but I would also strongly caution against a wholesale end to ICE’s ability to detain people in our state,” they said. “The truth is that there is no substitute for lawyers getting in their cars, going to a facility with our bodies and meeting one on one in private with our clients directly.”

“It’s really, really difficult to provide people with legal help telephonically, when the people who have your clients in custody have no respect for the rule of law and for individuals rights.”

Is America’s legal system up to the task of defending rights and institutions in the Trump era?

“I do have hope that the rule of law will prevail and that this horrible, horrible, tragic moment in our history, this painful moment for our community members who are being directly impacted, can also be a galvanizing opportunity for us to rethink what do we want our laws to say? What do we want due process to look like? What checks and balances do we want?” said Martin Diaz.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jill-martin-diaz-3-20250827.jpg,N,,2025-09-11 15:57:16.027806

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants.
Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear.","California’s soup kitchens, homeless shelters and preschools can continue to serve those without legal status, at least temporarily, according to a decision today by a U.S. district court judge in Rhode Island.

In July, four federal departments — Education, Justice, Health and Human Services and Labor — directed California to deny many immigrants access to federally funded public services, including health care, education and job training. The new policies apply to certain classes of immigrants, including those without legal status as well as those who have it, such as asylum seekers or those with student visas.

California quickly joined 20 other states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit, arguing that the policy changes were illegal. The ruling today, which is a preliminary injunction, means that the federal government can’t enforce the new policies in these states until the lawsuit is decided, which could take months or years to resolve.

“With today’s decision, vital education, nutrition, and health programs like Head Start — and the families who rely on their services — can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s Office. Head Start offers free preschool to low-income children across the state.

“The Trump Administration continues to pull the rug out from under California families just trying to get by, but we’re fighting back,” she said. “We’re grateful that a District Court has put a stop to this cruel new directive while our litigation continues.”

The four federal departments said in July that the new policies were an effort to fulfill one of Trump’s executive orders, which claims that public benefits fuel “illegal immigration.” The executive order asks federal departments to ensure that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens.”

A lawyer for the Justice Department, Sean Skedzielewski, said the new policies also reflect the proper interpretation of federal law, despite the fact that the Justice Department has used a different interpretation for nearly 30 years.

In her written decision issuing the preliminary injunction, U.S. district judge Mary McElroy said she’s skeptical of Skedzielewski’s legal argument. “The (federal) Government argues that it has somehow interpreted this statute incorrectly for the nearly thirty years that it has been the law. In its view, everyone (from every past administration) has misunderstood it from the start—at least until last month, when the right way to read it became clear to the (federal) Government.”

McElroy wrote the new policies, which are now paused, would mean that “fewer people will get critical antipoverty resources due to immigrant communities avoiding services but also because, generally, people living in poverty at times lack government identification.”

Who qualifies for public benefits?

In 1996, Congress passed a law restricting most federally funded public benefits to U.S. citizens or those with certain legal statuses, such as a green card. Later, when clarifying the law, the federal government carved out certain exceptions.

Any person, regardless of their legal status, can access a crisis call center and any neglected or abused child can receive public assistance because these services are “necessary for the protection of life and safety,” according to federal guidance from 1996, which clarified the meaning of that year’s law. Homeless and domestic violence shelters, public hospitals and programs that support mental health or substance use recovery are also available to all.

As a result of a 1982 Supreme Court decision, the federal government allows all students under 18 years old, regardless of legal status, to attend public school. Immigrants without legal status are also able to access Head Start and to enroll in adult education classes, which include English as a second language and high school equivalency programs.

In Santa Clara County, which encompasses San Jose, roughly 40% of residents are foreign-born and more than half of all children in the county have a foreign-born parent. The county receives about $3.7 billion in federal funding each year, most of which supports its public hospital system, according to a court declaration by Greta Hanson, the chief operating officer of the county.

Verifying patients’ legal status isn’t feasible, she said, but even if it were, it would “have extremely detrimental impacts and deter individuals from seeking much needed care.” If an individual has a contagious disease but avoids seeking care, for example, they could jeopardize the health of their entire community.

Although the new policies went into effect in July, the health system has yet to turn away any patients. The states in the lawsuit and the four federal departments came to an agreement that they would delay enforcing the new policies until Sept. 11. Because of today’s preliminary injunction, it will now take months or years before the policies are enacted, and if the judge ultimately rules in favor of California, the policies may never take effect at all.

It’s just one of many lawsuits California has filed against the Trump administration regarding the treatment of immigrants. In an attempt to implement a different presidential executive order, which asked federal departments to stop “waste, fraud and abuse,” the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) asked California to share private data about people who receive food stamps.

In July, Democratic attorneys general, including California Attorney General Rob Bonta, sued the USDA, saying it’s an attempt to target mixed-status families, where U.S. citizens may have a non-citizen relative. California has also sued the Trump Administration over its deployment of the National Guard after federal immigration raids led to protests in Los Angeles this summer.

All told, California has sued or joined other states in suing the federal government roughly 40 times since the president’s inauguration. During the first Trump administration, California sued the president 123 times and won about two-thirds of those cases.

Many of the lawsuits filed this year have already led to preliminary injunctions, temporarily halting the Trump administration’s new policies, but advocates for immigrants say the president’s actions have had an impact nonetheless.

Many Californians, including those with legal status, are shying away from public services out of fear. Some are afraid to leave their house at all.

At an adult school in Huntington Beach, principal Steve Curiel said few immigrants are showing up for English-language classes this summer. He said he’s heard that other schools across the state are seeing the same trend.
