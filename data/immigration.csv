,Policy,2026-01-03 14:09:30+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Opinion | Trump's Attack on Venezuela Is Illegal and Unwise - The New York Times,"The Editorial Board, www.nytimes.com, the-editorial-board",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/opinion/venezuela-attack-trump-us.html,"Over the past few months, President Trump has deployed an imposing military force in the Caribbean to threaten Venezuela.
The United States spent 20 years failing to create a stable government in Afghanistan and replaced a dictatorship in Libya with a fractured state.
Mr. Trump has not yet offered a coherent explanation for his actions in Venezuela.
If Mr. Trump wants to argue otherwise, the Constitution spells out what he must do: Go to Congress.
So how should the United States deal with the continuing problem that Venezuela poses to the region and America’s interests?","Over the past few months, President Trump has deployed an imposing military force in the Caribbean to threaten Venezuela. Until now, the president used that force — an aircraft carrier, at least seven other warships, scores of aircraft and 15,000 U.S. troops — for illegal attacks on small boats that he claimed were ferrying drugs. On Saturday, Mr. Trump dramatically escalated his campaign by capturing President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela as part of what he called “a large scale strike” against the country.

Few people will feel any sympathy for Mr. Maduro. He is undemocratic and repressive, and has destabilized the Western Hemisphere in recent years. The United Nations recently issued a report detailing more than a decade of killings, torture, sexual violence and arbitrary detention by henchmen against his political opponents. He stole Venezuela’s presidential election in 2024. He has fueled economic and political disruption throughout the region by instigating an exodus of nearly eight million migrants.

If there is an overriding lesson of American foreign affairs in the past century, however, it is that attempting to oust even the most deplorable regime can make matters worse. The United States spent 20 years failing to create a stable government in Afghanistan and replaced a dictatorship in Libya with a fractured state. The tragic consequences of the 2003 war in Iraq continue to beset America and the Middle East. Perhaps most relevant, the United States has sporadically destabilized Latin American countries, including Chile, Cuba, Guatemala and Nicaragua, by trying to oust a government through force.

Mr. Trump has not yet offered a coherent explanation for his actions in Venezuela. He is pushing our country toward an international crisis without valid reasons. If Mr. Trump wants to argue otherwise, the Constitution spells out what he must do: Go to Congress. Without congressional approval, his actions violate U.S. law.

The nominal rationale for the administration’s military adventurism is to destroy “narco-terrorists.” Governments throughout history have labeled the leaders of rival nations as terrorists, seeking to justify military incursions as policing operations. The claim is particularly ludicrous in this case, given that Venezuela is not a meaningful producer of fentanyl or the other drugs that have dominated the recent epidemic of overdoses in the United States, and the cocaine that it does produce flows mostly to Europe. While Mr. Trump has been attacking Venezuelan boats, he also pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, who ran a sprawling drug operation when he was president of Honduras from 2014 to 2022.

A more plausible explanation for the attacks on Venezuela may instead be found in Mr. Trump’s recently released National Security Strategy. It claimed the right to dominate Latin America: “After years of neglect, the United States will reassert and enforce the Monroe Doctrine to restore American pre-eminence in the Western Hemisphere.” In what the document called the “Trump Corollary,” the administration vowed to redeploy forces from around the world to the region, stop traffickers on the high seas, use lethal force against migrants and drug runners and potentially base more U.S. troops around the region.

Venezuela has apparently become the first country subject to this latter-day imperialism, and it represents a dangerous and illegal approach to America’s place in the world. By proceeding without any semblance of international legitimacy, valid legal authority or domestic endorsement, Mr. Trump risks providing justification for authoritarians in China, Russia and elsewhere who want to dominate their own neighbors. More immediately, he threatens to replicate the American hubris that led to the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump seemed to recognize the problems with military overreach. In 2016, he was the rare Republican politician to call out the folly of President George W. Bush’s Iraq war. In 2024, he said: “I’m not going to start a war. I’m going to stop wars.”

He is now abandoning this principle, and he is doing so illegally. The Constitution requires Congress to approve any act of war. Yes, presidents often push the boundaries of this law. But even Mr. Bush sought and received congressional endorsement for his Iraq invasion, and presidents since Mr. Bush have justified their use of drone attacks against terrorist groups and their supporters with a 2001 law that authorized action after the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Trump has not even a fig leaf of legal authority for his attacks on Venezuela.

Congressional debates over military action play a crucial democratic role. They check military adventurism by forcing a president to justify his attack plans to the public and requiring members of Congress to tie their own credibility to those plans. For years after the vote on the Iraq war, Democrats who supported Mr. Bush, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, paid a political price, while those who criticized the war, like Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama, came to be seen as prophetic.

In the case of Venezuela, a congressional debate would expose the thinness of Mr. Trump’s rationale. His administration has justified his attacks on the small boats by claiming they pose an immediate threat to the United States. But a wide range of legal and military experts reject the claim, and common sense refutes it, too. An attempt to smuggle drugs into the United States — if, in fact, all the boats were doing so — is not an attempt to overthrow the government or defeat its military.

We suspect Mr. Trump has refused to seek congressional approval for his actions partly because he knows that even some Republicans in Congress are deeply skeptical of the direction in which he is leading this country. Already, Senators Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski and Representatives Don Bacon and Thomas Massie — Republicans all — have backed legislation that would limit Mr. Trump’s military actions against Venezuela.

A second argument against Mr. Trump’s attacks on Venezuela is that they violate international law. By blowing up the small boats that Mr. Trump says are smuggling drugs, he has killed people based on the mere suspicion that they have committed a crime and given them no chance to defend themselves. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 and every subsequent major human rights treaty prohibit such extrajudicial killings. So does U.S. law.

The administration appears to have killed defenseless people. In one attack, the Navy fired a second strike against a hobbled boat, about 40 minutes after the first attack, killing two sailors who were clinging to the boat’s wreckage and appeared to present no threat. As our colleague David French, a former U.S. Army lawyer, has written, “The thing that separates war from murder is the law.”

The legal arguments against Mr. Trump’s actions are the more important ones, but there is also a cold-eyed realist argument. They are not in America’s national security interest. The closest thing to an encouraging analogy is President George H.W. Bush’s invasion of Panama 36 years ago last month, which drove the dictator Manuel Noriega from power and helped set Panama on a path toward democracy. Yet Venezuela is different in important ways. Panama is a much smaller country, and it was a country where American officials and troops had operated for decades because of the Panama Canal.

The potential for chaos in Venezuela seems much greater. Despite Mr. Maduro’s capture, the generals who have enabled his regime will not suddenly vanish. Nor are they likely to hand power to María Corina Machado, the opposition figure whose movement appears to have won the country’s most recent election and who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize last month.

Among the possible bad outcomes are a surge in violence by the left-wing Colombian military group the ELN, which has a foothold in Venezuela’s western area, or by the paramilitary groups known as “colectivos” that have operated on the periphery of power under the Maduro dictatorship. Further unrest in Venezuela could unsettle global energy and food markets and drive more migrants throughout the hemisphere.

So how should the United States deal with the continuing problem that Venezuela poses to the region and America’s interests? We share the hopes of desperate Venezuelans, some of whom have made a case for intervention. But there are no easy answers. By now, the world should understand the risks of regime change.

We will hold out hope that the current crisis will end less badly than we expect. We fear that the result of Mr. Trump’s adventurism is increased suffering for Venezuelans, rising regional instability and lasting damage for America’s interests around the world. We know that Mr. Trump’s warmongering violates the law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/18/multimedia/18venezuela-editorial-pbkh/18venezuela-editorial-pbkh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 09:12:14.721212

It does not appear that Neff has any background working on cases related to federal election law.
One was the Konnech case.
Federal prosecutors are not reviewing the Konnech case, the spokesman said.
Court filings show Neff was involved in Galvan’s L.A. County case, but the prosecution was led by a more senior attorney.","Eric Neff’s tenure at the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office ended after he was placed on administrative leave in 2022 over accusations of misconduct in the prosecution of the CEO of Konnech, a software company that election conspiracy theorists said was in the thrall of the Chinese government.

Now, three years later, Neff is serving as one of the Trump administration’s top election watchdogs.

Late last year , his name began appearing on lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division, listed as “acting chief” of the voting section.

Neff’s appointment, first reported by Mother Jones, has prompted renewed scrutiny of his work at the L.A. County district attorney’s office.

The Times interviewed several of Neff’s former colleagues, who revealed new details about claims of misconduct that emerged from the Konnech case, and said they were alarmed that someone with almost no background in federal election law was named to a senior position.

Neff led the 2022 investigation of Konnech, a tiny Michigan company whose software is used by election officials in several major cities. In a criminal complaint, Neff accused the company’s CEO, Eugene Yu, of fraud and embezzlement, alleging the company stored poll worker information on a server based in China, a violation of its contract with the L.A. County registrar’s office.

Six weeks after a complaint was filed, prosecutors dropped the case and launched an investigation into “irregularities” and bias in the way evidence was presented against Konnech, the D.A.’s office said in a 2022 statement.

The county paid Konnech $5 million and joined a motion to find Yu factually innocent as part of a legal settlement.

The internal probe was focused on accusations that Neff misled supervisors at the district attorney’s office about the role of election deniers in his investigation, according to two officials with direct knowledge of the case who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Neff also allegedly withheld information about potential biases in the case from a grand jury, according to the two officials.

In a civil lawsuit filed last year, Neff said the internal review by the D.A.’s office cleared him of wrongdoing. The two officials familiar with the probe who spoke on the condition of anonymity disputed Neff’s characterization of the findings.

A spokesman for Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman declined to comment or provide the results of the investigation into Neff, which the officials said was conducted by an outside law firm that generated a report on the case. Neff’s attorney also did not provide a copy of the report.

A Department of Justice spokesman declined to comment.

Neff’s attorney, Tom Yu — no relation to the Konnech CEO — said his client had no obligation to provide background information about the origins of the case to the grand jury.

Neff’s appointment comes as President Trump continues to remake the DOJ in his own image by appointing political loyalists with no criminal law background as U.S. attorneys in New Jersey and Virginia and seeking prosecutions of his political enemies, such as former FBI Director James Comey.

Trump has never recanted his false claim that he won the 2020 election.

When then-L.A. County Dist. Atty. George Gascón announced the charges against Konnech in 2020, Trump said the progressive prosecutor would become a “National hero on the Right if he got to the bottom of this aspect of the Voting Fraud.”

The Konnech case was centered on contract fraud, not voter fraud or ballot rigging. Six weeks after the charges were filed, the case disintegrated.

The D.A.’s office cited Neff’s over-reliance on evidence provided by True the Vote, the group that pushed the unfounded Chinese government conspiracies about Konnech and also appeared in a film that spread claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.

Gascón initially denied that True the Vote was involved in the case, but weeks later, a D.A.’s office spokesman said a report from the group’s co-founder, Gregg Phillips, sparked the prosecution. Phillips testified in court in July 2022 that it was Neff who first contacted him about Konnech.

The two officials who spoke to The Times said that Neff withheld True the Vote’s role from high-level D.A.’s office staff, including Gascón, when presenting the case.

Gascón declined an interview request, noting he is named in Neff’s pending lawsuit, which is slated for trial in early 2026.

Neff’s attorney insisted the case against Konnech was solid.

“He was let go because Trump tweeted a statement of ‘Go George Go’,” the attorney said. “That’s why Eugene Yu was let go. Because Gascón was so scared he was going to lose votes.”

Calls and emails to an attorney who previously represented Eugene Yu were not returned.

In his lawsuit, Neff claimed he had evidence that “Konnech used third-party contractors based in China and failed to abide by security procedures” to protect L.A. County poll worker data. The evidence was not attached as an exhibit in the lawsuit.

A DOJ spokesperson declined to describe Neff’s job duties. His name appears on a number of lawsuits filed in recent months against states that have refused to turn over voter registration lists to the Trump administration.

Neff is also involved in a suit filed against the Fulton County clerk’s office in Georgia seeking records related to the 2020 election, records show.

“We will not permit states to jeopardize the integrity and effectiveness of elections by refusing to abide by our federal elections laws,” Asst. Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon, the California conservative who now leads the civil rights division, said in a recent statement. “If states will not fulfill their duty to protect the integrity of the ballot, we will.”

Dhillon declined to comment through a DOJ spokesman.

The voting section “enforces the civil provisions of the federal laws that protect the right to vote, including the Voting Rights Act,” according to the DOJ’s website.

It does not appear that Neff has any background working on cases related to federal election law. He first became an L.A. County prosecutor in 2013 and spent years handling local crime cases out of the Pomona courthouse. He was promoted and reassigned to the Public Integrity Division, which investigates corruption issues, in 2020, according to his lawsuit.

While there, he handled only two prosecutions related to elections. One was the Konnech case. The other involved allegations of election rigging against a Compton city council member.

In August 2021, Isaac Galvan, a Democrat, was charged with conspiring to commit election fraud after he allegedly worked to direct voters from outside his council district to cast ballots for him. Galvan won the race by just one vote, but was booted from office when a judge determined at least four improper ballots had been cast.

Galvan’s criminal case is still pending; he recently pleaded guilty to charges in a separate corruption and bribery case in federal court. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles said there was no overlap between the D.A.’s election rigging case and the bribery case against Galvan. Federal prosecutors are not reviewing the Konnech case, the spokesman said.

Court filings show Neff was involved in Galvan’s L.A. County case, but the prosecution was led by a more senior attorney.

Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who served in the civil rights division during the Obama administration, said section chiefs normally have decades of experience in the area of law they’re meant to supervise.

“The biggest problem with somebody with Neff’s history is the giant screaming red flag that involves filing a prosecution based on unreliable evidence,” Levitt said. “That’s not something any prosecutor should do.”

Neff’s attorney, Yu, scoffed at the idea that his client was not experienced enough for his new role in the Trump administration, or that he was selected due to his involvement in the Konnech case.

“Eric got the job because he’s qualified to get the job. He didn’t get the job for any other reason. He got the job because he’s an excellent advocate,” Yu said. “I think the Justice Department is very fortunate to have Eric.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/55862cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5842x3067+0+414/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2Fed%2F147d71991fffe61e1414af4642a9%2Fd26b356ebce5442386cfd08115aee8a0,N,,2026-01-03 06:56:34.635500

Nikita Svinchukov said he doesn’t feel safe and described the center as overcrowded, exceeding its 1,575-person capacity.
“There is clearly chaos going on here now with the courts, and it’s all in a deplorable state,” Nikita Svinchukov said.","Two Vancouver residents who came to the United States from Russia about two years ago seeking legal asylum were detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents last week.

Aleksandr Kungurtsev, 34, and Nikita Svinchukov, 24, now sit in the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. Their arrests leave two families without breadwinners and a boy undergoing intensive treatment for brain cancer without his father.

Agents took Kungurtsev at 8:34 a.m. Dec. 27. His wife, Viktoriia, said four unmarked vehicles pulled up to their home in Vancouver’s Marrion neighborhood. Agents called Kungurtsev outside and asked him to verify information on his phone regarding his asylum application. He walked out barefoot.

The agents promised that everything was fine and that he would be released in two hours after having an ankle monitor placed on him, Viktoriia Kungurtsev said in Russian through Google Translate and a phone interpreter. She said agents showed no warrant.

“When he took the phone and began looking at it, they grabbed him,” she said. “He was not even wearing shoes.”

Agents detained Svinchukov around 10 a.m. Dec. 27, according to James “Jimmy” Mathis II, a 72-year-old Vietnam veteran. Svinchukov, who is Aleksandr Kungurtsev’s nephew, works as a caregiver for Mathis.

Mathis said a man in a dark-blue uniform knocked on his door on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs campus in Vancouver. Mathis said the man identified himself as VA campus police. The man said he was there with a warrant with ICE and “just needed something signed,” Mathis said.

He said ICE was pinging Svinchukov’s ankle monitor during the interaction.

Svinchukov was monitored via SmartLINK, a smartphone app and monitoring system used by ICE’s Alternatives to Detention program. The system employs GPS-equipped ankle monitors for continuous location tracking and requires users to submit facial recognition check-ins on the app. Intended to ensure court appearances, these monitoring methods face criticism for the intense digital surveillance they impose on individuals awaiting legal proceedings.

After Svinchukov traveled to Texas for work, ICE placed an ankle monitor on him and restricted his travel to within the Pacific Northwest. The family says they don’t know why he was given the ankle monitor or why his travel was restricted.

When agents came to his home, Mathis let them in. Two other men who entered behind the first were wearing ICE flak jackets. The man in the blue uniform wore no ICE insignia, Mathis said.

Mathis said he felt deceived and began protesting and shouting. He said the agents told him, “Go to sleep, old man.”

A video of the incident shows that Svinchukov demanded a warrant, but agents did not present one. When they moved to restrain Svinchukov, he panicked and tried to run, he told The Columbian in a video call Tuesday.

Mathis told The Columbian he suspects the man in dark blue was an ICE officer posing as VA police. He said he spoke to VA campus police and was told the description he gave didn’t match anyone who worked on the campus.

Other people in Vancouver have reported seeing ICE dressed in a way that makes them appear as if they work for other law enforcement agencies.

Sofiia, Svinchukov’s wife, said officers tackled him and arrested him while the incident was caught on a video call with her.

“These are good people,” Mathis said. “They haven’t done anything wrong. I don’t want to live in a country like that.”

Shaneka Barfield, a spokesperson for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, told The Columbian that VA police were not involved in this arrest and did not assist ICE.

The families said they tried to file a police report but local authorities refused to accept a report, stating they did not want to get involved with a federal agency.

The 2019 Keep Washington Working Act prohibits local authorities from working with federal immigration enforcement, punishable with a criminal violation and potential stripping of certification.

Potential death sentence

On Tuesday, the families of the men spoke with The Columbian with the help of a translation app and a phone interpreter. Candy canes and ornaments hung in their now-quiet home off Mill Plain Boulevard. A Christmas tree stood in the corner. The dining table held a spread of holiday sweets, resting beneath a wood carving of a church that reads, “Praise him.”

But the holiday atmosphere was broken by the sound of three women speaking with distress to one another in Russian, all wearing masks to mitigate the spread of germs to an immunocompromised teenager nearby. One comforted a whining amber Labradoodle. From the second floor, the mechanical whir of medical equipment drifted down the halls.

Aleksandr Kungurtsev is the sole provider for his wife and 16-year-old son, Egor. The boy recently underwent a 12-hour-long emergency brain surgery and is receiving chemotherapy and radiation treatment. He requires assistance with eating via a feeding tube and going to the bathroom. The family says he can no longer play soccer.

“Our child is physically unable to care for himself and urgently needs his father’s constant presence for both physical care and psychological support,” Viktoriia Kungurtsev said.

She said that following his father’s detention, Egor’s condition deteriorated sharply, resulting in severe vomiting and a hospital visit. Viktoriia Kungurtsev’s fear is that if she is also detained, Egor will have no caretaker and no funding for therapy and will enter the foster system.

The family exhausted their savings during two months of medical rehabilitation in Seattle. They attempted to retain an attorney, paying her $13,500, but said the attorney declared bankruptcy and never returned the funds.

“Right now, we have nothing,” Viktoriia Kungurtsev wrote in an appeal for aid. “No money for rent, food, transportation to the hospital or basic needs.”

The family has posted a GoFundMe to raise money for Egor’s medical expenses.

Beyond the immediate medical crisis, the family fears deportation could be a death sentence for Nikita Svinchukov.

Nikita Svinchukov and Aleksandr Kungurtsev entered the United States seeking asylum using the CBP One mobile app. They were allowed into the country three months after applying for asylum. Nikita Svinchukov has strong ties to the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a Russian organization established by late opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

Russian authorities have labeled the group a “terrorist organization,” resulting in criminal cases against associates. Navalny died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, a death his widow and international leaders blame on the Kremlin.

“We really did come here seeking protection. We believed so much in the United States and its people,” Sofiia Svinchukov said. “We felt safe here and were confident my husband would be protected. He was detained in Russia because of politics, and now he’s being detained here because of politics.”

Nikita Svinchukov believes he will face execution if returned to Russia because of his ties to the Anti-Corruption Foundation.

In the video call with The Columbian, he said that when he and the others were transferred to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, agents told them they “are here because the policy in the country has changed” and instructed them to prepare for deportation.

“We have been asking what the new policy change is, but no one here seems to know what the policy is,” Nikita Svinchukov said.

He said the agents acknowledged that he and his uncle lack criminal history but said it didn’t matter anymore, and they would be placed in a low-risk portion of the detention center.

Nikita Svinchukov said he doesn’t feel safe and described the center as overcrowded, exceeding its 1,575-person capacity.

“There is clearly chaos going on here now with the courts, and it’s all in a deplorable state,” Nikita Svinchukov said. “There are at least 44 people sleeping on the floors of the corridor outside the cells, right now.”

He described the food as just barely edible and hygiene supplies as scarce. A 15-minute video call costs $53, draining what little money the families have left.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Columbian. The ICE media line is disconnected.

“Since Jan. 20, DHS has arrested more than 595,000 illegal aliens,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a Dec. 10 post on the DHS website. “Illegal aliens are hearing our message to leave now. They know if they don’t, we will find them, we will arrest them, and they will never return.”

The men’s families insist they are law-abiding and have complied with any regulations given to them.

“We wouldn’t have reached out to (The Columbian) if we had a criminal record or had done anything illegal,” Sofiia Svinchukov said. “That would have been foolish.”

The family doesn’t know why the women in the family weren’t taken, but reports from across the country show disproportionately more men than women are detained by ICE. On average, 90 percent of arrests by ICE are of men. Between 2012 and 2013, between 93 percent and 94 percent of arrests were men; 6 percent to 7 percent were women.

The memo also outlines plans to re-review applications of immigrants from these countries as far back as 2021.

The list, which is composed mostly of countries in Africa, includes Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

Last month, the Trump administration expanded the list of countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. from 19 to 39, plus the Palestinian Authority. The move comes as the administration is bringing sharper scrutiny of those who have followed legal steps to seek permanent status in the U.S.

“USCIS remains dedicated to ensuring aliens from high-risk countries of concern who have entered the United States do not pose risks to national security or public safety,” the memo states as rational for the pause and reviews. “To faithfully uphold United States immigration law, the flow of aliens from countries with high overstay rates, significant fraud, or both must stop.”

There are some exceptions outlined in the memo, including athletes and members of their teams competing in the World Cup and Olympics.

The administration first suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.

Toward the end of 2025, DHS began taking steps to further pause and review these legal avenues of migration. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees processing of applications including for visas, naturalizations and asylum, announced it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases.

On Jan. 2, The Bulwark, a political news organization, reported that the metro Phoenix area will be the next city targeted by the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration operations, in line with the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Three former DHS officials in contact with their former colleagues told reporter Adrian Carrasquillo that the Democratic-led city will be the agency’s next focus of arrests, detentions and deportations. They didn’t know the definitive timeline, but local immigration organizations and officials are preparing for the anticipated influx of agents.

“No one is safe from the recklessness of this administration,” state Sen. Analise Ortiz told Phoenix New Times. ICE, she said, has been “more egregious in their activity” and the “potential for even more enforcement is horrifying.”

During the first year of the Trump administration, ICE has maintained a steady presence in the Phoenix area. Raids and arrests have occurred at work sites, immigration courts, Home Depot locations and individual homes. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and holiday visitors have been detained.

Neither ICE nor DHS would respond on the record to New Times’ request to comment.

As the new year approaches, these enforcement actions and detention facilities are expected to increase, as ICE is flush with cash following the Republicans’ passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The report that Phoenix will be targeted next also comes on the heels of a “joint enforcement operation” between ICE and the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office, which has resulted in a lot of activity in the San Tan Valley area, some 50 miles southeast of Phoenix.

“These actions do not make us safer,” wrote Beth Strano, the director of Borderlands Resource Initiative, who said the community has been preparing for increased immigration enforcement. “Instead, they create fear, divide families and erode trust in local leaders and law enforcement.”

“It’s been quiet out here, to an extent,” said Clarissa Vela, the founder of PeopleFirstProject. “It’s going to start turning into California.”

Vela was out on a community patrol tracking ICE activity when New Times reached her Friday morning — she said she’d seen nine arrests already before lunch. With activity expected to ramp up, she said, “I believe the community should be embracing one another right now. Regardless of your immigration status, get out and fight. We’re gonna be what stops this.”

The Bulwark wrote that the administration plans to turn the Valley into a “hub of removal” in the Southwest, significantly expanding operations in such cities as Denver, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. Specifically, this will include building more tent-like, soft-sided detention facilities of the sort that are holding thousands of detainees in Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz.”

As ICE attempts to expand its detention capacity nationwide, it appears to be aiming to make Arizona a significant part of that effort. New Times found that Maricopa County Sheriff Jerry Sheridan considered adding 1,000 ICE beds in the county’s jail system and Marana residents are currently fighting plans to turn a former prison into a detention center.

According to reporting by the Washington Post on Dec. 24, ICE is planning to renovate a warehouse site in Glendale to be used as a processing facility, where 500 to 1,500 people would be held. The specific location of that facility is not yet known. Ortiz, who represents the West Valley and parts of Glendale, said the city of Glendale was unable to provide her with any information about the potential facility, which “tells me that it is very, very early in the process,” she said.

In a statement to New Times, the city of Glendale said it was aware of the Post’s reporting, but “has not yet received any information or notice from the federal government about the plan,” spokesperson Lesley Miller wrote.

“If there is an opportunity for the city to block this, they absolutely should,” Ortiz said. “There will be an outpouring, an outcry of opposition to putting this type of death camp in our community.”

ICE’s facilities in Arizona have already come under scrutiny for having hazardous conditions, and Ortiz is worried about the safety of these temporary structures in Arizona’s extreme heat.

“The vast majority of Arizonans do not want to see their friends, family, neighbors or coworkers taken by ICE, people who are doing nothing wrong and are contributing to the community,” she said. “Trump lied to the voters when he said he would go after the most violent people. That is not what is happening.”",https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/10/ICE-Vest-Getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 01:56:41.684196

Santa Maria City Councilmember Gloria Soto told the crowd that since last Saturday, Dec. 27, community organizations, such as 805 UndocuFund, have documented nearly 150 ICE detentions in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.

Soto said that at least 87 people were apprehended in Santa Maria, calling it the “epicenter of what they’re seeing over the holiday break.”

Immigrant rights groups also reported increased enforcement action in northern San Luis Obispo County in more recent days, with nearly 20 people in Paso Robles and San Miguel taken into custody on Tuesday, Dec. 30.

KSBY News has reached out to ICE representatives but has not been able to independently verify the number of detentions reported.

Soto added that increased ICE activity has also been seen in other parts of California and the country, saying, “The scale, speed and geographic expansion we are seeing is coordinated regional activity and not isolated incidences, and behind every number is a person.”

Cesar Vasquez, 805 Undocufund Rapid Response organizer, told the crowd that he has seen some of these incidents turn violent and that some U.S. citizens have been detained and questioned because of their race.

We want a community where all people here are respected.”

Speakers called for increased public support and funding for legal defense and other resources for immigrant families, and they urged the Santa Maria City Council to take action in response to increased ICE enforcement.

AFL’s client, Students Against Racial Discrimination (SARD), alleges that the UC system uses unlawful racial preferences under the guise of “holistic” admissions. This violates the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, 600 U.S. 181 (2023), which rejects race-based admissions policies in any form.

The district court held that AFL’s complaint plausibly alleges unlawful racial discrimination in UC’s undergraduate and law-school admissions, and it further held that SARD has standing to pursue these claims.

“The University of California tried to shut this case down before any real scrutiny of its admissions practices could take place,” said Ryan Giannetti, Counsel at America First Legal. “The court rightly rejected that effort and confirmed that public universities are not above federal civil-rights laws. UC has done a poor job hiding racial discrimination behind language about ‘holistic review,’ and now it has to answer for its unlawful use of race in admissions.”

America First Legal will continue its fight to end illegal discrimination in higher education, defend students from unlawful judgments based on their immutable traits, and save the American ideals of meritocracy and equal treatment under the law.

And the Washington Post reported recently that ICE is planning to construct seven large-scale industrial holding centers—including a facility in Glendale.
Share “Right now, if you put 5,000 more beds in Phoenix, you have more expansive throughput,” the former senior DHS official said.
As part of its growing presence in Arizona, DHS is expected to build controversial soft-sided facilities, the former official relayed.
The timeline of increased operations in the Phoenix area is unclear.","ALTHOUGH DONALD TRUMP’S IMMIGRATION AGENDA is becoming less and less popular with voters, the president has shown no interest in slowing it down or scaling it back in the new year.

In fact, the federal crackdown is likely to only grow in scope and intensity, as Reuters reported. And as three former DHS officials in contact with their former colleagues at the agency each described to me, the expectation among current officials is that one Democratic-led city in particular is about to become the next focus of arrests, detentions, and deportations: Phoenix.

A more robust DHS presence in the Phoenix metropolitan area would mark a new phase in the Trump operations—not just because it would take place in one of the country’s most significant swing states (and a border one, at that), but because it would likely involve a greater expenditure of federal resources than prior operations in other cities have required.

ICE is flush with cash following last year’s passage of the president’s signature piece of legislation, the “Big Beautiful Bill.” And the administration is looking to use that money to dramatically expand its detention capabilities. Residents in Arizona have already been fighting plans to turn the former Marana prison outside Tucson into a detention center. And the Washington Post reported recently that ICE is planning to construct seven large-scale industrial holding centers—including a facility in Glendale.

One of the three former senior DHS officials said that adding thousands more beds in the areas surrounding Phoenix would allow the administration to turn the city into a “hub of removal” in the Southwest.

“Right now, if you put 5,000 more beds in Phoenix, you have more expansive throughput,” the former senior DHS official said. An increase on that level would make it possible for federal agents to significantly expand their operations in other Western cities, including Denver, Las Vegas, and L.A.

“Arizona becomes another hub like [the Rio Grande Processing Center],” the official added.

As part of its growing presence in Arizona, DHS is expected to build controversial soft-sided facilities, the former official relayed. The tent-like structures are easier to put up quickly, but they are difficult to manage humanely because of their greater exposure to the elements, which contributes to a variety of serious problems for detainees. Soft-sided facilities have already been controversial during Trump’s second term: Florida opened a detention center in the Everglades, soon nicknamed “Alligator Alcatraz” by the administration, and continues to operate it in spite of horrifying reports about the conditions being faced by the 6,725 men who have been or are currently being held there. (A court case is pending that could result in the closure of the detention camp; it has already survived multiple legal challenges to its continued operations.)

Elsewhere, the use of soft-sided detention centers has expanded. The $1.24 billion facility in Fort Bliss held 1,000 detainees when it opened in August; it is intended to hold up to 5,000 people.

The timeline of increased operations in the Phoenix area is unclear. While it’s a safe bet that the administration plans to use the same playbook it used in other cities, there could be some notable differences.

Andrea Flores, who served as the director of border management on the National Security Council during the Biden administration and oversaw coordination between ICE and CBP, warned that the use of soft-sided facilities as overflow immigration detention space raises significant humanitarian concerns.

“It’s extremely expensive, and these are not spaces people should be in for a long time, frankly—they were very poorly managed even under Biden,” she told me. “The concern is you expand soft-sideds to expand detention space, but just because you do doesn’t mean you can expand removals. Then you’re just going to have a bunch of people detained in the desert.”

Flores added that in its obsessive quest to remake immigration enforcement, the Trump administration has been treating every novel idea as a good one. That fixation on novelty has led to the implementation of some truly bad ideas.

“Alligator Alcatraz was unique and also a failure,” she said. “It didn’t necessarily ramp up deportations, it just put them in intensely inhumane conditions.”

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin did not respond to a request for comment on the prospect of an enforcement ramp-up in the Phoenix metro area in January.

A History of Opposition: From SB 1070 to a Blue-Hued Arizona

There is another reason that DHS’s Phoenix operations will be different from the ones the department has undertaken in other cities: Arizona’s history of wrenching political fights over immigration and the border.

Arizonans have many scars from these battles. Fifteen years ago, many fought State Sen. Russell Pearce’s show-me-your-papers law, SB 1070. Around that time, a constellation of activists and organizers mobilized against then–Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio. They, alongside Republicans who recoiled at the party’s embrace of Trumpism, turned Arizona from a ruby-red state—one that hadn’t gone blue since 1996—to a state Joe Biden won in 2020. Arizona now boasts two nationally known Democratic figures in Sens. Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly; it also has a Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs.

What Arizonans told me is they now see in Trump an Arpaio at the national level—and a threat to immigrants that is that much broader.

“Here, specifically in Southern Arizona, we’ve been anticipating something like this happening,” Rep. Adelita Grijalva (D-Ariz.) told me. “In Tucson, the mayors met with Pima County elected officials and the Tucson police department, who have all taken strong positions that none of our government resources are going to be used to help ICE in any way.”

From the Marana prison in Grijalva’s backyard to the reports of future warehouses stuffed with immigrants, the congresswoman has many vectors of DHS’s operations in view, and she said she’s going to keep pushing back against all of the department’s encroachments in her state.

“I don’t want any kind of detention facility here, people languishing, given no kind of process at all,” she said. “I have not been able to see constituents in Florence and Eloy, so I think I’m just going to start showing up. They have to meet that quota, and the only way to do it is illegally.”

Representatives of grassroots groups preparing for the influx of federal agents say the groups are currently working as a loose network of organizations with no formal leadership structure. The members of the ad-hoc coalition include NDLON; LUCHA AZ, a mainstay in organizing as well as political work activating Latino voters in the state; most of the local labor unions; established groups like Chicanos Por La Causa; and some more radical entities such as the Party for Socialism and Liberation. To a person, the activists I spoke with say the state has been in this precarious place before.

“This has been tried before and failed with Joe Arpaio’s tent city and the Arizona experiment with early onset Trumpism changed the state from red to blue,” said Chris Newman, the general counsel of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON). Newman noted that even the current backlash to Trump’s immigration crackdown has reminded many Arizonans of what happened in their state during the Arpaio era. “Pretty much all of the activism that you see in the immigrant rights movement right now is emulating the type of response that civil rights leaders demonstrated in Arizona in 2010, which was the seminal year.”

“Linked Fates”

So what will the reaction in the Phoenix area be to more aggressive anti-immigration operations?

Alejandra Gomez, the head of LUCHA AZ, has picked up on several clues. She told me her group conducted a research study during the spring and summer of 2024 that included 1,400 Latino voters, from first generation to fourth, from the most traditional voter to the most skeptical ones. It found that Latinos in Arizona felt a sense of “linked fates” regardless of their immigration status or how long they’d been here.

She also recalled the march of tens of thousands of Arizonans on the state capitol in 2010 to protest SB 1070. More of that kind of resistance will be in order should Trump escalate enforcement in the state, she said.

“There’s a muscle memory that will come together when we begin to see the supercharged version of this,” she predicted. “If there is fear, people are still acting. If there is anger, people are still acting. If there is sadness, people are still acting. What is also true is people are still living and not allowing the intimidation from this administration to stop quinceañeras or weddings.”

Newman agreed.

“If the Trump administration escalates enforcement activities in Arizona, that will be met with an escalation of nonviolent protest,” he said.

But is it possible we live in a different time? Could it be that what worked in 2010 during a nascent anti-immigrant moment won’t succeed now? The state dealt more directly than others with more lax border policies under Joe Biden; could that history have helped prepare it to embrace something more extreme in the opposite philosophical direction?

One of the state’s top pollsters—who worked for one of the state’s more prominent conservatives—doesn’t think so.

Chuck Coughlin served as a campaign manager for former Republican governor Jan Brewer during the battle over SB 1070; today, he is the president of HighGround, a polling operation in Arizona. He told me increased enforcement in Phoenix won’t go over well with voters, and it especially won’t go over well with voters in Maricopa County, which is home to 60 percent of the state’s electorate.

“I don’t look at this as being a positive move in Maricopa county, it’s not going to play well,” Coughlin said. “Everybody believes the border control problem is under control. That was always the issue that created the angst back when I worked for Brewer. Back then it was that people were coming over the border with impunity, that’s not happening at all now, so that sentiment isn’t there.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VDyi!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6601947b-5c4b-4c3b-8eb5-cae23d5133a1_6048x4024.jpeg",N,,2026-01-02 18:56:22.885970

HAVANA TIMES – US federal immigration agents are now routinely operating masked and without visible identification, exacerbating the abusive and unaccountable nature of the current administration’s mass-deportation campaign, the organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) has reported.

According to a report by the human-rights organization, “the indefinite and widespread nature of these practices is fundamentally incompatible with the United States’ obligations to ensure that abuses by law-enforcement forces are investigated and that there is accountability.”

Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at HRW, said that “this kind of concealment should be the exception, never the norm. Law-enforcement agents must be identifiable so that they can be held accountable for their actions.”

“And it is even more alarming given the widespread abuses that have occurred during immigration-related arrests in recent months,” she added.

HRW stated that since Donald Trump assumed the presidency again in January 2025, “his administration has carried out across the country an abusive campaign of immigration raids and arrests, primarily targeting people of color.”

“Many of the raids are deliberately carried out in places where people from the Latino community work, shop, eat, and live,” the report noted.

Agents have apprehended people in courthouses for routine appointments with immigration officials, as well as in places of worship, schools, and other sensitive locations, the text highlighted.

Many raids have been marked by the sudden and unjustified use of force, without provocation, creating a climate of fear in many immigrant communities.

These immigration-enforcement operations have often involved agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) who wear masks and, in some cases, are dressed in plain clothes.

It is common for agents to conceal agency badges and use unmarked vehicles to detain people in their cars as well as in courthouses, schools, workplaces, homes, on the street, and on public transportation.

On its website, ICE justifies the widespread practice of masking by stating that it is intended to “avoid being exposed.”

“This kind of broad and indiscriminate justification for concealing officials’ identities is not compatible with the United States’ human-rights obligations, except when the measure is necessary and proportionate to address specific security considerations,” HRW stated.

By contrast, when applied as a broad and automatic strategy, such measures “constitute an obstacle to accountability that is incompatible with the United States’ human-rights obligations,” it said.

It added that anonymity also weakens deterrence, fosters conditions for impunity, and inhibits the exercise of rights.

According to the Deportation Data Project at the University of California, nearly 220,000 people were detained by ICE agents in the first nine months of the Trump administration.

HRW interviewed 18 people who were arrested or witnessed arrests by unidentifiable individuals in five US cities since January 20. All described the incidents as terrifying, saying they felt they could do nothing if they suffered abuses, especially if the agents were not identifiable.

The organization also analyzed dozens of videos of stops and arrests involving masked agents that were posted on social media.

Many observers “have suggested that the terror these tactics instill is deliberate,” HRW noted.

Additionally, HRW reports that in recent months the media have covered cases of people impersonating federal agents who kidnap, sexually assault, and extort victims, exploiting the fear generated by immigration-control measures.

“This shows that the lines between criminals and law-enforcement agents can be blurred when federal agents themselves are not identifiable,” HRW said.

The organization maintained that “Congress must investigate the brutality in ongoing immigration-enforcement activities, including the specific impacts of unidentifiable agents carrying out stops and arrests.”

“Allowing masked and unidentified agents to roam communities and apprehend people without identifying themselves undermines trust in the rule of law, creates a vacuum in which abuses can spread, and exacerbates unnecessary violence and the brutality of arrests,” Wille concluded.

""I think that this is going to push a lot of trans rights litigation to state courts under state constitutions,"" she said.","-- In 2026, the fight for access to justice in the United States will be shaped by high-stakes legal and budgetary decisions affecting immigration, housing and civil rights. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a challenge to President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship, a case that could deny federal recognition of citizenship to certain U.S.-born children and upend long-settled constitutional law.

At the same time, Congress is moving toward sharp cuts to funding for civil legal aid, threatening the Legal Services Corporation and the nonprofit legal aid providers that represent low-income Americans in cases involving eviction, benefits and family stability.

Efforts to expand the right to counsel for tenants facing eviction continue to grow, and studies show improved court outcomes, but chronic underfunding, attorney shortages and state preemption laws are limiting their reach.

Legal experts and advocates spoke with Law360 about these developments and what they signal for access to justice efforts in the year ahead, as state courts increasingly become the front line for civil rights enforcement.

The Showdown Over Birthright Citizenship

This year, the Supreme Court will decide whether the 14th Amendment guarantees a right to U.S. citizenship to all children born on U.S. soil with few exceptions, as has been the case since the amendment's ratification in 1868.

On Dec. 6, the court decided it will hear a legal challenge to an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship that President Trump signed on his first day back in office.

Now in the hands of the justices, the case, Trump v. Barbara , has the potential to drastically reshape American immigration and could have a deep impact on the fabric of society, experts say.

The citizenship clause of the amendment says, ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.""

In his Jan. 20, 2025, executive order titled ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,"" Trump said that ""the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.""

With the executive order, Trump promoted an interpretation of the Constitution in which the phrase ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" excludes the children of noncitizens without a permanent status in the country. This interpretation, which is at odds with the majority of scholarship on the issue, has been proposed for decades, mostly in conservative legal circles.

Under the executive order, the federal government would deny recognition of U.S. citizenship to certain children born in the United States based on their parents' immigration status at the time of birth. The order applies only when both parents lack U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident status, but it sweeps in two distinct categories of births.

One category covers children born to mothers who were unlawfully present in the United States at the time of delivery, when the child's father was neither a U.S. citizen nor a lawful permanent resident. A second category applies to children whose mothers were lawfully in the country on a temporary basis, such as on a visa, but whose fathers likewise did not hold U.S. citizenship or green cards when the child was born.

In practical terms, the order directs federal agencies to treat children born under those circumstances as noncitizens, despite their U.S. birthplace. As a result, affected individuals would be unable to obtain federal documentation recognizing U.S. citizenship, including passports and Social Security numbers, even if they were issued birth certificates by state or local authorities.

Overall, at least 11 lawsuits have been filed to challenge the executive order, according to a litigation tracker run by Just Security, a digital law and policy journal housed in the Reiss Center on Law and Security at the New York University School of Law.

In four of those cases, federal district courts issued nationwide preliminary injunctions last year. The Supreme Court ruled in June in one of them, Trump v. CASA , limiting federal courts' power to issue universal injunctions, but did not rule on the issue of birthright citizenship.

In Trump v. Barbara , a federal court in New Hampshire temporarily prohibited federal officials from implementing the executive order as applied to a class of infants born on or after Feb. 20, 2025.

Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University Law School, said that although the Supreme Court has been largely deferential to President Trump on most immigration issues, the birthright citizenship case might present an opportunity to distance itself from his administration's policies.

""The court wants at least one case, I think, to show that it does have some independence from President Trump by ruling against him,"" he said. ""I think this is an example of such a case.""

Funding for Legal Aid Uncertain

Funding for legal aid is one of the most pressing access to justice issues facing the country, with the legal needs of millions of people going unmet.

According to a 2022 study by the Legal Services Corporation — a nonprofit, federally funded organization established by Congress in 1974 to ensure equal access to justice by providing civil legal aid to people who can't afford lawyers — low-income Americans lack legal help for 92% of their substantial civil legal problems.

In its budget proposal for fiscal year 2026, which ends on Sept. 30, the White House called for eliminating the LSC, which provides funding to 131 independent nonprofit legal aid organizations in every state, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories for issues like housing, wages and benefits.

Congress declined to follow the White House's proposal to shut down the LSC, but the organization is now facing a reduction in federal funding. While the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $6 million increase in July, the House Appropriations Committee passed legislation that would decrease the LSC's funding by 46% from its current level — earmarking $300 million. The current funding will remain flat through January, but cuts are coming.

In a call with Law360, LSC President Ronald S. Flagg said the current budget environment presents significant challenges for civil legal aid. At the same time, at a time when federal agencies are eliminated altogether or their budgets are slashed, actions by Congress signal that there is bipartisan support for the LSC and the need for funding civil legal aid overall.

""Flat funding in this environment can be viewed as a win when many federally funded institutions saw deep cuts or were eliminated entirely,"" Flagg said. ""That said, flat funding still leaves enormous unmet need.""

About half of people seeking assistance from legal aid organizations are turned away because of lack of funding, Flagg said.

If the House's proposed budget cut, which would take LSC's funding back to 1999 levels, is signed into law, an estimated 2.9 million more Americans would be left without legal help each year, according to the organization.

""As all of these budget negotiations are going forward, legal service organizations across the country have already seen reduced revenues and staffing layoffs at the same time as demand for their services are surging for help with housing, and family, and safety, and economic stability,"" Flagg said. ""In that setting of economic pressure, actually, investment in legal aid is one of the highest value investments communities can make.""

Studies conducted by the LSC estimate that each dollar invested in civil legal aid results in $7 in economic returns by reducing homelessness and the need for emergency services and shelters, and by preserving employment.

""It's all very much dependent on our continuing to make investments in civil legal aid, which is why the current debate over the federal budget, and in particular the legal funding for LSC, remains so important,"" Flagg said.

Right to Counsel's Expansion and Challenges

A nationwide movement to expand the right to an attorney in civil legal matters will continue to gain new ground in 2026, opening avenues for thousands of Americans who struggle on issues directly impacting their lives, in particular tenant-landlord disputes.

John Pollock, the coordinator of National Coalition for a Civil Right to Counsel, told Law360 that right-to-counsel, or RTC, for tenants facing eviction has continued to expand geographically in 2025, with Los Angeles adopting tenant right to counsel and Bozeman, Montana, joining the list, bringing the total to 27 jurisdictions.

Reports published in 2025 showed both the impact and the challenges involved in expanding the right to a lawyer. Some of the challenges have to do with implementation, which often lags behind the legislative timelines lawmakers set when passing RTC laws.

One of the studies, which looked at RTC programs for tenants implemented between 2017 and 2024, show that, on average, RTC programs became operational more than six months after passage, with much longer delays in large jurisdictions or those that phased programs in gradually.

In practice, many programs could not serve all eligible tenants, even where laws promised universal coverage. Legal aid providers often lacked sufficient staff, leading to waitlists, triage systems or limited-scope representation that fell short of full counsel representation. The study also identified chronic underfunding and attorney shortages as the most serious obstacles to effective RTC implementation.

But the same study also showed evidence that, when implemented well, RTC is able to improve the legal system as a whole and lead to better outcomes for litigants. For example, the study found that in jurisdictions where RTC was meaningfully integrated, default eviction orders against tenants decreased, tenant protections like habitability laws were enforced more consistently and there was a shift away from ""eviction mill"" court practices that litigants and attorneys have lamented for years.

Pollock said the availability of counsel ""is changing the game."" RTC laws created streamlined processes to access attorneys.

""Before right to counsel, a lot of tenants were lost in the maze of trying to get legal assistance,"" he said.

Courts in jurisdictions that have RTC laws began to change the way they behaved towards tenants, informing them about their right to a lawyer and shifting the culture of tenant courts from one where evictions were often rubber-stamped by judges to one where they are litigated. Issues like needed repairs in the home appear more routinely where RTC exists, compared to the past, Pollock said.

The studies found that legal representation can help reduce harm, even when eviction occurs. Lawyers can help tenants address those issues in court where they can ask courts to order landlords to make repairs or mitigate them. Attorneys can also help tenants negotiate extra time to move when an eviction order is issued and avoid getting eviction records. These outcomes reduced trauma, family disruption and risk of homelessness, the studies show.

Looking ahead to 2026, Pollock said uncertainties over the federal budget are concerning. He warned that potential cuts to Medicaid, expiration of healthcare subsidies under Obamacare and cuts to rent assistance programs funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development could trigger cascading effects.

""They're going to cause health problems. But health problems don't stay health problems, they lead to housing problems, they lead to employment problems, they lead to child custody problems, and all of those then ripple and flow into the civil justice system,"" Pollock said.

Pollock described state preemption — the use of state law to bar cities and counties from enacting, or even considering, local ordinances in certain policy areas — as another threat to access to justice people will face in 2026.

In the housing context, preemption means states could pass legislation that prohibits municipalities from adopting measures such as right-to-counsel laws, rent regulations, eviction protections or other landlord-tenant reforms, even where local officials and voters support them.

Pollock said conservative states are increasingly using preemption not just to strike down specific policies but to remove local authority altogether. He pointed to Texas and Florida, which in 2024 enacted laws preempting the entire field of landlord-tenant regulation, effectively preventing cities from passing any new tenant-protective measures regardless of local conditions.

""We view this as an attack on democracy,"" Pollock said. ""The cities are closest to the people in them and know best what their residents need, and the states are just disallowing them from doing that.""

State Courts' Trends in Civil Rights

As the federal government pulls back from enforcing civil rights protections across the executive, legislative and judicial branches, state courts and state constitutions have increasingly emerged as the front line for civil rights litigation, said Kasia Szymborski Wolfkot, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Judiciary Program.

Szymborski Wolfkot said a broad federal retrenchment has pushed civil rights advocates to turn to state courts and state Legislatures to vindicate rights that once found protection in federal law. In response, she said, states have begun ""filling the gap.""

That has included interpreting state constitutions more expansively, creating new causes of action and developing remedies that go beyond what is currently available in federal courts. As a result, Szymborski Wolfkot said, state constitutional law has become an increasingly important battleground for civil rights enforcement — one that will likely see important developments in 2026.

Outrage over aggressive immigration enforcement has prompted state lawmakers in immigration-friendly states to consider new accountability mechanisms for federal agents.

Currently, most states lack remedies for violations of state constitutional rights equivalent to those available under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code, the federal civil rights statute, which allows plaintiffs to seek damages against state officials.

But that landscape is changing, Szymborski Wolfkot said.

The Illinois Legislature, for example, recently passed the ""Illinois Bivens Act,"" a law that would allow individuals to sue federal officials for constitutional violations during civil immigration enforcement activities and expand remedies for violations of state constitutional rights. Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed the legislation into law on Dec. 9.

Similar proposals are being considered in other states, including New York, where immigration enforcement has increased dramatically since the beginning of the second Trump administration.

""They've really started to introduce and think about introducing some legislation that gives people private causes of action,"" Szymborski Wolfkot said. ""This is exciting, because while they may be focused on ICE enforcement, it also allows for a cause of action for violations of the state constitution.""

In another growing trend, more states are passing laws barring immigration enforcement in sensitive locations, such as courthouses, schools and hospitals.

Szymborski Wolfkot said that, after the federal government rescinded internal limits on immigration arrests in these places, states like New York stepped in with their own protections. She said additional states are now adopting similar restrictions, framing them as civil rights measures designed to ensure that people can safely access courts, education and medical care without fear of arrest.

State courts are also at the forefront of legal challenges involving the rights of transgender persons.

Following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June in United States v. Skrmetti upholding Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors, trans rights litigation is increasingly moving to state courts, Szymborski Wolfkot said. Montana's Supreme Court struck down a similar ban under its state constitution's privacy protections, and challenges are pending in state courts in Ohio and North Dakota.

Szymborski said ""healthcare freedom"" constitutional amendments, originally adopted to limit the Affordable Care Act, are being used by litigators as tools to challenge restrictions on gender-affirming care and abortion.

""I think that this is going to push a lot of trans rights litigation to state courts under state constitutions,"" she said.

They have stood by while conservative presidential absolutists have framed the debate with labels, shibboleths, and catchphrases that, while misleading or outright false, have tilted the playing field rightward.
Here lies the textualist/originalist case for absolutist unitary executive theory; rest in peace.
Very unfortunately, despite the empty legal grounding and practical horrors of unitary executive theory, liberal advocates have allowed proponents like Kavanaugh to frame and dominate the public narrative.
“Unitary executive theory,” for example, is a mind-numbing, impenetrable abstraction calculated to induce 99 percent of the populace to tune out of the debate altogether.","The media’s takeaways from the December oral arguments in the Trump Justice Department’s bid to the Supreme Court to invalidate multimember “independent agencies” were unanimous: They were a big win for Trump and for legal conservatives’ decades-long drive to free presidents from congressionally imposed checks on presidential control over executive agencies and personnel. The widely anticipated result would render two dozen commissions and boards that have wielded political authority for decades unconstitutional at a stroke.

To provide a modicum of insulation from political interference, these bodies’ governing statutes prescribe that the president may only remove commissioners or board members for “cause”—usually defined as “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Such limitations on presidential removal authority run counter to the “unitary executive theory” treasured by the conservative legal movement. On all sides, pundits heard all six conservative justices signaling that they would likely apply that theory to uphold Trump’s unexplained dismissal of Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, eliminating for-cause removal safeguards and with it, multimember agency independence.

This consensus take is accurate as far as it goes. But beneath the conservative justices’ convergence around that bottom line, the lengthy session exposed reservations, confusion, and differences across the conservative bloc, potentially heralding divergence, uncertainty, proliferating lawsuits, and regulatory gridlock in years ahead—perhaps even this term.

The right-wing justices’ emergent disarray seemed to reflect their awareness of pitfalls lurking in and around their hitherto unquestioned unitary executive gospel—including logical, legal, and most of all, real-world consequences that menace the economy, the nation, and the court itself. With these threats suddenly hoving into view, the conservative justices were flailing to figure out credible strategies to head it off.

Obviously, the gritted-teeth dogmatism of the conservative justices is the engine that has driven this kooky theory forward, despite its evident lack of grounding in constitutional text and history. But liberals also deserve blame. They have stood by while conservative presidential absolutists have framed the debate with labels, shibboleths, and catchphrases that, while misleading or outright false, have tilted the playing field rightward.

Since first hoisted by President Ronald Reagan’s second-term Attorney General Edwin Meese, the unitary executive banner has flown as an originalist imperative, catchily articulated by wordsmith-in-chief Justice Antonin Scalia. Quoting the so-called vesting clause of Article 2 of the Constitution—“The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States”—Scalia spun that text to “not mean some of the executive power, but all of the executive power.” Scalia’s chestnut bred an asserted (though not demonstrated) corollary: that to effectively deploy this sweeping authority, presidents must hold an indefeasible power to remove senior executive officials, certainly agency heads, at will, for any reason or no reason.

But in the oral argument testing this claim, the conservative justices seemed to reckon with the fact that recent scholarship had obliterated unitary executive theorists’ claims to an originalist birthright. Here, hammer blows had been struck by both eminent conservative as well as liberal-leaning academics. In the courtroom, the justices’ grudging recognition came across in a variety of ways.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, perhaps because she repeatedly vaunts her originalist fidelity, tried two countertactics, neither of which seemed to resonate with her conservative colleagues. First, she attempted to trivialize the real-world importance of the several agencies enacted in the 1790s with leadership structures recently shown to lack untrammeled presidential removal authority. Even if this was factually accurate, her contention would have little or no legal probative weight. But Barrett was, indeed, demonstrably wrong on the facts.

In postrevolutionary America, the agencies that Congress saw fit to wall off from presidential at-will removal wielded significant economic and societal power. An example was the Revolutionary War Debt Commission, enacted in 1790, in response to a proposal by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. He called for an entity to be run by “commissioners, vested with … final authority,” not “with the President … nor Hamilton himself as Secretary of the Treasury,” as noted in Georgetown administrative law expert Victoria Nourse’s friend-of-the-court brief. Hamilton estimated that this Commission was tasked with distributing over $25 million, a “tremendous” sum, according to Nourse, more than $880 million today.

Acknowledging that the War Debt Commission and other similarly independent eighteenth-century entities render the vesting clause a thin reed for presidential absolutist unitary executive theorists, Barrett offered a second alternative approach. She observed to Trump’s lawyer, Solicitor General John Sauer, that constitutional provisions other than the vesting clause could plausibly ground a decision to trim Congress’s power to constrain presidential firing discretion. Then she whisked to her point, “Is there any reason to be specific [about which provision the court relies on] in this case?”

Barrett’s stratagem would have the court bless Trump’s unreasoned dismissal of Slaughter without specifying a reasoned basis for its own decision. Would that ploy pass any relevant smell test? Should six unelected, life-tenured justices wipe out over a century of precedent structuring vast sectors of the economy—without bothering to explain where and how they derive the authority to engineer such an epochal upheaval? Unsurprisingly, no takers spoke up to endorse this approach.

The principal constitutional provision Barrett had in mind as an alternative textual basis for Trump’s purported removal of Slaughter was the so-called “take care” clause. This clause prescribes that the president “shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Presidential absolutists have often cast that clause as a grant of power paralleling or reinforcing their Scalian gloss on the vesting clause. Without unbounded power to fire all agency heads, they insist, the president will be unable to ensure their faithful execution of the law.

Thus, as Justice Neil Gorsuch grilled Slaughter’s counsel, Amit Agarwal: “You agree, I assume, the president is vested with all the executive power [echoing Scalia’s 1988 proclamation] (emphasis added),” and that “he has a duty to faithfully execute all the laws.” But Gorsuch, reiterating decades-old assertions by presidential absolutists, misstated the text of both clauses. The vesting clause does not actually say “all” the power; Justice Scalia did. His spin is plausible, but that text certainly permits more nuanced interpretations. In a rare slip during an otherwise on-the-mark performance, Agarwal acquiesced in the Scalia-Gorsuch distortion.

Much more telling, the terms of the take care clause do not direct the president to execute the laws, faithfully or otherwise; the clause requires him to “take care that the Laws be faithfully executed”—that is to say by others; namely, his subordinates. Further, this language prescribes a duty, not a grant of power, and one which he is obligated to “take care” to fulfill.

In practical fact, are presidents disabled from performing that good-faith oversight role if they are authorized to fire agency heads for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance”? On the contrary, such a mandate could more plausibly be understood to affirmatively ensure that a president could use removal authority to further fidelity to law by agency heads—as distinguished from pushing his own political agenda, which is expressly what this administration argues should be a president’s prerogative.

Moreover, Barrett’s (correct) assertion that more than one constitutional provision pertains to presidential removal authority underscores that the vesting clause cannot be read in isolation but must be contextually interpreted in the light of all such relevant constitutional provisions. (The lifting of discrete words or phrases out of context is a common maneuver by conservatives to twist the meaning of legal texts.) Such other provisions would, necessarily, include Article 1’s foundational grant of power to Congress “To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing [enumerated] Powers [specifically assigned to Congress], and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.” (Emphasis mine.) Here lies the textualist/originalist case for absolutist unitary executive theory; rest in peace.

To work around the collapse of this long-standing foundation for presidential absolutism, Barrett’s colleagues on the right took a different tack: They ignored it. They never invoked constitutional text or Framers’ design at all. Instead, they reverted to two strategies. The first was a constitutional policy argument, untethered to constitutional text or original design. This claim was that independent agencies are democratically unaccountable, a failing remediable only by axing removal restrictions and subjecting multimember agencies like the FTC to unlimited control by the elected national chief executive. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh challenged Slaughter’s counsel:

How do you answer the accountability theme.... Independent agencies are not accountable to the people? They’re not elected as Congress and the president are and are exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries?

Reinforcing this “accountability” riff, conservative justices trotted out a second tack—parades of hypothetical horribles, far-fetched in the manner of the fantasies that law professors contrive to bedevil first-year law students. As Kavanaugh, echoing suggestions by Barrett, lectured Slaughter’s counsel:

Your position would allow Congress to ... maybe convert some of the existing executive agencies into independent agencies with no political balance requirement, with a long term, say, 10 or more years.... So you can imagine ... when both houses of Congress and president are controlled by the same party ... so as to thwart future presidents of the opposite party, and ... I don’t think we can just say, oh, that hasn’t happened, so it’ll never happen.

What the “accountability” and parade of horribles gambits both show is that the court’s conservatives, desperate to pull their limping unitary executive theory at-will removal package across the finish line, have leapt from abandoning constitutional text or original meaning to conjuring real-world consequentialist claims that similarly have no connection to on-the-ground reality.

Anyone familiar with the actualities of how nominally “independent” agencies shape and adopt rules and policies, implement, and enforce them—especially those targeting the “billion dollar industries” for which Kavanaugh shed crocodile tears—knows that they are in fact democratically accountable. Their officials are necessarily aware and wary of Congress, where powerful committees and individual members are responsive to interests the agencies regulate, of the federal courts, and of the White House as well. Especially in the current environment, no one who reads newspapers or views newscasts can consider, say, the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Communications Commission “unaccountable.”

Quite apart from such such agencies’ subservience to the current White House, screeds like Kavanaugh’s, against the “headless fourth branch,” leave out the landmark accountability regime that the post–New Deal Congress enacted. This is the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, which gives targets of agency actions statutory rights, enforceable in court—to receive notice; to be heard; to present factual, legal, and policy contentions, before significant agency actions can be undertaken or finalized. To such contentions, agencies must provide “reasonable,” record-based responses or risk getting initiatives scrapped in court.

Those requirements impel agencies to invest years of effort, involving chunks of personnel, revenue, and other resources. Riding on their success, agency leaders, including presidential appointees and presidents themselves, can have significant reputational, ideological, or political stakes. And in terms of democratic accountability, APA-mandated procedures are orders of magnitude more marked by meaningful participation for affected interests, and more transparent to the media and politicians with relevant constituencies and interests, than many secrecy-shrouded backroom maneuvers on Capitol Hill or in the White House—none of which are covered by the APA or equivalent open-government safeguards.

Very unfortunately, despite the empty legal grounding and practical horrors of unitary executive theory, liberal advocates have allowed proponents like Kavanaugh to frame and dominate the public narrative. Their errors and omissions are why liberals have often come up short in the half-century-old war over the courts and the Constitution.

To begin with, liberals have not challenged labels that their conservative adversaries have crafted to frame the debate their way. “Unitary executive theory,” for example, is a mind-numbing, impenetrable abstraction calculated to induce 99 percent of the populace to tune out of the debate altogether. This of course is precisely the impact UET theorists seek.

Liberals should be opening ordinary people’s eyes to the real-world consequences for them of gutting autonomy for, say, the FCC, with its power to grant, deny, condition, or withdraw broadcast licenses, or the FTC, with its power to scotch power-concentrating mergers, rooting out deceptive and abusive marketing schemes, and engineering restitution to victimized consumers.

To do that liberal advocates could begin by replacing the soporific “unitary executive theory” label with one more sharp-edged—perhaps “presidential absolutists” or “politicizers” or “corruption coddlers.” They need to constantly highlight concrete examples of abuses, threatened and actual, and of corruption that could or has already caused attention-getting damage, and spotlight the beneficiaries of agency programs and actions. They could be saying that absolutists are out to “Make America Corrupt Again” or “bring back the swamp.” This should and could be a debate liberals will enjoy having; one that conservatives shall run from.

Too often, liberals counter unitary executive theory with a defense of the need for “impartial experts,“ lauding agency missions in hopelessly abstract terms, such as health or competition or fairness. To be sure, highlighting expertise or critical agency missions is valid and necessary. But taken alone, such frames can reinforce the right’s portrayal of regulatory and other officials as denizens of a remote “administrative state,” distant and undemocratic, performing esoteric duties that don’t speak to the real-world benefits being provided.

Indeed, the very term “independent agency,” which sets the framework for the entire public, political, and constitutional debate, is a misleading misnomer. Presidents have ample means of influencing multimember agencies, notwithstanding that agency leaders can be terminated before their statutorily fixed terms expire (only) for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.” After all, who can, with a straight face, cast that formula as impeding the president’s duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed?

Anyone who has served in a White House and been involved in efforts to nudge agencies like the FTC or FCC toward a president’s policy priorities—as I was in President Jimmy Carter’s White House—knows that presidents have ample legitimate levers, from the authority to select chairpersons from among commission members; to appoint members on a staggered, fixed-term basis; to formally advocate before or in appropriate circumstances contact agency officials; and even to use the president’s bully pulpit.

The claim made by the absolutists, that these agency heads are “unaccountable,” is ahistorical. In addition to ignoring the accountability to the judicial branch created by the APA, that slander leaves out of account the multidecade reform process that turned notoriously timid agencies, which were often cozy with the industries they were assigned to regulate, into agencies that are qualitatively more conscientious, aggressive, and even innovative instruments of the missions Congress created them to serve.

That reform process was sparked by Ralph Nader and his legions of young reform-minded lawyers. Their initial target was the very entity that the Trump White House and its acolytes seek to bring to heel by firing Slaughter simply because she was appointed by Trump’s Democrat predecessor. In 1969, “Nader’s Raiders,” as they were dubbed by The Washington Post’s William Greider, famously delivered an 185-page report, which described the FTC as hobbled by “cronyism, institutionalized mediocrity, endemic inaction, delay, and secrecy ... an iceberg of incompetence and mismanagement.”

The report set off a tidal wave of public demand for reform, such that the new Republican president, Richard M. Nixon, requested a follow-up report from the American Bar Association. When the ABA substantiated and even supplemented Nader’s Raiders’ criticisms, Nixon sent a “Special Message on Consumer Protection” to Congress, elaborating his “belief [that] the time has now come for the reactivation and revitalization of the FTC.”

In addition to proposing a raft of statutory enhancements of the FTC’s jurisdiction and authority. Nixon’s message also detailed an internal reform agenda for the agency. He noted, “The chairman-designate of the FTC has assured me that he intends to initiate a new era of vigorous action as soon as he is confirmed by the Senate and takes office.” Nixon “urge[d] the FTC to give serious consideration” to the ABA report and remedies it proposed, and laid out several specific actions for the agency, including “reduc[ing] its unacceptably large backlog of cases” and “more energetic field investigations.”

Moreover, he noted that his Bureau of the Budget (precursor of the current Office of Management and Budget) would assist in diagnosing problems and shaping solutions, and provide or recommend additional funding if necessary. When Jimmy Carter ascended to the White House in 1976, he solidified and intensified Nixon’s “revitalization” effort, by appointing and naming Michael Pertschuk, a Nader ally, as chairman, and appointing an additional new commissioner—Columbia law professor Robert Pitofsky, the author of the ABA’s report.

Precisely because presidents, Congress, and public opinion held the dysfunctional mid-twentieth-century FTC accountable and enabled its “revitalization,” major businesses invested massive resources to reverse that progress. That backlash campaign has now been capped by this bid to the Supreme Court to overturn long-standing precedent, ignore or misconstrue legal text enacted by Congress or embodied in the Constitution—all in order to give an unabashedly corrupt president direct authority to squelch measures inimical to his or his allies’ interests.",https://images.newrepublic.com/3e105d11127d1a51080ff7949fba987a9ab7991c.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg,N,,2026-01-02 16:57:31.067912

Why it matters: Throughout 2025, the administration downplayed the potential for broad worksite raids and labor enforcement. It received public pushback in instances when it did happen and the administration apologized after a major raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.

The Department of Homeland Security's social media campaign hasn't typically highlighted the worksite enforcement arm of ICE's operations.

But in a post sharing video of a business site visit in Minnesota, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem wrote, ""More coming.""

Driving the news: The most recent wave of enforcement comes after a popular video from YouTuber Nick Shirley claimed that there was fraud at multiple day care centers in the area. Both Noem and FBI director Kash Patel responded to the allegations.

Earlier in December, the local U.S. Attorney's Office charged six people and secured a guilty plea from one woman in ongoing fraud schemes.

DHS is posting videos on social media showing ICE's investigative team, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), conducting visits to business in the name of fighting ""rampant fraud plaguing Minnesota.""

This is a typical function for HSI, which is the investigative arm of ICE.

""We've already heard many businesses who have received some subpoenas for documents,"" said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of Minnesota's chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, commonly known as CAIR.

Zoom in: In one DHS video, officers can be heard asking an employee at a convenience store about E-Verify, a federal program that helps business owners check employees' work authorization status.

The HSI officers also say that a few days prior to the visit that a ""notice of inspection"" was delivered, which starts the I-9 audit process to verify the legal status of a business's workforce force.

Zoom out: The attention on fraud in Minnesota has been a months-long project for DHS with Operation Twin Shield, starting in September, and President Trump calling attention to the issue at a Cabinet meeting in early December.

""The American people deserve answers on how their taxpayer money is being used and ARRESTS when abuse is found,"" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Axios.

According to an online database last week, Oneida-Stantec JV LLC was awarded a $3.9 million contract to work with the federal government on construction of ICE detention facilities. Native Americans across the country have voiced backlash to these types of deals, pointing out their ancestors were once the subject of government-forced removals.

During a news conference Friday, Jeff House, CEO of the Oneida ESC Group, apologized for greenlighting the contract and said ""it was a huge mistake.""

You may not agree or appreciate the decision, but I do want you to know that when I made the decision, the scope of work was really about inspecting facilities, making sure they’re up to code, making sure that they meet humane standards, making sure it’s properly engineered, and while I don’t approve and am appalled by ICE activities, these people are being detained and put in a facility somewhere, and what had gone through my mind was, 'Who is taking care of them? Who is looking out for their best interest?'

Oneida Nation Chairman Tehassi Hill says the Oneida Business Committee was not aware of the contracts and the Nation does not oversee the day-to-day decisions of its corporations.

In response, the Oneida Business Committee adopted a resolution indicating the Nation now requires its divisions, entities and tribal corporations to disengage from grants, agreements or contracts that involve Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values. The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needed to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our Good Mind Principles,"" Hill wrote Wednesday.

House agreed he will meet with the tribe quarterly on projects to ensure they align with the Nation's values.

Additionally, late Friday afternoon, the Oneida Nation announced its Business Committee has replaced the board of managers for the Oneida Engineering Science and Construction Group with an interim board manager -- Debra Powless, the Nation's director of commerce development.

The now-former board managers are Chairman John Breuninger, Jacquelyn Zalim and Leslie Wheelock.

Tribal leaders said two more resolutions have been passed by the Oneida Business Committee to ""provide further policy guidance to the OESC Group"" and require all of the Nation’s corporations to adopt a corporate social responsibility policy.

""Taking this action is a step to ensuring that the future OESC Group Board of Managers and other Nation owned corporate boards practice due diligence in their roles, and active communication with their Nation assigned liaisons,” said Hill.

Online documents show Oneida-Stantec is based in Milwaukee and was formed in 2024 to receive government contracts in the environmental market. Stantec has six Wisconsin offices, including in De Pere and Sturgeon Bay.

The same online database says the business was awarded a $2.6 million contract on Sept. 19. House says he thinks that contract came out of the Biden Administration, but it didn’t get signed until Sept. 22. Work has already begun on that project.

“I have to get more information on that particular contract. I’m just focused on this one that was awarded on the [December] 26th,"" House said.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, in a memo released Thursday, said it would pause the review of all pending applications for visas, green cards, citizenship or asylum from immigrants from the additional countries. The memo also outlines plans to re-review applications of immigrants from these countries as far back as 2021.

The list, which is composed mostly of countries in Africa, includes Angola, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

Last month, the Trump administration expanded the list of countries with travel restrictions to the U.S. from 19 to 39, plus the Palestinian Authority. The move comes as the administration is bringing sharper scrutiny of those who have followed legal steps to seek permanent status in the U.S.

""USCIS remains dedicated to ensuring aliens from high-risk countries of concern who have entered the United States do not pose risks to national security or public safety,"" the memo states as rational for the pause and reviews. ""To faithfully uphold United States immigration law, the flow of aliens from countries with high overstay rates, significant fraud, or both must stop.""

There are some exceptions outlined in the memo, including athletes and members of their teams competing in the World Cup and 2026 Olympics, both hosted by the U.S. this year.

The administration first suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.

Towards the end of 2025, DHS began taking steps to further pause and review these legal avenues of migration. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees processing of applications including for visas, naturalizations and asylum, announced it would re-review the status of everyone who had been admitted into the U.S. as a refugee under the Biden administration, essentially reopening those cases.

The agency also previously announced an indefinite pause in all processing of asylum applications while it works through its backlog.

Oneida Nation officials apologized for entering into contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency after facing backlash from tribal members for the business ventures.

In a Jan. 2 video broadcast on social media, Oneida Chairman Tehassi Hill said he and the rest of the tribal council weren’t aware until Dec. 29 of the contracts between ICE and the tribe’s subsidiary Oneida Engineering, Science and Construction Group (ESC).

“I was very upset when I learned about this,” Hill said in the video broadcast.

Hill said the business venture with ICE does not align with the tribe’s values and the Oneida Nation Business Committee would have never entertained the idea. He added that the tribe's business committee does not engage in the day-to-day decisions of its corporations, but only provides high-level oversight. The Oneida ESC and some of the tribe’s other business entities are kept separate from tribal government to help insulate the tribe from any potential litigation.

Jeff House, CEO of Oneida ESC, also apologized for approving the contracts with ICE, saying it was a mistake.

House said the Dec. 26 contract with ICE was for inspecting facilities and ensuring they are up to code and provide humane standards.

He said he doesn’t approve of what ICE is doing, but he thought the contract would ensure immigrants were being treated properly.

The Federal Procurement Data System, an online database of federal contracts, shows Oneida-Stantec JV LLC (OESC Group) was awarded a $2.6 million contract by ICE on Sept. 19 and a $3.7 million contract by ICE on Dec. 26. The information was first reported by Fox 11 News in Green Bay.

House said he is focused on canceling the Dec. 26 contract as well as gathering more information on the September contract. The contracts are engineering and technical services and for maintenance of government facilities.

A similar situation of a tribal nation facing the ire of Indian Country after it entered into a contract with ICE occurred earlier this month with the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation of Kansas.

Dallas Goldtooth, a popular Indian Country actor, comedian and activist spoke out against the nearly $30 million contract.

“This is a clear example of where economic development without any base values grounded in Indigenous philosophy and human dignity leads you into some dark places,” he wrote on social media about the issue.

In response, Prairie Band officials fired the senior members of the tribe’s LLC, which made the contract with ICE. Potawatomi tribal officials later announced they were able to cancel the contract with ICE.

House said he was aware of the Prairie Band situation, but he believes that tribe’s contract was for building a detention facility on or near the reservation whereas the Oneida contracts were only for inspections.

Oneida officials have faced vocal opposition from hundreds of tribal members after news of the contracts broke.

“This reflects a clear misalignment with the values I expect our elected officials to uphold,” posted tribal member and former Oneida Nation attorney Rebecca Webster on social media. “This is mind boggling that anyone thought this was a good idea.”

Others posted in reply that ICE is targeting mostly Indigenous people from Turtle Island (North America) who happen to be from Mexico or Central America.

There have been incidents in which ICE briefly detained tribal members of reservations in the U.S. in apparent cases of racial profiling. These incidents have drawn a lot of ire from Indian Country because the ones being arrested have ancestors who were among the first people in what is now the U.S., going back at least 10,000 years. ICE agents, on the other hand, typically have ancestors who have been here only a few generations.

Hill said the Oneida Business Committee also passed a resolution in response to the situation to clarify on the tribe’s position.

“Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values,” Hill said in a statement.

“The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needs to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our ‘Good Mind Principles’.”","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/presto/2020/03/17/PGRB/31dd4a66-a373-48ec-ad0d-9fb01b269842-GPGCasino02377.JPG?crop=3044,1713,x0,y154&width=3044&height=1713&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 16:57:24.870762

Tuccille, Billy Binion",,,,,https://reason.com/volokh/2026/01/02/presence-of-probable-clause-precludes-claim-that-immigration-arrest-was-retaliation-for-first-amendment-protected-speech/,"Under Nieves, plaintiffs must also show the defendant had no probable cause to arrest the plaintiff.
And even the Bello-Reyes court noted that § 1357 has a probable cause requirement.
Thus, the two factors considered by the Bello-Reyes court are unsound or inapplicable.
[T]he Court's focuses on whether Respondents had probable cause and whether Petitioner's advocacy was the but-for cause of his arrest.
Rather, as stated earlier, Petitioner only argues that Nieves probable cause requirement should not be required.","The First Amendment ""prohibits government officials from subjecting an individual to retaliatory actions for engaging in protected speech. If an official takes adverse action against someone based on that forbidden motive, and non-retaliatory grounds are in fact insufficient to provoke the adverse consequences, the injured person may generally seek relief by bringing a First Amendment claim."" Nieves v. Bartlett (2019) (citation modified).

To prove First Amendment retaliation, Petitioner must show: (1) he engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) Respondents actions injured him such that a person of ordinary firmness would be chilled from engaging in that activity, and (3) Petitioner engaging in his constitutionally protected activity substantially motivated Respondents' retaliatory actions. Under Nieves, plaintiffs must also show the defendant had no probable cause to arrest the plaintiff. Only then may courts analyze the substantial motivation prong. But Nieves exempts the ""no-probable cause"" requirement when ""officers have probable cause to make arrests but typically exercise their discretion not to do so."" A plaintiff must present ""objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.""

Petitioner argues—for the first time in his reply—that the Court should not require him to show Respondents had no probable cause to arrest him, following the Ninth Circuit's approach in Bello-Reyes v. Gaynor (9th Cir. 2021). In Bello-Reyes, the Ninth Circuit ruled the plaintiff did not need to show the defendants had no probable cause for his immigration bond revocation. The Ninth Circuit so ruled for two reasons. First, the Ninth Circuit noted that unlike Nieves, which arose from a § 1983 claim, Bello-Reyes involved a habeas petition. And while it is necessary, in § 1983 suits, ""to identify the particular state official or officials who violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights,"" not so in habeas. Since a habeas petitioner ""need not identify a particular violator, only that his confinement is unconstitutional,"" the Ninth Circuit deemed the ""problems of causation that may counsel for a no-probable cause standard are less acute in the habeas context.""

Second, the Ninth Circuit noted that while ""a probable cause requirement exists for initial immigration arrests,"" there is ""no equivalent benchmark"" when ""ICE is revoking bond rather than arresting in the first instance."" Since there was no objective benchmark for bond revocations, which are fully discretionary, the Ninth Circuit concluded that those whose immigration bond was revoked could never be released on habeas if they were required to show no-probable cause. The Court finds Bello-Reyes unconvincing.

First, while Petitioner need not identify a particular official (who violated Petitioner's rights) in the habeas context, he must still show that engaging in constitutionally protected activity was the but-for cause for the Respondents to arrest him. Thus, the same ""problems of causation"" that exists in § 1983 contexts also appear in the habeas context.

Second, unlike Bello-Reyes, involving a petitioner subject to bond revocation, this case involves Petitioner's arrest, which involves 8 U.S.C. § 1357. And even the Bello-Reyes court noted that § 1357 has a probable cause requirement. Thus, the two factors considered by the Bello-Reyes court are unsound or inapplicable.

Third—and most importantly—Bello-Reyes is on a collision course with Nieves. Nieves lays the general framework to establish First Amendment retaliatory arrest claims. And while that suit was brought using § 1983, this Court does not see why the same claim would have a different framework solely due to a different cause of action. Nieves—and Gonzalez v. Trevino (2024)—suggest the same. In Gonzalez, the Court reiterated that Nieves ""recognized a narrow exception to [the no-probable cause] rule. The existence of probable cause does not defeat a plaintiff's claim if he produces 'objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.'"" This language does not suggest First Amendment retaliatory arrest elements differ based on the cause of action. And ""when the highest court in the country has spoken clearly on a matter of federal constitutional law,"" this Court ""is not at liberty to disregard or parse that decision"" in an inconsistent way….

To reiterate, Petitioner must show, to prevail on his retaliatory arrest claim: (1) he was engaged in constitutionally protected activity, (2) Respondents arrested him, (3) Respondents had no probable cause to arrest Petitioner or would not have arrested other similarly situated individuals who did not engage in such constitutionally protected activity, and (4) Petitioner engaging in his constitutionally protected activity was the but-for cause of his arrest….

[T]he Court's focuses on whether Respondents had probable cause and whether Petitioner's advocacy was the but-for cause of his arrest.

Respondents produced an immigration warrant signed a day before Petitioner's arrest, showing DHS had ""probable cause to believe that [Petitioner] is removable from the United States."" Furthermore, Respondents aver that Petitioner was arrested to place him in removal proceedings.

Petitioner provides no evidence showing Respondents had no probable cause to arrest him. Rather, as stated earlier, Petitioner only argues that Nieves probable cause requirement should not be required. Nevertheless, Petitioner could overcome Nieves general rule ""if he produces 'objective evidence that he was arrested when otherwise similarly situated individuals not engaged in the same sort of protected speech had not been.'"" But Petitioner has not done so. Even if he does, the existence of probable cause that Petitioner was unlawfully present in the United States means that Petitioner's advocacy could not be the but-for cause of his arrest. As such, Petitioner's retaliatory arrest claim is not likely to succeed on the merits….",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2021/11/reason-logo-featured-placeholder.jpg.webp,N,,2026-01-02 13:57:16.927132

And so far, the list is long — stretching across senior committee chairs, high-profile party figures, and members from battleground districts.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is leaving her coastal 1st District seat to run for governor, opening a Republican-leaning district seat.
Reps. Byron Donalds (Fla.), Chip Roy (Texas), Barry Moore (Ala.), Buddy Carter (Ga.), and others are trading House seats for high-stakes Senate, governor, or statewide races.","With the 2026 midterms approaching, a wave of congressional departures is reshaping the political landscape on Capitol Hill. Members from both parties are announcing retirements, resignations, and bids for higher office — developments that could play a pivotal role in determining which party controls the U.S. House next year.

Republicans are defending a razor-thin majority, and several of the lawmakers heading for the exits have been among President Donald Trump’s most outspoken allies. For Democrats, every retirement represents a potential opening as they work to retake the majority.

Retirements are often viewed as an early barometer of political headwinds, signaling churn, internal frustration, or a strategic calculation about the road ahead. And so far, the list is long — stretching across senior committee chairs, high-profile party figures, and members from battleground districts.

Among the most notable departures:

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) said he will retire after more than three decades, citing redistricting changes upheld by the Supreme Court.

Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) will step down after three terms and is backing his twin brother to succeed him.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) stunned colleagues with a resignation announcement amid a public break with Trump.

Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) joined a crowded field for governor, leaving his Bay Area seat open.

Rep. Nydia Velázquez (D-N.Y.), a pioneering figure and longtime mentor to progressives, emphasized the need for generational change.

Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) will retire despite Trump’s endorsement, stepping away after helping push through major tax legislation.

Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) will end her historic tenure as the first Black woman to represent her state in the House.

Rep. Chuy García (D-Ill.) will leave Congress to focus on family health concerns and a gubernatorial bid.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) is leaving her coastal 1st District seat to run for governor, opening a Republican-leaning district seat.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will retire after nearly 40 years, closing a chapter on one of the most influential careers in modern congressional history.

Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine), one of the most moderate Democrats in the House, is stepping aside amid rising incivility and threats.

Dozens more are departing to run for Senate or gubernatorial seats — including Iowa’s Ashley Hinson, Massachusetts’ Seth Moulton, Texas’ Wesley Hunt, Wisconsin’s Tom Tiffany, Arizona’s David Schweikert, Texas' Jasmic Crockett and New Hampshire’s Chris Pappas.

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) stunned the political world by announcing she would not seek reelection in 2026 — a move that quickly scrambled Iowa’s political map, leading Hinson to vacate her competitive northeastern House seat to run for Ernst’s Senate seat, billing herself as “President Trump’s top ally in the United States Senate.”

In northwest Iowa, Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, jumped into the race for governor after both Ernst and Gov. Kim Reynolds signaled they wouldn’t seek new terms.

Crockett’s entry to run for Senate, leaving behind a safely Democratic House seat, highlights a broader national trend: a wave of House members pursuing higher office as both parties brace for a major midterm election year.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), former chair of the House Freedom Caucus and one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, is running for governor with Trump’s blessing.

Reps. Byron Donalds (Fla.), Chip Roy (Texas), Barry Moore (Ala.), Buddy Carter (Ga.), and others are trading House seats for high-stakes Senate, governor, or statewide races.

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) was in the race for New York governor after her withdrawn U.N. ambassadorship and public rift with GOP leadership, but announced in December that she would be suspending her campaign for governor.

Ambitious climbs on both sides of the aisle

Running for governor:

David Schweikert (R-Ariz.)

Tom Tiffany (R-Wis.)

Ralph Norman (R-S.C.)

Byron Donalds (R-Fla.)

Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.)

Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.)

John James (R-Mich.)

Mikie Sherrill (D-N.J.) already successfully made the jump after announcing her 2024 gubernatorial run and winning the election.

Running for Senate:

Angie Craig D-(Minn.)

Haley Stevens (D-Mich.)

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.)

Robin Kelly (D-Ill.)

Chris Pappas (D-N.H.)

Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas)

Wesley Hunt (R-Texas)

Andrew Barr (R-Ky.)

Buddy Carter (R-Ga.)

Barry Moore (R-Ala.)

Other statewide races

In Texas, Rep. Chip Roy is seeking to succeed Attorney General Ken Paxton, while Paxton himself runs for Senate — another example of how Trump-era figures are reshuffling the GOP bench.

Others are leaving politics altogether, like Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas), a longtime foreign policy hawk warning of rising global threats, and Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.), who has struggled to balance a bipartisan brand with a changing district.

With familiar names like Mace, Ernst, Nadler, Pelosi, Velázquez, Doggett, and McCaul either moving on or setting off statewide domino effects, the 2026 midterms are shaping up as a test not just of Trump’s influence, but of how both parties manage generational turnover on Capitol Hill.

Both parties now face an unpredictable map heading into 2026. For Republicans, every vacancy risks complicating an already narrow majority. For Democrats, the openings represent rare opportunities in competitive districts where retirements can quickly reshape the race.

As lawmakers continue to exit and new candidates jump in, the House landscape is being redrawn in real time — setting up one of the most consequential midterm cycles in years.",https://wcti12.com/resources/media/195fcb04-4ef5-475c-bb8b-5b3b25017baf-jumbo16x9_AP24120810340643.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 13:12:51.120826

Just days ago, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that it would be conducting an audit of the immigration and citizenship cases of individuals from 19 countries, including Somalia. The audit comes in response to concerns raised that the 98 people charged with defrauding Minnesota’s social welfare programs may have also lied and presented fraudulent documentation during the naturalization process. At least 85 of those charged are of Somali descent; however a vast majority of them are United States citizens. Although it is uncertain how many of them were born in the United States.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared on Fox & Friends that the Trump administration is “""not afraid to use denaturalization.” She also shared that a joint effort is underway between the State Department and DHS to determine steps necessary to revoke citizenship status of Somali immigrants charged or convicted in the Minnesota fraud scandal.

""Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

However, attorney David Schoen, who formerly represented President Donald Trump, shared that it would require an ""extraordinary circumstance” for a person to become denaturalized, which is a rare occurrence.

There's a mechanism in place for people who are still green card holders, who are fomenting violence on campus and all of that, to be deported,” Schoen told Fox News Digital.

Judge Jackson also concluded that the preliminary injunction provision precluding the CFPB from instituting an agency-wide mass reduction-in-force (“RIF”) remains in full force and effect.
We have previously argued that “combined earnings” means combined profits and won’t belabor our argument in this blog.
Judge Jackson’s opinion may also affect the CFPB’s Regulatory Agenda, which the industry largely supports.
In light of Judge Jackson’s opinion, perhaps it will be unnecessary to use interim final rules as its path for accomplishing the bureau’s Regulatory Agenda.","In a case of first impression, in clarifying her injunction issued in the lawsuit brought by the National Treasury Employees Union and others challenging the planned reductions in force and other efforts to reduce functions at the CFPB, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the DC Federal District Court vigorously rejected the opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice (“OLC”) that the CFPB may not be funded by the Fed because (1) the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the CFPB may only be funded by the Fed out of “combined earnings of the Federal Reserve System”, (2) the term “combined earnings” means combined profits and not combined revenues and (3) the Federal Reserve System has incurred losses since September 2022. Instead, Judge Jackson held that “combined earnings” means simply combined revenues.

As a result of reaching this opinion, Judge Jackson concluded that the preliminary injunction issued by her earlier this year, as slightly modified by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, remains in full force and effect and that the CFPB may not refuse to request additional funds from the Fed in order to perform statutorily required functions. Judge Jackson also concluded that the preliminary injunction provision precluding the CFPB from instituting an agency-wide mass reduction-in-force (“RIF”) remains in full force and effect.

In reaching her opinion about the funding issue, it is noteworthy that Judge Jackson based her opinion on the assumption that the Federal Reserve Banks are still losing money even though the plaintiffs argued that they are now turning a profit on a combined basis and that, even if OLC’s interpretation of “combined earnings” is correct, that argument would be moot under existing circumstances. As a result, the Court avoided having to conduct a hearing to determine whether the Federal Reserve Banks now are profitable on a combined basis and, if so, whether the Fed would be required to honor certain funding requests from the CFPB.

Judge Jackson addresses in her opinion among other things, prior CFPB and Fed statements regarding interpretations of the funding language in Dodd Frank.

As recently as 2024, the CFPB took the position in CFPB enforcement litigation that the “plain meaning” of “combined earnings.”

refers to the System’s income.” Chair Jerome Powell reiterated this position interpretation in testimony before Congress; he explained that the Fed “looked at th[is] question very carefully” and determined that “it’s very clear on the law and legislative history” that the Fed is “required to make those payments” even when the Fed is operating at a loss.

Judge Jackson further relied on dictionary definitions of “earnings” which defined the word as revenues. Judge Jackson noted that the Federal Reserve Act used the term “net earnings” and (and not “earnings) to mean profits. Finally, Judge Jackson argued that Congress could not have intended to subject the CFPB’s survival to the vagaries of the Fed’s financial situation from time to time.

We have previously argued that “combined earnings” means combined profits and won’t belabor our argument in this blog. Suffice it to say, we would expect the CFPB to take an immediate appeal of Judge Jackson’s opinion to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. There is already pending before the that Court en banc an appeal from Judge Jackson’s issuance of the preliminary injunction (A three-judge panel of the Circuit Court had reversed Judge Jackson’s earlier decision, but that decision was vacated when the Circuit Court granted a petition for rehearing en banc.) In order to shorten the review time for any appeal of Judge Jackson’s new opinion dealing with the funding issue, it would make sense for that appeal to be combined by the en banc Circuit Court with the already pending appeal without the new appeal first being heard by a three-judge panel. It seems likely that the funding issue is headed to the Supreme Court. `

Things are further complicated by two other recently filed lawsuits filed by Public Citizen in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California (see here) and another by 21 state attorneys general in the Federal District Court for the District of Oregon, which raise the same funding questions (see here ).

In the meantime, unless the CFPB is able to obtain a stay of Judge Jackson’s clarification, Acting Director Vought may need to request funds from the Fed since, according to the Acting Director, the CFPB is on the verge of running out of money and would be in violation of the preliminary injunction if he still refuses to request funds from the Fed. Judge Jackson’s opinion may also affect the CFPB’s Regulatory Agenda, which the industry largely supports. That agenda includes, among other things, proposed rules regarding the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Section 1033 of Dodd Frank (open banking), and Section 1071(small business loans data collection). Since Vought announced that the CFPB would soon be running out of funds and that he felt legally unable to request funds from the Fed, the industry has been deeply concerned about how the CFPB would be able to accomplish its ambitious regulatory agenda.

There had been rumors, and in some court cases’ status reports filed by the CFPB, indicating that the bureau would issue one or more Interim Final Rules before it ran out of funds.

In light of Judge Jackson’s opinion, perhaps it will be unnecessary to use interim final rules as its path for accomplishing the bureau’s Regulatory Agenda.

After declining to turn over data on residents who use food stamps to the federal government, including their immigration status, Hawaiʻi faces the threat of losing tens of millions in funding to operate the food aid program.

Brooke Rollins, secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, vowed in December to withhold the federal funds used to administer the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program from states that have not complied.

The state chose not to provide the data because it “is committed to protecting the personal information of individuals applying for and receiving SNAP,” said Scott Morishige, who heads the Department of Human Services division that manages the program.

For Hawaiʻi, that could mean a loss of up to $33 million in federal funding in 2026.

“DHS is currently reviewing potential options if federal funds are withheld,” Morishige said.

Such an event would force the state to make tough decisions about hiring freezes, delays in technology upgrades and perhaps layoffs of administrative staff and eligibility workers, said Colin Moore, a political scientist at University of Hawaiʻi Mānoa.

Even if the money is not withheld, the predicament foreshadows other changes in SNAP funding the state will have to confront later this year.

“I don’t think you would see the effect necessarily on SNAP recipients immediately,” Moore said. “It’s about slow erosion of the infrastructure that supports the program.”

‘Strategic Pressure On States’

The USDA in February first demanded that states share five years of details including names, addresses and immigration status about SNAP recipients. Rollins said it was necessary to root out fraud.

She leveled her latest threat in early December at Hawaiʻi and 21 other states that sued the department in July over what they called an unprecedented and unlawful request. The states said they already verify beneficiaries’ eligibility and never share such “large swaths” of personal data with the federal government. Those states, and the District of Columbia — which also joined the legal challenge — all are led by Democrats.

Rollins targeted administrative funding, not funding that goes directly to recipients, which Moore called “a very strategic way for the federal government to put pressure on states; it’s both evil and clever.”

“It avoids the political backlash of cutting benefits that would probably be unacceptable to the vast majority of voters,” he said. “It targets the state level bureaucracies, and that means it really puts pressure on the governors of these blue states and their bureaucratic leaders, which is a far less sympathetic constituency than families who need food.”

The legal challenge to the USDA request is ongoing. In October, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily barred the USDA from collecting the data from states that had not yet turned it over; Rollins did not address that order when she made her December statements at a Trump administration cabinet meeting. Twenty eight states have shared their SNAP recipient data with the USDA, Rollins said.

The demand for SNAP data echoes the administration’s efforts to obtain historically confidential personal information, such as taxpayer and Medicaid records. Those moves have been explicitly framed as ways to bolster Trump’s anti-immigrant campaign as well as to cut waste and fraud.

And the push has been in the works starting soon after inauguration day, if not before. The conservative Project 2025 blueprint that Trump disclaimed knowledge of during the election but has taken full pages from — co-author Russell Vought is a top administration official — outlined information sharing between federal and state agencies as a way to enhance immigration enforcement.

“It is essential to use all available legal authority to end any incentives in (USDA) benefit programs that encourage illegal immigration,” Rollins wrote in a February letter to state and local governments.

Changes On The Way

Undocumented immigrants are not eligible for SNAP, but their children are if born in the U.S. COFA citizens — those from the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau who are in the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association agreements — Cuban and Haitian immigrants and certain lawful permanent residents also can qualify for benefits. In Hawaiʻi, at last count, there were 13,190 people with unspecific citizenship or identified as non-citizens receiving SNAP, Morishige said.

Yet a 2025 Congressional Research Service report found fraud in the $100 billion program rare. For example, in 2021, it said, states tried to recover $54 million in benefits that were “trafficked” — sold for cash — or where fraud was committed during the application process. Errors made by state agencies, in the form of SNAP benefit payments that were too large or too small, were a greater source of financial loss – some $10.5 billion in 2023.

Hawaiʻi had an error rate of 8% in fiscal year 2024, down from about 21% the previous two years. That’s compared to a nationwide error rate of 11.7% in 2023.

Rollins said that based on information from states that have submitted the requested data, 186,000 dead people are receiving SNAP benefits nationally and 500,000 people are getting double benefits. That reflects .4% and 1.2% respectively of the 42 million people receiving the benefits monthly.

About 162,000 Hawaiʻi residents rely on SNAP and, in September, received an average of $343 each.

Even if the USDA does not follow through on Rollins’ promise to withhold funding, Hawaiʻi will face a somewhat similar scenario in late 2026. At that point, changes to SNAP outlined in the domestic budget bill Trump signed in July will take effect and states will be forced to pick up a larger share of the program’s administrative costs.

Now, the federal government pays 50% of the state’s administrative costs. Under the changes that are to take place in October, that share drops to 25%.

Other changes the bill contained included stricter eligibility requirements and work requirements that kicked in in November.

Tavi said the need is dire for her office and other legal service organizations to help children like J.A.L.L.","A 17-year-old Massachusetts teen was recently released from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Connecticut and returned home to his family for the holidays after he was detained by agents in New York in August.

The teenager, identified by his initials, J.A.L.L., was detained on Aug. 3 while in Buffalo, with his 18-year-old brother and a friend, according to attorney Chris Mattei, a member of his legal team from Bridgeport-based Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, PC.

According to Mattei, the three were stopped while leaving a CVS in Buffalo, New York. Local police officers approached them asking for identification. All three reportedly showed identification and were told they were free to go. Before traveling too far, the vehicle was pulled over.

“They were held for a period of time until the Department of Homeland Security arrived,” Mattei said. For reasons that are not clear and certainly not lawful they then came and scooped all three of these guys, including an American citizen.”

“They detained all three of them and quickly processed our client and his brother to Texas,” Mattei said. “You can imagine the unexpected nightmare of one second being in the car with your brother and your friend just living out your normal high school life and then the next thing you’re on a plane to Texas facing deportation.”

According to Mattei, the friend, an American citizen, was released and J.A.L.L.’s brother was ordered deported to Ecuador because he was 18. J.A.L.L, a minor, was put in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services.

The Massachusetts teen remained in an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter in Texas until Oct. 9, according to Mattei. After that he was transferred to a shelter in Groton, Noank Community Support Services, where he was held until Dec. 23 when he was released after his lawyers filed a successful habeas petition on Dec. 19.

“Once he was arrested, and when he informed the Department of Homeland Security officials that he had status in the United States and was living with his father, they apparently coerced him into signing papers consenting to be deported to Ecuador until it was put on hold,” Mattei alleged.

According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, its mission “is to promote the health, well-being, and stability of refugees, unaccompanied alien children, and other eligible individuals and families, through culturally responsive, trauma-informed, and strengths-based services.” The shelter in Groton reportedly runs a federal program shelter separate from ICE’s detention or enforcement roles

Mattei said he was contacted by the Center for Children’s Advocacy in early December.

“They started to become quite concerned with this particular child’s situation because he had been separated from his father for about four months … two of those months were spent in Texas,” Mattei said.

“He was then brought back to the Northeast and, despite his father having already been approved as a ‘sponsor,’ that is somebody for him to live with in this country, and despite the fact that he had lived with his father in the United States for five years, there was just this bureaucratic nightmare that seemed intentional preventing him from being reunited with his father,” according to Mattei.

“With the situation becoming increasingly dire, the Center for the Children’s Advocacy and my law firm decided to get involved to see if we could raise the issue of his detention with a federal judge to see if we could get him out,” Mattei said.

Sabrina Tavi, director of the Immigrant Children’s Justice Project for the Center for Children’s Advocacy, said she and Mattei went to work on the case about three weeks ago. Mattei works for the same law firm that helped free Kevin, a Meriden teenager who was also released from ICE custody right before Christmas.

Mattei said he had no idea detained children were being housed in Connecticut. According to Mattei, the Noank Community Support Services is contracted by the Department of Health and Human Services. The facility is to provide shelter and to meet the daily needs of children who are in the Department of Health and Human Services custody.

“We were convinced that there was really nothing about his either initial arrest in August or his four-month detention that was lawful,” Mattei said. “Once we were retained and we familiarized ourselves with the facts we filed a habeas petition and a motion for a preliminary injunction quickly as we could.

“We were so disgusted by the fact that this child had been forcibly separated from his father. He lived with him for five years uninterrupted with no issues. He was a full-time high school student and for reasons that are not clear, and the government did not defend, he was arrested in August and separated from father,” Mattei added. “He was not one of these children who had nowhere to go and nobody to take care of him. To the contrary, his father had been approved by the government to be his sponsor in the United States, so he should have never been there.”

Mattei said J.A.L.L. and his father are not U.S. citizens but aren’t here unlawfully and are seeking permanent status.

“It’s just like a family that comes to the United States under different circumstances that are going through the lawful channels of trying to establish residency here,” Mattei said.

J.A.L.L. was released to his father on Dec. 23 after driving through a snowstorm.

“We spoke to him soon after and they were both in tears and I think in some ways, it was bittersweet because they were thrilled to be together and they’re going to be going back to Massachusetts to celebrate Christmas with family,” Mattei said. “But his brother was not going to be there. I think it was obviously a great relief to be reunited and also both felt pain for going through something like that.”

Tavi said she learned about J.A.L.L.’s case in early December. She said the high school junior’s father was previously approved for him to live with during the time when he was granted Special Immigrant Juvenile status and deferred action, which is reportedly the government’s agreement that, while he awaits the availability of a visa, they won’t take any action to deport him in recognition of the fact that he has approved SIJ.

According to Tavi, J.A.L.L. had employment authorization, a Social Security number and has been an excellent high school student taking advanced classes in preparation for college. While in Texas, Tavi said, J.A.L.L. was teaching other students how to speak English.

“He’s lost a half of a year of his education and the harm and drama he experienced can’t be overstated,” Tavi said. “He’s been home about a week and hasn’t been to school yet because of the holidays. He had a joyful reunion with his father and family but is readjusting and ready to start the new year.”

Connecticut does not have any detention centers for adults detained by ICE, but there are several contracted facilities for detained children.

“There are other children being detained and we have heard anecdotally that under this administration there’s been an increase in interior enforcement actions against children who are already residing in the U.S. like J.A.L.L,” Tavi said.

Tavi said the need is dire for her office and other legal service organizations to help children like J.A.L.L.

“We are so relieved to have him reunited with his family. That is the goal,” Tavi said. “What we did was put a stop to the harm that the government was inflicting on him. But there is nothing there that makes this child whole again. There’s nothing there that heals him and his family from the harm and trauma that was inflicted on this child. It is still there, and it still exists.”",https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thc-l-IMMIGRATION-AGENT.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-02 15:56:37.791995

In 2025, California became the frontline of a federal playbook for more militarized immigration enforcement.

Raids on California streets and lawsuits that followed helped rewrite the ground rules for how agents can operate. What began as before-dawn operations in Golden State farm towns quickly expanded into a broader nationwide strategy: surprise workplace and neighborhood sweeps and roving patrols miles from the border.

CalMatters reporters across California documented how tactics first seen in Kern County, such as warrantless traffic stops and a heavy reliance on appearance-based profiling, spread statewide and then across the country. The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld these methods.

Early in the second Trump administration, the federal government sent Marines to the border, citing a crisis. Those troops have since quietly gone home.

Hundreds of National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles following civil unrest about immigration arrests. President Donald Trump threatened to send forces to the Bay Area, then backed off. State officials objected, while federal leaders characterized the moves as necessary. The standoff deepened long-running tensions between California and the White House over the state’s sanctuary policy and federal authority.

All this fell most heavily on families with deep roots in California. CalMatters found deportations increasingly reached people who have decades-long residence, U.S.-citizen children, stable employment, and even those following legal pathways. ICE detained people at green-card interviews and routine check-ins. The changes destabilized school systems, the agricultural economy, and health care.

A federal lawsuit over a deaf asylum seeker’s prolonged detention exposed gaps in medical care and disability accommodations in immigration facilities. Under Trump, asylum seekers with pending claims lost protection from arrest. A new system is emerging where people trying to follow the rules are easier targets than those evading them. Detention centers drew scrutiny as local authorities shied away from conducting health and safety inspections, while advocates reported worsening conditions inside.

A quieter but equally consequential trend has emerged: The immigrant population shrank. Love them or hate them, Trump’s immigration policies were achieving the administration’s goals. Pew Research found the national immigration population shrank by about 1.4 million people in the first half of 2025, the first decline in half a century. Economists warned about slower growth. State leaders weighed long-term impacts on the workforce, schools, and social service systems.

Enforcement grew more data-driven. Drone surveillance expanded in urban areas, and advocates warned about new uses of artificial intelligence to identify deportation targets and analyze asylum and visa applicants’ digital histories.

2026 outlook: California expects further interior enforcement, additional legal battles over sanctuary laws, funding, and renewed attempts to expand detention capacity.

Rhode Island

In November 2025, the Providence City Council unanimously passed new immigration and policing reforms to the Community-Police Relations Act, which restricts the Providence Police Department officers’ ability to assist federal immigration enforcement. The federal Department of Homeland Security has also claimed that Rhode Island is defying national immigration policy.

RI’s ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown said in an interview with Rhode Island Current, the reasoning for the administration’s attitude could be a 2014 federal court order. It ruled that police officers in Rhode Island cannot hold a person in custody based on just a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer for more than 48 hours. The state’s Attorney General, Peter Neronha, has also taken part in multiple cross-state lawsuits against the administration’s immigration policy reforms.

Massachusetts

In Massachusetts, the state Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 2017 that local law enforcement officers have no legal authority to arrest, detain or hold an individual based solely on a federal civil immigration detainer. Cities and towns such as Boston, Amherst, Cambridge, Chelsea, Concord, Newton, Northampton and Somerville have passed local laws limiting their police departments’ involvement in federal civil immigration enforcement. The Trump administration sued Boston over its Trust Act in September and Boston has asked a judge to dismiss that lawsuit. Similarly, sanctuary cities sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut them off from federal funds in response to their stance on assisting civil immigration enforcement.

Maine

In Maine, the state legislature passed a bill in June 2025 aimed at limiting how state and local law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities. At the time, Gov. Janet Mills called the bill “overly broad and confusing,” and held it over until the next legislative session. But in December, Mills announced she would let the bill become law without her signature, saying that, while imperfect, it was one way to push back against what she calls “ICE’s unacceptable actions.”

Vermont

For years, Vermont law has required all law enforcement agencies to adopt a “fair and impartial policing” policy, which, among other things, prohibits Vermont police from enforcing civil immigration law. The policy bars state and local police from asking about a person’s immigration status unless it’s relevant to a criminal investigation. Vermont law enforcement officers are also limited in when they can share identifying information about a person, like their physical address or license plate information, with federal immigration authorities.

While the Trump administration has identified Vermont as a “sanctuary state,” Gov. Phil Scott has rejected that label, asserting that the state “does not have any law or policy that impedes the enforcement of federal immigration law.”

Connecticut

Connecticut has had a statewide Trust Act in place since it was passed by lawmakers in 2013. It limits how local and state law enforcement interact with ICE authorities by restricting information sharing between agencies, such as a person’s immigration status. When President Trump returned to office in early 2025, advocates launched a campaign to strengthen the act. Lawmakers were considering a bill that would bring about even more limits in communication between Connecticut law enforcement and ICE authorities. It was heavily debated and led to updates to the state’s Trust Act in October, placing those limitations on all state and municipal employees, as well as criminal prosecutors. People are now able to sue local municipalities and police departments in Connecticut for violating the Trust Act under the newest update to the law.

In a special legislative session this November, Connecticut lawmakers passed legislation that limits immigration arrests on courthouse grounds without a signed judicial warrant. It also bars law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings in court without a medical need. The move comes after an uptick in ICE apprehensions around courthouses in Connecticut, including an arrest that took place inside a courthouse in Stamford.

New Hampshire

New Hampshire is an outlier in the Democratic-controlled region and is following the legislative trends of Republican states in other parts of the country. The Republican-controlled State House passed two laws in 2025 requiring local police departments to cooperate with federal immigration authorities. These had strong support from Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, a former Attorney General with long-standing ties to law enforcement.

New Hampshire was also part of a wave of Republican states that passed legislation to invalidate certain out-of-state driver’s licenses “issued by another state exclusively to undocumented immigrants who are unable to prove lawful presence in the United States when the licenses are issued.” In practice, this means that the law only invalidates this class of license in Delaware and Connecticut.

Ayotte has been vocal in her support for tougher immigration enforcement.

“We are the safest state in the nation. We’re going to continue to be that, and this is a big step forward,” she said in a bill signing ceremony. “There will be no sanctuary cities in New Hampshire. Period. End of story.”",https://oceanstatemedia.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bfaa61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1760x990+0+92/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-ri.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F14%2F15852bf74c019b3ba2acc4e41926%2Fdownload-39.webp,N,,2026-01-02 12:56:57.881195

Class Actions.
These moves underscore how class actions may be increasingly important tools for challenging government action.","The Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. marks a major shift in how federal courts may police executive action. In the Court's June 27, 2025 decision, a 6-3 majority held that so-called ""universal"" or nationwide injunctions — orders barring enforcement of a federal law or policy against all persons, not just the parties before the court — exceed the equitable authority that Congress granted to federal courts. But even as it restricted universal injunctions, the Court in CASA left open other potential bases for broad relief. The decision offers important lessons for entities affected by government action to protect their interests.

The Supreme Court's CASA Decision

CASA arose from President Trump's executive order seeking to restrict birthright citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. Three federal district courts issued injunctions blocking the president's order nationwide. The Trump administration sought partial stays of those orders in the Supreme Court — focusing its attack not on the lower courts' constitutional rulings, but rather on the nationwide scope of the injunctions.

The Supreme Court held that the universal injunctions were improper. Justice Barrett's majority opinion rested on the Judiciary Act of 1789 — the statute that authorizes federal courts to issue remedies like injunctions. The Court held that the Judiciary Act authorizes only those remedies traditionally available in English courts at the time the United States was founded. The Court viewed that historical tradition as largely foreclosing universal injunctions. The Court acknowledged, however, that there may be situations where granting a broad injunction is necessary to provide the plaintiff ""complete relief"" in the case.

Open Avenues and Open Questions

What remains of universal relief after CASA? Three avenues are most promising, but each carries uncertainty.

1. APA Relief. CASA explicitly declined to address the ""distinct question"" of relief in cases brought under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The APA allows challenges to federal agency actions and instructs courts to ""hold unlawful and set aside"" impermissible actions.

Historically, courts have understood this language to authorize universal vacatur — that is, invalidation beyond the particular parties. Even before CASA, however, the government argued that the APA must be read in harmony with traditional equity limits and thus does not permit universal vacatur. Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Barrett have signaled support for that restrictive view; Justice Kavanaugh has taken the opposite position (and reiterated that position in CASA), and Chief Justice Roberts has shown skepticism during oral arguments (calling the no-universal-vacatur position ""radical"" and quipping that judges on the D.C. Circuit vacate rules ""five times before breakfast"").

Yet two issues complicate APA remedies. Most critically, there are major unanswered questions about preliminary relief under the APA. CASA's restrictions apply to all injunctions, including preliminary injunctions — ones granted early in the case to prevent irreparable harm to the parties. The APA authorizes courts to issue similar temporary relief in the form of a stay. Courts generally apply the same standard to determine whether a temporary stay is warranted under the APA that they apply in evaluating the propriety of a preliminary injunction. That parity could suggest (as one court recently concluded) that CASA's limitations apply equally to APA stays. And yet there are strong arguments rooted in the APA's text, structure, and history that the law authorizes universal stays.

The APA remedy has another key limitation: It applies only to ""agency"" action. The Supreme Court has held that the president is not an agency. Many presidential policies must be implemented through agency actions, which are subject to challenge under the APA. But some presidential orders — like the birthright citizenship order — are self-executing and arguably not subject to APA review (although even this issue is unsettled). CASA's limits will be most consequential for these sorts of presidential actions with immediate, self-executing consequences.

2. Class Actions. CASA leaves intact broad injunctions protecting members of a properly certified class under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In CASA, Justice Kavanaugh's concurring opinion and Justice Sotomayor's dissenting opinion both highlighted this procedural pathway.

Litigants have already used Rule 23(b)(2) successfully in the birthright citizenship litigation, starting immediately after the Supreme Court's decision. A Maryland district court granted class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) and issued a nationwide injunction covering all children who would otherwise obtain citizenship. A New Hampshire district court followed a similar path.

These moves underscore how class actions may be increasingly important tools for challenging government action. But they also reflect limits on class remedies. Class actions must meet specific criteria, including commonality and typicality — basically, that the class members' circumstances are sufficiently alike for class-wide adjudication. In the Maryland case, the court certified a class for children but denied certification for parents in their individual capacities, finding their fears about their children's citizenship to be too individualized. For government actions imposing varied burdens across regulated entities, these hurdles may be difficult to overcome.

3. Organizations and States. Several of the plaintiffs in CASA were large membership organizations suing on behalf of many members. The Court did not question the ability of those organizations to secure injunctions covering their members, so long as the traditional requirements of ""associational standing"" are met. But there has been renewed interest — especially from Justice Thomas — in restricting the availability of organizational standing. The government, too, has contested broad injunctions for organizations post-CASA (although its efforts were recently rejected in the birthright citizenship context).

CASA also leaves unsettled the availability of injunctions for states as plaintiffs. Such injunctions could extend broadly if a state can credibly claim that a universal injunction is necessary to fully redress its injuries. Several plaintiffs in CASA were states, and the states claimed that, given cross-border flows of children and their parents, it would be impossible to fully redress their financial injuries and administrative burdens without injunctions extending beyond the state's borders. While the Court in CASA expressed some skepticism that this rationale could justify a universal injunction, it did not definitely resolve the question, and courts on remand upheld universal injunctions for the states on this theory.

4. CASA's ""Complete Relief"" Caveat. Finally, CASA acknowledged that universal injunctions may still be warranted when necessary to give plaintiffs complete relief. The Court cited examples — a nuisance injunction requiring a defendant to ""turn down her music"" or an order blocking a racially gerrymandered map — where full relief to one plaintiff inevitably benefits others. Plaintiffs who can analogize their situation to those examples may still obtain broad injunctions.

That said, the practical benefits of this ""complete relief"" carveout may be limited. The Court emphasized that even when such an injunction extends more broadly, ""only the plaintiff can enforce the judgment against the defendant."" Non-parties who are nominally protected by the injunction cannot necessarily protect their interests if the government does not abide.

Takeaways

CASA may not mark the end of universal relief, but it unquestionably changes the landscape for parties affected by government action. Affected organizations and individuals should consider several steps to ensure their interests are best protected:

Before CASA, affected parties generally could expect that any litigation challenging a new federal policy — if ultimately successful — would benefit them even if they were not plaintiffs. CASA complicates that calculus. By default, injunctions blocking federal action leave the government free to enforce that action against anyone who was not a plaintiff in the case — unless and until the party secures an injunction itself. Tracking litigation involving new government actions is more important than ever, including because after CASA joins that litigation (or files a new case), it may be necessary to protect the entity's interests.

Prepare for Patchwork Remedies. Compliance with federal regulation will inevitably be more complicated in a post-CASA world. As noted, courts have continued to read the APA as authorizing universal vacatur. But CASA may limit the preliminary relief awarded in any case to the specific parties challenging the policy. That can mean months, if not years, where the policy is enforceable as to some but not all parties, or in some but not all geographic areas.

Leverage Organizations and States. As noted, CASA did not foreclose broad injunctions protecting all members of an organization with standing to challenge a particular federal policy. Joining organizations that are ready and willing to challenge government action is likely to be an increasingly important strategy for entities subject to federal action. Relatedly, partnership or collaboration with states capable of challenging federal policy could be mutually beneficial.

Carefully Consider Causes of Action and Remedies. The APA's potential for universal vacatur makes the APA a more attractive procedural vehicle than ever before. Any challenge to a new presidential policy should consider the availability of agency defendants so as to unlock use of the APA, and should be careful to preserve all arguments that the APA authorizes regarding broad relief notwithstanding CASA.

Keep an Eye on Class Actions. In the wake of CASA, Rule 23(b)(2) class actions are likely to become a more popular vehicle for securing broad, uniform relief against federal policies. If that trend continues, individuals and organizations affected by a government action could benefit from class litigation — or may find themselves swept into certified classes, even if they have not personally chosen to litigate. Potential class members should pay attention to new filings in their area of interest and consider whether to participate or coordinate with class counsel to protect their specific interests. For clients who might otherwise have relied on a nationwide injunction to safeguard their rights, proactive engagement with class litigation may be an essential part of any effective strategy.

The Supreme Court last Tuesday blocked the Trump administration’s plans to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois due to the heightened objections of local officials. “This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration’s consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump’s march toward authoritarianism,” said Governor JB Pritzker, in a statement on Tuesday. The court in an unsigned order rejected an emergency request made by the administration, which stated the National Guard were needed to protect federal agents involved in immigration enforcement in the Chicago area. The court order said that Trump could only call up the military where they could “legally execute the laws” and that power is limited under another law called the Posse Comitatus Act. Local officials shared their thoughts regarding the Supreme Court’s decision to media this week.

“Our members and families in Chicago and across Illinois have spent far too long living under the weight of a federal militarized presence that’s done little to address the real issues in our neighborhoods or the chronic underinvestment in our public schools. Instead of working with communities to tackle the root causes of injustice, this presidential administration has focused on division, using our nation’s military — including young people who were once public school students themselves — to do its dirty work.” –Chicago Teachers Union

“This ruling is a critical blow to an administration that has repeatedly violated the law to target our most vulnerable. This was more than an overstep; using the military to carry out a campaign of intimidation against our own people was a terrifying and blatant abuse of power. We need to continue standing together to protect the dignity and safety of our communities and ensure that no family in Chicago has to live under the threat of being torn apart by an aggressive, unchecked deportation machine.” –Independent Candidate for Illinois 4th Congressional District Mayra Macías

“We welcome the Supreme Court’s ruling to block the deployment of National Guard personnel to the streets of Chicago, rebuking President Trump’s attempts to militarize and demonize our city. I’ve maintained that these threats are unconstitutional from the very beginning. I am encouraged that the Supreme Court shares this view.” –Mayor Brandon Johnson",,N,,2026-01-02 12:57:03.124449

A recent amendment expressly codifies disparate impact liability under the New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) for employment discrimination claims. This comes as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has backed away from disparate impact theories in enforcing federal employment discrimination statutes.

The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in personnel processes and decision-making has the potential to raise disparate impact issues to the extent that AI processes have varying effects on specific groups.

New York employers may face increased potential exposure from neutral employment practices, underscoring the importance of proactive review and documentation.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed Senate Bill S8338 on Dec. 19, 2025, which codifies that a facially neutral employment practice may violate the New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) based on its discriminatory effects, even absent discriminatory intent. While the amendment largely clarifies existing law, it comes at a time when federal enforcement of disparate impact theories has become less certain as the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has taken a more restrained approach to pursuing disparate impact claims under federal employment discrimination statutes. Against that backdrop, the amendment underscores the continuing importance of state-law compliance and employer attention to outcome-based employment practices, as well as the purportedly neutral decisions of their AI tools.

What the Amendment Does

The legislation adds a new subdivision to New York's Executive Law § 296, providing that, in NYSHRL employment discrimination cases, an unlawful discriminatory practice may be established where an employer uses a policy or practice that actually or predictably results in a disparate impact based on a protected characteristic.

The statute makes clear that proof of discriminatory motive is not required. After the employee demonstrates that a particular employment practice causes, or predictably will cause, a disparate impact on a protected class, the employer then bears the burden to establish that the practice is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity. Even if that showing is made, an employee may still prevail by showing the employer's business necessity could be satisfied by a less discriminatory alternative.

The statute also requires that an employer's justification be supported by evidence and not based on hypothetical or speculative considerations, reinforcing the need for objective validation and documentation of employment criteria.

Although disparate impact liability is not a new concept, the amendment injects ambiguity into the analysis by prohibiting policies and practices that ""actually or predictably"" yield disparate results. This raises the specter of challenges to practices that do not ""actually"" cause a disparate impact but can be argued to ""predictably"" do so. Given the litigation climate in New York, this additional language creates another reason for employers to be intentional in assessing the effect, or event ""predicted"" effect,of personnel practices and policies.

Why This Matters Now, Especially as AI Gains Ground in Employment Practices

By codifying disparate impact liability, New York has increased scrutiny of ostensibly neutral employment practices — such as hiring criteria, screening tools, promotion standards and compensation structures — that may produce statistically significant disparities.

AI tools are often adopted to promote efficiency and consistency and typically would not be viewed as intentionally discriminatory. However, these tools present disparate impact risks to the extent that the data inputs, models or selection criteria underlying those tools have varying effects on specific groups. For example, even in the relatively early phases of AI's adoption, there have been claims in litigation that an employer's use of AI training datasets disproportionately composed of one protected group (for example, males) results in an adverse disparate impact to members of other groups (for example, females).

The beefed-up disparate impact liability under NYSHRL, combined with New York City's 2023 regulations on AI use in personnel processes, guide in favor of an intentional approach by employers in using these tools for employment decisions.

Looking Ahead

This amendment applies to employment discrimination occurring on or after its effective date of Dec. 19, 2025, making proactive compliance efforts particularly important. Employers should consider reviewing key employment practices to assess disparate impact risk, ensure that job-related criteria are well supported, and evaluate whether alternative approaches could achieve business objectives with less discriminatory effect.

When Jeremy Corbyn raised the hunger strike in Parliament, some MPs laughed.
In 1981, during the Irish hunger strike, men were dying in prison cells while politicians dismissed them as criminals, attention-seekers, terrorists.
In Guantanamo, hunger strike was met with force.
I am joining this hunger strike in solidarity.","I know this road. I have its map etched into my bones. I carry scars that won’t heal without justice, without accountability.

I learned it in Guantanamo, when the only thing I could control was my own body.

We were disappeared. Isolated. Forced into silence. Our words were redacted. Our letters were stamped secret. Lawyers were blocked. Time stretched and rotted. No court dates were given. No real charges were made.

I was reduced to a number in an orange uniform, locked in a metal cage. The US government had already named me. “The worst of the worst.” “Terrorist.” “Enemy combatant.” Labels designed to make torture sound necessary.

And torture came. Day and night. Relentless. Mechanical. Meant to break the mind first, then the body. So I stopped eating. Not as a gesture. Not as a plea. I stopped because everything else had been taken from me. My body was the only territory this foreign state hadn’t yet occupied.

A hunger strike is not symbolic. It is not dramatic. That’s a lie sold by the media, by people who have never watched a body collapse from the inside, who turn slow death into headlines and panels and clean sentences.

A hunger strike is a slow, painful journey towards death. It dismantles you piece by piece. Muscles shrink. Vision fades. The heart falters. Organs begin to fail. Every beat is a warning. Every hour drags you closer to death, whether you want it or not.

A hunger strike begins when every other door is slammed shut. When the system makes it clear your life has no value, as long as you stay quiet and obedient. When it looks straight at you and tells you you’re already dead.

So you answer with your body.

At least eight imprisoned pro-Palestine activists in the UK have refused food. One has been on hunger strike for more than two months. Others have passed 50 days without eating. Some have already been taken to hospital. They are scattered across prisons, cut off from each other, torn from their families, buried under the word “terrorist” so cruelty can be dressed up as law.

They are Heba Muraisi, Qesser Zurah, Amu Gib, Teuta Hoxha, Kamran Ahmed, Lewie Chiaramello, Jon Cink, and Umer Khalid.

United Nations human rights experts have expressed grave concern for hunger strikers’ lives. They warned the activists face heightened risks of organ failure, neurological damage, and death without proper medical care and called on the UK government to ensure timely emergency care, to engage with the activists’ demands and to address rights issues linked to prolonged pretrial detention and restrictions on protest activity.

I have been inside this story before. Violent words are meant to strip you of your humanity so the public doesn’t have to feel the sting of your suffering.

When Jeremy Corbyn raised the hunger strike in Parliament, some MPs laughed. Laughed. Not whispers. Not quiet discomfort. But open mockery. Smirks from padded seats while people’s bodies were breaking down in cells. While people were collapsing, being dragged to hospital wards, organs failing. This is untouchable power.

David Lammy, the deputy prime minister, has dodged meeting the families of the hunger strikers. He has avoided even the barest human gesture of listening. Cowardice wrapped in protocol. This is deliberate contempt.

In 1981, during the Irish hunger strike, men were dying in prison cells while politicians dismissed them as criminals, attention-seekers, terrorists. The mockery came first. The jokes. The coldness. The refusal to engage. Then came the funerals. Power always laughs before it kills. Humour becomes a shield for cowardice.

Nothing has changed. The accents are different. The suits are better tailored. The cruelty is the same.

This is not democracy. This is rot at the centre of the state.

We were held for years in Guantanamo without charges, without evidence, without a path to release. In the UK today, people are kept on extended remand, sometimes for years, while trial dates are pushed further away. Time itself becomes the punishment. Time becomes a weapon. A weapon against prisoners and their families.

Isolation comes next.

In Guantanamo, isolation was designed to break us. Months, sometimes years, without meaningful human contact. Silence so heavy it pressed against your skull. A silence meant to erase you. In UK prisons, hunger strikers are separated. Transferred. Harassed. Stripped of routine, stripped of connection. Isolation is framed as safety. It is not. It is punishment. It is control.

Then comes censorship. Letters delayed. Phone calls cut short. Visits restricted. Information filtered. Families left in the dark. Lawyers forced to fight for the barest access. At Guantanamo, every word leaving the camp was monitored. In the UK, the same instinct survives. Control the narrative. Control the person.

Then comes medical coercion. In Guantanamo, hunger strike was met with force. Shackles. Restraint chairs. Tubes forced through noses into stomachs while guards pinned our limbs. They called it medical care. It was violence. Pure, deliberate, crushing violence designed to make resistance unbearable.

The UK likes to pretend Guantanamo was an American mistake. Something distant. Something finished. It was not. It was a laboratory. The experiments were exported. Absorbed. Normalised. And now, they are applied inside their prisons.

You see it in the extended remand.

You see it in the proscription laws twisted to criminalise protest.

You see it in prisons used as warehouses, places to store people indefinitely while the state takes its time building a case.

And you see it in the quiet cooperation between systems. Guantanamo fed the black sites. Black sites fed domestic counterterror policing. The same logic shows up again and again. In places like Alligator Alcatraz in Florida. In British prisons holding political activists under terrorism laws. Different flags. Same playbook.

Abuse travels faster than accountability.

I have watched governments study each other. Share techniques. Refine the language. Learn how to cage people legally. How to stretch the law without snapping it. How to crush dissent while calling it order.

This is not about agreeing with the politics of the prisoners. This is about whether a state is allowed to disappear people before trial, isolate them, censor them, then punish them for refusing to cooperate with their own erasure. If the UK wants to claim it is nothing like Guantanamo, then it has to prove it with action.

End prolonged remand without trial.

End isolation as a response to protest.

Restore full access to lawyers and families.

Provide medical care that protects life, not policies that quietly endanger it.

Listen to the hunger strikers. Meet their families face to face.

Abolish the terror laws used to criminalise dissent, stretch guilt by association, and disappear people behind language instead of evidence.

Force members of parliament to step out of silence and take responsibility.

These are not radical demands. They are the bare minimum. The floor, not the ceiling, for any society that claims to respect human rights.

I am not writing this as an observer. I am writing as someone who has already lived the ending. I am telling you plainly, without euphemism and without distance. Systems like this do not correct themselves. They do not slow down out of shame. They only stop when they are confronted, directly and without fear. Now.

I refuse to be silent. I am joining this hunger strike in solidarity. I do this because I recognise the system at work. I do this because I know Guantanamo did not end, it spread. It embedded itself in other prisons, other laws, other governments that tell themselves they are better. I do this because standing with the oppressed against the oppressor is not symbolic for me. It is a responsibility earned through survival. I do this because I am able to, and because doing nothing would make me complicit.

This hunger strike is not about food. It is about dignity. It is about justice. It is about remand used as punishment, silence used as policy, and a state that believes if it waits long enough, people will break and disappear. It believes silence will protect it, shield it, absolve it. It will not.

I stand with the hunger strikers. I will not look away. I will not soften this. I will not be polite about slow death carried out in clean buildings and legal language.

And I will not let them be erased. Free the hungers strikers!",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/photo_2025-12-21_13-29-29-1767194884.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2026-01-02 07:56:47.121665

Some pending cases, such as a challenge to immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles region, have led to emergency docket orders from the US Supreme Court, the authority of which will be a major point of litigation in the coming months. At stake are hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds and the state’s ability to steer policy in key areas including education, health, and infrastructure.

By August, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that early federal court orders had restored $168 billion in federal funding to California, a payoff after a February state funding package pumped $25 million into Bonta’s office for legal fights with Trump.

Now, the cases are maturing in California courts and some Golden State victories could be threatened when they reach the conservative high court. Still, while the Supreme Court has frequently sided with the Trump administration, it’s difficult to evaluate the justices’ response to legal fights involving California in one sweep, UCLA Law Professor Joseph Fishkin said. The degree of its alignment varies by topic, with the court indicating significant support for the dismantling of independent agencies, but drawing a line against the administration’s unauthorized National Guard deployments, Fishkin said.

“There’s a lot of battles that are highly politically salient, and also there’s litigation about the topic,” Fishkin said. “In general over the past year you’ve seen—not just in California but around the country—you’ve seen a lot of district courts and even appellate courts issue rulings that are pretty much normal law, what you would expect, and then you’ve seen the Supreme Court take some positions that are more unusually favorable to the Trump administration. That’s the broad pattern.”

Trump v. California

Several cases brought by the Trump administration in response to laws passed by California are set for hearings in the first part of this year.

US District Judge Christina Snyder on Jan. 12 will hear a motion for a preliminary injunction in the legal challenge over the No Secret Police Act (SB 627) and No Vigilantes Act (SB 805), passed in response to reports of masked, unidentifiable federal law enforcement agents.

Federal agents would be prohibited from wearing masks and required to identify themselves by displaying their agency and name or badge number under the laws. The Trump administration, alleging violations of the Supremacy Clause, said in a November complaint the laws “would recklessly endanger the lives of federal agents and their family members and compromise the operational effectiveness of federal law enforcement activities.”

The laws were set to take effect Jan. 1, but California agreed not to enforce them until Snyder rules on the preliminary injunction request. Docket

A July lawsuit alleged California’s laws banning tight cage confinement for egg-laying hens are driving up consumer prices nationwide. It argues the federal Egg Products Inspection Act preempts state laws governing the treatment of hens and egg quality.

California said in court filings the first Trump administration previously agreed that the federal law doesn’t supersede the state’s cage-free law.

US District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles will hear California’s motion to dismiss Jan. 12, and a summary judgment hearing is scheduled for Feb. 23. Docket

Challenges to Administration Actions

Additionally, lawsuits brought by California-based litigants have action coming in early 2026.

The judge who issued one of the first major orders restricting the Trump administration’s 2025 federal immigration raids will hear on Feb. 5 contrasting motions to dismiss the case and to enforce her preliminary injunction.

US District Judge Jennifer Thurston in April ordered US Customs and Border Protection agents to stop arresting people in California’s Central Valley without reasonable suspicion. Detainees had accused agents of widespread racial profiling in a case with facts echoing Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, which is pending in LA federal court. US Supreme Court justices in an interim stay order lifted the LA district court’s injunction and allowed enforcement efforts to resume uninhibited.

The Trump administration argues the plaintiffs lack standing, based on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s concurrence attached to the September order. The plaintiffs say the emergency docket order isn’t binding. They also allege federal agents have violated the preliminary injunction and are asking for an order to require further training and documentation. Docket

In San Francisco, a Ninth Circuit panel will hear arguments in a challenge to the use of Trump administration executive orders on gender identity and diversity initiatives to block funds for a set of nonprofits supporting LGBTQ+ clients.

The nonprofits brought the case in San Francisco federal court after the federal government yanked their awards, saying it wouldn’t fund programs that were “equity related” or promoted “gender ideology.” US District Judge Jon Tigar in June granted a preliminary injunction, ordering the administration to reinstate terminated awards.

Arguments are scheduled before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Feb. 10. Docket

Awaiting Rulings

California’s new congressional map drawn in response to Texas redistricting to add up to five Democratic state representatives will get a ruling from a federal panel shortly on whether it can be used for the 2026 midterms.

The Archdiocese of Louisville issued a statement Jan. 1, signed by Archbishop Shelton J. Fabre and other Kentucky bishops, expressing their increasing concern over the treatment of immigrants.

While countries have a responsibility to control their border, the statement reads, laws ""must be enforced in a just and predictable manner that respects the God-given dignity of each human person.""

Their concerns, the statement continues, are rooted in ""reports of immigrants with legal status having that status arbitrarily revoked; increasing incidents of political leaders vilifying immigrants; the elimination of sanctuary protections for churches, hospitals, and schools; and proposals at the state level targeting the ability of immigrants to live and pursue their dreams in Kentucky...""

These combined realities, according to the leaders, have created a ""climate of hostility, anxiety and fear,"" and they oppose efforts to ""stigmatize immigrants as a group or to spread fear based on national or ethnic origin.""

""We stand with all of our immigrant brothers and sisters who have been victimized by unjust government action or by harmful rhetoric and vilification,"" the statement continues. ""We call on all of our political leaders to work to reform our broken immigration system in a way that allows for the peaceful and orderly migration of people who are searching for peace, stability, religious freedom, and economic opportunity, as well as one that respects family unification and a realistic possibility of potentially obtaining citizenship.""

The statement comes as President Donald Trump's administration prepares for more aggressive immigration enforcement in 2026, thanks to a massive surge in new funding. ICE and Border Patrol will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029. The agencies' existing annual budgets are about $19 billion.

With the increase in funding, officials have said they plan to hire thousands more agents and open new detention centers while picking up more immigrants in local jails for deportation and partnering with outside groups to track down more people without legal status.

Changes to immigration enforcement are also negatively impacting Kentucky Catholic churches with foreign-born priests.

Bishop William Medley of Owensboro, who signed the Jan. 1 statement, told The Courier Journal in November 2025 that nearly four of 10 priests within his diocese — which covers the majority of western Kentucky — are foreign-born, including some who rely on protected immigration statuses or religious worker visas in order to stay in the country.

,Agencies,2026-01-02 04:51:04+00:00,CNN,Exclusive: DHS begins slashing FEMA disaster response staff as 2026 begins | CNN Politics,Gabe Cohen,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/01/politics/dhs-cutting-fema-disaster-response-staff,"“FEMA can’t do disaster response and recovery without CORE employees,” a former senior FEMA official told CNN.
“The regional offices are almost entirely CORE staff, so the first FEMA people who are usually onsite won’t be there.
CORE employees make up about 40% of FEMA’s workforce — over 8,000 people — working full-time hours on temporary contracts.
Now, DHS is instructing FEMA to let at least some of those contracts lapse, forcing employees to depart as their terms expire.
Thousands of FEMA’s staff of about 25,000 left in 2025 due to layoffs and buyouts, deepening the shortage.","The Trump administration is abruptly cutting dozens of staff who are at the forefront of disaster response and recovery at the Federal Emergency Management Agency this week, according to internal emails obtained by CNN and sources familiar with the plan.

On New Year’s Eve, some employees received emails saying their positions “would not be renewed” and “therefore, your services will no longer be needed” after their contracts expire in the first days of January.

The cuts target FEMA’s Cadre of On-Call Response and Recovery (CORE) teams, which form the backbone of the agency’s operations during and after a disaster, and could be just the beginning of a larger effort by Secretary Kristi Noem and the Department of Homeland Security to shrink FEMA, potentially axing thousands of workers in the coming months who deploy during hurricanes, wildfires and other national emergencies.

According to two sources with knowledge of the terminations, which suddenly ousted roughly 50 CORE staff, the decision came from FEMA’s new acting chief Karen Evans — who was elevated to the role by DHS leadership after the embattled previous agency head resigned.

The notices stunned employees, who learned they would be let go within days. “Beyond cruel to be treated in such a way,” one of the workers said.

FEMA’s CORE employees are among the first federal boots on the ground during a disaster, working shoulder-to-shoulder with local officials, helping survivors and managing the crucial aid and grants that fuel recovery and rebuilding.

“FEMA can’t do disaster response and recovery without CORE employees,” a former senior FEMA official told CNN. “The regional offices are almost entirely CORE staff, so the first FEMA people who are usually onsite won’t be there. The impact is states are on their own.”

So far, DHS, which oversees FEMA, hasn’t given the agency much guidance about what comes next, leaving employees anxious about more cuts.

A DHS spokesperson denied that the department has implemented any new policy for these workers and did not address questions about this week’s abrupt terminations or the department’s broader plans to downsize the agency.

“The CORE program consists of term-limited positions that are designed to fluctuate based on disaster activity, operational need, and available funding,” the spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “CORE appointments have always been subject to end-of-term decisions consistent with that structure and there has been no change to policy.”

Several sources told CNN that DHS has been considering letting more contracts expire as part of a push to downsize the agency, though officials have wavered on how deep the cuts will go.

CORE employees make up about 40% of FEMA’s workforce — over 8,000 people — working full-time hours on temporary contracts. Several thousand of these workers will see their contracts end in 2026.

Traditionally, CORE workers have served on two-to-four-year contracts that were almost always renewed. In 2025, DHS limited FEMA to renewing these contracts for just 180 days at a time while they considered a long-term plan to shrink the agency.

As of January 1, DHS revoked FEMA’s authority to renew those employees without approval from Homeland Security officials, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.

Now, DHS is instructing FEMA to let at least some of those contracts lapse, forcing employees to depart as their terms expire.

Under President Donald Trump’s second administration, DHS has argued for the past year that FEMA is bloated, despite a 2023 Government Accountability Office report that found the agency was facing a staffing shortfall of more than 6,000 employees—about 35% below its target level. Thousands of FEMA’s staff of about 25,000 left in 2025 due to layoffs and buyouts, deepening the shortage.

The latest cuts to CORE are part of a broader Trump administration effort to overhaul FEMA, shrink its footprint and shift more responsibility for disaster response to the states. A task force appointed by the administration – known as the FEMA Review Council – is expected to soon release sweeping recommendations, including a proposal to cut the agency’s workforce in half.

But after CNN exclusively obtained a draft of the recommendations this month, the White House abruptly postponed the task force’s final meeting, leaving FEMA’s future in limbo.

Inside FEMA and across the country, officials are sounding the alarm about the administration’s plan, warning that most states simply aren’t equipped to handle major disasters on their own.

Billions in federal funding for communities nationwide remain stuck in FEMA’s backlog, largely because of bureaucratic hurdles imposed by Trump’s DHS. With the future of federal funding up in the air, some states are already tightening their own budgets and laying off local emergency management staff whose departments rely on money from FEMA to brace for the impact.

The FEMA Review Council is expected to recommend moving some agency staff out of Washington, DC, and into other parts of the country — a move that could help fill some gaps if the CORE workforce is slashed.

Still, it likely means fewer federal boots on the ground when disaster strikes, leaving states with more responsibility for supporting survivors and navigating access to the federal resources that are still available — a bureaucratic process the Trump administration has vowed to improve.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-08-16t031720z-1105141236-rc2xm2a4kxy9-rtrmadp-3-hawaii-wildfires-20260102025249119.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-02 00:57:33.116733

This applies to both immigrants and nonimmigrants, according to the CBO document dated Dec. 29.

The White House says the restrictions are for national security and public safety reasons, while immigrant advocates say the ban targets African and Muslim countries.

The travel ban continues restrictions on those from Afghanistan; Burma (Myanmar); Chad; Republic of the Congo; Equatorial Guinea; Eritrea; Haiti; Iran; Libya; Somalia; Sudan; Yemen from entering into the United States.

There are also partial travel restrictions on people from Venezuela and Cuba, according to the document.

It comes amid new restrictions on H1-B visas taking effect earlier this week.

SEE ALSO: Why the US is targeting the diversity visa lottery and what it means for applicants

The H-1B visa program allows employers to hire noncitizens that have a specialized skill or trade and was previously done somewhat randomly.

The changes the administration made, which went into effect on Monday, allow for a weighted system to prioritize individuals that would make a higher wage.

""The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,"" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser.

""The new weighted selection will better serve Congress' intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America's competitiveness by incentivizing American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers,"" Tragesser said. ""With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers.""

Rosanna Beradi, an immigration attorney, said the change will limit those who qualify.

""The change will severely limit the number of applicants who qualify under the H-1B program,"" she told ABC News. ""It will make it even harder for international students to remain in the U.S. after graduation, which will exacerbate the brain drain. The new rule effectively eliminates the lottery system and prioritizes high wage earners.""

According to the data, federal immigration authorities made 660 arrests in Oregon in the first 10 months of 2025.

The data set ends in mid-October but according to U.S. Border Patrol Chief Michael Banks, at least another 560 people were arrested in October in Portland alone.

Let us hope we will see more — a lot more — of that same success in this new year.","Listening to the usual legacy media suspects, one might think 2025 was an apocalyptic wasteland of sorts — an authoritarian fever dream brought on by the return of Donald J. Trump to the Oval Office. The reality looked very different. This past year was, in many ways, a pretty great and clarifying one. Let’s take stock of what happened when our government remembered whom it serves, as well as what unfinished business remains as we flip the calendar.

First, the obvious: Political sanity was restored to the nation’s capital. After years of leftist elite-driven chaos — wide-open borders, hyper-vindictive lawfare, fecklessness on the world stage and more — the nation has begun to revert back to first principles: national sovereignty, law and order, and strong leadership abroad. Under Trump, the United States has once again acted like a real nation-state that pursues its real interests — not a nongovernmental organization with a nagging guilt complex.

That reorientation has paid huge dividends. On immigration, the Biden-era invasion at the southern border has tapered by more than 90%. On energy, a renewed embrace of domestic production has led to the lowest average national gas prices in nearly five years. Violent crime, thanks to Trump’s law enforcement operations and innovative use of the National Guard, has dramatically fallen: Murders decreased by nearly 20% from 2024, and robbery and burglary also saw double-digit percentage decreases. Abroad, allies and adversaries alike recalibrated to the reality that the White House once again means what it says.

Still, work always remains. Here, then, is my 2026 wish list.

Peace in Eastern Europe

The Russia-Ukraine war has gone on far, far too long. The Trump administration has exerted tremendous diplomatic effort trying to orchestrate a peace deal, which remains elusive. A durable peace — one that halts the senseless slaughter on both sides, respects Ukrainian sovereignty and accommodates legitimate Russian concerns, and avoids a wider great-power conflagration — should be a paramount Trump administration foreign policy goal in 2026. Russia is the invader and Vladimir Putin is the greater obstacle to a lasting peace, but both sides need to make painful — if, frustratingly, also painfully obvious — concessions.

Victory on birthright citizenship

Back home, a consequential legal battle now sits before the U.S. Supreme Court: the Trump administration’s righteous challenge to the erroneous practice of constitutionally “required” birthright citizenship for the U.S.-born children of noncitizens. The notion that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, was meant to constitutionalize a global human trafficking magnet — granting automatic citizenship to all children born here, including those whose parents entered the country illegally — is indefensible as a matter of plain constitutional text, the congressional history in the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and basic common sense. Indeed, birthright citizenship has been nothing short of ruinous for the United States. A Trump administration victory would restore Congress’s rightful authority over circumscribing citizenship and remove a longstanding incentive for illegal immigration.

Improved affordability and housing costs

Legal victories mean relatively little if ordinary Americans continue to feel like they are getting squeezed. Improved affordability must be front and center in 2026 — from the federal level down to states and localities. The cost of living is not an economic abstraction; it affects rent, groceries, child care and the difficulty of buying a first home. Housing, in particular, demands attention. Housing policy should reward supply, not suffocate it — cutting red tape and burdensome construction fees, reforming zoning incentives, and curtailing the inflationary spending that puts upward pressure on mortgage rates. A nation where young families cannot afford to put down roots is a nation courting decline — the very antithesis of Trumpian restoration.

Justice for Minnesota fraud scandal

The burgeoning fraud scandal over state and federal funds for child care in Minnesota, including at businesses run by Somali Americans — astonishing in scale — has become a test case for whether the rule of law still applies when politics get uncomfortable. Justice means following the facts wherever they lead: recovering stolen taxpayer dollars and holding wrongdoers and abettors legally accountable without fear or favor. To wit, on the subject of abettors: What did Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), Atty. Gen. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and other prominent Minnesota politicians know, and when did they know it? Moreover, what did Kamala Harris — who picked Walz as her 2024 presidential running mate — know, and when did she know it? The Biden administration and the Walz administration began investigating these fraud allegations years ago, and the American people deserve answers to all these questions.

Tamed Communist China

Finally, no wish list can be complete without confronting the central geopolitical challenge of our age: that of Communist China. Simply put, Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party, who just presided over their largest live-fire military exercises around Taiwan, must be meaningfully deterred in the Indo-Pacific. That means maintaining a combative tariff posture, implementing as much economic decoupling as is feasible and emboldening key regional allies — such as Japan — who share America’s interest in freedom of maritime navigation and diminished Chinese hegemony. Decades from now, Trump’s presidential legacy will be partially defined by how he handled the China challenge. Now is not the time to take the foot off the gas pedal.

This past year showed what is possible when Washington rejects the politics of managed decline and reembraces the best of the American tradition and way of life. Let us hope we will see more — a lot more — of that same success in this new year.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b695c3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3893x2044+0+276/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F99%2F8c165a2019cf764bc784a12306e8%2F281d61c31b0d477aae3d342351438fdb,N,,2026-01-01 21:12:06.827504

Numerous immigration policy changes were rolled out in 2025, impacting the way people travel, obtain visas and become citizens in the United States.

Here are five of the biggest changes taking effect:

Trump administration launches H-1B visa overhaul

The Trump administration unveiled a proposal in September to change how H-1B visas are awarded, a program that has become a cornerstone of the tech industry by allowing U.S. companies to hire highly skilled workers from abroad, including software engineers and data scientists.

Issued by the Department of Homeland Security, H-1B visas are temporary work permits that have become a vital pathway for U.S. tech companies to recruit global talent.

The proposal was designed to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.

DHS said the changes will go into effect in February and are meant to ""better protect the wages, working conditions, and job opportunities for American workers.

""The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by U.S. employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesman Matthew Tragesser said in a statement.

Expanded facial recognition for non-citizens looking to enter and exit the US

The Department of Homeland Security implemented a new rule on Dec. 26, 2025, that expands facial recognition for non-citizens who are entering and leaving the United States.

The DHS said on its website that the rule ""amends existing DHS regulations to authorize U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an operational component within DHS, to collect facial biometrics from all noncitizens upon entry and exit at airports, land ports, seaports, and other authorized points of departure.""

The rule applies to green card holders and other non-U.S. citizens living legally in the country.

""Although U.S. citizens are not covered by this rule, they may continue to voluntarily participate in the facial biometrics process at entry and exit,"" the DHS added.

Homeland Security moves toward scrutinizing foreign tourists' social media accounts before entry

The Department of Homeland Security is moving toward scrutinizing the recent social media histories of foreign travelers before allowing them to enter the United States.

In a notice filed in December in the Federal Register, U.S. Customs and Border Protection wrote, ""In order to comply with the January 2025 Executive Order 14161 (Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats), CBP is adding social media as a mandatory data element for an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) application.""

""The data element will require ESTA applicants to provide their social media from the last 5 years,"" it added.

Homeland Security describes ESTA as ""an automated system used to determine the eligibility of visitors to travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program and whether such travel poses any law enforcement or security risk.""

Trump launches $1M Gold Card for US residency status

Trump in December announced the launch of the much-anticipated ""Trump Gold Card,"" an immigration initiative designed to provide a new, streamlined path to U.S. citizenship.

The card, which has a starting price of $1 million, features a portrait of the president, the Statue of Liberty and the American flag underneath a gold background, with ""Trump Gold Card"" stamped on the left side.

""We anticipate THE TRUMP GOLD CARD will generate well over $100 Billion Dollars very quickly,"" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. ""This money will be used for reducing Taxes, Pro Growth Projects, and paying down our Debt.""

Interested parties can apply for the ""exclusive privileges"" on the official website, trumpcard.gov. According to the site, applicants will submit their documents and pay a nonrefundable processing fee, triggering an accelerated probe by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Once an applicant is approved, a Trump Gold Card will be available for use throughout all 50 states and territories. They will be given lawful permanent resident status as an EB-1 or EB-2 visa holder.

Revamped US citizenship test adds questions, goes into effect

A new version of the U.S. citizenship test is requiring applicants to answer twice as many questions as the old one.

""The 2025 naturalization civics test is an oral test consisting of 20 questions from the list of 128 civics test questions. You must answer 12 questions correctly [60%] to pass the 2025 test. You will fail the test if you answer 9 of the 20 questions incorrectly,"" U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said on its website.

The new test foregoes geographical questions and test-takers will be required to name all three branches of government instead of just one.

Our most-read stories of this year informed readers about the myriad impacts of the Trump administration’s policies on Arizonans — especially Indigenous people and immigrant communities — political drama in the legislature and state government and the efforts of Arizona’s Democratic congressional representatives to push back against the Trump administration and U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Below are the top-10 most-read stories on azmirror.com in 2025.

10. No court, no hearing: Trump revives fast-track deportations, expands reach nationwide

President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts have been major news all year. In January, the Trump administration greenlighted fast-tracked deportation proceedings for immigrants living anywhere in the United States who couldn’t prove more than two years of continuous presence in the country. Known as expedited removal, people detained under the policy were not entitled to a court hearing, but were subject to immediate expulsion from the country.

“This is a huge expansion that really sets up the groundwork for raids, rapid removal and racial profiling,” said Laura Belous, an attorney with the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project.

In Arizona, people without legal status who have lived in the country for fewer than 10 years are in the minority. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that around 273,000 immigrants who lack any kind of legal authorization call the Grand Canyon State home, and 72% of them have lived in the country for at least a decade.

9. Turning Point leader, former GOP Rep pleads guilty to attempted election fraud

Republican former state lawmaker Austin Smith pleaded guilty in November to charges stemming from his personal forgery of more than 100 voter signatures on petitions to make it onto the 2024 ballot for reelection.

When he was first accused of forging the signatures in April 2024, Smith was a leader of Turning Point USA’s advocacy arm, Turning Point Action, and was a member of the far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus. Smith, who had previously spread unfounded claims of fraud perpetrated by Democrats during the 2020 election, called the allegations ludicrous.

But he quickly dropped his reelection bid and his job at Turning Point. In June 2025, after he’d resumed his job at Turning Point Action, a grand jury indicted Smith on 14 counts of fraud and forgery.

In November, Smith entered into a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to one count of attempted fraudulent schemes and practices and to one count of illegal signing of an election petition.

He’s scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 6.

8. Johnson sets record refusing to swear in Adelita Grijalva for 36 days after she won election

U.S. Rep. Adelita Grijalva unwillingly set a record when she hit day 36 of her wait to be sworn in to represent the state’s 7th Congressional District.

Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives refused to swear in Grijalva, using a range of excuses, the most frequent of which was the federal government shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 – Nov. 12.

The Tucson Democrat was finally sworn in 50 days after she easily won a Sept. 23 special election in the deep blue southern Arizona district formerly represented by her father Raúl Grijalva. The elder Grijalva died of cancer in March.

7. Two top Arizona health officials resign amid ‘unprecedented politicization’ of process

Two of Arizona’s top public health officials resigned rather than face an acrimonious confirmation process at the legislature, where Republicans used agency director hearings to play hardball politics with Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and stymie her government.

In April, Hobbs announced that Jennie Cunico, the director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, and Carmen Heredia, who headed Arizona’s Health Care Cost Containment System, the state’s Medicaid program, had stepped down from their positions. Heredia had been scheduled to go before the state Senate’s Committee on Director Nominations days before she resigned.

In her announcement, Hobbs blamed the Republican majority for co-opting the confirmation process to attack her nominations on political grounds.

Under Arizona law, the governor’s agency picks are required to be vetted and approved or rejected by the state Senate. The process has historically been uneventful, with candidates facing interviews from lawmakers on committees relevant to the agencies they’ve been chosen for, but Hobbs’ election prompted Republicans to set up an entirely new committee to vet her choices. And that has resulted in aggressive, hourslong interrogations that more closely resemble federal confirmation hearings.

6. Gallego and Kelly demand answers over planned closure of Phoenix BIA office

Arizona U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego in March expressed their concern to the General Services Administration about President Donald Trump’s plan to close the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Phoenix, and urged reconsideration.

The BIA office in Phoenix is located on Central Avenue south of Thomas Road. It serves 53 tribes in the western region, including 20 from Arizona. The office’s planned lease termination date was Aug. 31, but it was still open as of Dec. 31.

As of Dec. 11, just 30% of the General Services Administration’s planned lease terminations for the year had been finalized.

5. Political chaos erupts as Arizona Senate passes budget and ends session unilaterally

The Arizona state budgeting process in 2025 was particularly grueling and contentious.

Republicans in the Arizona House of Representatives held up progress on the budget, the only task constitutionally required of the legislature, for weeks after they left negotiations with the Senate and Gov. Katie Hobbs.

Passing a state budget in Arizona requires approval from the Republican-led House and Senate, as well as from Hobbs, a Democrat.

In an effort to force House Republicans to compromise after a tentative agreement fell apart, Republicans in the Arizona Senate voted to end the chamber’s work for the legislative session at around 2 a.m. on June 20, after passing its budget bills in a marathon of amendments and votes.

The move angered House Republican leaders, but Republican Senate President Warren Petersen said it was necessary because House Republicans refused to work collaboratively on a budget.

Most of the opposition in both chambers came from members of the far-right Arizona Freedom Caucus, who did their best to drag out the budgeting process with fruitless amendments and procedural holdups, angry that the rest of the legislature didn’t acquiesce to their budget demands.

The Senate’s move was successful in forcing the House back to the negotiating table, and Hobbs finally signed a bipartisan $17.6 billion budget on June 27, three days before the June 30 deadline to avoid a state government shutdown.

4. Tribal flags removed from Phoenix VA hospital under new federal policy

When the flags of Arizona’s 22 tribal nations were removed from the Carl. T. Hayden VA Medical Center in central Phoenix on March 18, the Salt River-Pima Maricopa Indian Community pushed back.

“I was surprised and appalled when the staff of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs hospital dropped off all 22 Arizona Tribal Nation flags at our office, explaining that they could no longer display them,” Ricardo Leonard, vice president of the Salt River-Pima Maricopa Indian Community, said in a statement.

The move came on the heels of the U.S. Department of Defense deleting websites about the Navajo Code Talkers who were instrumental to America’s victory in the Pacific Theater in World War II.

“Not only is this nonsensical, but it dishonors all Native American veterans and their families who have given so much to protect this country,” Leonard, a U.S. Army veteran, said.

On March 20, the Department of Defense restored the webpages about the Navajo Code Talkers.

Days after the tribal flags were removed from the hospital, Gov. Katie Hobbs took the flags and displayed them in her office.

3. GOP lawmaker calls for Dem congresswoman to be executed for urging Trump protests

Arizona state Rep. John Gillette made headlines in 2025 with his extreme and racist comments. In September he called for the execution of a Democratic congresswoman because she urged people upset with President Donald Trump to protest in the streets.

Gillette wrote on the social media site X that U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, was calling for the government to be overthrown and should be hanged.

“Until people like this, that advocate for the overthrow of the American government are tried convicted and hanged.. it will continue,” Gillette said in response to a video of Jayapal.

Gillette’s comments about Jayapal came after some of his democratic colleagues voiced concerns over his rhetoric after he castigated them for calling for civility and unity in the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In a message to all his fellow lawmakers that included a racial slur, he placed blame for political violence solely on Democrats and the political left, accusing them of stoking hate and violence against Republicans.

He also came under fire for Islamophobic comments that led to an ethics complaint that was ultimately dismissed by the Republican chair of the House Ethics Committee.

2. Trump admin cancels $21 million in funding for schools and food banks to buy from Arizona farmers

The U.S. Department of Agriculture in March announced it was cancelling roughly $1 billion in already-promised spending on local food purchases for schools and food banks nationwide.

For fiscal year 2025, Arizona had been awarded roughly $13.1 million to purchase food for schools, and an additional $8.1 million to cover products for food banks. Those awards were canceled.

USDA data shows that 392 Arizona farmers and food producers participated in the Local Food for Schools program, which provided funding for states to purchase food from local farmers and distribute it to schools and child care programs. After the cancellations, those farmers had to find other markets for their products. The bulk of the money, more than $4.8 million, went to farmers growing produce.

1. Reports of Navajo people being detained in immigration sweeps sparks concern from tribal leaders

As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement intensified its efforts, in January 2025, to apprehend and deport immigrants who lack legal status in the United States, concern increased among Indigenous communities residing in urban areas about reports of Native people being detained.

After President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for an increase in ICE raids, Navajo tribal leaders received alarming reports that their tribal members in the Valley were being detained, heightening uncertainties over the implications these actions have for their communities and the safety of their people.

But Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren told the Arizona Mirror that his office had heard the concerns coming into his office and circulating on social media about Indigenous people in urban areas being detained by ICE. However, he said that his office had not been able to verify or successfully reach a Navajo person who had been detained.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_4481final-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 21:12:14.425991

Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, who co-sponsored the legislation, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by Trump's veto.","President Donald Trump issued the first vetoes of his second term on Tuesday, rejecting two low-profile bipartisan bills, a move that had the effect of punishing backers who had opposed the president's positions on other issues.

Trump vetoed drinking water pipeline legislation from Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, a longtime ally who broke with the president in November to release files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He also vetoed legislation that would have given the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida more control of some of its tribal lands. The tribe was among groups suing the administration over an immigration detention center in the Everglades known as "" Alligator Alcatraz.""

Both bills had bipartisan support and had been noncontroversial until the White House announced Trump's vetoes Tuesday night.

Trump appeared to acknowledge the tribe's opposition to the detention facility in a letter to Congress explaining his veto. ""The Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,"" Trump wrote.

Trump did not allude to Boebert in his veto of her legislation, but raised concerns about the cost of the water pipeline at the heart of that bill.

In an interview later Wednesday with Politico, Trump also criticized the state's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis while saying that he issued the veto because ""They're wasting a lot of money and people are leaving the state. They're leaving the state in droves. Bad governor.""

Boebert, one of four House Republicans who sided with House Democrats early on to force the release of the Epstein files, shared a statement on social media suggesting that the veto may have been ""political retaliation.""

""I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability. Americans deserve leadership that puts people over politics,"" her statement said. Boebert added in another post: ""This isn't over.""

The Florida legislation had been sponsored by Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez, whom Trump has endorsed. Gimenez and the Miccosukee Tribe were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.

When asked whether the vetoes were punishment, the White House did not answer and instead referred to Trump's statements explaining the vetoes.

Congress can override the vetoes by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the House and the Senate, but it's unclear if there's enough support in the Republican-controlled chambers to do so, especially heading into a midterm election year where many of them will be on the ballot and many GOP members will count on Trump's backing.

Boebert's legislation, the ""Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act,"" aimed to improve access to clean drinking water in eastern Colorado.

While the congresswoman has long been a staunch supporter of Trump, she found herself at odds with the president with her support this year for legislation that required the Justice Department to release files related to Epstein.

Trump fought the proposal before reversing in the face of growing Republican support for releasing the files. Members of his administration even met with Boebert in the White House Situation Room to discuss the matter, though she didn't change her mind.

Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado, who co-sponsored the legislation, said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by Trump's veto.

Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.

KELLY: What did he veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.

KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, ""the massive cost of taxpayer handouts."" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.

KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, ""I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation."" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.

But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.

KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, ""has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies."" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.

KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?

KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.

KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.

KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

KELLY: And Happy New Year.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications, according to the lawsuit.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on Nov. 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.","A federal judge in Boston on Dec. 30 stayed plans by President Donald Trump’s administration to end temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to hundreds of South Sudanese nationals living in the United States.

U.S. District Court Judge Angel Kelley granted an emergency request by several South Sudanese nationals and an immigrant rights group to prevent the temporary protected status they had been granted from expiring as planned after Jan. 5.

The ruling is a temporary victory for immigrant advocates and a setback for the Trump administration’s broader effort to curtail the humanitarian program. It is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the administration’s moves to end similar protections for nationals from several other countries, including Syria, Venezuela, Haiti and Nicaragua.

Kelley issued the order after four migrants from South Sudan and the nonprofit African Communities Together sued. The lawsuit alleges that action by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawful and would expose them to being deported to a country facing a series of humanitarian crises.

Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued an administrative stay that temporarily blocks the policy pending further litigation.

She wrote that allowing it to take effect before the courts had time to consider the case’s merits “would result in an immediate impact on the South Sudanese nationals, stripping current beneficiaries of lawful status, which could imminently result in their deportation.”

Homeland Security Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the judge’s ruling ignored Trump’s constitutional and statutory authority and that the temporary protected status extended to South Sudanese nationals “was never intended to be a de facto asylum program.”

Conflict has ravaged South Sudan since it won independence from Sudan in 2011. Fighting has persisted in much of the country since a five-year civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people ended in 2018. The U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there.

The United States began designating South Sudan for temporary protected status, or TPS, in 2011.

That status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts, or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on Nov. 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

The lawsuit argues the agency’s action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment.

“The singular aim of this mass deportation agenda is to remove as many Black and Brown immigrants from this country as quickly and as cruelly as possible,” Diana Konate, deputy executive director of policy and advocacy at African Communities Together, said in a statement.

The statement, published on the Archdiocese of Louisville’s website Jan. 1, addresses Kentuckians as a follow-up to a national statement issued by the U.S. bishops in November.
It also included the signature of Jason D. Hall, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, which represents the bishops on matters of public policy.

We stand ready to be a part of bringing this about,’ ” they conclude.","The Roman Catholic bishops of Kentucky reiterated their commitment to “stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters” in a special statement for the feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 4.

The statement, published on the Archdiocese of Louisville’s website Jan. 1, addresses Kentuckians as a follow-up to a national statement issued by the U.S. bishops in November.

“In continuity with that message, and with our joint statement in December 2024 with the bishops of Tennessee, as we celebrate the Epiphany of the Lord and recognize Jesus Christ as the light that guides all nations on earth, we now wish to address ourselves specifically to our Kentucky communities,” they write in the Jan. 1 statement.

The four bishops who signed the statement are Archbishop Shelton J. Fabre of Louisville, Bishop of Owensboro William F. Medley, Bishop of Covington John C. Iffert, and Bishop of Lexington John Stowe, OFM Conv. It also included the signature of Jason D. Hall, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, which represents the bishops on matters of public policy.

The bishops begin by reiterating the position of the Catholic Church on immigration.

“Nations have a right and responsibility to control their borders and to enforce laws meant to protect the population, but all laws must be enforced in a just and predictable manner that respects the God-given dignity of each human person,” they write. “Pope Leo reminded us of this when he stated, ‘No one has said that the United States should have open borders…I think every country has a right to determine who and how and when people enter.’ The Holy Father then added that ‘we have to look for ways of treating people humanely, treating people with the dignity that they have.’ ”

They go on to express concern over the challenges facing immigrants in the U.S.

“Accordingly, we are increasingly concerned about the rapidly developing challenges facing immigrants, whether documented or undocumented. Regular reports of immigrants with legal status having that status arbitrarily revoked; increasing incidents of political leaders vilifying immigrants; the elimination of sanctuary protections for churches, hospitals, and schools; and proposals at the state level targeting the ability of immigrants to live and pursue their dreams in Kentucky, combine to create an understandable climate of hostility, anxiety, and fear,” they write, adding, “We oppose all efforts to stigmatize immigrants as a group or to spread fear based on national or ethnic origin.”

Asking elected leaders to reform the immigration system, they continue:

“We stand with all of our immigrant brothers and sisters who have been victimized by unjust government action or by harmful rhetoric and vilification. We call on all of our political leaders to work to reform our broken immigration system in a way that allows for the peaceful and orderly migration of people who are searching for peace, stability, religious freedom, and economic opportunity, as well as one that respects family unification and a realistic possibility of potentially obtaining citizenship.”

The bishops also call “Catholics and all people of good will” to action — seeking a better understanding of the plight of immigrants and Church teaching and advocating for policies that respect human dignity.

“We reiterate the call and commitment we made with our brother bishops in Tennessee and invite Catholics and all people of good will ‘to learn more about the plight of immigrants, to understand the values that form our Catholic Teaching on the matter, and to join us in advocating for just and comprehensive laws and policies that respond to the requirements of human rights and dignity and reflect the desire for the common good in our nation. We stand ready to be a part of bringing this about,’ ” they conclude.",https://therecordnewspaper.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mass-for-Separated-Families-3-9.4.25-web.png,N,,2026-01-01 17:56:23.526660

They’ve committed crimes against the Constitution of the government they’re acting in the name of and they’ve used the force, often violent force, of the federal government against innocent people. They’ve lied to Congress and federal judges. They’ve systematically violated judicial orders. They’ve denied people the most fundamental right guaranteed to residents, regardless of legal status, in the US: the right to due process of law.

The man running Trump’s border policy, Thomas Homan, was under FBI investigation for accepting grocery bags stuffed with cash to steer contracts to the Trump administration. The man running Border Patrol’s commando squads, the maniacal Gregory Bovino, was excoriated by a federal judge for lying in a deposition about the circumstances of his violent crackdowns on protesters in Chicago.

Traditional sanctuaries–churches, schools, day care centers, hospitals and courthouses–have been violated. Members of Congress, including a U.S. senator, have been roughed up and arrested. Religious leaders have been tear-gassed, tasered and beaten. People have been deported to squalid prisons in unstable countries on continents they’ve never visited, never mind lived on. Arrest warrants and deportation orders have been post-dated and falsified.

For years, the libertarian right has warned about the militarized takeover of law enforcement. Using an entirely fictitious “immigrant invasion” as an excuse, Trump chucked these constitutional anxieties aside, along with the Posse Comitatus Act, and ordered federal troops into DC, Chicago, LA, Memphis and Portland.

People have been detained and deported for their political views and columns they’ve written. People have been deported for embarrassing the government. People have been deported for the hats and shoes they wear and their tattoos. Babies have been ripped out of their mothers’ arms. Children as young as four years old have been forced to defend themselves in immigration court. The torture cells of El Salvador’s most notorious prison were rented out for more than 200 Venezuelans swept up and deported in secret flights that violated a federal judge’s order. Conditions in US detention prisons are just as bad, if not worse.

The vast majority of those arrested had no criminal record. Many of them were arrested at their jobs washing cars, mowing lawns, cultivating plants, putting roofs on houses. Others were arrested while checking in with their immigration officers or showing up for scheduled court hearings. Apparently, it’s much easier to abduct people who are abiding by the law, than those who aren’t. Who knew?

People are being grabbed off the street or chased down in their cars because they “look” like they might be immigrants. Dozens, perhaps hundreds of American citizens, have been illegally stopped, interrogated, tasered, tear-gassed, arrested and detained by masked ICE and Border Patrol agents, who have routinely dismissed documents, even REAL IDs, as forgeries. Several American citizens have been wrongly deported. Racial profiling in the service of deportation has been sanctified by the Supreme Court, with Brett Kavanaugh calling such stops a minor inconvenience, even when they result in specious arrests.

Since Trump bought off most of the large law firms at the beginning of his term, most of the legal heavy-lifting to expose the corruption and criminality of the administration’s immigration crackdown has been done by small firms and non-profits, who have routinely kicked the government’s ass in courtrooms from Portland to Nashville, Las Cruces to Boston. ICE has proven itself to be a lawless agency whose mission is to spread terror through immigrant communities across the US. But they’ve succeeded in turning much of the country against them. Public support for immigration has climbed to record highs.

Block by block, city by city, the barbarous legions of ICE are being confronted, driven back and defeated. The Trump/Miller pogrom against immigrants is failing in all of its objectives except one: to inflict maximum cruelty on a vulnerable population that it has used as a scapegoat for the decline of the American economy, resulting from four decades of ruthless neoliberal policies. This shameful episode will stand as the ghastly hallmark of this misbegotten administration.

“Many people — many nations — can find themselves holding, more or less wittingly, that ‘every stranger is an enemy’. For the most part this conviction lies deep down like some latent infection; it betrays itself only in random, disconnected acts, and does not lie at the base of a system of reason.

– Primo Levi, Survival in Auschwitz

+ On January 31, Julio Noriega, a US citizen born in Chicago, was walking in Berwyn, Illinois, to get a pizza when ICE descended on him, placed him in handcuffs, and shoved him into a van with other shacked men. His wallet, which held his ID and Social Security card proving his citizenship, was confiscated. He was detained overnight before being released without a record of what occurred.

+ At 5:30 in the morning of January 27, Jhony Godoy Gregerio was driving with his brother Bayron to work in Maywood, Illinois, when he was pulled over. Bayron was wearing an ankle bracelet mandated by ICE. The officer asked if his name was “Brian.” After Jhony answered “no,” the officer opened the car door and pulled Jhony from the car, his hands and feet cuffed. As multiple trucks carrying 15 armed officers surrounded the vehicle, the officer said he was from ICE. The ICE agent didn’t show Jhonny a warrant, and he has no criminal history other than a few traffic citations. He was taken to Indiana, and before he was able to contact his wife and child or a lawyer, he transferred to the same Louisiana prison where ICE sent Mahmoud Khalil. Jhony has been living legally in the US for 15 years.

That same day, Jhony’s brother Marco Godoy Gregerio, who was driving in a second car, was also pulled over and arrested by ICE. The ICE agent also asked Marco if he was “Brian.” Marco said, “No,” and handed the officer his ID from the Guatemalan consul’s office. As armed ICE agents surrounded his car, Marco was told to turn the car off and that he was going to be placed under arrest. He wasn’t told why, and he wasn’t shown a warrant. Marco had no criminal record. Like his brother Jhony, he was taken into custody, held in Indiana, and quickly transferred to Louisiana without being able to contact his family or a lawyer. He was held for 25 days before being able to request bond from an immigration judge.

+ On January 26, ICE agents surrounded an apartment building in Chicago where Sergio Bolanos Romero lived. As he got into his car and started driving to work, he was pulled over by armed ICE agents who told him to exit the vehicle and demanded he show them proof of his immigration status. After Sergio didn’t provide any, he was handcuffed, taken to a parking lot, which served as an ICE processing center, and then transferred to a jail in Wisconsin. It turned out that ICE had mistaken Sergio for the target of a planned raid who lived in the same building, even though Sergio’s car did not match ICE’s intended target. Sergio had not committed a crime and was not shown a warrant for his arrest. He was released two days later.

+ On January 29, ICE pulled over Bernandino Randa Marinas on his way to work in Chicago. After handing his ID to an ICE agent, Bernandino was ordered to keep his hands on the steering wheel of his car and not to move. He was held this way for around 40 minutes before one of the ICE officers told him he was under arrest. When Bernando asked to see a warrant, the officer quickly flashed him his cell phone. But he was not shown a Notice to Appear, and at the time of his arrest, there were no pending proceedings against him. Bernandino has lived in the US for more than 20 years, has two children who are US citizens, and a third is due in May. He has no criminal history.

+ On the morning of February 6, 2025, Jose Ortega Gonzalez was arrested by ICE while driving to work in Kansas. Jose has lived in the US for 20 years and is the father of children who are US citizens. Armed ICE officers surrounded his car and demanded his immigration papers. Jose told them he didn’t have proof of his legal status on him. He was then asked if he’d been arrested for drug trafficking. Jose told the officers he had no criminal history besides a couple of traffic tickets. Jose was then handcuffed, taken to a local police station, and then to an ICE detention center, where he was held for three weeks before seeing a judge who freed him on bond.

+ On January 26, Abel Orozco Ortega was driving back from the grocery store to the same Lyons, Illinois house he’s lived in for 15 years when he was stopped and arrested by ICE. The ICE agents had mistaken him for his son, Abel Jr., who is more than two decades younger. After Abel handed an ICE officer his driver’s license, the immigration cop reached inside Abel’s car window, unlocked and opened the door, then grabbed Abel’s arm and told him he was under arrest. He was hauled out of the car, cuffed, and put into an ICE vehicle. Abel’s son Eduardo came out of the house to see what was going on. As Eduardo, who is a US citizen, tried to speak with his father, the driver of the ICE car drove over his foot. These traumatic events caused Abel to experience a severe health episode, which required his hospitalization. After he was discharged from the hospital, ICE transferred him to a detention center in Indiana, where he remains. Abel Ortega has no criminal record and was never shown a warrant for his arrest.

+ On the morning of January 27, ICE agents showed up at an apartment building in Chicago. They were looking for a man named Carlos. When one of the residents of the apartment told them no one named Carlos lived there, eight ICE officers busted through the door and began searching the apartment. They found 24-year-old Jockneul Hernandez Rojas in his room watching television while in bed. The officer told him to get dressed and that he was under arrest. Jockneul was handcuffed and led out of the building. Jocknuel was not shown a warrant and had no criminal record. He had previously been issued a Notice to Appear by ICE, but the immigration court had dismissed the case against him. Jocknuel was taken to the ICE center in Indiana and then swiftly transferred to Louisiana, where he was later released on the orders of an immigration judge.

+ In the early morning hours of January 28, federal agents broke down the door of Raul Lopez Garcia’s house in Elgin, Illinois. They located Raul in an upstairs bedroom, where they handcuffed him and confiscated his identification documents. He was taken to an ICE facility for processing. Raul was not shown a warrant for his arrest and had no criminal record. ICE later claimed that they encountered Raul while looking for his stepson. Raul was eventually released on bond by a federal judge.

+ ICE agents broke down the door of Senen Becerra Hernandez’s Chicago apartment, looking for his roommate. Senen was placed in handcuffs and ordered to wait outside for more than an hour as they looked for the target of their raid. Instead of releasing him, the ICE officers took Senen to a detention center. ICE later justified his warrantless arrest by falsely claiming that he didn’t live at the address and had no community ties. In reality, Senen lived in the apartment where the raid occurred, had a job, and attended a local church.

+ At 11 AM on February 7, an ICE team entered El Potro’s Mexican Café and Cantina in Liberty, Missouri. The 10-member team was armed and dressed in tactical gear. Several of the agents wore masks over their faces. One of the ICE agents told the cafe owner they were looking for someone and ordered him to make all his employees available for questioning. They didn’t provide a name, show him a photograph, or provide a warrant. Still, the owner felt he had to comply.

As two ICE agents guarded the door, the employees were rounded up and placed in separate booths in the restaurant, where each employee was ordered to provide their ID. One employee was almost immediately placed in handcuffs, while the others were detained in the booths for more than two hours as ICE seized the employment records from the restaurant. At 12:30, 12 employees were placed in handcuffs, marched out of the cafe, and taken into custody. Eleven workers were detained in Kansas, while another was taken to Kentucky and later to Indiana. All but two of the workers were soon released on minimal bonds. One was deported, and the other remains in detention.

+ In their mass roundups of alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, ICE has been using tattoos as justification to deport noncitizens to a life of hard labor and torture in Salvadoran prisons. Among those deported are: a tattoo artist who entered the US legally seeking asylum: a teenage boy in Arlington, Texas, who got a tattoo on his left hand of a rose with paper money as its petals because, his sister said, he thought it “looked cool;” and a 26-year-old man whose tattoos his wife claims are unrelated to any gangs, never mind TdA.

+ Here’s the declaration of immigration attorney Linette Tobin on the arrest and deportation to El Salvador of her client Jerce Reyes Barrios, a professional soccer player and dissident from Venezuela who was seeking asylum in the US as a political refugee.

1. I am the immigration attorney for Jerce Reyes Barrios, born in [sic] January 16, 1989 in Venezuela.

2. In February and March 2024, Mr Reyes Barrios marched in two demonstrations in Venezuela, protesting the authoritarian rule of Maduro. At the second demonstration, he was detained and taken to a clandestine building where he was tortured (electric shocks and suffocation) along with other demonstrators.

3. Shortly after his release, he fled Venezuela for the United States. He registered with CBP One in Mexico, then presented himself to CBP officials on the day of his appointment. He was taken into custody and detained at Otay Mesa Detention Facility in September 2024.

4. We applied for asylum, withdrawal of removal, and CAT protection in December 2024. His final individual hearing is set for April 17, 2025, before Judge Robinson at the Otay Mesa immigration court.

5. On March 15, 2025, Mr. Reyes Barrios was deported to El Salvador with no notice to counsel or family. It was not until March 18, 2025, that counsel was able to reach an ICE official and learn that he had, in fact, been deported.

6. Mr. Reyes Barrio was/is a professional soccer player in Venezuela. He has never been arrested or charged with a crime. He has a steady employment record as a soccer player, as well as a soccer coach for children and youth.

7. Initially, Mr Barrios was placed in maximum security at Otay Mesa and accused of being a Tren de Aragua gang member. The accusation is based on two things. First, he has a tattoo on his arm of a crown sitting atop a soccer ball with a rosary and the word “Dios.” DHS alleges that this tattoo is proof of gang membership. In reality, he chose the tattoo because it is similar to the logo for his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid. See the logo below.

8. Second, DHS reviewed his social media posts and found a photo of Mr. Reyes Barrios making a hand gesture that they allege is proof of gang membership. In fact, the gesture is a common one: It means “I Love You” in sign language and is commonly used as a Rock-and-Roll symbol.

9. After submitting a police clearance from Venezuela indicating no criminal record, multiple employment letters, a declaration from the tattoo artist who rendered the tattoo, and various online images showing similar soccer ball/crown tattoos and explaining the meaning of the hand gestures, Mr Reyes Barrios was transferred out of maximum security.

10. Nevertheless, on March 10th or 11th, he was transferred from Otay Mesa to Texas without notice. Then, on March 15, 2025, he was deported to El Salvador. Counsel and family have lost all contact with him and have no information regarding his whereabouts or condition.

+ If this is how they’re treating opponents of Maduro, imagine how they’re treating dissidents of the Bukele regime in El Salvador.

+ How does ICE justify these arrests and deportations to Buekele’s concentration camp-like prison, where torture, food deprivation and killings are commonplace? In truly Kafkaesque terms: “the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose. It demonstrates they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.”

+ In late February, the Canadian actress Jasmine Mooney was kidnapped by ICE after she tried to renew her work visa at the US/Mexico border. She was cuffed, thrown into a van, held prisoner for 12 days, denied access to a lawyer, made to sleep on concrete floors and given a forced pregnancy test before being sent back to Canada with no explanation from DHS officials for the brutality of her treatment. Mooney described her surreal ordeal in vivid terms for an article in The Guardian.

+ On March 5, Ranjani Srinivasan was told by email that her student visa had been revoked after she attended a couple of protests and liked some social media posts in support of Palestinians in Gaza. Ranjani, a 37-year-old architect from India who was on the verge of completing her doctoral program in urban planning at Columbia, withdrew from school and fled to Canada after ICE knocked on her dorm door and accused her of advocating “violence and terrorism.” In an interview with Boston radio station WBUR, Ranjani said:

I’m not a terrorist sympathizer. I’m not pro-Hamas. And I think it’s really dangerous to label any free speech that somebody disagrees with, or any sort of peaceful objection to global issues, as terrorism. I think it just creates a climate of fear where people are scared to share their opinions. There’s a feeling that your visa could be revoked for even the simplest political speech, and the whole point of an American university is to have debate and nuance about ideas to contest them freely. I think there’s a general fear of doing that now.

+ On March 7, Fabian Schmidt was detained by immigration officers at Logan Airport in Boston on his way back from Luxembourg. Schmidt holds a green card and has lived and worked in the US since moving to the States with his mother in 2007. He became a permanent resident in 2008 and has worked in the US as an electrical engineer ever since. As ICE officers interrogated him and demanded he surrender his green card, his partner, a cardiologist and US citizen, waited for him for four hours at the airport. During his detention, Schmidt was stripped naked, placed in a cold shower, and deprived of food, water, and medication. He collapsed before being hospitalized at Mass General. After his release from the hospital, Schmidt was taken to an ICE facility in Burlington, Mass., and then transferred to an ICE jail in Rhode Island. Schmidt’s green card had recently been renewed and there were no pending legal cases against him. He wasn’t served with a warrant at the time of his arrest and wasn’t permitted to contact his family for three days. Schmidt has an 8-year-old daughter who is a US citizen.

+ On March 9, a French space researcher was subjected to a “random” search upon arrival in the US. His phone and computer were confiscated and searched. The DHS agents found a series of text messages describing Trump’s treatment of scientists, which they used to accuse him of harboring a “hatred of toward Trump that could be described as terrorism.” He was held in custody overnight and deported back to Europe the next day. Agence France Press later reported that DHS had accused him of “hateful and conspiratorial messages” and had referred him to the FBI.

+ On March 12, Dr. Rasha Alawieh was detained by immigration officials at Boston’s Logan Airport. She was told that her visa had been revoked and that she would be deported back to Lebanon, where she’d been visiting her parents. Her phone and computer were confiscated. Dr. Alawieh works at Brown Medicine and Rhode Island Hospital. She had secured an H-1B visa that doesn’t expire until 2027. She was trained in the U.S. at Ohio State, the University of Washington, and Yale as a transplant surgeon. She hasn’t been convicted or accused of a crime. In court filings, ICE claimed to have discovered photos on her phone that were “sympathetic” to leaders of Hezbollah. It turns out that the images weren’t Dr. Alaweigh’s but had been posted to a group chat she belonged to.

+ On March 17, masked ICE agents arrested Badar Khan Suri outside his own in Arlington, Virginia. Bara is an Indian national with a student visa who was doing post-doctoral research at Georgetown University. The agents told Badar his visa had been revoked and he would be deported to India. Badar has no criminal record and is married to a US citizen. Badar’s lawyer, Hassan Ahmad, told Politicothat he had been targeted because of his wife’s Palestinian heritage. In a sworn statement, Badar’s wife, Mapheze Saleh, said the detention of her husband “has completely upended our lives…Our children are in desperate need of their father and miss him dearly. As a mother of three children, I desperately need his support to take care of them and me.” A federal court blocked Badar’s deportation.

+ ICE is knowingly renditioning innocent people and sending them to a prison where the night-time sadism of Abu Ghraib is the operational plan 24/7…

+ The ACLU filed a sworn declaration from a Venezuela woman asylum seeker whom ICE detained and wanted to deport to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act; she says she overheard ICE officials on the plane to El Salvador conversing about that court ruling ordering them to turn the plane back to the US. ICE defied the court order and renditioned the detainees to El Salvador despite stopping for “hours” to refuel. The Venezuelan asylum seeker was later returned to the Webb Detention Center in Laredo, Texas…

On Friday, we were told to gather our belongings and put on the bus at Webb [County detention center in Laredo, Texas] and sat in the bus for about 5 minutes and then were taken back to Webb.

Saturday morning, we were again told to gather our belongings and get on the bus. We went to the airport, and eight women were put on the plane with me.

When we got on the plane, there were already over 50 men on the plane. I could see other migrants walking to the plane, but we took off before any additional people boarded. Within a couple of minutes, I overheard two US government officials talking, and they said, “There is an order saying we can’t take off, but we already have.”

I asked where we were going and we were told that we were going to Venezuela. Several other people on the plane told me they were in immigration proceedings and awaiting court hearings in immigration court.

We were not allowed to open our window shades.

We landed somewhere for refueling. We were there for many hours. We were arm and leg shackled the whole time.

We took off again and landed fairly quickly. I was then told we were in El Salvador.

While on the plane the government officials were asking the men to sign a document and they didn’t want to. The government officials were pushing them to sign the document and threatening them. I heard them discussing the documents and they were about the men admitting they were members of TdA.

After we landed but were still on the plane, a woman opened the shade. An officer rushed to close the shade and pulled her down by her shoulders to try and stop her from looking out. The person who pushed her down had HOU-O2 written on his sleeve.

I saw out the window for a minute and I saw men in military uniforms and another plane. I saw men being led off the plane. Since I’ve been back in the US, I have seen news coverage, and the plane I saw looks like the one I’ve seen on TV with migrants from the US being delivered to El Salvador.

+ Neri Alvarado was working as a baker in Dallas when ICE showed up asking to see his tattoo. “We’re here because of your tattoos. We are finding and questioning everyone who has tattoos,” an ICE agent told him. Neri explained that the rainbow-colored ribbon on his arm was an Autism Awareness tattoo honoring his 15-year-old brother with autism. The ICE examined Neri’s phone and told him he was clean. But another agent ordered him kept in detention. Then, he was renditioned to El Salvador without any explanation. His only crime was having a tattoo.

+ ICE is trying to deport Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Columbia student who attended pro-Palestine protests. Chung came to the US from South Korea with her family at age SEVEN. She’s been a lawful permanent resident for more than a decade. She was the valedictorian of her high school class. She faced a disciplinary hearing from Columbia, which found she did not violate the university’s policies. Despite being cleared of any crimes or infractions (even that of trespassing on her own campus), ICE agents showed up at her parent’s house and told them her green card had been revoked. Armed ICE agents showed up twice at her campus apartment looking for her. On Wednesday, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order stopping the Trump administration from detaining Yunseo.

+ A little after five in the evening on Tuesday, Runeysa Ozturk, a Ph D candidate at Tufts University, was accosted on the streets of Somerville, Mass., outside of Boston by hooded and masked agents, who initially refused to identify who they were and then falsely claimed they were “the police.” They were, in fact, ICE. Runeysa’s backpack, purse, and phone were seized. She was placed in cuffs, forced into a black van, and taken away. She was told her student visa had been revoked, and she was going to be deported. Ozturk, a Turkish citizen, was here legally, had committed no crimes, and wasn’t charged with a crime by ICE when they kidnapped her. Her sole offense? Co-writing an op-ed in the Tufts student paper opposing Israel’s mass killings of Palestinians. Even though a federal judge had ordered ICE to keep her in Massachusetts until a hearing on her status could take place, she was transported to an ICE detention jail in Louisiana.

+ On Thursday, Marco Rubio admitted that he’d personally revoked Runeysa’s visa and smeared her without evidence as being a terrorist sympathizer and a supporter of Hamas. “We do it every day,” Rubio boasted. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.” Rubio said he’s already revoked 300 student visas and intends to revoke many more.

+ Kilmar Abrego Garcia came to the US in 2012 to escape being recruited into a Salvadoran gang that had terrorized his family for more than two years. In 2016, he met his future wife, Jennifer Stefania Vasquez Sura, a US citizen living in Maryland. They eventually moved in together and Kilmar helped raise her two children. They later had a child together. Each of the three kids had some form of disability. Kilmar, according to Jennifer, was an attentive and devoted father to all of the children. He held a steady job, he stayed out of trouble, and then he was busted in 2019 while waiting to apply for a job at Home Depot and accused of being a member of the M-13 gang in Long Island, where he’d never been. During his hearing, Abrega adamantly denied any gang ties. The cops said they arrested him because “he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique.”

Jennifer Vasquez Sura wrote in a deposition that she was so fearful Kilmar would be deported that she arranged for them to get married while he was in jail: “I coordinated with the detention center and a local pastor to officiate our wedding. We were separated by glass and were not allowed physical contact. The officers had to pass our rings to each other. It was heartbreaking not to be able to hug him.”

Relying on the bogus testimony from a confidential informant, the immigration judge issued a removal order but barred his deportation to El Salvador, agreeing that there was a serious threat to Abrego Garcia’s life if he was returned home. The judge ordered his release and required him to regularly check-ins with ICE, which Abrego Garcia faithfully did.

So things stood until March 12, 2025, when ICE agents stopped Abrego Garcia’s car as he was driving his 5-year-old son home from school. He was cuffed, told his immigration status had been revoked and that he would be deported. The agents took him to a detention center in Baltimore. When Kilmar was finally able to talk with Jennifer on the phone, he told her the ICE agents once again accused him of being a member of M-13, saying bizarrely they’d watched the family frequently visit a certain restaurant and that they had photos of Kilmar playing basketball.

On the morning of March 15, Kilmar called Jennifer again to let her know he’d been transferred to Louisiana. “That call was short and Kilmar’s tone was different,” Jennifer wrote in her deposition. “He was scared. He was told he was being deported to El Salvador. He was told he was being deported to El Salvador to a super-max prison called ‘CECOT.’” Jennifer hasn’t heard from him since.

Then, on Monday of this week, the Trump administration admitted in a court filing that Abrego Garcia had been deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order. By accident, they claimed, the result of an “administrative error:” (Which sounds like the excuse for everything that happened in the last two months.) “On March 15, although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error.” Even so, the Trump administration argued the court had no power to order the return of Kilmar from the custody of the nation that he had fled 13 years ago in fear for his life.

The entire case against Kilmar, dating back to 2019, has the smell of a frame-up. When Kilmar’s lawyers attempted to contact the detective who filled out a form in 2019 accusing him of links to MS-13, they discovered that the police department had no record of his arrest. Even more damning, the detective who filled out the fatal form had been suspended.

Despite the outrageous facts of the case, instead of admitting their grotesque error, the Trump administration went on the offensive, sending JD Vance out to smear Kilmar on FoxNews, where he called him “a convicted MS-13 gang member with no legal right to be here. He had also committed some traffic violations; he had not shown up for some court dates. This is not exactly ‘father of the year’ here.” Trump’s Jesus-worshipping press spokesperson Kathline Leavitt threw even more toxic slime at Kilmar, calling him a “criminal,” a “foreign terrorist,” and a “heinous individual.”

All lies.

Abrega Garcia has no criminal record and his wife and kids miss him and worry about his fate in Naghib Bukele’s lethal dungeon.

+ In 2024, José Gregorio González came to the US from Venezuela to donate a kidney needed to save the life of his brother José Alfred Pacheco, who suffers from late-stage renal failure. But before the operation could take place, González was swept up by an ICE raid in Chicago that a neighbor described as “an ambush.” González’s request for asylum had been denied, but an immigration judge had allowed him to stay in the US for the time being because Venezuela was refusing to accept any deportation flights from the US. González hadn’t any criminal history in the US and wasn’t served with a warrant at the time of his arrest. After public outrage over his detention, Gonzalez was temporarily released until after the operation could take place, at which time he would be deported.

+ The Washington Post explains that this is far from the only case where noncitizen relatives have been deported while caring for relatives with terminal illnesses, though not as terminal as the sickness of the country that is deporting them:

Last month, a child brain cancer patient in Texas and her four siblings — all U.S. citizens — were deported to Mexico along with their undocumented parents who had removal orders as the family was en route to a Houston hospital for her treatment. An undocumented Mexican woman in the Los Angeles area fared better — ICE arrested her in February, but an immigration judge allowed her to post bond as she was the caregiver for an American daughter with bone cancer.

+ On March 27, a mother and her three children were kidnapped by ICE in Sackets Harbor in northern New York, the hometown of Tom Homan, who’s commanding the immigration raids for Trump. All four of them were handcuffed, including a third grader, and kept in detention for 11 days. They were finally released this week after more than 1,000 people showed up to protest their baseless arrests.

+ The Los Angeles United School District said plainclothes ICE agents tried to question students at two elementary schools in Los Angeles on Monday but were denied entry by administrators. Superintendent Alberto Carvahlo said the agents falsely claimed they had parental permission to question the kids.

+ Here’s the declaration of Luis Alberto Castillo Rivera, who entered the United States legally from Venezuela, had committed no crimes while in the US, yet was kidnapped without a warrant by ICE and sent to the notorious Camp 6 at Guantanamo Bay, where he was fed wretched food, kept shackled in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day, denied medical care, mocked and humiliated by guards, saw a prisoner beaten by guards for refusing to return a toothbrush, had their Bibles and passports seized and were denied phone calls with family and lawyers for two weeks…

+ First, you get away with deporting non-criminal non-citizens. Then you try to deport non-criminal citizens whose ethnicity you dislike. Last week, Juan Carlos Gomez-Lopez, a 20-year-old Georgia man of Mayan heritage, was pulled over and arrested by Florida Highway Patrol for “being an undocumented immigrant over the age of 18 who had illegally entered the state of Florida.” There were just two problems. First, the enforcement of DeSantis’s punitive immigration law Gomez-Lopez supposedly violated, has been blocked by a federal court. Second, Gomez-Lopez is a US citizen. When Gomez-Lopez appeared for his arraignment before the local court, his advocates presented the judge with his birth certificate and Social Security card as proof that he is a natural-born US citizen. Leon County Judge LaShawn Riggins said, “In looking at it and feeling it and holding it up to the light, the court can clearly see the watermark proving this is an authentic document.” Riggins said there was no probable cause for his detention, but that her hands were tied because ICE had asserted jurisdiction and wants him sent to a detention center for deportation.

“It’s like this dystopian nightmare of poorly written laws,” said Thomas Kennedyof the Florida Immigrant Coalition. “We’re living in a time when this man could be sent to El Salvador because, what? Is he going to be treated as a stateless person?”

+ Meanwhile, in Boston: “Immigration attorney Nicole Micheroni says she was born at Newton Wellesley Hospital, grew up in Sharon, Massachusetts, and was educated at Wellesley College. So, anyone can imagine her surprise when she says she received an emailed letter from the Department of Homeland Security, telling her to self-deport within 7 days…”

+ And in Arizona, CBP targeted another Bostonian: Rioles Saeed, a lawyer now living in Tucson, received a notice from Border Patrol telling her to leave the country or be forcibly deported. Saeed is an American citizen who was born in Boston. Saeed: “I thought this was for one of my clients but then i saw that it was addressed only to me. With the dot gov, it said it was from CBP…There is a true recklessness coming from the government and shows an intimidating attitude towards our immigrant clients.”

+ Alec MacGillis, Pro Publica: “Kseniia Petrova left Russia in protest of Putin and found work at a Harvard lab, w/ a valid visa. She arrived with only a backpack. CBP stopped her recently at Logan for failing to declare frog embryos she had brought from Paris for her lab. This would normally come with a fine. Instead, she is in prison in Louisiana. “I feel like something is happening generally in America. Something bad is happening. I don’t think everybody understands.”

+ We’re watching the Milgram Experiment breakout in real-time, as hundreds of ICE agents commit sadistic acts against innocent people, they’d never imagined themselves ever doing back in Sunday School…(At least I hope they’d never imagined themselves doing it): A Guatemalan immigrant with no Massachusetts criminal record was arrested Monday on Tallman Street in New Bedford after federal agents shattered the glass on his vehicle with axes, as he and his wife waited inside the car for their lawyer to arrive. Like so many others, he was detained without a warrant.

+ The former cop who sent gay makeup artist, Andry Jose Hernandez, Romero to a hellhole of a prison in El Salvador is a known liar, who was put on a Brady List of cops whose testimony should not be trusted at trial. He also drove drunk into a family’s house and falsified his overtime hours.

American citizens are being routinely caught in Trump’s deportation dragnet, detained, jailed, and threatened with deportation, even a four-year-old with cancer and a pregnant mother who would have given birth to an American citizen. When ICE’s “mistakes” are revealed, usually through the presentation of a birth certificate days after the false arrest, the typical response has been to blame the victims. That’s if they haven’t already been deported.

Take the case of 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, who was detained by Border Patrol outside Tucson on April 8 and held for 10 days in the privately run Florence Correctional Center before being released. Hermosilla, who has a learning disability, told his jailers he was an American citizen. They told him to tell his lawyer. At that point, Jose Hermosillo didn’t have a lawyer. Two days later, Jose told an immigration judge the same thing. Federal prosecutors requested a week-long delay in the case. And Jose, who is the father of a six-month-old American citizen, was held for another seven days until his family could finally present the court with his birth certificate.

After his release, DHS smeared Hermosillo, blaming him for his own arrest and detention. In a post on Twitter (of all places), DHS said: “Hermosillo’s arrest and detention were a direct result of his own actions and statements.” In trying to cover their own cruel blunders, DHS officials alleged “that Jose Hermosillo approached Border Patrol in Tucson, Arizona, stating he had ILLEGALLY entered the U.S. and identified himself as a Mexican citizen.”

This was a convenient concoction, a fiction. Hermosilllo hadn’t been in Mexico and he’s not a Mexican citizen. To support their self-serving claim, DHS said Hermossilo signed a transcript of an alleged interview attesting to this version of events. But Hermosilla can’t read or write. He can only scratch out his name, according to his girlfriend.

What really happened is quite different, tragic even. Hermosillo lives in Albuquerque and had traveled to Tucson with his girlfriend to visit her family. While in Tucson, he suffered a seizure and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. He was treated and released, unsure exactly where he was or how to return to his girlfriend.

Hermosilla flagged down what he thought was a police car to ask for directions. It turned out to be Border Patrol. He told the officer he was staying in Tucson but was lost.

The BP officer responded harshly, “You’re not from here. Where are you from?

“New Mexico,” Hermosilla said.

“I don’t believe you,” the BP cop said. “Show me your papers?”

Hermosilla told him he’d left his New Mexico ID at his girlfriend’s family’s place.

“I’m not stupid,” the cop told him. “I know you’re from Mexico.”

Then the cop arrested Hermosilla, told him to sign some papers, and then deposited him in a cell with 15 other men, where he was served cold food and denied his medications for the next 10 days.

“I told them I was a US citizen,” Hermosillo told Arizona PM. “But they don’t listen to me.”

+ On Friday, Federal Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump appointee, issued an order saying that DHS had apparently deported a 2-year-old American citizen to Honduras with “no meaningful” process, even though the girl’s father, also a US citizen, fought to keep her in the country.

+ The ACLU reported that on Friday, the New Orleans field office of ICE deported two families with minor children. Three of the children (age 2, 4 and 7) are US citizens. One of the children suffers from a rare form of metastatic cancer. The citizen child was deported without medications or being able to consult with their doctors, even though ICE was fully briefed about the child’s dire medical condition. One of the mothers is pregnant. Both families have lived in the US for many years.

According to the ACLU, “ICE held the families incommunicado, refusing or failing to respond to multiple attempts by attorneys and family members to contact them. In one instance, a mother was granted less than one minute on the phone before the call was abruptly terminated when her spouse tried to provide legal counsel’s phone number.”

+ Aldo Martinez-Gomez, a US citizen living in California, received a DHS notice on April 11, threatening “criminal prosecution” and fines if he does not depart within seven days, even after he showed them his birth certificate. “Do not attempt to remain in the United States,” the letter warned. “The government will find you.’ Martinez-Gomez: “I’m just trying not to be one of the government’s mistakes.”

+ At 8:30 in the morning on Friday, U.S. Marshals entered a county courthouse in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and arrested trial judge Hannah Dugan on charges that she had obstructed the arrest of a noncitizen. Trump officials, including FBI director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, publicly gloated over her arrest, as did Trump, who posted a photo of the judge wearing a medical mask on his Truth Social feed.

Shockingly (right?), the facts are a little different from what the Trumpites have presented. Flores was in Dugan’s courtroom on another matter, when ICE agents entered and attempted to arrest him without a warrant. Dugan ordered the agents out of her court and told them to contact the supervising judge. Then she escorted Flores and his attorney out the back of the courtroom to a public hallway.

Flores Ruiz was not, as Patel crudely asserts, a “perp.” He hadn’t been accused of “perpetrating” any crime, except that of being in the US without papers. There was no “increased danger” to the public because there was never any “danger” to begin with, except to Flores Ruiz. He was later detained by ICE and jailed without incident. Surely, judges have sovereignty over their own courtrooms and have the authority to demand to see a warrant before an arrest is made inside their chambers.

Of course, this is yet another provocation, pushing the limits of executive power to see how far it reaches. It seems as if Trump is heeding Bukele’s advice at the White House that you need to “get rid of the judges.” In 2021, the Salvadoran despot removed all five judges from the nation’s supreme court and fired its attorney general.

+ Two weeks after a family from Maryland moved into a new rental house in Oklahoma City, 20 armed ICE agents burst into their home. “I didn’t know who they were,” the mother later said. “It was dark. All the lights were off. I kept asking them, ‘Who are you? What are you doing here? What’s happening? And they said, ‘We have a warrant for the house, a search warrant.’”

+ “You can’t just walk up to people with brown skin and say, ‘Show me your papers,” said U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer L. Thurston, before issuing a preliminary injunction forbidding the Border Patrol from conducting warrantless immigration stops throughout a wide swath of California.

+ Sophie’s Choice, American-style: A Guatemalan woman will be given “the choice” of whether she wants to take her newborn, a US citizen born in Tucson on Wednesday, with her when she is deported, CBP says. CBP placed guards outside her maternity ward room and refused to let her speak to a lawyer…

+ Two weeks after a family from Maryland moved into a new rental house in Oklahoma City, 20 armed ICE agents burst into their home. “I didn’t know who they were,” the mother later said. “It was dark. All the lights were off. I kept asking them, ‘Who are you? What are you doing here? What’s happening? And they said, ‘We have a warrant for the house, a search warrant.’”

Flashing the warrant, ICE raided the house, seizing cellphones, computers, and the family’s life savings. While ICE agents ransacked the house, they forced the mother and three daughters to stand outside in their underwear. “We are citizens!” the mother screamed at the ICE officers. “You have guns pointed in our faces. Can you just reprogram yourself and see us as humans, as women?”

+ ICE arrested an Afghan who provided security for US troops in Afghanistan, who was in the country legally as his asylum claim was being processed, and who had no criminal record. In the charging document, ICE lied to the court about his status. Let this be a lesson to any foreign national that you can’t trust the US to live up to its commitments. We’ll chuck you out when we have no use for you, for any reason at all or no reason at all, back into the hands of people who may want you dead…

+ If your cause is so righteous, why do you have to resort to such vile forms of trickery and deception?

+ ICE “mistakenly” arrested a US Marshall in Arizona because he looked the type. We’ve gone from showing probable cause as a basis for arrests to “he fits the general description” (ie, male and Hispanic), let’s haul him in and sort it out later….

+ Like many family members of people ICE detained during its raid on Ambiance Apparel in Los Angeles last Friday, Yurien Contreras has not heard from her father, Mario Romero, and has no idea how is doing: “I witnessed how they put my father in handcuffs, chained him from the waist and ankles. My family and I haven’t had communication with my dad. We don’t know anything.”

+ Jose Ortiz, one of the men arrested in the LA worksite raids, has lived in LA for 30 years. After 18 years on the job, he had advanced to the role of floor manager when ICE arrested him without a warrant and with no criminal record.

+ A few days ago, 75 Democrats voted for a Congressional Resolution praising ICE. Today, ICE manhandled, threw to the ground, cuffed, and detained US Senator Alex Padilla for trying to attend a press briefing by DHS Secretary. Kristi Noem…Whose side are you on?

+ Sen. Alex Padilla: “If that’s what they do to a United States Senator with a question, imagine what they do to farm workers, day laborers, cooks, and the other nonviolent immigrants they are targeting in California and across the country. Or any American that dares to speak up.”

+ ICE released photos of National Guard troops, not “guarding” against “rioters,” but assisting in raids on immigrants…

+75 Democrats joined with House Republicans to vote for a Resolution thanking ICE for its role in implementing Trump’s Mass Deportation operations…

+ You want to know what kind of people work for ICE, they’re the type that mocks and laughs at a mother, sobbing on the street outside her house while holding her infant son in her arms as masked men haul away her husband for no explicable reason: When Roberto Diego Alvarez left for work in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, he was seized by ICE officers, thrown to the ground, then hauled away in handcuffs, while his wife Nicole, a 35-year-old US citizen, watched and cried as she clutched their 8-month-old son. Nicole later told Newsweek: “I learned from Diego that they were laughing at me in the car before leaving, pointing and saying, ‘I bet she is recording.’ I was hysterical. I had our son, Denver, who is 8 months old, in my arms. I couldn’t stop crying.”

+ Last Saturday, the management of the Los Angeles Dodgers told the singer Nezza to “do the national anthem in English tonight.” Instead, Nezza put on a Dominican Republic t-shirt and sang the anthem in Spanish. (Nezza was born in the US and is an American citizen.) Word of the Dodgers’ attempt to suppress Nezza ignited outrage among many in the LA Hispanic community. This is, after all, the team that evicted a predominantly Mexican community of 300 families from their homes in Chavez Ravine (without compensation) to build Dodger Stadium. Nezza’s defiant act and the local response to it almost certainly prompted the Dodgers to take this action on Thursday…

+ This was followed by the Dodgers agreeing to donate $1 million to “immigrant families” who have been traumatized by the ICE raids in LA…(Way to go, Nezza!)

+++

+ Pedro Luis Salazar-Cuervo was detained by Texas cops, who asked if he had tattoos. Salazar-Cuervo told the cops he didn’t, and in fact, he had none. Then the cops searched his phone and found a photo of Salazar-Cuervo standing next to a man who did have a tattoo. That was enough for ICE to label him a Tren de Aragua and have him deported to Bukele’s concentration camp prison in El Salvador without any trial or hearing. This week, a Texas judge agreed that he must be returned to stand trial in August for trespassing on private property, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison. The Trump administration has not indicated whether it will act on the court’s order.

+ Julio Noriega, a U.S. citizen, was walking around a suburb handing out his resume to local businesses when ICE surrounded him, handcuffed him, and detained him for 10 hours before checking his ID and releasing him.

+ A couple of notable cases from Immigration Defense, which is representing dozens of people arrested by ICE in LA in the last week: One of their clients is a man named Javier, a cancer patient who has lived in LA for more than 20 years without any criminal record. If he isn’t released soon, he will miss his scheduled chemotherapy treatments. Another case is that of a day laborer who was granted asylum in the US 8 years ago. He was arrested twice by ICE this week. During the first arrest, he was held for eight hours and was on the verge of being transferred out of LA until ImmDef was able to prove his legal status. Then he was detained again.

+ Brad Lander, the comptroller of NYC (and NYT-endorsed mayoral candidate), was arrested by ICE at Immigration Court this week, after asking to see a warrant for people who were detained after an immigration hearing…

+ Lander after his release from ICE custody:

I’m happy to report I’m just fine. I lost a button. But I’m gonna sleep in my bed tonight, safe, with my family… At that elevator, I was separated from someone named Edgardo… Edgardo is in ICE detention and he’s not going to sleep in his bed tonight…There were posters on the wall… it said in English, ‘Are you detained and separated from your children?’ … We are normalizing family separation, we are normalizing due process rights violations, we are normalizing the destruction of constitutional democracy.

+ Narciso Barranco was working as a landscaper at an IHOP in Santa Ana when ICE agents, who refused to identify themselves, grabbed him, threw him to the ground, repeatedly punched him in the face, and pepper-sprayed him. ICE later said he attacked them with a “weed whacker,” but videos of the abduction show no such attack. Barranco is the father of three sons, all of whom are US Marines.

+ Barranco’s son, Alejandro, on his father, after he’d been pepper-sprayed, body-slammed, punched, and bloodied by ICE: “He has always worked hard to put food on the table for us and my mom. He was always careful and did his taxes on time. He never caused any problems, and he is known as a kind and helpful person by everyone in our community. I believe my father was racially profiled. They didn’t ask him anything. They just started chasing him and he ran because he was scared. He didn’t know who was after him.”

+ “My mom looked at the rear mirror and she saw how my sister was attacked from the back,” Estrella Rosas told ABC7. “She was like: ‘They’re kidnapping your sister.’” Estrella’s sister, Andrea Velez, had just been dropped off at her workplace in downtown Los Angeles when ICE agents descended upon her. One masked agent grabbed Velez, lifted her off the ground and carried her away to an ICE fan, as her sister and mother shouted: “She’s a US citizen. They’re taking her. Help her, someone!” Velez, a 36-year-old graduate of Cal-Poly Pomona, disappeared into ICE custody. She was arrested without a warrant and wasn’t even asked for her identification. It took her lawyer more than a day to find out where she was being held.

Velez is one of at least 674 US citizens who have been wrongly arrested by ICE. More than 120 US citizens have been detained and at least 70 deported. After ICE was forced to admit Velez was a US citizen, they charged her with assaulting an ICE office. Velez is 4’11 and weighs about 85 pounds.

+ The LAPD officers seen in the videos of Velez’s abduction by ICE were only on the scene because someone had called 9-11 to report a kidnapping.

+ Iris Dayana Monterroso-Lemus was five months pregnant when she was arrested and abducted by ICE and sent to the Richwood Correctional Center in Louisiana, even though she’d committed no crime that needed “correction.” The prison guards refused to give her any prenatal care or an ultrasound, even after she pleaded for help and got sicker and sicker.. She told the prison doctor that she’d felt no fetal movement in days and was experiencing severe abdominal pain. After a steady flow of vaginal discharge for three days, she was finally hospitalized and kept in shackles as she experienced a miscarriage:

When I was delivering my baby, they didn’t even give me a little privacy. Imagine. A guard was sitting right there, watching me day and night. They even shackled my feet because they thought I might escape. Like I was some criminal. I told them, ‘What you’re doing to me isn’t right.’

+ 55-year-old Sae Joon Park, a Green Card holder and Purple Heart recipient, was forced to self-deport to South Korea, after living in the US for almost 50 years, during which time he served in the US Army, got shot in the back in combat, and spent years battling PTSD and addiction. The reason ICE came after him? A drug possession charge from 15 years ago. ” I can’t believe that this is happening in America,” Park told NPR in an interview before his departure. “That blows me away, like a country that I fought for.”

+ A deaf and mute Mongolian man named Bay, who was seeking asylum in the US, has spent more than 80 days at an ICE facility. During that time, he has not had an opportunity to see a judge or communicate with anyone who understands Mongolian Sign Language, according to his sister.

+ ICE raided a house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, abducted a family and deported them to Brazil, including a two-year-old girl, who is a US citizen. The girl suffers from chronic health issues and is now considered a “non-citizen” in Brazil, where she has no rights to medical treatments under Brazil’s public health care system, and can’t enroll in daycare or school. She’s living in the country on a temporary visa that will expire in a few weeks, at which point she could be deported back to the US without her parents.

+ Bob, a 36-year-old from Brazil told Brandon Tauszik of Mother Jones: “What’s been going on in LA is we’ve just been seeing a lot of people come in and just ripping people out in a very intense way…rounding them up, like fucking stray dogs.”

+ LA City Councilman Hugo Soto-Martinez said this week that ICE showed up at a domestic violence shelter, looking to snatch the abused, not the abusers…

+ In 1988, Johnny Noviello was 10 years old when he moved from Canada to Daytona Beach with his family. He grew up in Florida and eventually obtained his green card, becoming a legal permanent resident of the United States. In May, he was detained by ICE after DHS revoked his green card, citing a drug offense from 2017. On Monday, Noviello was found dead in his cell at the Federal Detention Center in Miami, where he’d been incarcerated for the last six weeks, awaiting deportation to Canada. He was 49 years old. Noviello is the tenth person to die in ICE custody since Trump assumed office.

+ Sixty-seven-year-old Maddona Kashanian came to the US from Iran on a student Visa in 1978. After graduating from college and the Iranian Revolution, she applied for asylum. Her request was denied, but immigration officials granted her the right to remain in the US as long as she obeyed US laws and made regular check-ups with her immigration officers. In nearly 50 years, Kashanian never missed an appointment or was charged with a crime.

Then, last week, Kashanian was at her home, working in her garden, when three unmarked vehicles pulled up in front of her house. Masked men got out and arrested Kashanian. She was tossed in the back of a pickup truck and taken to a local jail in Hancock County, Mississippi, where she spent the night. The next day, she was rendered to the South Louisiana ICE facility in Basile. Why was this harmless woman targeted? Because she’s Iranian at a moment when Trump was waging war on Iran.

+ George Retes was pulled over by ICE as he was driving near the violent raid on farm workers outside of Camarillo last Thursday. The ICE agents broke the windows of his car and pepper sprayed him, before taking him into custody. Retes is an American citizen and disabled US Army Veteran. He was held in federal lockup for four days , during which time his family and lawyer had no way of contacting him to find out where he was or inquire about his physical condition. He was released without charges on Sunday night. Is this what Thomas Homan meant when he told FoxNews that ICE can stop people based on their skin-color and “briefly” detain them without a warrant or probably cause until ICE is satisfied they’re American citizens?

+ George Retes: “Clearly it didn’t matter that I was a citizen, or a veteran, or that I identified who I was. They ignored everything I said, and they just they broke my window and they dragged me out. I let them know that I was a veteran and I wasn’t doing anything wrong, that I’m just trying to get to work.”

+ Reporter: Congressman, do you care if U.S. citizens accidentally get detained in ICE raids?

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC): “No, I’m not concerned about that.”

+ A 35-year-old Irish tourist to the US had overstayed his visa by three days, when he was arrested by ICE, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration. Although he’d agreed to immediate deportation, he somehow he got buried in the system or lack thereof and was moved around to three different facilities after Trump took office. Because the detention centers were now overflowing, Trump’s ICE made a deal to lease prison beds from the Bureau of Prisons in Atlanta, where he was sent with dozens of other unfortunate souls abducted by the masked secret police. He languished there for more than three months in conditions he described as inhumane. Bunkbeds lacked ladders, the cells were teeming with mice and cockroaches, the prison clothes he was given were stained with shit and blood. The toilets didn’t flush, he was denied medication and doctor visits and fed “disgusting slop.” When he finally got his medicine, the prison guards threw it on the ground instead of handing it to him. “We were treated less than human.” After finally being released in March, he was deported to Ireland and banned from entering the US (where he’d come to visit his girlfriend) for 10 years.

+ A man posing as a bondsman rang the doorbell of a house in Arlington, Virginia near midnight. He began asking strange and misleading questions about the residents’ mother before pulling out a gun and forcing his way into the house. The man flashed a letter from ICE, but showed no ID or badge. He rummaged through the house, broke into a bedroom, threw a young woman and her uncle Orlando on the bed and asked for ID. He then handcuffed Orlando, who had been living in the US working construction for 20 years, marched him to his car, sedated him, and drove him around for several hours until the ICE office in Chantilly, Virginia to open. Orlando was deported a couple of days later to Honduras before the family could even contact a lawyer.

+ The ICE agents who abducted her husband, Darwin Contreras, in a courthouse in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, wore “something you can get from Walmart,” said Elizabeth DeJesus. They didn’t say who they were or where they were taking him.

Darwin came to the US from El Salvador 20 years ago in search of his mother when he was seven years old. He was detained at the border instead and spent several years in foster care. Eventually, he was reunited with his mother and they moved to Bethlehem. He was a track star in high school and won a presidential fitness award from Barack Obama.

Since graduating, he has kept steady work and married an American citizen. He was nabbed by ICE after a routine court appearance. DeJesus says that Darwin is suffering mentally and physically while in ICE custody, awaiting a hearing: “When he got there, he was not adjusting well. He was not ok. His mental health was not good.”

+ Miguel Angel Ponce, a 33-year-old U.S. citizen born in College Station, Texas, was grabbed by ICE, handcuffed and detained for more than 2 hours. “I felt kidnapped,” he said. “They just put me in handcuffs and took me to another location.” The ICE agents said he “looked like” someone they were looking for—told him to “shave your beard” to avoid future arrest.

+ Will Kim came to the US from South Korea when he was five years old. He’s had a Green Card as a lawful permanent resident of the US for many years. Currently, Kim is a PhD student at Texas A&M, where he’s researching a vaccine for Lyme disease. Last week, he was detained at San Francisco International Airport. The feds have offered no reason for his arrest and have denied Kim access to his attorney, Eric Lee. Kim was allowed only a single brief call to his mother. The only blemish on his record is a minor marijuana possession charge, which was settled in a diversion program and should have been expunged. “My client Will Kim has a green card, grew up in the US, became a scientist & is researching Lyme disease vaccines,” Eric Lee wrote on Twitter. “He has spent more than 7 days in a CBP airport detention ctr w/ no daylight, sleeping in a chair, no access to a lawyer. Another brutal attack on immigrants & science. Free Will!”

+ Jon Luke Evans, the only black police officer in the town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine, was detained by ICE after he attempted to purchase a gun for his job. After Evans’s arrest, Patricia Hyde, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston office, smugly quipped: “The fact that a police department would hire an illegal alien and unlawfully issue him a firearm while on duty would be comical if it weren’t so tragic.” But Evans isn’t an illegal alien. He has a valid work permit that doesn’t expire until March 2030 and Maine is one of the states that allows immigrants to work as police officers. “We rely on the Department of Homeland Security’s E-Verify program to ensure we are meeting our obligations,” said the town’s Police Chief Elise Chard. “We are distressed and deeply concerned about this apparent error on the part of the federal government.”

+ Kenny Laynez is an 18-year-old American citizen living in Palm Beach, Florida. On his way to work on a landscaping crew, Kenny’s van was pulled over ICE, because he “looked like an illegal.[sic]” His mother, who is not a US citizen, was driving. Kenny was yanked from the van and held for more than 6 hours by ICE, after providing proof of his citizenship. During the arrest, Kenny’s cellphone recorded the giddy, juvenile banter of the ICE agents:

Agent 1: You got hit?

Agent 2: Nah, didn’t get hit, bro.

Agent 1: Oh, okay.

Agent 2: No, once she got the proper spread on, she was gone.

Agent: 1: You are funny, bro.

Agent 2: It was funny.

(Agents laughing.)

Agent 1: They’re starting to resist more now.

Agent 2: We’re going to end up shooting someone. If it keeps going like this because they’re going to end up fighting.

Agent 1: This kid goes like, this guy here: “You can’t do this. I’m not doing shit.”

Agent 2: We told you already to get out. You either get out or I am going to pull you out.

Agent 1: Right. Yeah.

Agent 2: God damn! Wow!

Agent 1: Nice!

Agent 2: Just remember, you can smell that with a $30,000 bonus.

Agent 1: Yeah! (agents laugh)

+ Jose Osman Gutierrez has been working for more than 7 years to support his family in Houston, Texas. He had no criminal criminal record when ICE raided his home at 7:13 in morning, with four young children inside. He was grabbed, roughed up and hauled off by the neck, eventually losing consciousness. All of this happening in front of his wife, Jennifer Garcia, who is 9 months pregnant. Jennifer, distraught at the prospect of giving birth alone to her fifth child, was pushed and shoved by ICE officers as she pleaded for her husband. As Jennifer crumpled to the street, her children and neighbors screamed: “She’s nine months pregnant! Call a doctor!!”

+ ICE “targeted” a female priest for expedited removal. Yeonsoo Go is a South Korean national with a valid visa that does not expire until December 2025. She spent most of her life working to protect the rights of Korean immigrants—and was the first woman ordained by the Anglican Church of Korea. “I never imagined my own family would end up being a target of Trump,” Yeonsoo said.

“She’s staying at 26 Federal Plaza, which, as we know, is not actually a facility that has showers or beds or hot food. And so the detentions here are not only illegal, but they’re immoral,” said Rev. Matthew Heyd.

+ According to a new suit filed in the federal court for the Middle District of Louisiana, ICE illegally deported three children who are US citizens along with their noncitizen family members, including a two-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy with Stage Four kidney cancer. The children and their families were abducted by ICE in April when they showed up for scheduled hearings with immigration officials. The children were immediately separated from their families and denied contact with their parents or lawyers before they were deported to Honduras. The four-year-old cancer patient’s mother was not even allowed the opportunity to tell ICE officials about his perilous condition or arrange for his ongoing chemotherapy treatments.

+ Just days after a federal appeals court upheld a ban on ICE using roving patrols and racial profiling to target immigrants, Trump’s secret police launched Operation Trojan Horse, a shock raid outside of a Home Dept in the Westlake area of Los Angeles. Posing as building contractors, ICE agents drove a yellow Penske van in front of a group of day laborers at 6:44 in the morning, asking in Spanish if any of them were looking for work. Then masked ICE agents, one of them wearing a cowboy hat, jumped out of the van and began grabbing people. In all, 16 men were arrested and taken into ICE custody in defiance of a federal appeals court.

+ Guess which person was charged with felony assault in this photo of an ICE agent hauling away a 4’10” woman, an American citizen abducted on her way to work in LA’s garment district…?

+ ICE is arresting white people for filming them arresting non-white people. Dan Mathers, a US citizen in Florida, had been filming an ICE raid from a safe distance with a large row of hedges between them. He was not in any position to interfere with the raid. Mathers said he told one of the ICE agents that he “was short and it hurt his feelings.” Offended by the tweak about his height, the pumped-up ICE agent yelled, “You threatening me?” And then threw Mathers to the ground, arrested him and kept him in ICE custody for more than 10 hours, where he was prevented from contacting his family until 2:00 am the following morning.

+ We’ve gone beyond the “Show us your papers!” phase of intimidation, because your even your legal papers won’t save you and your children from being arrested, thrown in a sordid jail and deported for no logical reason at all…Consider the case of Sarah Shaw, a Washington mother from New Zealand who has legal residency in the US and works for the state, who was detained along with her 6-year-old son by ICE when she tried to re-enter the US from Vancouver, BC, after a trip to New Zealand to escort her two older children with their parents. Despite showing immigration officials her valid work visa, ICE claimed Shaw had overstayed her travel visa and shipped her and her child to the Dilley Detention Center in Texas. DHS officials ignored Shaw’s repeated pleas to allow her son, who has a valid travel visa, to enter the US.

For the past three years, Shaw has worked as a youth counselor in a juvenile detention facility run by the Washington State Department of Children. She has no criminal record.

Shaw’s attorney Minda Thorward: “Sarah is a survivor. She’s a fighter. She’s really strong. But she’s also very stressed out about all of this. She’s repeatedly requested that her son be released, even at the border DHS refused to permit that. So his detention is unlawful. He should not be there. He should not be in removal proceedings. None of that should be happening…There’s no reason to detain her. She has no criminal history. She simply made a paperwork mistake.”

+ Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz, a student at Reseda High School in LA, was walking his dog in his Van Nuys neighborhood when he was grabbed by ICE, thrown to the ground and abducted. ICE officers first tied his dog to a tree. Then they cut the leash and let it run loose along one of the LA’s most heavily trafficked roads, Sepulva Boulevard.

Cellphone videos of Benjamin’s arrest record the agents joking about the $2,500 bonuses they’ll receive for nabbing a teenager without any criminal record: “Thanks to him, we get to drink this weekend!”

Benjamin has lived in LA for more than three years with his single-parent mother and is a caretaker for both his six-year-old brother and his twin five-month-old brothers. According to his legal representative, Benjamin is currently “cramped in a holding cell with about 50 others… He is cold, scared, and one of the youngest there.” Meanwhile, his mother is distraught and too afraid to leave her apartment.

+ Masked ICE agents hit a landscaper in Beverly Hills with a taser and pepper spray. Cell phone video shows the man screaming in agony as agents roughly arrest him.

“I couldn’t see what was happening – I just could hear a man screaming ‘my eyes, my eyes!’” a witness said. Another bystander can be heard asking, “What did you taze him for? Why are you doing that?”

The man’s family members say ICE abducted and abused the wrong man, since the lawn maintenance worker has no criminal history. They showed no warrants. They just descended on the neighborhood, assaulted him, abducted him and left.

+ ICE has arrested and is trying to quickly depart Arman Momand, a Virginia High School student, who has a special visa reserved for Afghan families that aided the US military during the occupation of Afghanistan. According to Momand’s lawyer, “It’s a very, very difficult visa to get. It’s reserved for people who—at their own peril—assisted the American military in our operations.” Momand was seized by ICE agents at a court hearing on a December 2024 driving incident that was resolved by the court as a misdemeanor, a mere infraction that should not have affected his visa status and eligibility to stay in the US with his family. Instead, ICE plans to deport him just weeks before classes start at J.R. Tucker High School in Henrico, Virginia. Deportation back to Afghanistan will almost certainly put the young man’s life in jeopardy.

+ Lopez Benitez, a native of Paraguay, is a construction worker in Queens who has lived in the US for two years with his sister, both of whom are US citizens. He applied for asylum and has regularly attended his required immigration meetings. He has no criminal record. Yet when he showed up for a scheduled immigration hearing, he was grabbed by masked federal agents and pulled away from his family.ICE agents violently knocked to the ground one of Benitez’s sisters during his abduction. He was taken to the ICE processing center at Federal Plaza in Manhattan and held in a room without a bed, access to a shower, or a change of clothes for three days. Then he was shipped halfway across the country to the ICE detention center in Conroe, Texas. Benitez and his family weren’t told why he was detained for more than a week.

This week, federal Judge Dale Ho ordered ICE to return Benitez to New York and then release him from custody. In his ruling, Ho castigated the government for arresting lawful immigrants during or after court hearings. Ho writes that the Trump administration has turned attendance at immigration court proceedings into a game of “detention roulette” that violates due process.

+ Back in April, Jesús Escalona Mújicas was on his way to his job at a construction site when he was pulled over by federal immigration officers and Texas police in a joint raid near Bryant, Texas. Escalona Mújicas, a 48-year-old native of Venezuela, was pressed against his car as his hands were bent behind his back and cuffed. He was taken to a neaby gas station where he was interrogated. He was then arrested and thrown in the immigration detention jail (aka, “Processing Center”) in Conroe, Texas. The officers who arrested him claimed to have a deportation order for Escalona Mújicas based on the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump had recently invoked to speed up deportations of alleged gang members from central and south America. An agent told him: “the President does not want to see Haitians, Nicaraguans, Cubans, or Venezuelans here.” Escalona Mújicas protested that he wasn’t a gang member and had a temporary work visa. But his denials were smugly dismissed by the arresting agents.

Soon after his arrest, ICE sent out a press release including a photo of Escalona Mújicas in handcuffs, wearing a John Deere sweatshirt with the caption: “documented Tren de Aragua gang member.” But the arrest report didn’t even get Escalona Mújicas’s nationality right, claiming that he was “an alien of El Salvadorian origin without legal status in the United States.” So it’s no surprise that they falsely arrested and then publicly smeared him as a “Tren de Aragua gang member,” even though his name was not listed in the admittedly problematic (for false positives) TxGANG database. What was the evidence the Trump administration used to as proof of Escalona Mújicas’s gang affliation? His Air Jordans.

In fact, Escalona Mújicas had no criminal history and had never heard of the Tren de Aragua gang until he got to the United States. When he lived in Venezuela, he worked as a forklift operator at Empresas Polar, the Venezuealan subsidary of Pepsi. Escalona Mújicas was deported back to Venezuela in May, but the Trump administration hasn’t rescinded its false accusation that he is a gang member, a slander that may well keep him from immigrating to any other country.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/teargassedbaby.png,N,,2026-01-01 13:56:56.436405

The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees’ behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that it would no longer cover “chemical and surgical modification of an individual’s sex traits through medical interventions” in health insurance programs for federal employees and US Postal Service workers.

The complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.

“This policy is not about cost or care – it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,” the Human Rights Campaign Foundation president, Kelley Robinson, said in a statement announcing the move.

The complaint, filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, includes testimonies from four current federal workers at the state department, health and human services and the postal service who would be directly affected by the elimination of coverage.

For instance, the postal service employee has a daughter whose doctors recommended that she get puberty blockers and potentially hormone replacement therapy for her diagnosed gender dysphoria, which would not be covered under the new OPM policy, according to the complaint.

The complaint notes that the workers are making the claim on behalf of themselves and a “class of similarly situated federal employees”.

The Trump administration has taken other steps to restrict care for transgender Americans, particularly minors. In December, the US Department of Health and Human Services released proposals that would block gender-affirming care to minors, including a policy that would bar Medicare and Medicaid dollars to hospitals that provide such care to children.

Senior Trump officials, such as the health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, call gender-affirming care “malpractice” for minors. But such restrictions go against recommendations from major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e4d439fd7406e53f25d80dba0a0ad61c2a3a59c/0_0_2597_2077/master/2597.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0540048db7c29f736c0a194f0018735a",N,,2026-01-01 12:56:49.442313

RELATED: Minneapolis store worker says she faces harassment after DHS fraud video

Legal experts said it is unusual for law enforcement agencies to publicly post active investigations on social media.

One video posted by DHS shows agents visiting the Burnsville Learning Center with a caption claiming agents are investigating “rampant childcare and other fraud.”

RELATED: Trump administration says it’s freezing child care funds to Minnesota after series of fraud schemes

The owner of the Burnsville Learning Center spoke with us off camera and denied any wrongdoing, saying his business is legitimate.

According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services licensing records, the daycare has an active license and four past violations. The most recent violation, issued in June, cited cleaning and safety issues. State records do not show any allegations of fraud against the daycare.

Another DHS video, also viewed more than two million times, shows agents questioning a worker at a Burnsville tobacco shop. DHS labeled the location a “suspected fraud site.”

However, the employee said the store was not the target of the investigation and that agents were asking questions about a different business next door.

“I didn’t do anything,” said employee Zeina Alhmaidi. “Why do I have to go through someone else’s problem?”

Immigration attorney Gloria Contreras Edin, based in St. Paul, reviewed the DHS videos.

“I’m going to just be very real and direct. It looks like racial profiling and targeting. It looks like officers are making generalized accusations,” Contreras Edin said. “There are no warrants, no subpoenas, and they haven’t stated any articulable suspicion about why they’re doing what they’re doing.”

When asked whether the federal government could face legal responsibility if people experience threats after being featured in the social media videos, Contreras Edin said the practice could expose DHS to liability.

“Posting enforcement on social media is not just unprofessional, it creates a liability,” she said. “Remember that these videos are now what we call discoverable. This is evidence and it locks it in. It’s going to show their intent, pattern and practice, lack of probable cause and you know that the agency endorsed it.”

Contreras Edin noted that while DHS can legally post these videos, doing so could preserve evidence that may later be used in court.

“You want your enforcement and investigative work to be private. In general, law enforcement is not out there publicizing the investigation of an individual here,” Contreras Edin said.

We reached out to the Department of Homeland Security four times since Monday, asking how businesses are identified as suspected fraud sites, what evidence supports those claims, and why these interactions are posted online.

On Tuesday, DHS began blurring the faces of people questioned in its social media videos.

Dec 31 (Reuters) – Republican President Donald Trump’s administration has announced a freeze on child day care payments to Democratic-led Minnesota, ramping up what the state’s governor had characterized as a political confrontation over immigration and allegations of widespread fraud in social services ‍programs.

“The funds are frozen until the state proves taxpayer dollars are being spent legitimately and in accordance with the law,” Trump’s Health and Human Services Department said on Wednesday in an email to Reuters.

The department did not respond to a Reuters request for details about how much money had been blocked. Assistant Secretary Alex Adams, who oversees the department’s Administration for Children and Families, referred on social media to $185 million in annual child ‌care funds for Minnesota, the amount the state received in the last fiscal ‌year, according to agency records.

GOVERNOR SAYS STATE HAS CRACKED DOWN ON FRAUD

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, said on X that Trump was “using an issue he doesn’t give a damn about as an excuse to hurt working Minnesotans.”

“We’ve spent years cracking down on fraudsters,” Walz added on X.

The Trump administration has in recent ​weeks focused on Minnesota as it says rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system. Administration officials have frequently and sharply criticized the state’s Somali community, the largest in the ‍country, as well as Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential ​nominee, and Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali American who represents a ​Minneapolis-based district in Congress.

Trump repeated such rhetoric on Truth Social on Wednesday, a day after Deputy HHS Secretary ‍Jim O’Neill posted on social media about the day care funding freeze.

FBI DEPLOYED PERSONNEL TO MINNESOTA

U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz issued an ultimatum this month, calling on Walz to address what he said was systemic fraud in the state’s Medicaid system.

“We are done footing the bill for your incompetence,” Oz said.

The FBI has deployed personnel and investigative resources to Minnesota to “dismantle ‍large-scale fraud schemes exploiting federal programs,” Director Kash Patel said on Sunday on social media.

Before Tuesday’s announcement, CMS had said in a December 5 letter it would require corrective measures within 60 days. In a ‍letter to Walz, Oz said ‍Minnesota must provide his agency with weekly updates, freeze high-risk provider enrollment, ​verify existing providers, and submit a plan to prevent future fraud, or face ​federal ⁠funding cuts.

The Trump administration has tried to block a wide range of ‌federal aid this year to pressure states to comply with its immigration crackdown, including disaster aid and transportation funding. Many of those attempts have been struck down in court, including an effort that sought to ban some immigrant children from preschool programs. The administration has successfully slashed foreign aid, diversity grants and other types of funding.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The number of small boat crossings are shameful and the British people deserve better.","A total of 41,472 migrants arrived in the UK in 2025 after crossing the Channel on a small boat - the second-highest annual figure on record.

No migrants made the journey on New Year's Eve, the Home Office confirmed on Thursday, with the last recorded crossing made on 22 December.

It means the overall number of arrivals last year ended up 9% below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.

The total for 2025 was 13% higher than in 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the journey, and 41% higher than 2023's total of 29,437.

The first half of 2025 saw 19,982 people arrive, a record number in that period.

However, that pace slowed during the last two months of the year and there were long periods when no migrants arrived, including a 28-day run from 15 November to 12 December.

There was an average of 62 people per small boat that arrived in 2025, which is up from 53 in 2024 and 49 in 2023.

Charities estimate that at least 36 people died trying to make the journey last year, including an eight-year-old girl and her mother, who were crushed on a boat in May, the Mirror reports.

The number of arrivals in 2025 has heaped pressure on Sir Keir Starmer's government, having entered office in July 2024 with a repeated vow to ""smash the gangs"" and reduce the number of crossings. Almost 65,000 migrants have arrived since then.

The UK's Border Security Commander, Martin Hewitt, tasked with curbing Channel crossings, told MPs in October that the number of arrivals in 2025 was ""frustrating"" but that work to stop the smuggling route was ""always going to take time"".

The government has also introduced and announced changes to legislation in a bid to stop Channel crossings, including:

The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act, which became law in December, that introduces new criminal offences and allows law enforcement agencies to use counter terror-style powers to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.

Plans for what Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has described as ""the most significant changes to our asylum system in modern times"" in a bid to deter people from coming to the UK and make it easier to deport them.

Making refugee status temporary, with regular reviews of the safety of the person's home country, and a wait of 20 years for permanent status.

But the government faces a fight once again with its own MPs to get those measures through, with some Labour parliamentarians branding the measures ""shameful"" and echoing the rhetoric of Nigel Farage's Reform UK.

Meanwhile, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the measures did not go far enough, adding that leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was necessary to address the problem.

Both the Conservatives and Reform UK have pressed for quitting the human rights treaty as a way to tackle illegal immigration, but the Labour government has insisted it will not leave the ECHR and instead seeks to adjust how immigration cases are interpreted in UK law.

Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy met ministers from ECHR member states last month, who agreed to consider reforming the treaty to address illegal migration.

International cooperation has also formed part of the government's strategy, such as through the ""one in, one out"" returns deal with France that came into force in August.

On 16 December, border security minister Alex Norris told peers that 193 migrants had been sent back to France and 195 had arrived in the UK under the returns deal so far.

But the scheme has drawn criticism as being ""no deterrent at all"" by shadow home secretary Chris Philp, amid cases of two migrants returning to the UK after being removed to France under the deal, who were then deported again.

Reacting to the total number of Channel crossings for 2025, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage wrote on X: ""Smash the gangs is a complete disaster. One in, one out is a farce and the numbers have been huge. Many of the young men that arrived last year will do us great harm.""

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: ""Most men, women and children taking these journeys have fled oppressive regimes like the Taliban in Afghanistan and brutal civil wars in countries like Sudan.

""No-one risks their life on a flimsy boat in the Channel except out of desperation to be safe in a country where they have family or community connections.

""It's right the government wants to stop Channel crossings but plans that will punish people found to be refugees are unfair and not an effective deterrent.""

He added that there needs to be a ""multi-pronged approach"", including targeting gangs and international cooperation to ensure refugees can access safe and legal routes - something Ms Mahmood has included in plans to overhaul the asylum system.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The number of small boat crossings are shameful and the British people deserve better.

""This government is taking action. We have removed almost 50,000 people who were here illegally, and our historic deal with the French means those who arrive on small boats are now being sent back.

""The Home Secretary has announced the most sweeping reforms to tackle illegal migration in decades, removing the incentives that bring illegal migrants to the UK and scaling up the return of those with no right to be here.""",https://e3.365dm.com/25/11/1600x900/skynews-small-boats-channel_7082809.jpg?20251115172058,N,,2026-01-01 10:57:39.292154

Trump, a Republican, has said troop deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Memphis and Portland were necessary to fight crime and protect federal property and personnel from protesters.
“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” Trump wrote.

Local leaders in those cities and Democrats have said the deployments, which have faced legal challenges, were unnecessary. They have accused the Trump administration of federal overreach and of exaggerating isolated episodes of violence at mostly peaceful protests to justify sending in troops.

Trump, a Republican, has said troop deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Memphis and Portland were necessary to fight crime and protect federal property and personnel from protesters.

“We are removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles, and Portland, despite the fact that CRIME has been greatly reduced by having these great Patriots in those cities, and ONLY by that fact,” Trump wrote.

“We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again – Only a question of time!”

Judges overseeing lawsuits filed by cities challenging the deployments have consistently ruled that the Trump administration overstepped its authority and found that there is no evidence to support claims that troops are necessary to protect federal property from protesters.

The U.S. Supreme Court on December 23 blocked Trump’s attempt to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois, a ruling that undercut his legal rationale for sending soldiers to other states.

The court said the president’s authority to take federal control of National Guard troops likely only applies in “exceptional” circumstances.

“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the court’s majority held in an unsigned order.

Trump started deploying troops in June amid protests against his hardline immigration policies including efforts to ramp up deportations. He also deployed troops to Washington and took control of local police in response to what he said was rampant crime – though local crime statistics indicated otherwise – using his unique authority as president over the U.S. capital.

And last week, Roberts and the court barred Trump from deploying the National Guard in Chicago to enforce the immigration laws.
Judges blocked it from taking effect, and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the order discriminated based on nationality.
A year later, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and upheld Trump’s order in a 5-4 ruling.
Instead, it has repeatedly lifted injunctions that blocked Trump’s policies from taking effect.","The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., ended the first year of President Trump’s second term with a record of rulings that gave him much broader power to control the federal government.

In a series of fast-track decisions, the justices granted emergency appeals and set aside rulings from district judges who blocked Trump’s orders from taking effect.

With the court’s approval, the administration dismissed thousands of federal employees, cut funding for education and health research grants, dismantled the agency that funds foreign aid and cleared the way for the U.S. military to reject transgender troops.

But the court also put two important checks on the president’s power.

In April, the court twice ruled — including in a post-midnight order — that the Trump administration could not secretly whisk immigrants out of the country without giving them a hearing before a judge.

Upon taking office, Trump claimed migrants who were alleged to belong to “foreign terrorist” gangs could be arrested as “enemy aliens” and flown secretly to a prison in El Salvador.

Roberts and the court blocked such secret deportations and said the 5th Amendment entitles immigrants, like citizens, a right to “due process of law.” Many of the arrested men had no criminal records and said they never belonged to a criminal gang.

Those who face deportation “are entitled to notice and opportunity to challenge their removal,” the justices said in Trump vs. J.G.G.

They also required the government to “facilitate” the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had been wrongly deported to El Salvador. He is now back in Maryland with his wife, but may face further criminal charges or efforts to deport him.

And last week, Roberts and the court barred Trump from deploying the National Guard in Chicago to enforce the immigration laws.

Trump had claimed he had the power to defy state governors and deploy the Guard troops in Los Angeles, Portland, Ore., Chicago and other Democratic-led states and cities.

The Supreme Court disagreed over dissents from conservative Justices Samuel A. Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch.

For much of the year, however, Roberts and the five other conservatives were in the majority ruling for Trump. In dissent, the three liberal justices said the court should stand aside for now and defer to district judges.

In May, the court agreed that Trump could end the Biden administration’s special temporary protections extended to more than 350,000 Venezuelans as well as an additional 530,000 migrants who arrived legally from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua or Venezuela.

It was easier to explain why the new administration’s policies were cruel and disruptive rather than why they were illegal.

Trump’s lawyers argued that the law gave the president’s top immigration officials the sole power to decide on these temporary protections and that “no judicial review” was authorized.

Nonetheless, a federal judge in San Francisco twice blocked the administration’s repeal of the temporary protected status for Venezuelans, and a federal judge in Boston blocked the repeal of the entry-level parole granted to migrants under Biden.

The court is also poised to uphold the president’s power to fire officials who have been appointed for fixed terms at independent agencies.

Since 1887, when Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates, the government has had semi-independent boards and commissions led by a mix of Republicans and Democrats.

But Roberts and the court’s conservatives believe that because these agencies enforce the law, they come under the president’s “executive power.”

That ruling may come with an exception for the Federal Reserve Board, an independent agency whose nonpartisan stability is valued by business leaders.

Georgetown Law Professor David Cole, the former legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the court has sent mixed signals.

“On the emergency docket, it has ruled consistently for the president, with some notable exceptions,” he said. “I do think it significant that it put a halt to the National Guard deployments and to the Alien Enemies Act deportations, at least for the time being. And I think by this time next year, it’s possible that the court will have overturned two of Trump’s signature initiatives — the birthright citizenship executive order and the tariffs.”

For much of 2025, the court was criticized for handing down temporary unsigned orders with little or no explanation.

That practice arose in 2017 in response to Trump’s use of executive orders to make abrupt, far-reaching changes in the law. In response, Democratic state attorneys and lawyers for progressive groups sued in friendly forums such as Seattle, San Francisco and Boston and won rulings from district judges who put Trump’s policies on hold.

The 2017 “travel ban” announced in Trump’s first week in the White House set the pattern. It suspended the entry of visitors and migrants from Venezuela and seven mostly-Muslim countries on the grounds that those countries had weak vetting procedures.

Judges blocked it from taking effect, and the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the order discriminated based on nationality.

A year later, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case and upheld Trump’s order in a 5-4 ruling. Roberts pointed out that Congress in the immigration laws clearly gave this power to the president. If he “finds that the entry of ... any class of aliens ... would be detrimental,” it says, he may “suspend the entry” of all such migrants for as long as “he shall deem necessary.”

Since then, Roberts and the court’s conservatives have been less willing to stand aside while federal judges hand down nationwide rulings.

Democrats saw the same problem when Biden was president.

In April 2023, a federal judge in west Texas ruled for anti-abortion advocates and decreed that the Food and Drug Administration had wrongly approved abortion pills that can end an early pregnancy. He ordered that they be removed from the market before any appeals could be heard and decided.

The Biden administration filed an emergency appeal. Two weeks later, the Supreme Court set aside the judge’s order, over dissents from Thomas and Alito.

The next year, the court heard arguments and then threw out the entire lawsuit on the grounds that abortion foes did not have standing to sue.

Since Trump returned to the White House, the court’s conservative majority has not deferred to district judges. Instead, it has repeatedly lifted injunctions that blocked Trump’s policies from taking effect.

Although these are not final rulings, they are strong signs that the administration will prevail.

But Trump’s early wins do not mean he will win on some of his most disputed policies.

In November, the justices sounded skeptical of Trump’s claim that a 1977 trade law, which did not mention tariffs, gave him the power to set these import taxes on products coming from around the world.

In the spring, the court will hear Trump’s claim that he can change the principle of birthright citizenship set in the 14th Amendment and deny citizenship it to newborns whose parents are here illegally or entered as visitors.

Rulings on both cases will be handed down by late June.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04000d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6992x3671+0+497/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2a%2F70%2F3c1d3a704e73b85b4c22b195aae8%2F2203860796.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 06:12:13.243038

A Washington Post report indicated the Trump Administration was seeking contractors for a processing site in Hagerstown for 500 to 1,500 beds for immigration detainees.

U.S. Rep. April McClain Delaney expressed outrage at the report and pledged to oppose any such facility.

McClain Delaney is demanding transparency from DHS and ICE and plans to use congressional oversight to investigate the proposal.

Hagerstown and Washington County governments said this week they are unaware of federal government plans for an immigration detention facility in the Hagerstown area.

The Washington Post reported on Dec. 24 that the Trump Administration is seeking contractors for a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time, according to a draft solicitation The Post reviewed.

The plan includes processing sites where newly arrested detainees would be booked into for a few weeks before being sent to one of seven large-scale warehouses that could each hold 5,000 to 10,000 people — a staging area for deportation, according to Post reporting.

Among the sites The Post listed where the federal government is looking to establish a processing site, with 500 to 1,500 beds, is Hagerstown, Maryland.

It was not clear if that means within the city limits or the greater Hagerstown area.

The Post reported that a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said she ""cannot confirm"" The Post's reporting and declined to answer questions about the warehouse plan.

The Herald-Mail emailed ICE, on Dec. 30, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, on Dec. 31, inquiring about The Post's report, but had not heard back by press time.

The State of Maryland already has three state prisons off Roxbury Road south of Hagerstown. The Washington County Sheriff's Office has a detention center off Western Maryland Parkway near Hagerstown's West End.

Hagerstown government responds to Post report about planned immigration facility

The City of Hagerstown, on Dec. 30, issued a statement about The Post report, that also was posted on the city's Facebook page.

""The City of Hagerstown is aware of the article published in the Washington Post over the last week naming Hagerstown as a possible site to utilize warehouse space to house those detained on immigration violations. The City of Hagerstown has no awareness of any such plans, and no city staff or city officials has been contacted by the government as to any future plans of utilizing space within Hagerstown for such a purpose.""

Washington County government response regarding potential immigration detention facility

The Herald-Mail reached out to Washington County government, asking if county officials were aware of a plan for an ICE facility in the Hagerstown area.

County spokesperson Danielle Weaver, on Dec. 30, responded via email:

""The County does not comment on US Government/Department of Homeland Security initiatives and is unaware of any actions currently to convert local warehouses for the purposes of immigration detention.""

The following comment from Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., was provided via email on Dec. 31 through Van Hollen's office, regarding the proposed ICE facility in the Hagerstown area.

""The Trump Administration's cruel mass deportation agenda has not focused on 'the worst of the worst,' but instead has swept up thousands of people that DHS admits pose no threat to our communities — including small business owners, community leaders, pastors, and more. Trump's ICE has already been locking up scores of people without respect for their due process rights — and contracting for massive private warehouse prisons marks another step in their assault on our communities. While we need secure borders and across-the-board reform, upholding our immigration laws can and must be done safely, smartly, and humanely — but clearly those are not the priorities of this Administration.""

Congresswoman April McClain Delaney issues statement regarding report of proposed ICE facility in Hagerstown

U.S. Rep. April McClain Delaney, D-6th District, released a statement on Dec. 30 regarding reports of a proposed ICE detention facility in Hagerstown.

""I am outraged by reports that the Trump Administration may be considering the construction of an ICE detention facility in or near Hagerstown. If true, this proposal is unacceptable — and I will fight it with every tool available to me.

""The mass detention of human beings without due process is a profound moral and constitutional failure. Detaining people — like asylum seekers and families — far from legal counsel, their support systems, and meaningful oversight creates a grave risk of unlawful detention and irreversible harm.

""Hagerstown is not a dumping ground for a broken federal system — it is a proud community built on fairness, decency, and the rule of law. I will not quietly accept a facility that threatens civil liberties, undermines due process, and contradicts our values.

""Let me be clear about what I am doing, and what I will continue to do, to stop this:

I am demanding full and immediate transparency from DHS and ICE, including all planning documents, contracts, internal analyses, and communications related to any proposed detention facility in Washington County. There will be no secrecy and no backroom decisions.

I am scheduled to meet with ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations field office in Baltimore in January, where I will conduct my constitutionally required oversight of this facility which has my constituents locked inside.

I will work with colleagues to use aggressive congressional oversight — including formal investigations — to expose any effort to rush this project forward while cutting corners on legality, due process, or human rights.

I will oppose any attempt to detain people without full constitutional protections, and I will challenge policies that normalize prolonged or unlawful detention under the guise of efficiency.

I will stand with community members, faith leaders, advocates, and local governments who are speaking out against this proposal, and I will elevate their voices at every level of the federal government.

""This is about values and who we are, and that begins with protecting our neighbors. A government that detains people in bulk, behind walls and razor wire, without transparency or accountability, is a government that has lost its moral compass.

""I will not allow Hagerstown to become a symbol of that failure. I will fight this proposal publicly, relentlessly, and unapologetically — and I will keep the people of this community informed every step of the way.""","https://www.therecordherald.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/14/PSAY/87274883007-lg-h-sfq-qw.jpeg?crop=1599,900,x0,y106&width=1599&height=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-01 07:56:51.046709

“The town has received no official communication from ICE or any federal agency regarding such a proposal,” the Merrillville Town Council said in a release Wednesday.
“Upon learning of the report, Merrillville officials immediately began reviewing the matter.
Currently, the town has no information confirming the accuracy of the Washington Post report.
This wouldn’t be the first time an immigration detention facility tried to set down roots in Northwest Indiana.","A plan by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport immigrants “like Prime, but with human beings” may include a Merrillville location — to the town’s complete surprise.

Town officials have been seeking clarification from federal sources since they got wind of a Washington Post article that ran on Christmas Eve saying the Trump administration “is seeking contractors to help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time.” Its plan, based on an unfinalized document the paper obtained, is to “speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system.”

“Newly arrested detainees would be booked into processing sites for a few weeks before being funneled into one of seven large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 people each, where they would be staged for deportation,” the Washington Post article said. “The large warehouses would be located close to major logistics hubs in Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, Arizona, Georgia and Missouri. Sixteen smaller warehouses would hold up to 1,500 people each.

“The new facilities will ‘maximize efficiency, minimize costs, shorten processing times, limit lengths of stay, accelerate the removal process and promote the safety, dignity and respect for all in ICE custody,’ the solicitation said. ICE plans to share it with private detention companies this week to gauge interest and refine the plan, according to an internal email reviewed by The Post.”

While not mentioned in the article outright, Merrillville was included and named in a graphic published with it. The revelation, however, came as a complete shock, town officials said.

“The town has received no official communication from ICE or any federal agency regarding such a proposal,” the Merrillville Town Council said in a release Wednesday. “Upon learning of the report, Merrillville officials immediately began reviewing the matter. Currently, the town has no information confirming the accuracy of the Washington Post report.

“Officials will keep the community informed as verified information becomes available.”

Council President Rick Bella, D-5, told the Post-Tribune that he believes Merrillville was included only as a “possible” location and not as an official one.

“It’s kind of like people who mention to us a possible Data Center: It’s just talk until something more formal happens,” Bella said.

Officials downstate also appeared to have been kept in the dark about any processing center plans for Northwest Indiana. Governor Mike Braun’s spokesman Griffin Reid said he had inquiries out on the matter, but did not respond by deadline.

This wouldn’t be the first time an immigration detention facility tried to set down roots in Northwest Indiana. Florida-based GEO Group in 2016 saw its plans for an $80 million private immigration detention center in Gary go up in smoke after nine months of wooing because at least six council members opposed it, the Post-Tribune previously reported.

GEO operates similar detention facilities across the country and some have drawn fire from human rights supporters and the ACLU over the treatment of immigrants. In response, GEO officials say some of the claims have been inflated by activists and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency holds its detention centers to high standards and procedures that are regularly audited.

Although no plans were ever revealed, GEO owns a 40-acre site in Hobart on West 49th Avenue where strident opposition from residents and city officials continues. GEO still owns the property.

ICE held more than 68,000 people at the beginning of this month, agency data shows, the highest number on record, according to the Washington Post article. Nearly half, or 48 percent of these people, have no criminal convictions or pending criminal charges, ICE data shows.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE acting director Todd M. Lyons said at a border security conference in April, according to the Arizona Mirror. He would prefer the deportation process operate “like Prime, but with human beings.”

Adelina Pruneda, an ICE Public Affairs Officer out of Central & South Texas, was on vacation and did not return a request for comment.

And in both instances officers allegedly retrieved Venegas' Alabama-issued REAL ID from his pocket but claimed it could be fake.

But that's what the federal government has accomplished with the REAL ID, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now considers unreliable, even though getting one requires providing proof of citizenship or lawful status in the country.

In a December 11 court filing, Philip Lavoie, the acting assistant special agent in charge of DHS' Mobile, Alabama, office, stated that, ""REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""

Lavoie's declaration was in response to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed in October by the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm, on behalf of Leo Garcia Venegas, an Alabama construction worker. Venegas was detained twice in May and June during immigration raids on private construction sites, despite being a U.S. citizen. In both instances, Venegas' lawsuit says, masked federal immigration officers entered the private sites without a warrant and began detaining workers based solely on their apparent ethnicity.

And in both instances officers allegedly retrieved Venegas' Alabama-issued REAL ID from his pocket but claimed it could be fake. Venegas was kept handcuffed and detained for an hour the first time and ""between 20 and 30 minutes"" the second time before officers ran his information and released him.

Lavoie's declaration says that the agents ""needed to further verify his U.S. citizenship because each state has its own REAL ID compliance laws, which may provide for the issuance of a REAL ID to an alien and therefore based on HSI Special Agent training and experience, REAL ID can be unreliable to confirm U.S. citizenship.""

It's the punch line to a bad joke with a 20-year windup. When Congress passed the REAL ID Act in 2005. It was sold as a post-9/11 security measure to create uniform standards for state IDs, including clearly listing citizenship or lawful immigration status. State IDs that conformed to the requirements would be marked with a star. Contrary to the cheeky first sentence of this story, DHS insists that REAL ID is not a national ID system, and that it doesn't involve a centralized national database. (Civil liberties groups say it amounts to a de facto national ID system anyway.)

The rub was that REAL IDs would be required for entry to federal property, including, most significantly for the average American, airport security checkpoints. But the law was widely unpopular. There was such low compliance from states that enforcement was delayed seven times over the years, until finally beginning this May.

The project should have been scrapped years ago. America somehow survived two decades of terrorism-free air travel without REAL IDs. As Reason's Scott Shackford wrote in 2021, ""The government is demanding that Americans give up more of their privacy to the feds, subject themselves to additional inane bureaucracy, and carry around proof that we're citizens to be able to fly, even though none of that makes us more secure.""

And now we discover that DHS doesn't even consider the thing proof of citizenship.

In a court filing in response to DHS, the Institute for Justice noted how incredible this position is. ""REAL IDs require proof of citizenship or lawful status,"" the Institute for Justice wrote. ""DHS is the very agency responsible for certifying that REAL IDs, including Alabama's STAR IDs, satisfy this requirement.""

The law firm argues that DHS' policy of allowing officers to disregard proof of lawful presence likely violates the Fourth Amendment and DHS' own regulations.

When asked to comment on Lavoie's declaration, a DHS spokesperson said in a statement to Reason: ""The INA requires aliens and non-citizens in the US to carry immigration documents. Real IDs are not immigration documents—they make identification harder to forge, thwarting criminals and terrorists.""

But of course, Venegas is a U.S. citizen, so he is not required to carry non-existent immigration documents.

DHS' statement to Reason when Venegas' lawsuit was first filed insisted that, ""What makes someone a target for immigration enforcement is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity.""

The agency never responded to a follow-up question asking why, then, Venegas was targeted.

This is the cynical two-step that the Supreme Court allowed this September when it overturned a ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that the Trump administration was likely violating the Fourth Amendment rights of citizens by seizing them based solely on factors such as ""apparent race or ethnicity.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh released a concurring opinion in which he waved away concerns that allowing such profiling would lead to citizens and legal residents being unduly harassed.

""As for stops of those individuals who are legally in the country, the questioning in those circumstances is typically brief,"" Kavanaugh wrote, ""and those individuals may promptly go free after making clear to the immigration officers that they are U. S. citizens or otherwise legally in the United States.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/12/REAL-ID.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:56:26.262020

Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and 2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards, and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump’s policies, saying they curb rights like due process and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

US CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES TO ISSUE WEIGHTED LOTTERY RULE

On December 29, 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) published a final rule, Weighted Selection Process for Registrants and Petitioners Seeking to File Cap Subject H-1B Petitions, that will replace the previous random lottery process for the selection of new H-1B visas with a system that accords greater weight and thus a higher chance of selection to beneficiaries with H-1B job offers at higher wage levels. The rule will take effect on February 27, 2026, in time for the H-1B lottery for Fiscal Year 2027 H-1B visas.

Under the new system, a lottery registration for a particular beneficiary may be entered into the lottery multiple times based on the highest Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) wage level in the area of intended employment for the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code appropriate for the position up to the point where the offered wage equals or exceeds that level. In other words, H-1B beneficiaries would be entered into the selection pool as follows based upon the classification of their offered wages:

Wage Level IV: 4 times

Wage Level III: 3 times

Wage Level II: 2 times

Wage Level I: 1 time

The weighted lottery rule will require additional information to be provided in the registration process, including the appropriate SOC code for the offered position, the area of intended employment, and the highest OEWS wage level that is met by the offered salary.

DC DISTRICT COURT JUDGE UPHOLDS H-1B 100K FEE

In a decision issued on December 23, 2025, US District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Beryl A. Howell upheld President Trump’s assessment of a $100,000 fee on certain H-1B beneficiaries—Proclamation No. 10973, Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers, 90 Fed. Reg. 46,027 (Sept. 19, 2025). The legality of the fee had been challenged by the US Chamber of Commerce. Judge Howell ruled that the Proclamation was lawful based upon the president’s ""broad authority"" to restrict noncitizens' entry.

In her decision, Judge Howell cited Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, codified at Section 1182(f) of Title 8 in the US Code, which states, in pertinent part, that whenever the president finds that the entry of noncitizens into the US would be detrimental to the United States' interests, the president ""may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.""

Currently, there are two other lawsuits challenging the Proclamation, one in the Northern District of California brought by Global Nurse Force and a coalition of unions and small businesses, and one brought by 20 states in federal district court in Massachusetts.

As we discussed in a prior LawFlash outlining the applicability of the $100,000 H-1B fee, the following H-1Bs are subject to the fee:

New H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 am ET on September 21, 2025 for beneficiaries outside the United States who do not have a valid H-1B visa.

H-1B petitions filed at or after 12:01 am ET on September 21, 2025 requesting consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection, including for an noncitizen in the United States.

Petitions filed at or after 12:01 am ET on September 21, 2025 requesting change of status, amendment, or extension where the USCIS determines the noncitizen is ineligible (e.g., not in valid status or they depart the United States before adjudication or if the beneficiary departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request). In such cases, the $100,000 fee applies and must be paid.

The following H-1Bs are exempt from the $100,000 fee:

H-1B petitions received by the USCIS before 12:01 am ET September 21, 2025

H-1B change of status, change of employer, extension, or amendment petition filed on behalf of a beneficiary who is in the United States in another valid nonimmigrant status, such as B, F, L, TN, etc.—and such amendment, extension, or change of status is granted

A beneficiary of an approved H-1B petition who subsequently departs the United States and applies for a visa based on the approved H-1B petition

A beneficiary who is outside the United States but holds a valid, unexpired H-1B visa at the time of the filing of another H-1B petition

Beneficiaries granted National Interest Exceptions

IMMINENT EXPANSION OF THE TRAVEL BAN

On December 16, 2025, President Trump announced the expansion of the administration’s travel ban to include additional countries and the Palestinian Authority. The expansion will take effect on January 1, 2026.

The US administration implemented the travel ban in June 2025, imposing two types of visa restrictions on 19 countries in total. Nationals of Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen were subject to a ban on all nonimmigrant (temporary) visas and immigrant visas (permanent residence, or green cards.) Nationals of Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela were subject to a ban on all immigrant visas and a slightly more limited ban on tourist, student, and exchange visitor visas.

Under the expansion to the travel ban set to take effect on January 1, 2026, there is a total ban on nonimmigrant and immigrant visas for nationals of these additional countries: Burkina Faso, Laos, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, and Syria. Individuals with documents issued by the Palestinian Authority are also subject to the full ban.

Nationals of the following 19 countries are now banned from all immigrant visas and a more limited ban on non-immigrant visas, specifically all tourist, student, and exchange visitor visas (B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J visas): Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burundi, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, Dominica, Gabon, the Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Tonga, Venezuela, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

Turkmenistan will now only be subject to a ban on immigrant visas, but not non-immigrant visas.

Exceptions

There were exceptions in the June ban for, among others, anyone with a current green card or a valid visa issued prior to the ban’s effective date; athletes, coaches, and their families attending the World Cup, Olympics, or other sporting events; people who are immediate relatives of a US citizen (spouses, children under the age of 21, and parents); children adopted abroad; and Afghans seeking Special Immigrant Visas for their work helping US armed forces.

In addition to the expansion of the ban to include additional countries effective January 1, the US administration also eliminated the following significant exceptions:

Immediate relatives of US citizens

Children adopted abroad

Afghans seeking Special Immigrant Visas for their work assisting US armed forces

Note that a foreign national with dual citizenship of a country subject to the ban and a country not subject to the ban may travel to the US using a valid passport from the non-banned country.

While there is no immediate impact on nationals of the 39 countries now subject to the travel ban who are currently in the United States, in late November, the USCIS placed a blanket pause on the adjudication of all immigration benefits for nationals subject to the June travel ban.

This suspension applies to all benefits, including visa petitions, green card applications, and citizenship oath ceremonies. This suspension has now been extended to nationals of the newly banned countries. As a result, this means that there are now 39 countries whose nationals are currently unable to obtain immigration status and come to the United States from abroad, or obtain or change their immigration status from within the United States.

Currently, there is no information as to when adjudication of immigration benefits will resume for nationals of the countries subject to the ban.

CBP updated the Carrier Liaison Program on December 18, 2025.

The new list of countries exempt from the six-month passport validity rule has been issued.

Citizens of these countries need only have a passport valid for their intended period of stay in the United States.

Understanding the Six-Month Passport Validity Rule

The six-month passport validity rule requires visitors traveling to the United States to possess passports that are valid for at least six months beyond their intended period of stay. This rule is crucial for maintaining orderly and secure international travel, as it prevents situations where a visitor’s passport expires while they are still in the United States, which could complicate their ability to return to their home country. By ensuring that travelers have sufficient time to address any unforeseen circumstances that might delay their departure, this rule helps to avoid complications arising from an expired passport, thereby facilitating smoother travel and entry processes.

Carrier Liaison Program Update

Countries that are provided exemptions from the six-month passport validity rule are included on the CLP list issued by CBP through a detailed process that involves several considerations. The United States often enters into bilateral agreements or reciprocal arrangements with certain countries, based on mutual trust and cooperation in immigration and border security matters. These agreements often recognize the efficiency and reliability of the exempt countries’ passport issuance and renewal systems, which can handle passport validity issues without the need for a six-month buffer.

CBP also evaluates the risk of overstaying or violating immigration laws by citizens of the countries under consideration, and countries with a low risk of such issues are more likely to receive exemptions. Historical travel practices and long-standing precedents between the United States and the exempt countries are also taken into account.

Once these factors are considered, CBP updates the list of exempt countries under the CLP. This list is published online and communicated to airlines and transportation companies to ensure passengers from these countries are aware of the exemption and only need a passport valid for the duration of their stay in the United States. It is made available through official channels, such as the CBP website and relevant bulletins, to keep carriers and travelers informed of the current exemptions.

Carrier Liaison Program Country List Update

The updated list of countries whose citizens are exempt from the six-month passport validity rule is as follows:

Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, December 18, 2025, Publication Number 5303-1225

Practical Impact

Airline and transportation companies must ensure that their passengers are aware of these requirements to avoid any travel disruptions. Travelers from the listed countries can plan their trips to the United States with the assurance that their passports need only be valid for the duration of their intended stay.

Yesterday, more than 11 months after being inaugurated, President Trump vetoed his first bills of this term. Both had passed Congress with broad bipartisan support. These were not divisive bills. So these vetoes pit the president against his fellow Republicans and raise the question of how far they might go to defy the president. NPR White House correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is here to walk us through details. Hey there.

DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey there.

KELLY: What did he veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, the first is a bill that would have helped communities in southeastern Colorado pay for a conduit that would carry clean water. The bill would have done that by giving them more time to repay money without interest to the federal government. Now, that conduit is important because residents there have dealt with unsafe water. Some of the groundwater is tainted with toxic elements like radium. The other bill deals with Florida. It would have expanded the area reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe and required the secretary of the interior to help safeguard communities there from flooding.

KELLY: OK. Let me take these one by one. The Colorado one, first, and this clean water conduit. Why did President Trump veto it?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, his stated reason is that the bill would force federal taxpayers to foot the bill for a local water project that, as initially envisioned, would have been paid for by the local communities. He added in a statement that he's committed to ending, quote, ""the massive cost of taxpayer handouts."" But it's important to get a sense of the scope here. Federal funding has paid for a large chunk of this project, but as our colleagues at Colorado Public Radio have pointed out, this particular bill would cost the federal government less than $500,000, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, which, in terms of federal spending, is absolutely tiny.

KELLY: May I ask about the language you just used? You just told us the president's stated reason for vetoing this. Is there a reason to think there are other motives in play?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Colorado Republican Representative Lauren Boebert has raised this possibility. In a statement, she said, quote, ""I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation."" She clashed with the president this year by pushing for the release of the Epstein files, but Trump has not explicitly linked that to his veto.

But in addition, Trump, earlier this year, threatened what he called harsh measures if a woman named Tina Peters was not released from a Colorado prison. Peters was a county clerk in Mesa County, Colorado, and she is serving a nine-year sentence for helping someone get access to voting equipment after the 2020 election. So the whole case is tied to conspiracy theories about election fraud. Earlier this month, Trump said he was pardoning Peters, but presidential pardons apply to federal crimes. Peters was convicted at the state level, so she remains in prison. Now, again, Trump has not explicitly linked Peters to this veto, but this morning, he posted on social media that he wants Peters freed, so we know she's on his mind.

KELLY: OK. Go to the other one, the Florida veto. What are the reasons, stated or otherwise, for that veto?

KURTZLEBEN: Well, Trump was straightforward in saying this veto was in part about politics. He said in a statement that the Miccosukee Tribe, quote, ""has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies."" Now, that seems to refer to the tribe earlier this year joining a lawsuit against an immigration detention center the Trump administration created in Florida, the one the president calls Alligator Alcatraz. The tribe considers the land it's built on sacred.

KELLY: To circle back to something I said at the outset, that both these bills, Florida and Colorado, they passed with the support of the president's GOP colleagues in Congress, right?

KURTZLEBEN: Yes. In fact, they both passed the House and Senate without those person-by-person roll call votes. The bills just had so much support. They were able to pass via voice votes or unanimous consent. So now the question is whether Congress can or wants to override Trump's vetoes.

KELLY: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thank you, Danielle.

KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson found that Noem’s termination of the three countries’ protected status was “preordained” and did not follow the proper process, including consulting with other federal agencies or considering all country conditions.

The Joe Biden appointee further found that Noem “inexplicably departed from prior practice” by limiting the transition period for Nepali, Honduran and Nicaraguan TPS holders to 60 days, an unexplained change from 22 years of DHS practice of allowing at least six months’ transition after a TPS termination notice.

“Unilateral power has never been American. Nor has this country ignored the importance of humanitarian relief,” Thompson said in the opening of her 52-page order.

She continued: “By complying with the Constitution and enforcing the purpose of the temporary protected status statute, this nation’s economy becomes strengthened and our society united.”

The TPS program protects individuals from certain countries due to violence or economic duress. While those with TPS status can’t be deported and can work legally in the U.S., they do not have a path to U.S. citizenship. The National TPS Alliance and individual TPS holders from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal sued after Noem ordered the termination of protected status for the three countries, claiming her actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act and were motivated by racial animus.

The order vacates Noem’s terminations, restoring protections for thousands of TPS holders in the country.

“Consistent with virtually every District Court decision in the last year, the court found that the administration failed to follow the law as it pursued its vendetta against these immigrant communities,” UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy Co-Director Ahilan Arulanantham said in a statement to Courthouse News.

National TPS Alliance coordinator Jose Palma said the decision “brings hope” to the TPS community but acknowledged that the government will most likely appeal the ruling.

“Today’s victory, we have to celebrate it; it gives hope that respect for the law is still strong and the court will continue being strong on the side of the law,” he said.

A representative for the Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

In the order, Thompson said Noem’s decision to terminate TPS to Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal was arbitrary and capricious because her decision was “preordained and not based on an objective review of the country conditions, after consultation with the appropriate interagency department, as required by the TPS statute and the APA.”

Thompson also found that Noem deviated from past practices by not considering all country conditions when she made her decision, writing that the government’s decision to only consider conditions under the initial designation for TPS would go against the intent of the statute.

“Defendants’ interpretation to only include the initial designation would grant the secretary unfettered discretion to terminate TPS for a country in the midst of destabilizing and destructive civil war so long as a historic flood for which an antecedent TPS designation was made (even just months earlier) had dissipated,” the judge wrote, adding, “Such a perplexing result is a natural consequence of defendants’ interpretation of the TPS statute; and this court need not ‘read the statute to usher in such a bizarre and half-baked scheme.’”

Further, Thompson said there was “substantial evidence” that the termination decisions for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal were motivated by racial animus, referring to multiple public statements by Noem and President Donald Trump that referred to TPS holders as criminals.

“These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population,” the judge said.

On July 31, Thompson postponed the termination of the TPS program for Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal until Nov. 18. However, a federal appeals court stayed that ruling, greenlighting the Trump administration to go ahead with its termination of TPS status for the three countries while litigation played out.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/01/kristi-noem-speaks-to-homeland-security-employees.jpeg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-12-31 23:56:32.766476

“WELCOME TO AMERICA,” another user replied.

Arquette was responding to White’s post slamming Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) for re-sharing an AI-generated video of the White Stripes musician threatening Trump voters.

The pro-Trump X account MAGA Response posted a video Monday of an AI-generated clip of White telling Trump supporters, “Don’t even think about listening to my music, you fascists.”

A day later, Burchett retweeted the video and mocked White’s appearance, writing, “That cute little girl from the Addams Family got really ugly and angry.”

White responded on Instagram, calling out the congressman’s “playground” bully behavior.

“Can you believe that a U.S. congressman, that’s right, a CONGRESSMAN (from my state no less), a once hallowed and respected position in our society, would repost an AI-generated video, containing a false comment that I never said and refuted (without researching that I might add) and like a 10 year old on a playground, add to it attempted insults to my physical appearance?” White asked his Instagram followers. “What kind of joke are we all living in now?”

White went on to bemoan how “low class playground bullies” like Trump and Burchett have lowered the standards for America’s elected officials, writing, “It’s really sad how embarrassing our leadership has become, I so wish the average American conservative could have a conversation with any intelligent people in other countries around the world, just for one brief moment, and actually see just what a joke our government (and by proxy our country) has become.”

The musician concluded his fiery post Monday by predicting a future when officials like Burchett refuse to “admit to being a part” of the MAGA “cult” and “well-spoken leaders” have replaced them in power.

“All the MAGA hats will be in landfills and actual intelligent and honorable leadership will take their place.

While some of those policies have since been paused or rolled back, the changes left many educators and families nervous and frustrated.

Here’s a round-up of some of the big moments from 2025.

Immigration fears keep students out of school

In April, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security showed up at two LAUSD schools to conduct what officials at the agency described as “wellness checks” on some immigrant students. The agents were turned away.

Widespread immigration sweeps started in L.A. a few months later.

Local school leaders, parents and students have said that fear has at times kept kids from attending school and high school principals across the country reported similar experiences.

We’ve also seen acts of resistance. As early as February, students walked out to protest Trump’s policies. Teachers and volunteers with organizations like Union del Barrio began patrolling neighborhoods near schools to sound an alarm if there was any suspected immigration enforcement activity.

Schools have also provided additional resources, including busing for students afraid to walk to school and know-your-rights training for parents.

Immigration concerns also stretched into early childhood education. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in July that children without legal status would be barred from Head Start programs. That directive was paused by the administration, and then rejected by a federal judge.

Federal budget cuts hit hard

The administration made a number of budget cuts to agencies that serve students and their families.

Early in the year, the administration slashed Department of Education staff.

The department also made steep cuts to its civil rights office in March, which already faced a backlog of complaints. Seven of 12 regional Office for Civil Rights branches were shuttered, including one in San Francisco, which handled complaints filed in California. The cases involve families trying to get services for students with disabilities, allegations of bias related to race and religion, and claims of sexual violence.

Many attorneys with the Office for Civil Rights were called back to work in December as the backlog of complaints became untenable.

The administration also restructured its funding of homeless services, meaning that the future may be even rougher for L.A. families seeking housing. Data reviewed by LAist show the number of unsheltered L.A. County children and families rose in 2025.

The National Blue Ribbon Schools Program was eliminated in 2025. The end of the program sunsets a long-standing celebration of local school achievements. LAist preserved the records of California winners.

And the shutdown this fall over the federal budget also ensnared children and others who rely on food assistance from SNAP and WIC. In some cases, school districts invested in expanded meal programs to help make up for lost meals.

Diversity, equity and inclusion were targeted

The Trump administration has also sought to eliminate language associated with historically under-served communities across public education:

Some Head Start centers were told to avoid words like “Black,” “minority,” and “trauma” in their funding applications.

Under pressure to avoid certain terms, educators in TK-12 have had to figure out different approaches to improve academic outcomes and mental health for Black students.

Colleges and universities such as the University of Southern California have eliminated “diversity, equity and inclusion” as stated values.

Trump also took other actions. He issued an executive order to end public service loan forgiveness for people who work at places that “advance illegal immigration, terrorism, discrimination and violent protests.”

Public higher education in California also found itself in unfriendly territory

In March, the Justice Department announced an investigation into University of California campuses related to allegations of antisemitism.

A few months later, the Justice Department revealed the results of an investigation into UCLA, alleging it found “indifference” to “a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students” — much like at Harvard, Columbia and other elite universities. To settle those and other claims, the Trump administration demanded $1 billion from UCLA.

The National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health froze hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding that had been allocated to the university’s researchers. This cut funding for a wide variety of projects — everything from research into pediatric cancer to how our gut microbiome affects our health.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20be2db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+170/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F52%2Fb3%2Fb53ff5df4ca5b9ea032ce2d720d5%2Fgettyimages-trump-mcmahon-education.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 06:56:24.368156

The measure would have also required the Interior Department to consult with the Miccosukee Tribe on the best ways to protect structures from flooding.
“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.
Requests for comment made Wednesday by Spectrum News to attorneys listed in federal court records as representing the Miccosukee Tribe — as well as to Gimenez’s office — were not immediately returned.
Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.","For the first time in his second term, President Donald Trump has used his veto power, rejecting two bills that would have expanded tribal control to more of the Florida Everglades and helped Colorado residents pay their share of a water pipeline project.

Both bills had bipartisan support when passed by Congress earlier this year. To override Trump’s veto, a two-thirds majority would need to vote for each measure in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

Trump rejected 10 bills in his first term in the Oval Office –– with Congress overriding only his veto of a defense policy bill in January 2021. Former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama vetoed 13 and 12 bills, respectively.

Bill to expand land reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe

In rejecting the Florida bill, Trump cited actions by the Miccosukee Tribe to try “to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe signed on as plaintiffs to one of three federal lawsuits against the Trump administration over the immigration detention facility constructed earlier this year in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility had been slated to close its doors earlier this year, but a federal appeals court put that order on hold in September, pending an appeal.

The bill vetoed by Trump would have incorporated the Osceola Camp — an inhabited tribal village in the Everglades — into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, controlled by the Native American tribe. The measure would have also required the Interior Department to consult with the Miccosukee Tribe on the best ways to protect structures from flooding.

One of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors — Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez of Florida — said the measure was “about fairness and conservation” during a speech on the House floor in July.

“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.

Requests for comment made Wednesday by Spectrum News to attorneys listed in federal court records as representing the Miccosukee Tribe — as well as to Gimenez’s office — were not immediately returned.

Trump contended in his veto that the Osceola Camp was built “without authorization, in a low area that was raised with fill material” and that the cost to repair and replace infrastructure could be as much as $14 million.

The president wrote that “it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado

The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.

The bill sought to lengthen the repayment timeline and to reduce interest payments the communities of the Arkansas River Valley must make to the Bureau of Reclamation for the pipeline’s construction.

First approved by former President John F. Kennedy in 1962, the project would provide an estimated 7,500 acre-feet of water per year to as many as 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

“Currently, many people in these areas rely on groundwater supplies that may contain naturally occurring radionuclides such as radium and uranium,” the Bureau of Reclamation says on a webpage about the plan.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., criticized Trump’s veto on social media, writing, “This isn’t governing. It’s a revenge tour.”

Bennet has previously accused the president of retaliating against the state over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., also chimed in Tuesday night on X, writing, “This isn’t over.”

The Colorado lawmaker shared another post, noting that she was among a handful of Republicans to sign a discharge petition forcing a vote in the House to require the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

After reversing course on his opposition, Trump ultimately signed the bill into law, and records have been made public in batches since Dec. 19 –– though several media outlets recently reported the Justice Department has more than 5.2 million more documents to review.

When asked for comment about Bennet's and Boebert’s remarks, the White House referred to Trump's message to Congress.

In those remarks, the president said that the water pipeline project had been delayed for decades because it is “economically unviable” and that he blocked the bill to save taxpayers money.

“Enough is enough,” Trump wrote about his decision. “My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/trump_AP_25344742401441_NAT_1210,N,,2026-01-01 11:11:55.249755

""We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again - Only a question of time!"" he said in a social media post Wednesday.

Governors typically control states' National Guardsmen, and Trump had deployed troops to all three cities against the wishes of state and local Democratic leaders. He said it was necessary as part of a broader crackdown on immigration, crime and protests.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centerpiece of his second term - and has toyed with the idea of invoking the Insurrection Act to stop his opponents from using the courts to block his plans. He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration.

In his post, Trump said the troops' presence was responsible for a drop in crime in the three cities, though they were never on the streets in Chicago and Portland as legal challenges played out. When the Chicago deployment was challenged in court, a Justice Department lawyer said the Guard's mission would be to protect federal properties and government agents in the field, not ""solving all of crime in Chicago.""

Portland Mayor Keith Wilson's office in a statement said the city's reduction in crime was due to the efforts of local police and public safety programs. Chicago officials echoed the sentiment, saying in a release Tuesday that the city had 416 homicides in 2025 - the fewest since 2014.

Trump's push to deploy the troops in Democrat-led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

Governors react

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area. The order was not a final ruling but was a significant and rare setback by the high court for the president's efforts.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote on X Wednesday that Trump ""lost in court when Illinois stood up against his attempt to militarize American cities with the National Guard. Now Trump is forced to stand down.""

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said in a statement Wednesday that her office had not yet received ""official notification that the remaining federalized Oregon National Guard troops can return home. They were never lawfully deployed to Portland and there was no need for their presence. If President Trump has finally chosen to follow court orders and demobilize our troops, that's a big win for Oregonians and for the rule of law.""

Trump's decision to federalize National Guard troops began in Los Angeles in June, when protesters took to the streets in response to a blitz of immigration arrests in the area. He deployed about 4,000 troops and 700 Marines to guard federal buildings and, later, to protest federal agents as they carried out immigration arrests.

The number of troops slowly dwindled until just several hundred were left. They were removed from the streets by Dec. 15 after a lower court ruling that also ordered control to be returned to Gov. Gavin Newsom. But an appeals court had paused the second part of the order, meaning control remained with Trump. In a Tuesday court filing, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Newsom.

""About time (Trump) admitted defeat,"" Newsom said in a social media post. ""We've said it from day one: the federal takeover of California's National Guard is illegal.""

Troops will remain on the ground in several other cities. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December paused a lower court ruling that had called for an end to the deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., where they've been deployed since August after Trump declared a ""crime emergency.""

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September as part of a larger federal task force to combat crime, a move supported by the state's Republican Gov. Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued. However, the judge stayed the decision to block the Guard as the state appeals, allowing the deployment to continue.

In New Orleans, about 350 National Guard troops deployed by Trump arrived in the city's historic French Quarter on Tuesday and are set to stay through Mardi Gras to help with safety. The state's Republican governor and the city's Democratic mayor support the deployment.

Oneida Nation officials say they are reviewing the issue to ensure alignment with the Nation's values.

Oneida Nation officials are coming under fire by tribal members after it was discovered one of the tribe’s subsidiaries entered into contracts with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.

The Federal Procurement Data System, an online database of federal contracts, shows Oneida-Stantec JV LLC (OESC Group) was awarded a $2.6 million contract by ICE on Sept. 19 and a $3.7 million contract by ICE on Dec. 26. The information was first reported by Fox 11 News in Green Bay.

The contracts are engineering and technical services and for maintenance of government facilities.

“Since becoming aware of this issue, the Nation has been completing its due diligence to address the issue in a legal and transparent manner,” tribal officials posted on social media late Tuesday. “We are working in compliance with our corporate charter to take the steps necessary to ensure alignment between the Nation's values and OESC group.

“The Nation has taken preliminary steps on this issue, and we ask for your patience as we navigate legal processes. More information is forthcoming over the next several days.”

The post on Facebook garnered hundreds of comments, some in favor of working with ICE and most against.

“This reflects a clear misalignment with the values I expect our elected officials to uphold,” posted tribal member and former Oneida Nation attorney Rebecca Webster. “This is mind boggling that anyone thought this was a good idea.”

Others posted that ICE is targeting mostly Indigenous people from Turtle Island (North America) who happen to be from Mexico or Central America.

There have been incidents in which ICE briefly detained tribal members of reservations in the U.S. in apparent cases of racial profiling.

These incidents have drawn ire from Indian Country because the ones being arrested have ancestors who were among the first people in what is now the U.S., going back at least 10,000 years.

A similar situation of a tribal nation facing the ire of Indian Country after it entered into a contract with ICE occurred earlier this month with the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation of Kansas.

Dallas Goldtooth, a popular Indian Country actor, comedian and activist spoke out against that nearly $30 million contract.

“This is a clear example of where economic development without any base values grounded in Indigenous philosophy and human dignity leads you into some dark places,” he wrote on social media about the issue.

Prairie Band officials fired the senior members of the tribe’s LLC, which made the contract with ICE. Potawatomi tribal officials later announced they were able to cancel the contract with ICE.

On Wednesday, Oneida tribal officials issued a statement saying they condemn OESC’s actions to enter into the contracts with ICE because “we believe such actions hinder teaching our values to the next seven generations of its employees, representatives or corporations if we do not abide by those values today.”

The leadership of OESC is scheduled to meet with the tribal business committee, which just passed a resolution to provide clarity of the tribe’s position on the issue.

“Passing this resolution is an initial step to implementing clarity about the Nation’s expectations that our employees, representatives, businesses and tribal corporations align with our core values,” Oneida Chairman Tehassi Hill said in a statement. “The Oneida Business Committee will consider other appropriate steps needs to prevent future misalignment with balanced measure using our ‘Good Mind Principles’.”

In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.
Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.
“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election.
I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.","Jack Smith, the former justice department special counsel who led the aborted federal prosecution of Donald Trump, told a congressional committee that he never spoke to Joe Biden about his cases, according to the transcript of a deposition released on Wednesday.

In his behind-closed-doors testimony to the House judiciary committee earlier this month, Smith defended the charges he brought against Trump for allegedly possessing classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election, while warning of the consequences of allowing election meddling to go unpunished.

“Theoretically, what happens if there is election interference and the people who are responsible for that are not held accountable?” Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked.

“It becomes the new norm, and that becomes how we … conduct elections,” Smith replied, according to the transcript.

“And so the toll on our democracy, if you had to describe that, what would that be?” the congresswoman asked.

“Catastrophic,” Smith said.

Trump and his Republican allies have alleged that the former special counsel was a key figure in a justice department that Biden had “weaponized” against his predecessor. The Republican-controlled House judiciary committee earlier this year heard testimony from one of Smith’s top deputies, and months later subpoenaed the former special counsel for private testimony. Smith had offered to voluntarily testify in public, as special counsels typically do.

In questioning from Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, Smith said he operated without interference from Merrick Garland, the attorney general who appointed him, or any other top justice department officials.

“Did President Biden ever give you any instructions about what you should or should not do related to these investigations?” Goldman asked.

“No,” Smith replied, later specifying he had not spoken to Biden about his cases in any way.

Smith was appointed in November 2022, and quickly brought the two federal cases against Trump, who also faced state-level charges of election interference in Georgia, and falsifying business records in New York.

While he would later be convicted of 34 felonies in the Manhattan case, neither of Trump’s federal indictments went to trial before he returned to office following the 2024 election, after which Smith, in line with justice department policy, dropped the charges.

The election-interference case was slowed by pretrial motions, including a supreme court ruling that gave presidents immunity for official acts and forced Smith to make changes to his case. The classified-documents case was hampered by rulings from Florida judge Aileen Cannon, who at one point dismissed Smith’s indictment.

Smith authored a report into his prosecutions, and the portion covering the election interference case was released prior to Biden leaving office. However, Cannon has barred the chapter discussing the classified-documents charges from being made public, though Democrats on the judiciary committee have asked her to reverse her decision.

At the outset of the hearing, an attorney for Smith, Peter Koski, told the committee the former special counsel had received an email from the justice department advising him to avoid talking about his evidence in the case because of Cannon’s ruling.

“This restriction significantly limits Mr Smith’s ability to discuss the classified-documents case. Nevertheless, Mr Smith is committed to doing his best to answering questions consistent with the department’s guidance,” Koski said.

In his more-than-eight-hour of testimony, Smith insisted he had no political motivations in indicting Trump, and said he believed “we had proof beyond a reasonable doubt in both cases” that he brought.

“If asked whether to prosecute a former president based on the same facts today, I would do so regardless of whether that president was a Republican or a Democrat,” he said in his opening statement. Smith later told an unnamed committee staffer he would have indicted Biden or Barack Obama over similar evidence.

Republicans have been in uproar after it emerged that federal investigators obtained data related to the phone usage of several members of Congress, which was used as part of Smith’s prosecutions. Smith hit back in his testimony, saying: “Recent narratives about my team’s work are false and misleading” and the “records were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation”.

The only data collected, Smith said, was incoming and outgoing phone numbers and the calls’ durations, not their contents themselves. The data helped show that Trump continued to press his allies to stop Biden from formally becoming president, even as his followers were attacking the US Capitol on January 6, he added.

“President Trump and his associates tried to call members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I did not choose those members, President Trump did,” Smith said.

Trump has repeatedly railed against Smith, and in his testimony the former special counsel acknowledged the risk that the president could come after him.

“I have no doubt that the president wants to seek retribution against me,” Smith said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c6b6153f6ef9976762872e59a0f5b562c179a7/180_0_1800_1440/master/1800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=57080d18d6d26ff6f65158e72c863b5c",N,,2025-12-31 20:57:24.767673

ICE agents did not appear to present a warrant to the man, and the agents refused to answer questions on the scene.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reportedly swarmed the Central Coast over the weekend, with a local advocacy group saying agents plucked people from their neighborhoods, workplaces and shopping centers without warning.

Immigration agents took at least 92 people into custody from Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, according to data collected by 805 UndocuFund, a local nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting undocumented immigrants and their families. The elevated ICE activity appeared to continue later into the week as well.

“This one is a direct attack on our communities,” 805 UndocuFund communications and media organizer Claudia Gonzalez said, noting that ICE picked most people up in areas where immigrants live and work.

805 UndocuFund collected this data from rapid responders who witness the arrests and community members who call and report the arrests of their friends and family members, she said. The group then checks the numbers to ensure there aren’t duplicates of the same incident in the dataset.

On Saturday, ICE agents took 34 people into custody from Santa Maria and two people into custody from San Luis Obispo, according to the data provided to The Tribune.

Then, on Sunday, ICE took 13 people from Lompoc, two people from Santa Barbara and eight people from Santa Maria — including four people who were working at a gas station, according to the data.

On Monday, ICE agents took 24 people from Santa Maria, five people from San Luis Obispo, one person from Nipomo and three people from Paso Robles, according to the data.

Since President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20, Gonzalez said ICE agents have taken at least 94 community members into custody from San Luis Obispo County and 537 community members from Santa Barbara County — with a large number of those incidents happening during the past few days, Gonzalez said.

805 UndocuFund community organizer Cesar Vasquez said he’s never seen ICE take so many people during a two-day period.

“It’s been hell,” he said.

ICE did not respond to The Tribune’s request for comment about the apparent uptick in Central Coast activity as of Tuesday.

Elevated ICE activity continues into week

On Monday, 805 UndocuFund rapid responders were running around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties monitoring ICE agents and offering help to families who had been separated, Vasquez said.

In addition to Santa Maria ICE agents, agents from Camarillo and Los Angeles appeared to join the swarm, too — which Vasquez hasn’t seen before, he said.

805 UndocuFund identifies ICE agents based on their vehicles and license plates.

The activity began early in Santa Maria on Monday, with ICE picking up a man on the way to his car at 4 a.m. on Bunny Avenue, Vasquez said. Then, at 4:45 a.m., ICE detained a man and a woman when he stopped on Bunny Avenue to drive her to work, he said.

At 5:24 a.m., ICE took a man from the parking lot of his apartment building on Western Avenue.

Then, ICE detained a man on Morrison Avenue as he dropped his children off with a babysitter at 5:26 a.m., Vasquez said.

ICE continued to circle the area, taking people into custody on Alvin and Bunny avenues and other nearby streets.

The agents then descended on San Luis Obispo County, taking a father from outside his apartment on Bullock Lane and Orcutt Road, Vasquez said. Then, 30 minutes later, ICE agents picked up two men from the same area, and another man on the way to his car 20 minutes after that, he said.

At 11:13 a.m., ICE agents took a man into custody from the lobby of the San Luis Obispo County Jail when he was released. The Tribune was at the scene at the time he was detained.

The agents immediately placed him in handcuffs and escorted him to a vehicle in the parking lot. ICE agents did not appear to present a warrant to the man, and the agents refused to answer questions on the scene.

Meanwhile, in Paso Robles, ICE took a man at 11:43 a.m. while he was getting groceries, Vasquez said. Agents continued to pick up other people in Santa Maria and across San Luis Obispo County on Monday afternoon, he said.

Tuesday morning was a similar story — with ICE agents driving around Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties to pick people up off the street, Vasquez and Gonzalez both told The Tribune.

The elevated activity has had a large impact on community members through the holiday weekend and into this week.

People avoided leaving their homes, even to go to work, to the doctor or to take their children to school, Gonzalez said.

“They’re definitely scared,” she said. “Even documented community members are scared to go outside, because what we’ve seen is obvious racial profiling. They’re hitting Santa Maria, and this is where our working community lives.”

These deportations have also impacted children from mixed-status families.

“When a family is separated, sometimes they lose their main breadwinner,” Gonzalez said. “Children are left without parents.”

Gonzalez said people can call 805 UndocuFund at 805-870-8855 if they see ICE or if they need assistance because a friend or family member was taken. People can donate to 805 UndocuFund’s mutual aid fund for impacted families at www.pledge.to/mutual-aid-fund.

“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times.","US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly planned a $100m, one-year media blitz for what it’s calling “wartime recruitment”, targeting conservative radio show listeners, gun rights aficionados, military affairs followers and men’s interests enthusiasts – among others in the Maga-verse – for jobs in the Trump administration’s next phase of its mass deportation campaign.

“Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” one of the agency’s ads says, directing interested readers to apply.

As ICE looks to hire for thousands of new positions, flush with cash after an unprecedented influx from Congress last summer, it’s relying on geofencing to ensure people near military bases, Nascar races, gun and trade shows, and college campuses receive its recruitment ads, according to an internal document reported by the Washington Post.

Officials also intend to spend $8m or more on deals with fitness, military and tactical/lifestyle online influencers, who would use their sway to push the administration’s immigration agenda through livestreams, events, and other content meant for their gen Z and millennial audiences.

“America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out,” ICE’s recruiting website says.

The administration’s hiring push comes after Donald Trump signed HR 1 into law in July, which allotted $45bn for immigration detention and $32bn for immigration enforcement-related activities and personnel.

Yet even as ICE now has the funds to hire about 14,000 new employees, its efforts to quickly do so have raised red flags among everyday citizens disgusted by the recruitment ads themselves and experts concerned that the speed and tone with which the federal government is pursuing new agents could attract more aggressive, combat-hungry applicants.

“They’re aiming for that sweet spot of people who’ve got something to prove, who want to have that power, under the guise of patriotism,” Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told the Post.

ICE’s controversial ads have leaned heavily on American symbolism – Uncle Sam, George Washington, Lady Liberty – while casting immigrants as bad actors to convince potential deportation officers to apply.

Meanwhile, ICE is offering an up to $50,000 signing bonus, higher than the real median personal income for a year’s work in the US, as well as up to $60,000 in student loan repayment for those who join.

The agency has already received more than 220,000 applications and made more than 18,000 tentative job offers, sometimes on the spot. At an ICE recruitment fair in Arlington, Texas, more than a hundred people were waiting outside before the event started.

“When I saw Uncle Sam pointing that finger, I just had it in my heart,” Mahin Ahmed, an ICE applicant, told the Times. “You’re thinking, ‘Look at this guy. He’s an immigrant. He wants to become a deportation officer.’ It doesn’t make any sense to you, makes 100 percent sense to me.”

With more ICE officers available, the White House border czar, Tom Homan, said that the number of immigrant arrests will “explode” in 2026, including through an increase in enforcement at workplaces, Reuters reported.

Homan’s comments came after the administration had signaled it would instead be toning down its public-facing immigration actions to focus on apprehending people with serious criminal convictions, in the face of widespread backlash to its violent and highly visible tactics in major cities around the country.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38bb565c4c908b17da4f77167e55959d3c281e9c/904_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d4402e573fdfe2f3354caf1d87583e3",N,,2025-12-31 17:57:23.358418

In the coming year, ICE plans to spend $100 million to recruit individuals who may be a good fit to assist in furthering President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda by targeting military enthusiasts, gun rights supporters, people interested in physical training and conservative politics, according to an internal document seen by the Washington Post.

The plan, reportedly dubbed the “wartime recruitment” strategy by ICE, outlines an aggressive acceleration in strategic marketing that ICE has already used to recruit more than 200,000 individuals to join the agency as it seeks to deport swaths of immigrants from the U.S.

New strategies include targeting recruitment ads to individuals on a military base, attending a NASCAR race or gun trade show, or at a college campus through “geofencing” – a technical strategy where advertisers can create a virtual boundary around a real area to trigger ads on web browsers or social media for people in the location.

The 30-page document also indicates ICE may partner with online influencers, some of whom could be former agents, veterans, or “pro-ICE,” who have Gen-Z and millennials audiences with interests that align with the military or fitness.

Those influencers would be expected to host live streams, attend events or post content online targeted toward “niche communities.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said they would not confirm or deny any leaked documents but praised the Washington Post for highlighting Trump and Secretary Kristi Noem’s “wildly successful ICE recruitment campaign, which is under budget and ahead of schedule.”

McLaughlin said ICE received more than 220,000 applications in five months and has issued more than 18,000 tentative job offers. She added that more than 85 percent of new hires have previous law enforcement experience.

McLaughlin stressed that new law enforcement hires meet “the same rigorous standards” that apply to all officers and those deployed in the field attend a virtual Deportation Officer Training Program as well as an in-person firearm and tactical training program at a local field office.

Over the last year, ICE has launched ad campaigns on television, radio, web browsers, streaming services and at in-person sporting events to attract potential recruits. Some of the ads target disgruntled police officers in major cities such as Chicago or Seattle. Others highlight signing bonuses of $50,000, generous benefits and even student loan forgiveness.

The agency has been specifically targeting Gen Z and early-career professionals as potential recruits, according to internal documents seen in August. Officials have been utilizing social media and streaming services to reach more than 42 million people in specific audience groups that may be a good fit for roles in ICE.

Earlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive.
He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.
The human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding.
“The implication is that ‘clearance’ would come from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General,” Crenshaw writes.","A newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Kilmar Ábrego García reveals that high-level justice department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority”, only after he was mistakenly deported and then ordered returned to the U.S.

Ábrego García, originally from El Salvador, has pleaded not guilty in federal court in Tennessee to charges of human smuggling. He is seeking to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the prosecution is vindictive – a way for the Trump administration to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

To support that argument, he has asked the government to turn over documents that reveal how the decision was made to prosecute him in 2025 for an incident that occurred in 2022. On 3 December, US district judge Waverly Crenshaw filed an order under seal that compelled the government to provide some documents to Ábrego García and his attorneys. That order was unsealed on Tuesday and sheds new light on the case.

Earlier, Crenshaw found that there was “some evidence” that the prosecution of Ábrego García could be vindictive. He specifically cited a statement by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, on a Fox News program that seemed to suggest that the Department of Justice charged Ábrego García because he had won his wrongful deportation case.

Rob McGuire, who was the acting US attorney for the middle district of Tennessee until late December, argued that those statements were irrelevant because he alone made the decision to prosecute, and he has no animus against Ábrego García.

In the newly unsealed order, Crenshaw writes: “Some of the documents suggest not only that McGuire was not a solitary decision-maker, but he in fact reported to others in [the justice department] and the decision to prosecute Abrego may have been a joint decision.”

The US attorney’s office for the middle district of Tennessee released a statement saying: “The emails cited in Judge Crenshaw’s order, specifically Mr McGuire’s email on May 15, 2025, confirm that the ultimate decision on whether to prosecute was made by career prosecutors based on the facts, evidence, and established [justice department] practice. Communications with the Deputy Attorney General’s Office about a high-profile case are both required and routine.”

The email referenced was from McGuire to his staff stating that Blanche “would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later”, according to Crenshaw’s order.

The human-smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee during which Ábrego García was pulled over for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and state troopers discussed the possibility of human smuggling among themselves. However, he was ultimately allowed to leave with only a warning. The case was turned over to Homeland Security Investigations, but there is no record of any effort to charge him until April 2025, according to court records.

The order does not give much detail on what is in the documents that were turned over to Ábrego García, but it shows that Aakash Singh, who works under Blanche in the office of the deputy attorney general, contacted McGuire about Ábrego García’s case on 27 April, the same day that McGuire received a file on the case from Homeland Security Investigations. That was several days after the US supreme court ruled in Ábrego García’s favor on 10 April.

On 30 April, Singh said in an email to McGuire that the prosecution was a “top priority” for the deputy attorney general’s office, according to the order.

According to the Post, the Hutchins warehouse would hold up to 9,500 detainees, nearly triple the amount that the largest current ICE detention facility, a makeshift tent encampment at Fort Bliss, can hold.
That number stands out even more when compared to the 700 or so that the current closest ICE detention center to Dallas, the Prairieland Detention Center near Alvarado, reportedly holds.
The Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about the proposed plan and did not confirm any of the paper’s findings.
Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, is the only state with more than one of the proposed new detention sites.","Nearly a year into President Donald Trump’s second administration, the signs that his controversial immigration policies will continue to show themselves in many ways are only growing more frequent. Along with near-daily headlines involving eye-popping statistics, arrests and deportations, a recent Washington Post report outlines a new plan that calls for Dallas County to soon be the home of the nation’s second-largest ICE detention facility.

“The Trump administration is seeking contractors to help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time, according to a draft solicitation,” the Post reported on Dec. 24.

According to the documents reviewed by the paper, the aim of the plan is to “speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system,” which is not logistically possible at present. Proposed new, large detention facilities would, according to the draft solicitation, be placed near “major logistical hubs.”

If the Dallas-Fort Worth area is anything, it’s a major logistical hub, so it’s of little surprise that Hutchins, in Dallas County, just a bit southeast of downtown Dallas, is one of the seven proposed spots for new detention facilities that would hold thousands of people at once. The proposed sites in the draft are located in cities, counties or states led by Republican officials who have demonstrated a pro-Trump stance and support for the president’s immigration policies.

According to the Post, the Hutchins warehouse would hold up to 9,500 detainees, nearly triple the amount that the largest current ICE detention facility, a makeshift tent encampment at Fort Bliss, can hold. That number stands out even more when compared to the 700 or so that the current closest ICE detention center to Dallas, the Prairieland Detention Center near Alvarado, reportedly holds.

The plans call for the renovated warehouses to have restroom and shower facilities, as well as medical units, recreational facilities, kitchens and housing for families that are detained together. But the fact that the government wants to place so many detainees together in an effort to deport as many as possible as quickly as possible leaves some advocates less than impressed with the proposed blueprints.

Tania Wolf, an advocate with the National Immigration Project who is based in New Orleans, near another proposed new detention center, told the Post. “It’s dehumanizing. You’re treating people, for lack of a better term, like cattle.”

The promise to begin mass deportations as soon as possible was arguably Trump’s most controversial pledge following his 2024 election victory. As of December 14, more than 68,400 people are in ICE custody, a record high.

Contrary to early statements from Trump and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who often declared that only the “worst of the worst” undocumented criminals would be detained and deported, many non-criminal immigrants have been held. According to recent reports, more than 75,000 of the people detained by ICE in the first nine months of 2025, at least a third of all ICE arrests during that time, did not have criminal records.

On Monday, the Observer reported from a press conference where the family of Maher Tarabishi, a Palestinian man living in North Texas detained by ICE in October, pleaded for his release. Tarbishi is being held at the Bluebonnett Detention Center north of Abilene, has no criminal record and is the primary caregiver for his son, Wael, who suffers from a rare neurological disorder that has caused him to be hospitalized twice since his father was arrested. Tarabishi is but the latest example of a North Texas resident being held by ICE who would likely not have been a candidate for deportation under previous administrations.

At this point, the plans for new dentinon facilities are in their early stages, and the Post article notes that the draft isn’t final and could change. The Department of Homeland Security declined to answer questions about the proposed plan and did not confirm any of the paper’s findings.

Texas, as Trump-friendly a state as there is, thanks to the enthusiastic support of Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton, is the only state with more than one of the proposed new detention sites. Baytown, outside of Houston, is listed in the draft solicitation as the second Texas warehouse site. San Antonio, along with El Paso and Los Fresnos, in the Rio Grande Valley, are noted as possible sites for new ICE processing centers, where detainees would go through before being “funnelled” to the larger detention facilities. These new processing facilities would act in a similar fashion to the Dallas ICE field office on Stemmons Freeway, the site of the September shooting that saw a gunman kill two detainees and injure another from the top of a nearby office building.",https://www.dallasobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/Immigrations_ICE_Detention_AdobeStock-e1767134725582.jpeg,N,,2025-12-31 16:58:07.639072

The second bill gave control of its tribal lands to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Florida. They are suing the Trump administration over the construction of the immigration detention center, Alligator Alcatraz.

""Enough is enough. My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies. Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts and restoring fiscal sanity is vital to economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation. For these reasons, I cannot support the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. Therefore, it is my duty to return H.R. 131 to the House of Representatives without my approval,"" Trump said in a message to Congress.

Both bills had bipartisan support.

“President Trump’s first veto of his second term blocks a bipartisan bill that both the House and Senate passed unanimously, costs taxpayers nothing, and delivers safe, reliable water to rural communities that overwhelmingly supported him,"" Colorado senators said ina joint statement.

Trump said the new law would not allow for any new construction spending on the pipeline project, but only fix the terms of repaying the cost, sparking a debate about the federal government's role in funding infrastructure projects.

While explaining the veto for the tribal lands bill, Trump wrote the tribe was ""actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.""

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo, backed the Arkansas Valley Conduit bill. Although Trump did not refer to her in the rejection, Boebert suggested the reason for the veto was ""political retaliation.""

I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability. Americans deserve leadership that puts people over politics,” Boebert said in a statement on social media.

Mr. Trump vetoed the two bills on Monday, the White House announced on X, after they were sent to his desk earlier this month. The bills had backers in both parties, and they passed the House and Senate through voice votes. Both houses of Congress would need to pass the bills again by a two-thirds margin to override the president's veto.

It's fairly rare for the president to exercise his veto power, especially when the president's party controls Congress. Mr. Trump vetoed 10 bills in his first term, all during his last two years in office, and former President Joe Biden used the veto power 13 times while in office.

Trump vetoes Everglades bill over immigration dispute

One of the bills — the Miccosukee Reserved Area Amendments Act — would have added a small village called the Osceola Camp to a section of the Florida Everglades that the Miccosukee Native American Tribe has control over. It would also require the Department of the Interior to take action to protect structures in the village from flooding.

The bill was backed by Florida Republican Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moody, and by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez and Democratic Rep. Darren Soto. Shortly before it passed the House in July, Gimenez said the bill was ""about fairness and conservation.""

""It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, land and their way of life,"" Gimenez said in a speech on the House floor.

But in a message to Congress on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the project benefits ""special interests"" — and accused the tribe of not cooperating with his immigration policies.

He wrote that ""despite seeking funding and special treatment from the Federal Government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.""

Earlier this year, the tribe joined a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center in the Everglades that state and federal officials refer to as ""Alligator Alcatraz."" The tribe has argued the facility could hurt the surrounding environment, impacting the tribe's ability to hunt and hold ceremonies on the land.

The president also argued that the Osceola Camp was originally created without authorization, writing, ""it is not the Federal Government's responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.""

The tribe said in a statement it was ""disappointed"" by the veto, arguing the bill ""was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests.""

""We have never sought to obstruct the President's immigration agenda,"" Miccosukee Tribe Chairman Talbert Cypress said. ""Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments.""

Soto said: ""Trump's veto appears to be revenge for the Miccosukee Tribe's valid opposition to the atrocious 'Alligator Alcatraz.' It's sad, petty, and a violation of tribal sovereignty.""

Trump vetoes Colorado water bill — local lawmakers call it ""revenge""

The other piece of legislation that faced a presidential veto this week was the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act. That bill was aimed at completing a long-planned water pipeline that could serve some 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

The pipeline was first proposed during President John F. Kennedy's administration, part of a series of water projects in Colorado. But it was never built, in part because federal law required local communities to pay for it, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. A 2009 law changed the funding breakdown and allowed local governments to pick up only 35% of the tab. The bill that was passed this year would have reduced those local entities' interest payments and given them more time to repay the costs.

Mr. Trump said he vetoed the bill as part of a broader push to cut ""taxpayer handouts."" He pointed to the pipeline's expected price tag — the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimated in 2023 it would cost about $1.4 billion, double the projected price seven years earlier.

The president argued the legislation ""would continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project.""

The bill was backed by the state's two Democratic senators and by Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert and Jeff Hurd, whose districts include areas that would be served by the pipeline.

Boebert told CBS News in a statement the veto was ""very disappointing,"" writing: ""This fight is not over.""

Boebert castigated the veto in a separate statement to local reporter Kyle Clark, calling the bill ""completely non-controversial"" and saying she hopes Mr. Trump's veto ""has nothing to do with political retaliation.""

""I must have missed the rally where he stood in Colorado and promised to personally derail critical water infrastructure projects,"" Boebert wrote. ""My bad, I thought the campaign was about lowering costs and cutting red tape.""

Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado also strongly criticized the president's decision, writing on X: ""Donald Trump is playing partisan games and punishing Colorado by making rural communities suffer without clean drinking water.""

Fellow Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet accused the president of seeking ""revenge.""

Boebert drew attention earlier this year by breaking with Mr. Trump and signing a petition to force a House vote on a bill to release files on Jeffrey Epstein.

Both bills had bipartisan support when passed by Congress earlier this year. To override Trump’s veto, a two-thirds majority would need to vote for each measure in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

Trump rejected 10 bills in his first term in the Oval Office –– with Congress overriding only his veto of a defense policy bill in January 2021. Former Presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama vetoed 13 and 12 bills, respectively.

Bill to expand land reserved for the Miccosukee Tribe

In rejecting the Florida bill, Trump cited actions by the Miccosukee Tribe to try “to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe signed on as plaintiffs to one of three federal lawsuits against the Trump administration over the immigration detention facility constructed earlier this year in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility had been slated to close its doors earlier this year, but a federal appeals court put that order on hold in September, pending an appeal.

The bill vetoed by Trump would have incorporated the Osceola Camp — an inhabited tribal village in the Everglades — into the Miccosukee Reserved Area, controlled by the Native American tribe. The measure would have also required the Interior Department to consult with the Miccosukee Tribe on the best ways to protect structures from flooding.

One of the bill’s bipartisan sponsors — Republican Rep. Carlos A. Gimenez of Florida — said the measure was “about fairness and conservation” during a speech on the House floor in July.

“It ensures the Miccosukee Tribe has the autonomy to protect their homes, their land and their way of life,” he said at the time.

Requests for comment made Wednesday by Spectrum News to attorneys listed in federal court records as representing the Miccosukee Tribe — as well as to Gimenez’s office — were not immediately returned.

Trump contended in his veto that the Osceola Camp was built “without authorization, in a low area that was raised with fill material” and that the cost to repair and replace infrastructure could be as much as $14 million.

The president wrote that “it is not the Federal Government’s responsibility to pay to fix problems in an area that the Tribe has never been authorized to occupy.

Financing modifications proposed for a water pipeline in Colorado

The other bill vetoed by Trump would have helped rural residents pay for their share of a long-planned water pipeline project, called the Arkansas Valley Conduit.

The bill sought to lengthen the repayment timeline and to reduce interest payments the communities of the Arkansas River Valley must make to the Bureau of Reclamation for the pipeline’s construction.

First approved by former President John F. Kennedy in 1962, the project would provide an estimated 7,500 acre-feet of water per year to as many as 50,000 people in southeastern Colorado.

“Currently, many people in these areas rely on groundwater supplies that may contain naturally occurring radionuclides such as radium and uranium,” the Bureau of Reclamation says on a webpage about the plan.

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., criticized Trump’s veto on social media, writing, “This isn’t governing. It’s a revenge tour.”

Bennet has previously accused the president of retaliating against the state over the incarceration of former election clerk Tina Peters, who is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a data breach scheme driven by false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.

Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., also chimed in Tuesday night on X, writing, “This isn’t over.”

The Colorado lawmaker shared another post, noting that she was among a handful of Republicans to sign a discharge petition forcing a vote in the House to require the Justice Department to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

After reversing course on his opposition, Trump ultimately signed the bill into law, and records have been made public in batches since Dec. 19 –– though several media outlets recently reported the Justice Department has more than 5.2 million more documents to review.

When asked for comment about Bennet's and Boebert’s remarks, the White House referred to Trump's message to Congress.

In those remarks, the president said that the water pipeline project had been delayed for decades because it is “economically unviable” and that he blocked the bill to save taxpayers money.

“Enough is enough,” Trump wrote about his decision. “My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Trump_AP_25363767852117_NAT_1231,N,,2025-12-31 15:56:42.580492

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the Washington Post that the agency was “thrilled"" about coverage of the ""wildly successful ICE recruitment campaign, which is under budget and ahead of schedule.” She did not dispute the information presented in the document.

Officials and citizens have raised alarm bells over ICE's traditional advertising methods, too, including public campaigns and propaganda efforts that many say are stoking unnecessary fear within communities.

Under the Trump administration, federal immigration officials have pivoted to extreme, high-risk tactics to meet deportation aims set by the president, including periodically violent operations in areas far from the border. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino has said the unprecedented actions of ICE agents are a new ""turn and burn"" strategy that sees agents deploying tactics normally reserved for major offenders on families and individuals who haven't been suspected of violent offenses.

ICE is reportedly set to sign on tens of thousands of new agents in the coming months as a result of its ""surge hiring marketing strategy,"" incentivized by major signing bonuses and inflated salaries allocated from Trump's Big Beautiful Bill. The agency has also reduced requirements for new hires. DHS reported that it received over 200,000 job applications in the last five months alone, with McLaughlin stating the vast majority are former law enforcement.

As allegations of civil rights violations increased, so have the numbers of habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court Massachusetts.","Since President Donald Trump began his second term in office, New Bedford’s immigrant community has been transformed.

The first nine months of mass deportations were marked by sudden and violent raids that drew national and international attention. Over time, enforcement became more targeted, moving largely out of public view.

Federal authorities have arrested at least 60 immigrants living or working in the New Bedford area. The Light has confirmed the apprehension of 53 through local sources, court records, and area and federal law enforcement. Some were detained during large-scale actions. Others were arrested individually, or at check-ins for immigration appointments.

Of those individuals, nine have been confirmed released. Some are awaiting decisions in immigration court, while others were released under supervision. Twelve detainees have since been deported from the United States.

Violent raids

People felt the mass deportation campaign before it hit New Bedford. Shortly after the 2024 election, advocates, lawyers, and some public officials urged their community to brace for impact. Businesses on Acushnet Avenue began to feel the pinch before the first street arrest happened.

U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s hammer fell upon New Bedford on March 11, when agents descended on the Minit-Man Car Wash and detained three Guatemalan men.

On March 21, ICE agents detained two Guatemalan men when they used a battering ram to enter their home on Viall Street. Teenagers present at the home said agents did not present warrants for entry. The raid left a 19-year old as household head. The action spurred 200 residents to demonstrate outside City Hall.

On April 14, Marilú Domingo Ortiz used her cellphone to record a federal agent as he smashed the car window when agents arrested her husband, Juan Francisco Méndez. The tape led to an international outcry and prompted declamation from U.S. Rep. Bill Keating. After more than two months in detention, ICE released Méndez on bond.

Dramatic street raids continued. Operation Patriot in May and Operation Patriot 2.0 arrested thousands of immigrants statewide, largely with no criminal convictions. In New Bedford, the vast majority of immigrants detained had no violent criminal convictions.

The overwhelming majority of those detained locally have been Indigenous men from Guatemala. The gender disparities led some advocates to speculate that it may point to a strategy of removing breadwinners to pressure their families to leave.

On June 8, ICE detained Emerson Garcia DosSantos as he drove his car in Fall River, leaving his U.S. citizen wife, Erika Hartman DosSantos, to fight brain cancer alone. DHS later deported Garcia DosSantos to his native Brazil. The couple is arranging for Hartman DosSantos to relocate to Brazil.

In the coming months, tactics evolved. The last confirmed street operation took place in Fairhaven on Sept. 19, when agents took three Guatemalan men into custody. Among them was Luís David Ajtzac Osório, an 18-year old with special immigrant juvenile status and a legal work permit.

Tactics have moved beyond street arrests. In July, Market Basket told 47 workers to leave their New Bedford store unless they could show proof of legal work authorization.

That demonstrated New Bedford’s economic dependence on immigrants as fear pushed people to leave their jobs, and often enough, the area. After months of terror, some businesses along Acushnet Avenue reported drops in sales as high as 50%.

The number of immigrant students enrolled in New Bedford Public Schools also dropped by 6% from last year, and a further 13% since September.

Bishop Edgar Moreira da Cunha, the prelate of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fall River, leads New Bedford’s large Catholic community. He spoke with The Light on the impact of ICE raids on church attendance.

“The United States is shooting themselves in the foot because they are doing harm to themselves by the things that they are doing,” da Cunha told The Light.

From the streets to the courts

ICE agents’ presence on the streets of New Bedford shrank significantly by the fall as federal operations shifted to other parts of the country. In Massachusetts, while street arrests have continued, ICE’s gaze fell upon district courts and immigration check-ins at the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program office in Framingham, or for check-ins at the ICE Field Office in Burlington.

Data collected by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by The Light show that over 400 arrests in Massachusetts from January to mid-October 2025 occurred across 44 courts statewide.

In Bristol County, emails obtained by The Light show routine exchanges between the sheriff’s office and ICE, including booking logs, court dates, and release times. At the Dartmouth House of Correction, jail officials often coordinated directly with ICE, sharing information that has helped facilitate immigration arrests.

However, sheriffs are limited in how much they can assist ICE, even when detainers are issued. A 2017 ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court bars sheriffs from holding someone solely on an ICE detainer once they are cleared for release, a ruling that has led to friction with federal agents.

That tension culminated in May, when the Department of Homeland Security published a list of “sanctuary jurisdictions,” accusing them of obstructing immigration enforcement. Nearly every county in Massachusetts appeared on the list, a move the president of the National Sheriffs’ Association, Kieran Donahue, criticized as arbitrary and damaging to cooperation between law enforcement and the White House.

In April, Mayor Jon Mitchell criticized ICE over a lack of transparency around Méndez’s arrest.

Communication has been inconsistent with the New Bedford Police Department as well, Police Chief Jason Thody told The Light in October. Most of the time, he said, officers learn of immigration arrests through news reports or social media.

In response to increased immigration enforcement activity and “some community pushback,” Thody issued interim guidance outlining how officers should interact with ICE when agents conduct operations in the city.

Legal developments

Enforcement continues to reflect massive changes in policy. And it has rippled into the court systems, where advocates and lawyers say many of those policies violate civil and due process rights.

Many complaints revolve around the speed at which those detained are processed and transferred outside Massachusetts. ICE detained Pascual Cuin González, a Guatemalan asylee in New Bedford, on Sept. 12, alongside his partner, Manuela Morales González.

Over the next week, authorities transferred him between Burlington and detention facilities in New York and Louisiana before agents released him to find his way back to New Bedford.

The use of Hanscom Air Force base to swiftly fly detainees out of Massachusetts prompted a letter from Gov. Maura Healey on Dec. 15 protesting the flights from the base.

“Flying these residents out of state and away from their support systems and legal counsel — often within hours of arrest — is intentionally cruel and purposely obstructs the due process and legal representation they are owed,” Healey said.

As fears of ICE permeate communities, nonprofits across the state have noticed a sizable increase in the number of residents applying for U.S. citizenship.

But many others seeking legal status, including Ajtzac Osório, the New Bedford teenager from the Fairhaven raid, have been de-documented despite following legal processes. The same day Ajtzac Osório was arrested, U.S. Citizenship and Immigrations Services removed his deferred action and later terminated his work permit.

As allegations of civil rights violations increased, so have the numbers of habeas corpus petitions filed in U.S. District Court Massachusetts. As of Dec. 29, there had been 629 habeas petitions filed in the court, 432 of which remained active. The number of habeas petitions filed continued to rise after multiple Board of Immigration Appeals decisions and an ICE policy change in July resulted in blanket bond hearing denials.

That happened to Yury Melissa Aguiriano Romero, a Honduran asylum seeker and the first confirmed female detainee from New Bedford. An immigration judge denied her a bond hearing at the behest of DHS. That judge later granted her release on bond only after a U.S. District Court judge ordered a bond hearing.

In December, U.S. District Court Judge Patti Saris declared that DHS had misclassified many detainees in order to deny their right to a bond hearing. She ordered DHS to allow for bond hearings to notify all current and future detainees within the jurisdiction of U.S. District Court Massachusetts and the Boston and Chelmsford immigration courts of that right in an appropriate language.

The rapidly shifting environment has taxed immigration lawyers, who find themselves overwhelmed with policy changes and people seeking legal representation.

The Massachusetts hub

The ICE Field Office in Burlington, where many are processed after arrest, has become a focal point of discussion over detention conditions. Stories of harsh treatment and possible civil and human rights violations have led to weekly protests outside the building and visits from federal lawmakers.

In August, The Light collected testimonies from immigrants in the Greater New Bedford area who had spent time in Burlington and, in some cases, other ICE facilities out of state. They described being kept in rooms with no windows for most of the day, receiving little food and water, and sometimes going days without bathing.

Others said their experiences in jails in New England, where immigrants were held with the general inmate population, felt more humane than ICE-run facilities.

Andrés De León Castro, arrested in Fairhaven in May and deported to Guatemala on July 12, said agents at Burlington told detainees they were not allowed to talk or move and left them in a freezing room without food or water.

“When we complained, they told us that’s what we deserved.”

Conditions inside the facility drew public attention after the release of Marcelo Gomes da Silva, a Milford High School student detained in May and held there for six days. His detention prompted a visit on June 5 by the U.S. Reps. Jake Auchincloss and Seth Moulton.

After his second visit in November, Moulton said at a news conference outside the facility that he saw fewer detainees than during his earlier visit, but that access to blankets remained a concern.

“It seems that they are moving people through here more quickly,” said Moulton. “The consequence of that is that they don’t have as much time to have lawyers intervene in their cases.”",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ice-arrest-screenshot.png,N,,2025-12-31 14:58:05.315601

California’s other legal fights with Trump This showdown is just one front in a broader war between California and the Trump administration:","The Trump administration has dropped its fight to keep California National Guard troops under federal control, a major shift in a months-long legal battle with Gov. Gavin Newsom.

In a filing Tuesday with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Department lawyers withdrew their request to maintain authority over roughly 300 Guard members still deployed in Los Angeles. The move comes after the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. Illinois, which undercut the administration’s argument for using state troops in domestic law enforcement.

Federal lawyers said they “do not oppose lifting of the partial administrative stay,” clearing the way for California to regain command.

“This admission by Trump and his occult cabinet members means this illegal intimidation tactic will finally come to an end,” Newsom posted on X. He added that he expects the court to affirm California’s authority over its Guard.

The legal battle between Trump, California explained

The fight began in June when Trump federalized 4,000 California Guard troops and sent U.S. Marines to Los Angeles after immigration raids sparked protests. Newsom called the move “a serious breach of state sovereignty” and warned it would inflame tensions.

Those tensions boiled over downtown, where demonstrators clashed with police and federal agents after raids in Paramount and Compton. Union leader David Huerta was arrested during one protest, fueling outrage among immigration advocates.

California sued, arguing Trump’s order violated constitutional limits. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer agreed, ruling the president’s theory of indefinite control “would upend the constitutional balance between state and federal power.” He ordered the troops returned to Newsom.

The administration appealed, but after the Supreme Court ruling, even conservative judges have questioned Trump’s stance.

Attorney General Rob Bonta called Tuesday’s filing “a good day for our democracy,” adding: “The President is not king.”

What’s next in the California National Guard case

The 9th Circuit is expected to lift the stay soon. Meanwhile, Congress is probing the broader use of military forces in civilian settings, raising civil liberties concerns.

For now, California appears poised to win back full control of its Guard — and score a symbolic victory in its long-running clash with Trump over immigration enforcement and state sovereignty.

Timeline: Key moments in the National Guard fight

June 6: Immigration raids in Los Angeles spark protests; union leader David Huerta arrested.

December 31, 2025

HRRC is deeply alarmed by the documented rise in the detention and physical assault of journalists in the United States, as outlined in the Freedom of the Press Foundation’s latest report. The routine detention of journalists signals a dangerous erosion of press freedom and a troubling shift in how authorities engage with independent media. HRRC calls on federal, state, and local authorities to immediately reaffirm and enforce protections for journalists, ensure accountability for abuses, and guarantee that members of the press can report freely and safely without fear of retaliation.

As press freedom is under increasing threat through legal and financial attacks in the United States, physical detention and assaults on journalists have also increased, according to a new report by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.

In 2025, at least 32 instances of journalists being detained by law enforcement while reporting were documented, in what the Freedom of the Press Foundation says represents a fundamental shift in authorities’ relationship with the press.

Nearly 90% of detentions took place during protests, the vast majority of which occurred during protests against efforts by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to arrest and deport “undocumented” immigrants. According to the report, documented instances involved journalists being detained for multiple hours at a time, sometimes while painfully handcuffed.

Though most instances involved journalists being released without charges, the detentions themselves deprived journalists of their crucial role to document and record potential abuses by law enforcement during protests.

“We know this chills their rights,” said Adam Rose, Chair of the Press Rights Committee for the LA Press Club and Deputy Director of Advocacy for Freedom of the Press Foundation, “but it also ends their shift.”

Assaults on journalists have also spiked in tandem with arrests, with nearly as many reported assaults on journalists recorded as in the previous three years combined. Half of those detained report being assaulted by officers in the lead-up to or process of being detained, including being violently forced to the ground and beaten by batons.

According to the Foundation, while covering immigration protests remains the riskiest beat for journalists’ safety and freedom, journalists have also been detained for routine news gathering, such as while covering city council meetings. The arrests represent a pattern of authorities “either poorly understanding the elements of routine newsgathering or purposefully using prosecutions to chill future reporting,” the report said.

This year, press freedom in the United States has fallen to a record low, according to Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Tracker, classified as in a “difficult situation” for the first time in the tracker’s history. In addition to physical attacks on journalists, economic factors – which force news organizations to choose between editorial independence and financial sustainability – were considered the greatest challenge.

The disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards.
The Guardian has contacted the Kennedy Center for comment.","The Kennedy Center reportedly adopted bylaws earlier this year that would limit voting to Donald Trump-appointed trustees – a controversial move that appears to reveal the long-held plan to install Trump’s name to the center.

The bylaws, in a possible breach of the institution’s charter, were revised in May and specified that board members appointed by Congress, known as ex-officio members, could not vote or count towards a quorum, according to the Washington Post.

The new rule was in force when the board voted unanimously on 18 December to add Trump’s name to the center, rebranding the building as the Donald J Trump and the John F Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.

The name change has since triggered a wave of protests. Artists have cancelled bookings and members of Congress have vowed to overturn the name change. Joyce Beatty, a Democrat from Ohio, is even suing to reverse it on the grounds that changing the center’s name requires an act of Congress.

Trump took over as chair of the board in February, quickly purging sitting members, while installing his supporters – including his longtime foreign policy adviser Ric Grenell, whom he appointed as president of the center. Grenell had been a vocal tribune of Trump’s “America First” ideology, and was not afraid to ruffle feathers during past spells as ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence (he was the first openly gay person to lead the intelligence community).

Just prior to his Kennedy Center appointment, Grenell served as the president’s envoy for special missions, and was involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela.

The center lists 34 presidentially appointed board members and 23 ex-officio members, who by law must include the mayor of Washington DC, head of the library of Congress, and the majority and minority leaders of the Senate. The federal law underpinning the center’s establishment identified ex-officio members as among the venue’s trustees, charged with maintaining it as a memorial to President John F Kennedy, the Post reported.

Roma Daravi, the center’s vice-president for public relations, told the Post that the rules had been changed in line with longstanding convention that ex-officio members did not vote: “The bylaws were revised to reflect this longstanding precedent and everyone received the technical changes both before the meeting and after revisions.”

Daravi continued: “Some members (including ex officio) attended in person, others by phone, and no concerns were voiced, no one objected, and the bylaws passed unanimously.”

Ellen Aprill, a legal scholar at UCLA, told the paper that such voting right limits breached the center’s charter.

“Clearly the intent of the charter provisions was to entrust Kennedy Center guidance to a broad group, not just those appointed by the president,” she said.

The disclosure comes as new figures showed a sharp fall in television ratings for this year’s Kennedy Center honors awards. A record low audience of 3.01m watched this year’s broadcast of the annual honors awards – hosted by Trump himself – when it was screened by CBS, marking a stark 25% downturn from last year. The event included appearances from some of Trump’s favorite artists, including Gloria Gaynor, Kiss and George Strait.

As artists cancel bookings, Trump on social media on Tuesday posted a string of statements from supporters criticizing the Kennedy family’s supposed lack of support for the center. His posts on his Truth Social network started mere hours after the Kennedy family announced the death of Tatiana Schlossberg, JFK’s granddaughter, who died aged 35, from leukemia.

In a statement, Walz’s office expressed openness to appearing before Comer’s committee while attacking the committee and President Donald Trump, who has led the attacks on the Minnesota governor and the state’s Somali population.

“We’re always happy to work with Congress, though this committee has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand,” the office said. “While the Governor has been working to ensure fraudsters go to prison, the President has been selling pardons to let them out.”

The statement did not definitively indicate whether Walz would voluntarily appear before Congress.

The president and his allies have used the fraud investigations to attack Walz, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee whom he’s seeking to unseat in the midterms, and disparage Somali immigrants in the state.

Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage” at a White House event in early December. On Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services froze hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for Minnesota’s child care programs, the latest in a string of actions the administration has taken against Minnesota in response to the fraud scandals.

In a social media post Wednesday, Trump again railed on Somali immigrants and insisted the U.S. “send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration is seeking to revoke the citizenship status of U.S. citizens of Somali descent who were charged with benefits fraud, while acknowledging that action may be rebuffed by the courts.

“It’s something the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State is currently looking at right now,” Leavitt said in a Fox News interview Wednesday morning. “We know that there are liberal activist judges across this country who will try to block and tackle this administration from pursuing justice at every turn. But that’s not gonna stop the president and his entire cabinet by acting on behalf of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens in the state of Minnesota and in states across the country who have been ripped off by people who have abused our immigration system.”

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in President Trump's first year back in office, an estimated 1.9 million people are self deporting versus more than 622,000 deportations. She is attributing it to the administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants.

In total, 2.5 million migrants have been deported.

For the holidays extending to Dec. 31, $3,000 was offered to immigrants who are in the country illegally through the CBP home app. Normally, $1,000 is offered. According to DHS's website, that money is an exit bonus, and the self-deportation also includes free travel to their home country or country where they have lawful status.

DHS will give migrants time to wrap up work, school and other personal matters before they self-deport.

It is unclear if the incentives are contributing to the self-deportation numbers or if it's mainly fear of migrants getting detained by ICE.

FOX 17 News is working to find out how many self-deportations have occurred in Tennessee. We are also looking to speak to migrants or activists who can speak on the self-deportations.

The angst from that community has been deportations include people whose only crime is crossing the border illegally, which they say is not basis for deportation. Deportations have also caused family separations.

But the president has grievances against the Miccosukee Tribe and the state of Colorado, leading lawmakers to accuse Mr. Trump of blocking the bills because of political disagreements. Throughout his second term, Mr. Trump has carried out a campaign of retribution against political opponents, law firms, universities and specific individuals.

In Florida, Mr. Trump suggested the veto of the bill to expand Miccosukee Tribe land was tied to its opposition to his immigration agenda. The Miccosukee Tribe joined a lawsuit earlier this year to block the administration from constructing an immigrant detention center in the Everglades nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz. And in Colorado, Mr. Trump has attacked the state’s leaders over the imprisonment of a former state election official, Tina Peters, for interfering with the 2020 presidential election.

“Despite seeking funding and special treatment from the federal government, the Miccosukee Tribe has actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.”

Both pieces of legislation passed by voice vote in Congress, indicating strong bipartisan support and suggesting lawmakers may try to override the president’s vetoes, which requires a two-thirds majority in both chambers. In Mr. Trump’s first term, he vetoed 10 pieces of legislation, one of which — the 2021 military policy bill — was overturned.

The Colorado legislation, which was sponsored by Representative Lauren Boebert, Republican of Colorado, would help local communities pay for the Arkansas Valley Conduit water pipeline.

“Enough is enough,” Mr. Trump wrote in a message to Congress. “My administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding expensive and unreliable policies.”

Ms. Boebert slammed the president’s veto, arguing he was “denying clean drinking water for 50,000 people in Southeast Colorado.”

“I sincerely hope this veto has nothing to do with political retaliation for calling out corruption and demanding accountability,” she said in a statement.

Ms. Boebert was a vocal supporter of releasing the Epstein files, drawing backlash from the White House, and the president has attacked Colorado’s leaders in recent weeks over Ms. Peters. She was found guilty of interfering with voting machines in an effort to prove falsehoods that they had been used to rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump. The president has pledged to pardon Ms. Peters, even though she was convicted in state court and Colorado officials argue he had no power to do so.

“This isn’t governing,” Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat of Colorado, wrote on X about the president’s veto. “It’s a revenge tour.”

The Trump administration first imposed a travel ban on 12 countries in June. After an Afghan national was arrested in the shooting of two National Guard troops in Washington over the Thanksgiving weekend, Mr. Trump vowed to extend the restrictions to more countries. This month, he expanded the ban to 19 countries, including Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, taking the total number of affected African states to 12.

Mali’s foreign ministry said it rejected the Trump administration’s argument that the action was taken because of security concerns and said the United State had made its decision without consulting Mali.

Several African countries that have adopted a more conciliatory approach and conceded to the demands to accept deportees from the United States have received exemptions from such travel bans. Weeks after Liberia agreed to receive Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March, the Trump administration extended visas for Liberians visiting the United States to 36 months from 12 months.

Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso are run my military juntas after coups in recent years. The military leaders of the countries had all largely severed ties with Washington and developed closer relations with Russia and China, as well as Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. They have also left the Economic Community of West African States, a regional alliance, and formed their own bloc.

“While this is likely to further constrain relations, it will also displace Washington’s influence,” said Beverly Ochieng, an analyst at Control Risk, a risk management group.

Since Mr. Trump was re-elected, he has sought to reshape American relations with Africa. While there have been pockets of continued engagement, such as efforts to end the war in Congo, analysts said the president has leaned heavily toward withdrawing from the continent.

Mr. Trump’s decision to slash foreign aid spending was deeply felt in Africa, which was the biggest recipient of U.S. assistance. A large number of the U.S. diplomats who were withdrawn from service this month were believed to have been posted in Africa.

Despite the American pullback, the strategic importance of countries in the Sahel region, a stretch of land that refers to countries south of the Sahara, could mean they are able to rebuild relations with Washington.

The Sahel, especially Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, account for more than half the world’s terrorism related deaths, according to the United Nations. The United States has advised its citizens not to travel to three countries because of the threat of terrorism, crime and kidnapping.

“Some of the closest partners of the Sahel countries — despite unmatched military or financial resources as the U.S. — continue to position themselves in a way that will likely grant them favorable access in strategic areas, including defense, mining and energy,” Ms. Ochieng said.

Congress required the Justice Department to release its files related to the investigations of the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein by Dec. 19. The department released about 100,000 pages on that date, and said in the days that followed that at least a million more documents still needed to be reviewed.

Since late November, the department has assigned nearly 200 lawyers from the national security division to review the documents and remove any information about victims, or anything that would compromise continuing investigations or national security. Now, Justice Department officials have told employees that they need more help to accomplish the task.

The document review is expected to take until at least Jan. 20, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Trump administration had already drawn the ire of Democrats and a few Republicans in Congress for appearing to break the law setting the deadline to release the documents.

The Justice Department has defended its handling of the matter. “We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,” the department said on social media.

But the disclosure that only a fraction of the documents have been released has only added to the troubles surrounding the rollout of the material. After the initial release on Dec. 19, some photographs were removed from the online collection because of what the department described as concerns about them possibly containing information about victims.

One image showed a credenza with an open drawer containing other photos, including at least one of Mr. Trump. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said the image was removed not to protect the president but because of concerns about whether that image contained any victims. The image was later restored to the collection.

More than a dozen schemes have come to light in Minnesota in recent years, many of them involving people of Somali origin. Prosecutors say the schemes have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. The scandal has rattled Minnesota politics and drawn the ire of the White House.

On Friday, a conservative active on social media, Nick Shirley, posted a video purporting to uncover rampant fraud in day care centers run by people of Somali origin. While day care centers in Minnesota have been prosecuted for overbilling in the past, none of the centers featured in the video have been accused of fraud by the authorities. Nevertheless, the video drew accolades from several senior White House officials.

Jim O’Neill, the deputy health secretary, said in a video statement on Tuesday that the department was pausing the funding in response to “credible allegations” of “extensive fraud” in Minnesota’s child care programs. Mr. O’Neill said he had sent a letter to the state’s governor, Tim Walz, a Democrat, demanding a thorough audit of the state’s day care centers.

In a statement, Mr. Walz’s office said the governor had been combating fraud “for years.”

“Fraud is a serious issue,” said the statement. “But this is a transparent attempt to politicize the issue to hurt Minnesotans and defund government programs that help people.”

Alex J. Adams, an assistant health secretary, joined Mr. O’Neill in the video statement and said that he had spoken on Monday with Cindi Yang, Minnesota’s child care services director, who had been unable to tell him whether fraud in the state’s social services system was isolated or widespread.

Carissa Larsen, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families, which oversees government-subsidized day care centers, said on Tuesday evening that agency officials were aware of the announcement but were not in a position to comment.

Two weeks ago, Mr. Walz applauded new federal charges in a widening, yearslong federal investigation into his state’s social services programs and promised that state officials were working to overhaul the troubled system. But Mr. Walz has been facing criticism from President Trump and Minnesota Republicans, who charge that the state lacked adequate safeguards.

Mr. Walz, who is seeking re-election, wrote in an opinion piece in The Minnesota Star Tribune this month that his state had made “significant progress” in rooting out fraud in its social services system but had “much more to do.”

“And it’s my responsibility to fix it,” he wrote.

More than 90 people have been charged in federal fraud investigations in Minnesota, which began during the Biden administration, and at least 60 have been convicted. In announcing charges against six more people accused of defrauding safety net programs, Joseph H. Thompson, the prosecutor overseeing the investigation, said this month that the authorities had identified “staggering, industrial-scale fraud” in Minnesota’s safety-net programs.

The schemes, which took root in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali community, targeted government programs meant to feed children during the Covid-19 pandemic, to help children with autism and to assist people at risk of homelessness. The authorities say that fraudsters billed the state government for social services that were never provided.

Mr. Trump has seized on the scandal, using it to unleash xenophobic tirades against America’s Somali community.

Mr. O’Neill said in his video statement that the health department had also taken steps to secure the national Administration for Children and Families system, requiring that future payments around the country would need to be certified with a receipt or photo evidence. The department also created a new hotline for reports of fraud, he added.

“We’re committed to holding bad actors accountable,” Mr. O’Neill said in the video. “Regardless of rank or office, anyone who’s involved in perpetrating this fraud against the American people should expect to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

The emails, which were made public as part of a newly unsealed judicial order, largely reflected communications about the case that Robert E. McGuire, the acting U.S. attorney in Nashville, had with members of his staff and with Aakash Singh, a top official in Mr. Blanche’s office. They raised serious questions about whether the Justice Department had misled Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw Jr., who is overseeing the case, by telling him that local prosecutors had acted alone in charging Mr. Abrego Garcia.

“These documents show that McGuire did not act alone and to the extent McGuire had input on the decision to prosecute, he shared it with Singh and others,” Judge Crenshaw wrote in the unsealed order. “Specifically, the government’s documents may contradict its prior representations that the decision to prosecute was made locally and that there were no outside influences.”

One of the emails, dated April 30, was written by Mr. Singh to Mr. McGuire and another prosecutor, Jacob Warren, as the government was building its criminal case against Mr. Abrego Garcia, who at the time was still in custody in El Salvador.

In it, Mr. Singh made clear that charging Mr. Abrego Garcia was “a top priority” for Mr. Blanche’s office. In response, Mr. McGuire wrote, “We want the high command looped in.”

A little more than two weeks later, Mr. McGuire wrote to his staff that while the ultimate decision about whether to bring charges was his own, he had heard that Mr. Blanche and his chief deputy at the time, Emil Bove III, were pushing for charges to be filed. In the email, Mr. McGuire referred to Mr. Blanche as the “DAG” — or deputy attorney general — and to Mr. Bove as the “PDAG” — or principal deputy attorney general. He also mentioned the “ODAG” — or the office of the deputy attorney general.

“I have not received specific direction from ODAG other than I have heard anecdotally that the DAG and PDAG would like Garcia charged sooner rather than later,” Mr. McGuire wrote.

Judge Crenshaw’s order was only the latest in an ever-growing series of rebukes dealt to the Justice Department as it has pursued parallel efforts to both prosecute Mr. Abrego Garcia and expel him from the country again.

Three weeks ago, a federal judge in Maryland released him from immigration custody in a scathing order that accused the Justice Department of egregious conduct that included stonewalling her, disobeying her direct instructions and even “affirmatively” misleading her about its plans to re-deport Mr. Abrego Garcia.

The judge in that case, Paula Xinis, has temporarily barred the Justice Department from taking Mr. Abrego Garcia back into custody. But on Tuesday evening, department lawyers said they would rearrest him if they were able to overcome her provisional order stopping them from doing so.

Judge Crenshaw’s order containing the excerpted emails was originally issued under seal on Dec. 3, when he instructed prosecutors to hand over the full trove of materials to Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers. The lawyers sought the communications in an effort to bolster their claims that the indictment against Mr. Abrego Garcia had been brought because the Trump administration was trying to vindictively punish him for contesting his initial deportation.

In October, Judge Crenshaw issued a preliminary ruling finding that there was a “realistic likelihood” that the administration had in fact brought the case vindictively. That decision allowed Mr. Abrego Garcia’s legal team to seek internal documents from the government.

In his initial order, the judge singled out Mr. Blanche, saying that he had made “remarkable statements” about the criminal case. On the day in June that Mr. Abrego Garcia was brought back to face indictment, Mr. Blanche went on Fox News and declared that the government had started to investigate the case only after Judge Xinis, in Maryland, had questioned the administration’s decision to deport Mr. Abrego Garcia and found that it “had no right.”

The newly released emails only pointed further at Mr. Blanche’s involvement in deciding to charge Mr. Abrego Garcia.

In one of the emails, written on May 16 as the Justice Department was nearing its decision to bring charges, Mr. Warren wrote to Mr. Singh, suggesting that Mr. Blanche was playing some sort of role in whether to seek an indictment quickly.

“If the DAG does want to move forward with the indictment on Wednesday,” Mr. Warren wrote, “we think it would be prudent to loop in the press office ASAP.”

Mr. Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have issued subpoenas to both Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh in an effort to have them testify under oath about their roles in seeking criminal charges. The Justice Department has strenuously objected to the subpoenas in a series of court filings, some written by a top department official, Stanley E. Woodward Jr.

For the moment, Judge Crenshaw has put off deciding whether to force Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh to take the witness stand — although he has put Mr. McGuire and his team in Nashville in a tough spot as they seek to rebut the judge’s preliminary finding that the case was brought vindictively.

All along, Mr. McGuire has told Judge Crenshaw that he can fight the claims of vindictiveness by placing himself and other lower-ranking witnesses from law enforcement on the stand to testify that senior Trump officials were not involved in the indictment of Mr. Abrego Garcia. But that argument lost much of its credibility after the emails were released on Tuesday.

And that has left Mr. McGuire facing a pair of bad outcomes.

If he were to go forward with his plan to overcome Judge Crenshaw’s preliminary finding of vindictiveness with testimony that the emails have already undercut, the judge could make a permanent finding of vindictiveness and immediately dismiss the indictment.

But the judge has also reserved the right to force Mr. Blanche and Mr. Singh to take the witness stand if he is unsatisfied by Mr. McGuire’s presentation. And that could lead to embarrassing questions being asked of some of the Justice Department’s most senior leaders.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/31/multimedia/31trump-news-promo-mqhv/31trump-news-promo-mqhv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 12:13:17.833372

No one from the federal government has contacted the county about plans, the head of the board of supervisors told News4. He flagged concerns about what a detention center in Stafford County might mean for the community.

News4 asked Board of Supervisors Chairman Deuntay Diggs if the county could support the level of infrastructure a major detention facility would need.

""No, not currently, and that's one of the bigger concerns with this potential detention facility. With 5,000 to 10,000 detainees, that's going to require upgrades in infrastructure, and that is going to come at the cost of the taxpayer,” he said.

Diggs said providing water, sewer and other resources to a federal facility would come at a cost.

News4 asked Diggs if he thinks such a facility is a move in the right direction for Stafford County.

""I don't believe so at this time. I think it changes the character and the nature of Stafford. We have a lot of history in Stafford. We're a very diverse community. Our constituents have been asking for things to do for the family, for kids, and this doesn't track with that direction,” he said.

News4 reached out to ICE and the Department of Homeland Security to ask about plans and did not hear back.

ICE is planning to hold 80,000 immigrants in warehouses around the country to speed up deportations, the Post reported.

While specifics on a potential facility in Stafford County are scarce, opinions are not.

“I mean, is that necessary? And is it morally right?” one resident asked. “That’s more so what I’m really concerned about.”

Included in the list of countries are Ecuador, Honduras, and Uganda, among others.

This is the latest effort by the current administration to reduce immigration to the United States. In October, the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals found that immigration judges should consider third-country removal prior to hearing an asylum case in the United States. In November, DHS asked immigration judges to dismiss nearly 5,000 cases. The basis of dismissal is not known.

The third country agreement gives the U.S. the ability to remove and relocate individuals to any of the countries in the program. In return, these countries typically receive some preferred treatment, like additional security support. In 2019, an interim final rule was issued, allowing the U.S. to reach agreement with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as third country partners. Per that agreement, if individuals were considered safe to apply for asylum in any one of those countries, they were barred from applying in the United States. Several lawsuits were filed, challenging the program. Additional lawsuits are expected in response to the current agreement.

In response, deniers of the program state it is eroding U.S. humanitarian programs. The program is considered another avenue for meeting Trump administration removal goals.

The Department of Justice argues the law violates the U.S. Constitution's supremacy clause and endangers federal officers.

Illinois officials state the law protects residents' constitutional rights from overreach by federal agents.

SPRINGFIELD — In an expected move, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit last week seeking to nullify a new state law that allows Illinois residents to sue federal immigration agents who arrest them in or near courthouses or if they believe their constitutional rights were violated.

The suit was filed by the Department of Justice in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. It alleges that the law, passed by the Democrat-led state legislature in October and signed by Pritzker earlier this month, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution and increases the likelihood that officers face threats and harassment.

“Threatening officers with ruinous liability and even punitive damages for executing federal law and for simply protecting their identities and their families also chills the enforcement of federal law and compromises sensitive law enforcement operations,” the Department of Justice said in a statement.

The complaint names Gov. JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul as defendants.

A spokesperson for Pritzker said in a statement to Capitol News Illinois that “the Trump Administration’s masked agents are not targeting the ‘worst of the worst' — they are harassing and detaining law-abiding U.S. citizens and Black and Brown people at daycares, hospitals, and courthouses.”

“This new law reflects our belief that no one is above the law, regardless of their position or authority,” the spokesperson said. “Unlike the Trump Administration, Illinois is protecting constitutional rights in our state.""

Response to blitz

Pritzker signed the law in the aftermath of “Operation Midway Blitz,” a federal immigration enforcement campaign that targeted the Chicago region starting in September.

The Department of Homeland Security said that the operation resulted in the arrest of more than 4,500 immigrants who were living in Chicago and its suburbs without legal permission. But the raids often led to violent confrontations between masked federal agents and protestors during various operations in the city and suburbs, including near an Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview. Many of these skirmishes resulted in the deployment of tear gas and other chemical agents.

Leading Illinois Democrats viewed the new law as a comprehensive legislative response to the blitz that provides safeguards to people in their interactions with immigration agents. It also places new requirements on public colleges and universities, hospitals and child care facilities and mostly prohibits them from disclosing the immigration status of students, patients, parents and children.

But the reach of the law is limited. Not included in the package is an outright ban on law enforcement officers wearing face masks while on duty, for instance.

Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, acknowledged before the bill passed that the state was “playing with a stacked deck” versus a federal government with the “upper hand” and that the law would likely be challenged.

Courthouse, private right of action provisions targeted

In its 22-page filing, the federal government specifically challenged the provisions relating to immigration agents’ actions in and around state courthouses as well as the private right of action that it created, arguing that “states have no power to ‘in any manner control the operations of’ the federal government.”

Under the law, all people attending court are considered “privileged from civil arrest” inside state courthouses and within a 1,000-foot buffer zone outside of the buildings.

Though there had long been a de facto understanding that such facilities were off-limits for immigration enforcement, they have increasingly been the site of apprehensions over the past year. Those who violate the act could be liable for statutory damages of $10,000.

The law also allows residents to sue immigration agents for violating their constitutional right to due process and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

They would be able to collect punitive damages that can increase if the agents are wearing masks, concealing their identities, failing to wear body cameras or using a vehicle with a non-Illinois or obscured license plate.

“That is a policy choice for Congress, not each individual state, to make,” Justice Department lawyers wrote in their filing, predicting that the law will “inevitably become a vehicle to threaten and harass federal officers.”

Latest state-federal immigration clash

It is not the first time the state and federal government have been entangled in litigation relating to immigration policy.

The Trump administration earlier this year filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate, under the supremacy clause, a state law and Chicago and Cook County ordinances that limit state and local law enforcement’s cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. A federal judge dismissed the suit in July.

And Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration in October to block the planned deployment of National Guard Troops to the nation's third largest city. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court denied an emergency appeal from the Trump administration seeking to lift a temporary restraining order put in place by a lower court that prevents the deployment of troops while the underlying case works through the courts.

Israeli authorities say the organizations did not meet new registration requirements that include sharing detailed information about staff, funding and operations. Israel continues to claim without evidence that Hamas is infiltrating the distribution of aid, a charge the aid groups have repeatedly denied. The announcement drastically harms Gaza’s residents who rely heavily on the aid groups for medical care, food and shelter. For instance, MSF is responsible for 20% of the hospital beds and supports a third of all births in Gaza. In a statement issued last week in anticipation of Israel’s announcement, MSF said, “If Israeli authorities revoke MSF’s access to Gaza in 2026, a large portion of people in Gaza will lose access to critical medical care, water, and lifesaving support. MSF’s activities serve nearly half a million people in Gaza through our vital support to the destroyed health system.” We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon awarded Boeing an $8.6 billion contract to build and deliver 25 new F-15 fighter jets for the Israeli Air Force. The announcement comes after President Trump met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Mar-a-Lago. The U.S. is the largest supplier of arms to Israel.

Russia launched an overnight drone attack in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa, injuring four people, including three children. The strike comes as Russia claims to have moved a nuclear-capable missile system into Belarus, a day after Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a drone attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s residence. Russian officials doubled down on the claim Tuesday but refused to provide any evidence. Meanwhile, national security advisers from several European countries are set to meet in Ukraine on Saturday, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Speaking to reporters, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine could be reached within weeks.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk: “The key outcome of recent days is the American declaration, and this is, of course, something new — some were even surprised — the American declaration of the United States’ readiness to participate in security guarantees for Ukraine after the conclusion of peace, including the presence of American troops, for example, on the border or on the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia.”

In Iran, mass protests over the country’s dire economic situation, including a collapsing currency and high inflation, have spread from businesses to universities. According to social media posts, students protested Tuesday at six university campuses in the capital Tehran, as well as in Isfahan and Yazd. The posts showed students chanting “Freedom” and “Don’t be afraid! We are all together.” Clashes broke out between students and security forces near the University of Tehran. This comes as Iran responded to President Trump’s threats that he would support new strikes against the country over its nuclear program. On social media, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that any actions against Iran would be “severe and regret-inducing.” This is the head of Iran’s parliament on Tuesday.

Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf: “I emphasize that Iran does not seek permission from anyone to defend itself. The Iranian people’s response to any widespread adventurism and evil is unapologetic and even unexpected.”

At least two oil tankers have reportedly arrived in Venezuela in recent days, with other vessels navigating toward the Venezuelan coast, despite the Trump administration’s blockade. The two other tankers approaching Venezuela are not under sanctions and are part of a fleet from China. It’s unclear whether China will press the Trump administration to secure the safe passage of the vessels as the United States ramps up its military forces against Venezuela.

This comes as a New York Times investigation has offered a glimpse into the physical evidence following mounting U.S. military strikes on boats off the Caribbean. The Times reports that days after a U.S. boat strike in November, a scorched 30-foot-long boat washed ashore a Colombian peninsula, followed by two bodies and dozens of packets, some of which had traces of a substance that smelled and looked like marijuana. The damning new details contradict President Trump’s claims of targeting cocaine and fentanyl traffickers. Marijuana is legal in at least 40 U.S. states.

In Bolivia, protests led by miners have entered a second week, with police forces on Tuesday firing tear gas at demonstrators in the capital La Paz. Protesters have condemned new austerity measures issued by the government of President Rodrigo Paz Pereira, who took office in early November. The decree has doubled gasoline prices and tripled diesel costs, with labor leaders and workers saying the new reforms will also skyrocket food and transportation costs for communities living in poverty. This is one of the protesters.

Franz Apulaca: “We’ve been repressed with rubber bullets, with weapons. We are fighting for a just cause. It is for Bolivia. We will fight to the end, until we get this cursed decree repealed.”

Honduran presidential runner-up Salvador Nasralla has formally filed an appeal to challenge the results of last month’s contested election. There are mounting accusations of fraud after conservative Nasry Asfura was declared the winner, nearly one month after voters took to the polls in an electoral process that was riddled with technical issues and a lack of transparency. Asfura was personally endorsed by President Trump, which was widely criticized as a way to intervene in Honduras’s election. Nasralla lost to Asfura by less than 1% of the vote and is seeking a review and recount of voter ballots.

The state of Florida executed 19 people on death row this year, a record high that nearly doubled the national average. That’s according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which said Florida’s executions accounted for about 40% of the country’s total this year. Advocates calling to abolish the death penalty have warned many of those put to death suffered from mental illnesses or were not given access to proper legal representation in their cases. Others were victims of abuse. Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis has been accused of expediting executions for political gain. Unlike other states, where the courts are more steadily involved in the process, Florida’s governor has the sole authority to issue execution warrants.

A newly unsealed order in the criminal case against Kilmar Ábrego García revealed that Justice Department officials pushed for his indictment, calling it a “top priority,” after he was wrongfully sent to El Salvador’s mega-prison CECOT and then returned to the U.S. under a court order. Meanwhile, ICE says it will not rearrest Kilmar Ábrego García again as long as a federal judge’s order blocking his detention remains in place. The Justice Department brought human smuggling charges against García for driving in a car with other undocumented immigrants. García is seeking to dismiss his case on the grounds that the Trump administration is targeting him.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/14/80414/full_hd/hd11-SSudan-Deportation.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 14:57:52.591846
