,Policy,2025-08-13 23:49:25+00:00,POLITICO,Chris Murphy goes all in on funding bill boycott as Dems seek bipartisanship - POLITICO,Jennifer Scholtes,,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/13/chris-murphy-senate-funding-boycott-trump-protest-00505880,"But in recent weeks, he opposed all spending measures advanced during Senate Appropriations Committee markups for which he was present, challenged his Republican counterpart on the DHS funding bill and voted “no” on the Senate’s first bipartisan funding package of the year.
28-to-1 votes are lonely.” So far, Murphy isn’t slamming his colleagues for embracing bipartisan negotiations, and his peers aren’t directly criticizing his approach.
Nine days later, Senate Republicans banded together to pass that bill.
“The bills themselves are good, bipartisan bills,” said Murphy.
“And you know,” Murphy continued, “he’s going to use the money in this budget to treat immigrants like animals.”","“Every single day, there’s new evidence that our democracy is falling, and you’ve got to take stands. You have to take fights,” Murphy explained. “I just worry — every time that we go along with these appropriations bills, we’re putting a bipartisan veneer of endorsement on an illegal process that’s ultimately part of his campaign to destroy our democracy.”

As the top Democrat on the appropriations panel that funds the Department of Homeland Security, Murphy occupies a role that has historically demanded across-the-aisle collaboration. But in recent weeks, he opposed all spending measures advanced during Senate Appropriations Committee markups for which he was present, challenged his Republican counterpart on the DHS funding bill and voted “no” on the Senate’s first bipartisan funding package of the year.

“I’m nothing if not consistent. I don’t like the position I’m in,” Murphy said. “It’s lonely. 28-to-1 votes are lonely.”

So far, Murphy isn’t slamming his colleagues for embracing bipartisan negotiations, and his peers aren’t directly criticizing his approach. But they aren’t exactly praising him either.

“He has the right to his opinion,” said the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, Patty Murray of Washington. “And I just have the opinion that the more we can do to get bills done, the better chance we have of getting better things for our country.”

Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, one of Murphy’s friends and another senior member of the Appropriations Committee, said Democrats have a duty to at least attempt to strike a cross-party compromise on federal spending ahead of the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.

“I’m not his spokesperson,” said Schatz, who is in line to be the chamber’s Democratic whip in the next Congress. “So all I can say is: We’ve been demanding a bipartisan process. So when there’s a step in that direction, I think it’s our obligation to try to be constructive.”

While Murphy has never been a moderate, he has grown rapidly into a liberal firebrand in recent years. Once best known on Capitol Hill for his advocacy for gun control and his foreign policy expertise, he’s now a frequent anti-Trump voice on cable news shows and has waded into controversial social topics like the nation’s “male identity” crisis.

But Murphy’s latest political stand against Trump comes as his name is floated for a bigger-stage battle against Republicans — this time as a presidential contender in 2028.

If the 52-year-old senator seeks the Democratic nomination in three years, his protest of government funding bills could help differentiate him as a candidate who fought the Trump administration with more than just verbal criticism.

“It does fit, right? These are strategies that would make sense if he’s interested in a national platform and to run for office like president,” said Hans Noel, a Georgetown University professor who studies presidential nominations.

“There’s some appeal to a lot of voters — of fighting — especially at the national stage, where he doesn’t have to worry about winning over allies for legislative progress,” Noel continued. “Murphy has been somebody who’s been talking on a national stage for a long time. It’s not completely new. But he’s somebody who’s got that kind of appeal.”

This past week, Murphy spent his birthday at an event with progressives in Arizona, where he talked broadly about the need for Democrats to balance opposition with real policy commitments: “We can’t just be against Donald Trump. We’ve got to give people a vision of something different.”

Since Trump’s election last November, Murphy has grown a beard, announced the end of his 17-year marriage and sparked rumors about romantic ties to a prominent Democratic strategist. In April, he hosted a town hall back in rural North Carolina — more than 500 miles from his blue home state. Then this summer, he launched a PAC aimed at taking on Trump and Republicans in Congress.

Murphy hasn’t always resisted negotiations with Republicans. In 2022, after a gunman left 21 people dead inside a Texas elementary school, he undertook weeks of painstaking talks that resulted in the first significant federal gun-control legislation in two decades. It was the culmination of a nearly decade-long fight for Murphy, who represented Sandy Hook Elementary School in the House at the time of that devastating 2012 shooting.

His next foray into bipartisan talks did not have a happy ending. Last year he scrupulously crafted the high-profile bipartisan border deal with Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, in an attempt to enact Congress’ first major immigration overhaul in more than three decades. Then Trump chilled Republican support for the bill.

To Murphy, it signaled that Republicans couldn’t be trusted to be good-faith actors in negotiations to fund the government: “I think that drama was early proof that they’re never going to cross him,” he said of Republicans’ loyalty to Trump.

This belief was further cemented when Murphy’s GOP colleagues cleared Trump’s $9 billion rescission request last month targeting public broadcasting and foreign aid.

“They can say that they’re going to honor the words on the page,” Murphy said. Yet if Trump “decides to ignore the law,” he continued, “I just don’t think that my Republican colleagues are going to really fight to protect it.”

Democratic leadership’s interest in engaging in bipartisan funding negotiations, from which Murphy is abstaining, is a relatively new development. Just a month ago, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer penned a lengthy “dear colleague” letter insinuating that his members should cut off cross-party talks if Republicans accepted the White House’s rescissions package.

Nine days later, Senate Republicans banded together to pass that bill. And five days after that, Schumer stood with his House counterpart, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, to announce that Democrats still “want to pursue a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations process.”

It has left Murphy as the lone Democratic appropriator continually opposing the funding bills his colleagues are trying to advance, even as he readily admits it’s not the substance of the spending measures he’s against.

“The bills themselves are good, bipartisan bills,” said Murphy. “It’s just — I don’t believe that anything in there is actually going to be implemented.”

This is the case Murphy said he wants to get through to Sen. Katie Britt, the Alabama Republican who chairs the Homeland Security appropriations panel opposite Murphy. The two lawmakers were seen last month in a heated exchange in the well of the Senate floor after passage of the clawback request. Britt described the conversation, captured by C-SPAN cameras, as “a spirited dialogue,” vowing: “I’ll continue to work in good faith, as I always have.”

Murphy, however, said negotiations on the DHS funding bill will be meaningless if Trump and Republicans are going to undermine the spending directives when the measure becomes law. “We had an animated discussion,” Murphy said of his talk with Britt. “Obviously it’s hard to write a bill when the administration is going to stab you in the back as soon as you write it, especially in a space as difficult as immigration and DHS.”

He pointed to specific examples of how Trump has already undermined appropriators, including the president’s efforts to fund the controversial “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration detention center in Florida by diverting money Congress appropriated for “humane” alternatives to detainment.

“And you know,” Murphy continued, “he’s going to use the money in this budget to treat immigrants like animals.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F32%2F7c%2F0b7affef43898bd342f60d0c3c96%2Fu-s-congress-36768.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 20:56:21.511241

The judge also barred the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from sharing Medicaid data with DHS, saying that Washington and the multistate coalition were likely to succeed on their claim that the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act’s prohibition on arbitrary and capricious agency action.

The preliminary injunction will remain in place either until after HHS and DHS complete a reasoned decision-making process that complies with the Administrative Procedure Act, or until litigation concludes.

“Protecting people’s private health information is vitally important,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “And everyone should be able to seek medical care without fear of what the federal government may do with that information.”

On July 1, Washington joined a multistate coalition led by California to sue the Trump administration, arguing that the mass transfer of Medicaid data violates the law and asking the court to block any new transfer or use of this data for immigration enforcement purposes. The lawsuit highlighted that the administration’s illegal actions are creating fear and confusion, leading eligible noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid. This leaves states and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency health care services.

Washington’s Medicaid program is operated as a part of the broader Apple Health suite of health benefits programs. Washington residents signed up for Apple Health understanding that their information would be confidential and not shared for reasons unrelated to the provision of health care.

Apple Health includes Apple Health Expansion, which provides full-scope medical services to Washington residents regardless of their immigration status. There are more than 1.9 million Apple Health clients in Washington, including about 49,000 whose immigration status makes them ineligible for some federally funded programs. Apple Health covers a range of health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, primary and preventative care, long-term services and supports, and behavioral health.

Brown joined the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont in filing the lawsuit.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained at least six people in Oakland on Tuesday, Aug. 12, at a home on 79th Avenue near Hillside Street. Among the detainees are a 17-year-old and someone with a severe disability, according to Nikolas De Bremaeker, immigrants’ rights managing attorney at Centro Legal.

De Bremaeker said he met with the detainees Tuesday after a call was received through the Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline (ACILEP).

“I pressed with ICE the illegality of detention of a child under these circumstances, and they will either release or move to a child detention center tonight,” De Bremaeker told The Oaklandside in an email.

The detainees are being held at the San Francisco ICE Field Office, according to De Bremaeker.

“A child is supposed to be held in a facility appropriate for children with certain requirements, as dictated by the Flores Settlement,” he said, referring to a 1997 settlement that establishes rules and regulations for the treatment of children in U.S. federal custody.

Centro Legal is one of the organizations working with ACILEP, a county program launched in February in response to the Trump Administration’s targeted immigration enforcement. ACILEP connects people with legal aid and helps verify reported ICE sightings in Alameda County.

In June, the Oakland Police Department confirmed to The Oaklandside that ICE agents have conducted targeted enforcement in the city for specific individuals, but didn’t provide further information.

An ICE spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the arrests prior to publication.

This is the first confirmed ICE sighting in Oakland that came through the hotline, according to Centro Legal’s program manager, Angel Ibarra.

“It was thanks to the calls we received from the community and family that we were able to verify the activity and connect them with Niko [De Bremaeker] for legal support,” said Ibarra via email.

California is the state with the largest population of people residing in the U.S. without legal authorization, with estimates ranging from 2.3 million to 2.6 million according to the American Immigration Council and the Pew Research Center. Texas and Florida have the second and third largest populations, at 2.1 million and 1.2 million respectively. In the first five months of the second Trump administration, Texas accounted for 26,341 ICE arrests, roughly a quarter of the total nationwide for that period, while Florida logged 12,982 arrests, and there were 8,460 in California, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of data obtained from the UC Berkeley-based Deportation Data Project. In terms of ICE arrests per one million residents, California ranked 27th in the nation, according to the LA Times analysis.

According to a San Francisco Chronicle analysis of the records obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE arrests in the San Francisco “area of responsibility” (which includes Kern County and north in California in addition to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam) increased 70% in the first months of President Donald Trump’s second term when compared to final six months of the Biden administration, for a total of 1,730 arrests. In December 2024, approximately 10% of the people ICE arrested in the San Francisco area of responsibility had no criminal convictions. The proportion has been steadily increasing in 2025, according to the SF Chronicle analysis, with 40% of ICE arrests in May in the area involving people with no criminal conviction.

De Bremaeker reminded community members of their constitutional rights under the 4th and 5th Amendments.

“It is unclear why this home raid happened, but a resident opened the door. I want to remind all to use your constitutional right to remain silent. Do not open your door,” De Bremaeker said. “ICE can’t come into your home unless they have a signed court/judge warrant or you let them in.”

Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license.","This article was produced in partnership with Gulf States Newsroom.

Alexander Sanchez had only been in the United States for two months when police officers pulled him over one morning in December near a major intersection in Kenner, about 10 miles outside of New Orleans.

It was a routine stop — the Kenner Police officers who pulled him over said Sanchez had run a red light — but it ended with Sanchez in a federal immigration detention center.

According to the police report, when an officer asked Sanchez for his driver’s license and his car’s registration and insurance information, Sanchez – who was undocumented and could not obtain a driver’s license in Louisiana – handed him a Honduran passport.

Speaking through an interpreter in a phone interview in June, Sanchez said he told the officer, “No tengo permitido” — I’m not permitted.

Sanchez was booked into the Kenner jail for driving without a license and the traffic signal violation. He said he spent three days in jail and then he was taken to federal immigration detention in rural Louisiana.

Hours after his arrest, Kenner, officers filled out a second arrest report for Sanchez based on a procedural request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — called an immigration detainer. Detainers are used to request that local law enforcement either let ICE know when they’re going to release detainees who may be subject to deportation or to hold them for 48 hours beyond when they would otherwise be released to facilitate their transfer to immigration detention.

Sanchez would be held for months inside a notorious former state prison in Winnfield — now used for immigration detainees — with a history of alleged human rights abuses. (Sanchez is no longer in immigration detention, he asked that his current location not be disclosed. He is identified by his middle name and second last name for the same reason.)

Sanchez’ case is hardly unique in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans with a large Hispanic population.

Gulf States Newsroom and Verite News analyzed Kenner Police Department arrest records for the first five months of this year and found that traffic arrests from stops and crashes in that city are serving as a gateway to immigration detention — and possible deportation — for many.

President Donald Trump came into office this year promising a nationwide crackdown undocumented immigrants. Among the tools his administration has used more extensively are detainer requests, which were up more than 60 percent in the first five months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, according to federal data reported by the Deportation Data Project.

But in Kenner, the increase has been even more dramatic. ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the 20 detainers issued through Kenner PD during the same period in 2024.

The vast majority of people booked on immigration detainers after being arrested by Kenner police from January through May were born in Honduras, according to the data shared by the Deportation Data Project.

According to Kenner arrest records, at least 75 of them, more than half, were initially booked for traffic-related offenses following a stop or collision.

The most common traffic offense linked to an immigration detainer was driving without a license — under state law, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Louisiana licenses — often accompanied by other traffic-related charges.

More than half of the people whom Kenner PD arrested for unlicensed driving between January and May 2025 became subjects of immigration detainer requests, like the one issued for Sanchez.

Asked for comment on Sanchez’s case, an ICE spokesperson said the agency “defers to KPD.”

Rachel Taber, a member of New Orleans-based immigrants rights group Union Migranté, said she has been consulting with people whose loved ones have ended up detained and in some cases deported after traffic stops in Kenner. She stressed that the arrests can traumatize families who may be separated over a traffic offense.

“The penalty doesn’t fit the crime,” Taber said. “A minor traffic infraction does not merit … never being able to hug your kids again.”

As of Tuesday (Aug. 12) it was not clear how many of the people for whom detainers were issued had more serious criminal records. (Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom have requested all criminal background check information obtained by Kenner law enforcement.)

ICE issued at least 129 immigration detainers through Kenner PD between January and May, a more than sixfold increase from the same period in 2024.

As more local departments, encouraged by Trump, are partnering with ICE, similar patterns are emerging throughout the country. In June, The Washington Post reported on how expanding partnerships between ICE and police agencies around the country have deployed traffic arrests as part of the machinery of immigration enforcement.

Though Louisiana law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE in the past, no such formal partnerships were in place at the beginning of this year, when Trump took office. This year, however, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and his conservative allies in the state legislature have strongly pushed for their adoption. And in March, Kenner PD became one of the first Louisiana departments to ink a new agreement with the federal agency, although as of last month, that program had not been fully implemented, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in an interview.

To Conley, ICE’s increased reliance on local law enforcement, and its use of detainers, shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the emphasis on local-federal partnerships from both Trump and Landry, who has pushed local agencies in Louisiana to cooperate with federal immigration agencies.

“I think it was the perfect storm, with a governor coming in that’s very law-and-order, and then you have the president coming in that ran on immigration reform and border security. So I don’t think it’s a coincidence now that we had these spikes,” he said.

Conley said traffic enforcement is the “number one” concern for Kenner constituents. Driving without a license is a particular concern because of the risk that unlicensed and uninsured drivers may cause an accident, and the other drivers involved may “never get made whole,” Conley said.

Michele Waslin, assistant director of the Immigration History Research Center at University of Minnesota, said that scenario is why some states have expanded eligibility for driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants.

“Obviously, people are driving without licenses. You’re not stopping them from driving,” Waslin said. “We want them to be licensed and insured … so in the case that there is an accident, what you described won’t happen.”

Waslin, who has studied the intersection of driver’s license policy and immigration enforcement, said laws blocking undocumented immigrants from accessing licenses “very clearly intersect with agreements with state and local police to identify people for deportation.”

Conley said his agency is not enforcing immigration law, but making arrests based on criminal laws.

“They’re in our lockup based on a lawful criminal arrest. If [Homeland Security Investigations] calls and puts a detainer on them, I’m going to honor the detainer,” Conley said, referring to a branch of ICE that investigates immigration violations.

‘You’re going to get brought to jail’

Sanchez fled Honduras after receiving death threats, according to his immigration attorney, Jeremy Jong. In October, he settled in the New Orleans metro area, near his aunt, Judith Cruz.

On the morning Sanchez was arrested, he was driving to Cruz’s house in St. Rose, which borders Kenner, to take her to church, Cruz said in an interview.

Sanchez couldn’t get a driver’s license because Louisiana requires applicants for driver’s licenses to show proof that they are in the country legally.

Driving without a license is considered a misdemeanor in Louisiana. According to a Kenner city ordinance, the penalty for driving without a license is up to $500 in fines and no more than 60 days behind bars, The state penalty is more stringent , with possible fines and a maximum of six months behind bars.

Though it is a crime, not all law enforcement agencies routinely arrest people for driving without a license. In Kenner, however, it’s required. For undocumented immigrants like Sanchez, an arrest can lead to an ICE detainer request, then a lengthy stay in immigration detention and possible deportation.

Conley said police in Kenner have long been required to arrest anyone suspected of driving without a license. In an interview in May, the police chief said his department has been “transparent” about its policy.

“Here in the city of Kenner, it’s very well known that if you’re operating a vehicle and you’ve never been issued a license, you’re going to get brought to jail,” he said.

Kenner PD is a potential outlier. Verite News and Gulf States Newsroom asked 10 law enforcement agencies in the region, including the Louisiana State Police, about their policies and practices for encounters with unlicensed drivers. Of the seven that responded, only one other agency – St. Charles Parish Sheriff’s Office – has a mandatory arrest policy on suspicion of driving without a license.

Through a translator, Cruz said she knows many immigrants in her community who have been arrested by Kenner Police and booked into the city’s local jail for traffic violations. She said some of them, like her nephew, ended up in the hands of immigration agents.

She said mothers who need to provide for their children and cannot always get a ride will take the risk of driving without a license in order to get to and from work.

“Mothers have no choice but to work to provide for our families. And when you drive to work, you’re taking your life in your hands,” Cruz said. “It’s just very painful to think about all the children that could be left home without their families.”

There are two main ways that ICE learns of people in local jails who may have violated federal immigration law. When someone is booked into jail, that person’s information is often electronically shared with multiple federal agencies, according to Lindsay Williams, a public information officer for ICE.

If agents at ICE find the person is suspected of immigration violations, they’ll contact the ICE office responsible for the region where the arrest was made, and that office will issue a detainer, Williams said. Local or state agencies can also inform ICE agents in their area about people in custody. Williams said officials in the New Orleans ICE office learn about arrests by Kenner PD through both methods.

The records obtained by the newsrooms do not shed light on why authorities requested an immigration detainer for each individual in Kenner.

A boom in federal-local immigration enforcement partnerships under Trump

The jump in detainers issued to Kenner PD aligns with a national increase in ICE’s use of these requests that may be attributed to pressure from the Trump administration to ramp up immigration arrests in order to fulfill his campaign promise of mass deportations.

In the early days of his second term Trump urged homeland security officials to secure more agreements with local agencies to collaborate on immigration enforcement. These partnerships – called 287(g) agreements – deputize local officials to perform some ICE duties.

“If you want to increase the number of deportations, if you want large numbers, then you’re going to use these partnerships more and more,” Waslin said.

In Louisiana, Landry, an immigration hardliner and Trump ally, began laying the groundwork for increased state and local participation in immigration enforcement in 2024. During that year’s legislative session, Landry worked with Republican lawmakers on a civil law that prohibits law enforcement agencies from following so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit cooperation with ICE. This June, Landry signed a new piece of legislation with sharper teeth into law, making it a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for local officials to refuse to comply with immigration detainer requests.

As of mid-August, ICE has 897 active partnerships with agencies around the country for the 287(g) program, according to the agency – compared to 135 in December near the end of the Biden Administration. In Louisiana, which had no participants enrolled in the program at the end of last year, 17 agencies, including Kenner PD, have signed up.

While the department is not yet fully accredited in the program, Williams, the ICE representative, said Kenner PD’s existing relationship with the agency was a “main contributing factor” to securing the partnership.

“The relationship is a stellar example of state and local cooperation with ICE for upholding public safety and has been for many years across multiple presidential administrations,” Williams said in an email.

Once accredited, Kenner PD will operate under what is called a “jail enforcement model,” which authorizes police officers to investigate immigration statuses of people booked into the city’s jail, place them into immigration proceedings and issue immigration detainers themselves.

‘A failure to yield upended her life’

In some cases in Kenner, people were involved in traffic crashes other people had a hand in — only to be arrested and later booked by immigration agents, Kenner PD records show.

In an incident on March 7, a woman spoke to police as the victim of an alleged hit-and-run, according to a probable cause statement in arrest reports.

Police arrested her for driving without a license, and she was booked on an ICE detainer the next day. Conley said people involved in an accident will be asked if they have a driver’s license and will “be held to the law.”

In Kenner, records do show arrests of some people who were accused of crimes with serious penalties and then booked on immigration detainers. For example, between January and May, 2025, Kenner police took at least three people into custody who were suspected of sex-related crimes and then booked on detainers.

Nationally, the share of people arrested by immigration officers who also have past criminal convictions has fallen when compared to the previous presidential administration, one recent analysis showed.

Jong, an attorney at immigrants rights organization Al Otro Lado, said he’s had a few clients who have been detained after being arrested for traffic offenses in Kenner.

He still thinks about a client, a woman from El Salvador, who was arrested by Kenner police officers for allegedly failing to obey a traffic sign back in 2017. Jong said the woman’s family was “ruined” by her deportation.

“A failure to yield upended her life and split up this family,” Jong said. “Her husband was torn up.”

Jong said knowing the possible consequences for arrests of immigrants in Kenner, he doesn’t understand the department’s policy of arresting people who are unable to obtain driver’s licenses in the state for not having them.

“There’s so much discretion for a police department to determine what laws you’re gonna put people in jail for,” Jong said. “It does seem like they are making the conscious decision to do something that is gonna lead to many of their residents getting deported.”

In an email, Conley said the responsibility lies with the individual who isn’t licensed, and that Kenner is “diverse and inclusive.”

Sanchez was detained for five months at Winn Correctional Center. He said near the end of his time there, he experienced headaches daily and became paranoid – fearful of the danger he said he escaped in Honduras.

He said he thinks fondly about his time in Louisiana before he was arrested because he felt safe.

“Things were going pretty well for me,” he said. “I wasn’t in danger.”

He said he tries not to think about his time in immigration detention.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/84debb5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4b%2F24%2F871f4ab14d4aa1043c3d34f2cea7%2F20250811-czb-kenner-02-2000x1334.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:48.750762

ICE recruitment efforts have also targeted active local law enforcement officers.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced on Tuesday that the agency has received over 100,000 applications in less than two weeks. The statement was released only a day after The New York Times reported that immigrant detainees in ICE custody had reached a ""modern record"" high of 60,000 people.

President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) on July 4, which appropriated nearly $75 billion to increase ICE's capacity to detain immigrants and conduct immigration-related arrests—making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country. With this funding, the Trump administration plans to reach its stated goal of deporting 1 million undocumented immigrants a year and reach an unprecedented quota of 3,000 immigrant arrests per day.

To keep up with these demands, ICE has launched an aggressive recruitment campaign—bankrolled by the nearly $30 billion from the OBBBA appropriated for hiring—and seeks to add 10,000 officers to the agency's more than 20,000 law enforcement and support personnel by 2029. To meet this end, Uncle Sam has been repurposed by ICE to recruit ""patriotic Americans"" to apply. The agency has also sweetened the deal by offering high starting salaries—some can reach $90,000—a maximum $50,000 signing bonus over three years, up to $60,000 in federal student loan repayments, and retirement benefits.

Last week, the agency also announced it was ending the age limitations for applicants—previously set between 21 and 37 or 40 years old, depending on the position—and began reaching out to retired federal law enforcement agents. The ICE recruitment website has a specific page dedicated to those who wish to ""return to mission,"" encouraging retirees to apply for ICE openings and ""secure our communities and uphold our laws"" during a ""pivotal moment in our country's history."" Selected retired federal law enforcement officers may also receive a salary from ICE while still collecting their pension.

Some speculate that the change to age limits and other policies means that ICE is having a hard time finding qualified applicants. But Tom Homan, the White House border czar, defended the move. ""There are a lot of roles at ICE for people who are over 40,"" he told Time magazine. ""Just because someone comes in and they're 55—maybe they can't carry a badge and a gun, they can certainly do administrative duty, they can do targeting on the intelligence team.""

John Sandweg, acting director of ICE under the Obama administration, told Time that recruiting from retired federal law enforcement was a ""pretty creative solution"" to quickly fill thousands of openings and get boots on the ground. Retired law enforcement officers won't need as much training as fresh recruits, who take much longer to hire, undergo a background check, receive security clearances, and get trained at Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers with limited capacity.

ICE recruitment efforts have also targeted active local law enforcement officers. At the end of July, ICE sent recruitment emails to Florida law enforcement seeking ""officers like you who are committed to serving with integrity, professionalism, and a deep sense of duty,"" reports CNN. The recruitment effort angered local sheriffs who previously agreed to partner with ICE on deportation efforts and are unable to match the hiring benefits offered by the agency.

Despite the heavy-handed recruitment efforts, Sandweg told Time that it will likely take ""three years before you see a significant increase of ICE agents on the street.""",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/08/8-13-25-v1-a.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 18:56:58.715230

""For months, DHS denied allegations of dreadful conditions and prevented me from accessing the 26 Federal Plaza detention facility to inspect the conditions.
Last month, videos obtained by Eyewitness News purported to show the conditions inside the facility at 26 Federal Plaza.
""BOP is now helping DHS stash immigrants in their jails and preventing members of Congress from conducting oversight,"" Goldman said.","SUNSET PARK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Officers at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn again denied entry to Rep. Dan Goldman (NY-10), one week after he and two congressional colleagues, Rep. Espaillat and Rep. Velázquez, were turned away.

Lawmakers have been trying to enter MDC to see the conditions in which around 100 immigrants are being held.

Goldman says that last week, Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials promised to accommodate a tour of the facility if given advanced notice of a visit, so he gave notice on Friday, August 8th.

Despite the advanced notice, he wasn't allowed in.

Under Section 527(a) of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024, members of Congress are given the authority to inspect any facility being used by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to detain or house immigrants -- without any prior notice needed.

""I want to understand why they are not letting me in,"" Goldman said.

In July, Goldman and 11 other members of Congress filed a suit against the Trump administration over its refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan.

""A federal judge found that DHS was holding immigration detainees in illegal and unconstitutional conditions at 26 Federal Plaza and ordered DHS to immediately improve those inhumane conditions,"" Goldman said in a statement. ""For months, DHS denied allegations of dreadful conditions and prevented me from accessing the 26 Federal Plaza detention facility to inspect the conditions. Now we know that DHS has been lying to the American people for months.""

Last month, videos obtained by Eyewitness News purported to show the conditions inside the facility at 26 Federal Plaza.

Videos shared by a detainee with a local civic group appeared to show over a dozen people inside the room, with several detainees laying on the cement floor on thermal blankets. It also showed two toilets that were separated from the rest of the men by only a waist-high wall.

Goldman pointed out that the denial of access came less than 24 hours after a federal judge ordered the Department of Homeland Security to improve conditions at a separate ICE detention facility at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, where Goldman has also been trying to enter the facility to expose inhumane conditions.

""BOP is now helping DHS stash immigrants in their jails and preventing members of Congress from conducting oversight,"" Goldman said. ""The American people deserve a government that tells the truth, follows the law, and does not cover up abuse.""

Rural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.
Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.
The administration’s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.
The Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.","If the Trump administration succeeds in barring undocumented immigrants from federally funded “public benefit” programs, vulnerable children and families across California would suffer greatly, losing access to emergency shelters, vital healthcare, early education and life-saving nutritional support, according to state and local officials who filed their opposition to the changes in federal court.

The new restrictions would harm undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens — including the U.S.-born children of immigrants and people suffering from mental illness and homelessness who lack documentation — and put intense stress on the state’s emergency healthcare system, the officials said.

Head Start, which provides tens of thousands of children in the state with early education, healthcare and nutritional support, may have to shutter some of its programs if the new rules barring immigrants withstand a lawsuit filed by California and other liberal-led states, officials said.

In a declaration filed as part of that litigation, Maria Guadalupe Jaime-Milehan, deputy director of the child care and developmental division of the California Department of Social Services, wrote that the restrictions would have an immediate “chilling effect” on immigrant and mixed-status families seeking support, but also cause broader “ripple effects” — especially in rural California communities that rely on such programs as “a critical safety net” for vulnerable residents, but also as major employers.

“Children would lose educational, nutritional, and healthcare services. Parents or guardians may be forced to cut spending on other critical needs to fill the gaps, and some may even be forced out of work so they can care for their children,” Jaime-Milehan said.

Rural communities would see programs shutter, and family providers lose their jobs, she wrote.

Tony Thurmond, California’s superintendent of public instruction, warned in a declaration that the “chilling effect” from such rules could potentially drive away talented educators who disagree with such policies and decide to “seek other employment that does not discriminate against children and families.”

Thurmond and Jaime-Milehan were among dozens of officials in 20 states and the District of Columbia who submitted declarations in support of those states’ lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s new rules. Six other officials from California also submitted declarations.

The lawsuit followed announcements last month from various federal agencies — including Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and Agriculture — that funding recipients would be required to begin screening out undocumented immigrants.

The announcements followed an executive order issued by President Trump in which he said his administration would “uphold the rule of law, defend against the waste of hard-earned taxpayer resources, and protect benefits for American citizens in need, including individuals with disabilities and veterans.”

Trump’s order cited the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as welfare reform, as barring noncitizens from participating in federally funded benefits programs, and criticized past administrations for providing exemptions to that law for certain “life or safety” programs — including those now being targeted for new restrictions.

The order mandated that federal agencies restrict access to benefits programs for undocumented immigrants, in part to “prevent taxpayer resources from acting as a magnet and fueling illegal immigration to the United States.”

California and the other states sued July 21, alleging the new restrictions target working mothers and their children in violation of federal law.

“We’re not talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, we’re talking about programs that deliver essential childcare, healthcare, nutrition, and education assistance, programs that have for decades been open to all,” California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said.

In addition to programs like Head Start, Bonta said the new restrictions threatened access to short-term shelters for homeless people, survivors of domestic violence and at-risk youth; emergency shelters for people during extreme weather; soup kitchens, community food banks and food support services for the elderly; and healthcare for people with mental illness and substance abuse issues.

The declarations are part of a motion asking the federal judge overseeing the case to issue a preliminary injunction barring the changes from taking effect while the litigation plays out.

Beth Neary, assistant director of HIV health services at the San Francisco Department of Public Health, wrote in her declaration that the new restrictions would impede healthcare services for an array of San Francisco residents experiencing homelessness — including undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens.

“Individuals experiencing homelessness periodically lack identity and other documents that would be needed to verify their citizenship or immigration status due to frequent moves and greater risk of theft of their belongings,” she wrote.

Colleen Chawla, chief of San Mateo County Health, wrote that her organization — the county’s “safety-net” care provider — has worked for years to build up trust in immigrant communities.

“But if our clients worry that they will not be able to qualify for the care they need, or that they or members of their family face a risk of detention or deportation if they seek care, they will stop coming,” Chawla wrote. “This will exacerbate their health conditions.”

Greta S. Hansen, chief operating officer of Santa Clara County, wrote that more than 40% of her county’s residents are foreign-born and more than 60% of the county’s children have at least one foreign-born parent — among the highest rates anywhere in the country.

The administration’s changes would threaten all of them, but also everyone else in the county, she wrote.

“The cumulative effect of patients not receiving preventive care and necessary medications would likely be a strain on Santa Clara’s emergency services, which would result in increased costs to Santa Clara and could also lead to decreased capacity for emergency care across the community,” Hansen wrote.

The Trump administration has defended the new rules, including in court.

In response to the states’ motion for preliminary injunction, attorneys for the administration argued that the rule changes are squarely in line with the 1996 welfare reform law and the rights of federal agencies to enforce it.

They wrote that the notices announcing the new rules that were sent out by federal agencies “merely recognize that the breadth of benefits available to unqualified aliens is narrower than the agencies previously interpreted,” and “restore compliance with federal law and ensure that taxpayer-funded programs intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize unqualified aliens.”

GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.
GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.
“For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage.
Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable.","A federal appeals court on Wednesday refused to give the operator of the immigrant detention center in Tacoma another chance to make its case for paying detainees as little as $1 per day.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the request from The GEO Group, the for-profit company that runs the facility, to reconsider its decision from earlier this year, siding with lower courts that found GEO violated state minimum wage law.

The decision affirms that the Florida-based GEO Group will need to pay more than $23 million that a jury and federal judge previously awarded. The next step in the company’s fight could be the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, brought by detainees and the state of Washington, has been ongoing since 2017.

GEO Group has run the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma since 2005. Its current contract with the federal government, signed in 2015, awarded the company at least $700 million to operate the facility over the following decade. The facility holds people detained by federal immigration enforcement on civil violations as they await potential deportation or release back into the United States.

The company used to run a voluntary work program for detainees. For years, hundreds at the Tacoma detention center were paid $1 per day, the minimum federal pay required in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. When necessary to attract workers, pay would go up to $5.

The program allowed GEO to avoid hiring 85 full-time employees, according to court filings. The detainees would cook and serve food, wash dishes, do laundry and clean the facility.

GEO’s federal contract requires it to comply with “all applicable federal, state, and local laws and standards,” including “labor laws and codes.” This includes state minimum wage laws, courts have ruled.

The company had argued federal contractors couldn’t be forced to pay Washington’s minimum wage under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that federal law takes precedence over state law.

GEO contended Washington can’t regulate the detention center differently than similar state facilities, since the state’s minimum wage law exempts prisons and jails.

A U.S. District Court jury in 2021 found GEO Group violated Washington’s minimum wage statute, and awarded nearly $17.3 million in back wages. A federal judge ordered the company to pay the state an additional $5.9 million in penalties. The work program has been suspended since then.

Between 2010 and 2018, GEO made around $20 million per year running the 1,575-bed detention center.

Washington’s state Supreme Court also sided with the detainees and the state, finding in 2023 that the detained workers should be considered employees.

On this go-around, GEO asked the original three-judge 9th Circuit panel either to rehear the case or send it to the full appeals court in what is known as a rehearing en banc. The Trump administration’s Department of Justice also urged the court to reconsider. The court denied the requests Wednesday.

Dissenting from the decision, Judge Patrick Bumatay, an appointee of President Donald Trump, wrote that “the effect of this decision will be widespread.”

“Our court provides a ‘roadmap’ for States seeking to undermine federal policies with which they disagree,” Bumatay wrote. “Our court’s message is clear: So long as States focus their regulation on federal government contractors — rather than on the federal government itself — the States may frustrate the performance of any federal government activities they wish.”

Chief Judge Mary Murguia, who President Barack Obama appointed, disagreed. She wrote that Bumatay equating the federal government and its contractors is “contrary to long-settled black letter law.”

“Adoption of his position would allow any government contractor to refuse to pay state-mandated minimum wage to its employees,” she continued. “For example, any defense contractor could refuse to pay minimum wage. No one in this case, not even GEO, has suggested that this is the law.”

The facility, the only private, for-profit detention center in Washington, has a history of allegations of human rights violations. It has come under renewed scrutiny as more detainees have been sent there with Trump’s return to office.

The Legislature has long had the detention center in its sights. Lawmakers tried to get it shut down in 2021 through a state law that was later deemed unenforceable.

Washington has also been ensconced in years of legal back-and-forth with GEO over state laws calling for greater oversight of the facility. Another court case tackling that issue is currently awaiting a ruling from the 9th Circuit.

A total of 372 organizations have coalesced to oppose the administration’s decision to make more federally funded health and human service programs off-limits to immigrants with some form of permission to be in the country.

The groups say the administration wrongly promotes the expanded restrictions as part of its efforts to target illegal immigration. The policy actually “directly targets lawfully present immigrants” by turning early learning centers, community health centers and mental health and addiction treatment programs “into immigration checkpoints” where providers would have to check a person’s immigration status, according to the groups.

“Undocumented immigrants already are not eligible for most federally funded programs. This is another case where the administration is lying to the public,” said Adriana Cadena, director of the Protecting Immigration Families coalition, which led the organizations’ opposition to restrictions to be implemented by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As a result, the restrictions will harm millions, the groups stated in official comments filed in response to the administration's expanded restrictions, published in the Federal Register July 14.

The deadline for public comment on the new restrictions was set for 11:59 p.m. Wednesday.

One in 4 children in the U.S. are in a family with at least one immigrant parent. In 2023, 86% of those children were born in the U.S., making them U.S. citizens, according to Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank. (President Donald Trump also wants to change such birthright citizenship.)

Even if a U.S. citizen child is entitled to use a program, the Trump administration's restrictions are likely to cause confusion and misunderstanding, Cadena said, because of the many children who are in families whose members have different types of immigration status.

""This is going to have long-term consequences we cannot begin to grasp,"" she said.

In response to an NBC News request for comment, the White House sent a link to a July 10 news release by HHS announcing the new restrictions. The administration said in the release that it was ensuring that public benefits were not “diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.”

“For too long, the government has diverted hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to incentivize illegal immigration,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., stated in the July 10 release. “Today’s action changes that — it restores integrity to federal social programs, enforces the rule of law, and protects vital resources for the American people.”

Expanding the programs restricted to 'qualified' immigrants

The 1996 Personal Responsibility Reconciliation Act restricted the eligibility for federal public benefits to certain “qualified” immigrants, according to KFF, a health policy group.

Qualified immigrants have been defined as those lawfully present in the U.S. and do not include people with Temporary Protected Status, those who have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and others, KFF reported.

The HHS has added 13 more programs to the list of programs open only to qualified immigrants.

Those newly added by the administration include Head Start, some of the funding for community health centers, family planning services, child welfare prevention, kinship guardian assistance, substance abuse prevention, treatment and recovery and mental health services and the Community Services Block Grant, the groups said. The federal government has said the list is not comprehensive and more programs could be added later.

The groups argue that the programs and immigrants' access to them have a larger benefit to society as a whole and that ""reducing access to these vital programs will make all of our communities less healthy, less safe, less stable, less able to thrive.""

Restrictions on the HHS programs announced in July were to be effective immediately. Groups said little guidance has been given to providers regarding their implementation, creating confusion and having a chilling effect on people who are eligible for the programs and benefits as well as on the nonprofits, local governments and others who provide them.

Several states have sued over the changes, which they said would also affect programs such as Meals on Wheels, domestic violence shelters, housing assistance and more. A lawsuit also was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of parent groups challenging Trump’s policies on Head Start.

The administration provided a 30-day comment period for the new restrictions.

""We do not necessarily expect that there is a real interest from the administration to seek comment on public policy that will impact millions of people,"" Cadena said.

""This is all about the Trump administration's governmentwide attack on immigrant families, and to dismantle the safety net system that many Americans rely on,"" she said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250813-miami-headstart-program-education-ac-448p-878f3c.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 19:56:54.102805

Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration.
The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.
Trump administration sees 'big win' Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.
“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote.","WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court’s ruling that had required the Trump administration to spend foreign aid dollars approved by Congress.

But instead of addressing the central argument of the lawsuit — that a president cannot refuse to spend money approved by lawmakers, who hold the power of the purse — the Circuit Court in a potentially significant decision said the organizations that filed the case didn’t have the authority to do so.

Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in her 33-page opinion that only the comptroller general, who leads the Government Accountability Office, has the power to bring lawsuits when a president impounds, or refuses to spend, congressionally approved funds. The GAO is an independent, non-partisan watchdog agency that works for Congress.

“Because the grantees lack a cause of action, we need not address on the merits whether the government violated the Constitution by infringing on the Congress’s spending power through alleged violations of the 2024 Appropriations Act, the ICA and the Anti-Deficiency Act,” Henderson wrote. The ICA is the Impoundment Control Act, which is the legal mechanism through which the president can delay or withhold funds.

Henderson was nominated to the Circuit Court in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush, a few years after President Ronald Reagan nominated her as a federal district judge in 1986.

Henderson wrote that she and Judge Gregory G. Katsas, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, concluded “the district court abused its discretion in granting a preliminary injunction” for several reasons.

Both Republican and Democratic state attorneys general filed amicus briefs in the case, with Republicans siding with the Trump administration. The case originated when Trump signed an order on Inauguration Day freezing certain foreign aid spending.

Henderson wrote that “within weeks, the State Department and USAID suspended or terminated thousands of grant awards.”

‘It is our responsibility to check the president’

Judge Florence Y. Pan, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, issued a 46-page dissenting opinion, arguing the ruling from her two colleagues was “procedurally and substantively flawed.”

“It is our responsibility to check the President when he violates the law and exceeds his constitutional authority,” Pan wrote. “We fail to do that here.”

Pan wrote she disagreed with the majority’s opinion that Trump withholding certain foreign aid funding was “a mere violation of the Impoundment Control Act that should be addressed by the Comptroller General.”

“In this case, the President’s violation of the Impoundment Control Act is a sideshow,” Pan wrote. “That statute provided a mechanism for the President to lawfully attempt to impound the funds, and his failure to follow its prescribed procedures is evidence that he was, in fact, refusing to obligate the funds in defiance of Congress.”

Public media funding targeted

The Trump administration has used the Impoundment Control Act one time this year, when it requested Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and various foreign aid programs.

The House voted mostly along party lines to approve the full request in mid-June.

Senate Republicans approved the bill in July after preserving full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

House GOP lawmakers then cleared the bill for Trump’s signature just before a 45-day clock ran out.

Trump administration sees 'big win'

Several members of the Trump administration, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought and Attorney General Pam Bondi, cheered the Circuit Court’s ruling in social media posts.

“In a 2-1 ruling, the DC Circuit lifted an injunction ordering President Trump to spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars on wasteful foreign aid projects,” Bondi wrote. “We will continue to successfully protect core Presidential authorities from judicial overreach.”

Vought wrote the ruling was a “Big win!”

An OMB spokesperson wrote in a statement the ruling represented a victory for the White House.

“Radical left dark-money groups have been using the court system to seize control of U.S. foreign policy,” the spokesperson wrote. “Today’s decision stops these private groups from maliciously interfering with the President’s ability to spend responsibly and administer foreign aid in a lawful manner and in alignment with his America First policies.”

Lauren Bateman, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the suit, wrote in a statement that the court's ruling represented ""a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles.

""We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration's unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance. In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the Administration’s unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world’s most vulnerable people.""",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/trumpjan202025_0.jpg?h=a580faff&itok=qIC4g4WA,N,,2025-08-13 17:56:40.760457

Judge Thomas Cullen of the Western District of Virginia questioned the DOJ over the lawsuit, which alleges that the Maryland district court overstepped its authority by imposing a standing order that automatically pauses deportation cases for two days when they are first filed.

Cullen, a Trump appointee, told DOJ attorneys early on in the hearing he was wary of their position.

""One of the things about me is that I don’t have a very good poker face, and you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,"" Cullen said.

TRUMP DHS SUES ENTIRE BENCH OF FEDERAL JUDGES IN MARYLAND DISTRICT COURT OVER AUTOMATIC INJUNCTIONS

The Virginia federal judge is presiding over the case in Baltimore because the Maryland judges recused themselves. Cullen said he would issue a decision by Labor Day on whether he would block the standing order.

DOJ attorney Elizabeth Hedges argued during the hearing that the Maryland court's order had the effect of ""tampering with the [U.S.] attorney general’s discretion"" over immigration enforcement matters.

The order requires clerks to immediately enter administrative injunctions that last two business days in cases brought by alleged illegal immigrants who are challenging their detentions or removals. The injunctions have the effect of temporarily barring the Department of Homeland Security from deporting or changing the legal status of an immigrant until a judge has time to review the case.

Hedges argued that the judges automatically enter the orders in these cases even if the court lacks jurisdiction in some of them.

The lawsuit, brought in June, comes as the Trump administration has taken an aggressive public posture against individual federal judges who have blocked enforcement of many of the president's executive actions, including in areas of immigration, education and federal agency cuts.

President Donald Trump has complained his agenda has been hamstrung and has called for the impeachment of certain judges whose orders he disagrees with. But the Supreme Court has, in many cases, overrode judges and allowed Trump to temporarily implement his executive actions while the lawsuits proceed in the lower courts.

Attorney Paul Clement, arguing on behalf of the Maryland judges, said during the hearing that there were ""less confrontational"" alternatives to resolving differences with the courts than suing every member of a district court.

Clement, a renowned conservative lawyer who served as former President George Bush's solicitor general, defended the standing order, calling it a ""modest effort to preserve the judiciary's ability to perform its constitutionally assigned role.""

'LAWLESS AND INSANE': TRUMP ADMIN READIES FOR FIGHT AFTER JUDGES BLOCK ABREGO GARCIA REMOVAL FOR NOW

Chief Judge George Russell of Maryland said he issued the standing order as a scheduling convenience to make sure the ""status quo"" is preserved when a deportation case is filed. He cited a ""recent influx"" of cases involving detained immigrants that were being filed after normal court hours, including on weekends and holidays.

The lawsuit represents a test of the independence of the judiciary branch. Clement said it was ""fundamentally incompatible"" with the separation of powers.

""We just don’t have a tradition of suits that are executive versus judiciary, executive versus Congress, Congress versus the executive,"" Clement said, adding that ""we don’t really expect one branch to sue another to try to vindicate its institutional interests.""

The lawsuit also comes as Trump's mass deportation agenda has encountered some roadblocks as immigrants raise court challenges and appeals to their removals.

Claims of inhumane conditions In June, the Amica Center and National Immigration Project filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two women who were being held at the Baltimore ICE facility.
Other immigration advocates have also raised concerns about conditions at the Baltimore ICE facility.","A group of Maryland lawmakers toured a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Baltimore on Wednesday after they were denied a visit in late July.

A spokesperson for the agency said the lawmakers initially arrived without giving advanced notice and were denied a tour for the safety of those in custody and ICE employees.

Wednesday's tour comes after a federal class-action lawsuit criticized the conditions at the George H. Fallon federal building.

ICE has denied those allegations, saying the agency is ""committed to enforcing immigration laws fairly, safely and humanely,"" and complies with federal laws and ICE policies.

Touring the Baltimore ICE facility

U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen and U.S. Representatives Kweisi Mfume and Sarah Elfreth participated in a guided tour of the facility on Wednesday morning.

The group said they left with more questions after being denied the opportunity to speak with detainees and being told that ICE officials would get back to them with answers.

""We leave here with more questions than we came in with, and it was that way the last time we were here,"" Mfume said. ""They've promised to get back to us on at least 20, 25 issues that have come up.""

""We just want answers, we want the truth, the facts, and we want to find a way to make sure that's public and transparent,"" he added.

According to Van Hollen, the group was told they could not talk to detainees at the ICE facility under Maryland law. However, the senator said the state law that the agency referred to does not prohibit members of Congress from talking with detainees.

""Clearly, they don't want us talking to the people who are detained here today or in the future,"" he said.

""As a senior member of a House oversight committee and as the ranking member of the government operations committee, we have clear congressional jurisdiction over ICE,"" Mfume said.

Following the visit from lawmakers on Wednesday, Van Hollen argued that the Baltimore holding facility serves as a detention center, claiming that there are reports of people being held for eight days.

Under ICE policy, holding facilities are designed to keep detainees for up to 12 hours.

""If you look at the people in these rooms, they are clearly being detained,"" Van Hollen said.

The agency previously responded to those allegations in a statement saying, ""ICE Baltimore operates a holding room, not a detention facility, and therefore is not subject to the standards outlined in the 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards.""

Van Hollen also mentioned that, according to ICE data, nearly 84% detainees fall under a category of ""no threat level,"" conflicting with the Trump administration's claim that ICE would be going after the ""worst of the worst.""

""They said they were going after the worst of the worst,"" Van Hollen said. ""That would be warranted, and that would be totally appropriate if that were true.""

The lawmakers said they are hoping to get answers after leaving ICE leaders with a list of questions.

WJZ has reached out to ICE for comment.

Claims of inhumane conditions

In June, the Amica Center and National Immigration Project filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of two women who were being held at the Baltimore ICE facility.

According to the lawsuit, the women were held for long periods in ""inhumane"" holding rooms, which allegedly violate ICE policies.

The lawsuit claimed ICE detainees can only be held for 12 hours in holding facilities. However, during a hearing in July, the Department of Justice argued that the lawsuit was incorrect.

Other immigration advocates have also raised concerns about conditions at the Baltimore ICE facility.

In March, the Amica Center and the nonprofit CASA held a rally where attendees criticized the size of the holding rooms, the lack of medical staff, and the lack of a food service contract.

ICE responded in a statement, saying its Health Service Corps is on site to provide necessary medical services.

""In the event of a medical emergency, detainees are promptly transported to nearby hospitals to receive immediate and appropriate care,"" the agency said.

U.S. Rep. Sarah Elfreth, during her tour, described the detainment rooms as tight.

""If there were 40 people in one of those rooms, you wouldn't be able to sit down all at the same time,"" she said.

Mfume questions how those with medical and sanitary needs are being treated,

""Some of our concerns are, what happens with women who have sanitary needs? What happens to people who have daily medications that were not on them when they're apprehended, and what happens to those who come in not being classified by nationality?"" Mfume said.

Initial ICE visit denied

In July, the lawmakers claimed their initial plans to visit the facility in July were ""unlawfully denied.""

""This does not bode well here in Baltimore or anywhere if members of the United States Congress, who are duly authorized to come in and to inspect, visit, or walk through a federal facility, are not allowed in,"" said Mfume, who is a senior member of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

In response, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted on social media, saying the lawmakers should have scheduled a tour at least one week in advance.

""Congressman, if you need a photo op with the violent criminal illegal aliens you are protecting, schedule a TOUR,"" the DHS posted on X.

US lawmakers sue over access to ICE facilities

In late July, 12 Democratic Congressmembers filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming there was an effort to limit access to detention centers that hold immigrants.

U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md) was among the leaders who joined the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, leaders alleged that the Trump administration is blocking their attempts to enter ICE detention centers and delaying plans to inspect the facilities.

""I hope that what happened here in Baltimore, by being able to gain access to a federal facility, starts now to happen all over the country,"" Mfume said Wednesday. ""If indeed we are to be the example, so be it. We just have to have transparency.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/05/14/03f35d30-a09b-436f-84a0-cc8cb079e326/thumbnail/1200x630/5bd1c7ae47c97c102497537e7f89bb2d/ice-facility.png,N,,2025-08-13 19:56:33.476388

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being “deported” and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.
Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states.
According to the lawsuit, Rosario “explicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children’s deportation and had never provided consent for such action.
Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.","Despite being American citizens, three children — a 4-year-old boy with Stage 4 kidney cancer, his 7-year-old sister and a 2-year-old girl — were swept up along with their families by immigration authorities in Louisiana and quickly sent to Honduras, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of the families.

The suit alleges that despite the government’s own directives, the parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their children.” The mothers, named in the suit as Rosario and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the U.S.

Instead, the families were “illegally deported without even a semblance of due process,” the lawsuit states.

Romeo, as the now 5-year-old is identified in the lawsuit, was diagnosed with a “rare and aggressive form of kidney cancer,” at age 2. He immediately began receiving ongoing “critical, life-saving medical treatment” in the U.S., according to the lawsuit, which was filed by immigrant advocacy group National Immigration Project and three law firms.

“The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care, in violation of ICE’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit said.

The suit was filed on behalf of the two mothers and their children in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The plaintiffs’ names in the lawsuit are pseudonyms to protect their identities and safety, attorneys said. The case against the federal government is in its early stages, and plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and damages, and for their arrests and removals to be found unlawful and to be returned to the United States.

“This is emblematic of what happens when the administration is laser-focused on deportation, that when the end result is all that matters, you are going to end up with wrongful and unlawful deportations,” Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, an attorney with the National Immigration Project, told NBC News.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that U.S. children were not being “deported” and denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their children before being sent to Honduras.

“Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.”

McLaughlin said that when there is “an underlying health issue, ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult to the men and women of federal law enforcement.”

NBC News has previously reported on U.S. citizen children being sent with their deported immigrant parents to other countries, including a 10-year-old girl recovering from a rare brain tumor sent to Mexico.

Rosario and Julia and their children were put on a plane to Honduras on April 25 after being detained at immigration check-in appointments where they were told to bring their U.S. citizen children and their passports, according to the lawsuit.

Both women had settled in the U.S. some years ago, the lawsuit states. Rosario came to the U.S. in 2013 as a 13-year-old unaccompanied minor. She gave birth to her first child, Ruby, in 2018 in New Orleans, and her second child, Romeo, in 2020.

In the lawsuit, Rosario claims she didn’t know an immigration case against her was playing out while she was in the U.S. She said she only found out she had a removal order dating back 10 years after she was taken into ICE custody during a traffic stop in February.

The mother of two was given an ankle monitor and had check-ins with ICE both at her home and at their local office, the suit states.

On April 24, Rosario showed up at her immigration check-in with her attorney and children, along with their passports, per ICE’s instructions. At the appointment, Rosario and her children were taken to a back room without their attorney and told they would be deported, according to the lawsuit.

ICE allegedly asked Rosario to sign a document without telling her what it was and Rosario refused. Agents allegedly dismissed her pleas to speak with her attorney about Romeo’s condition.

Her attorney then learned that the family had been transferred to a facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, three hours away. The attorney filed a stay of removal for Rosario’s family that included evidence of Romeo’s Stage 4 cancer diagnosis.

The family was boarded on a plane the next day.

According to the lawsuit, Rosario “explicitly opposed her U.S. citizen children’s deportation and had never provided consent for such action. Indeed, given Romeo’s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States.”

Like Rosario, Julia was also denied access to an attorney when she and her children were detained by ICE and deported, the lawsuit states.

Julia first arrived at the U.S. border in 2019 fleeing Honduras, after her daughter Janelle was kidnapped there, according to the details in the lawsuit. After applying for asylum, they were forced to wait in Mexico at the time under Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy. They said in the lawsuit they were kidnapped in Mexico before they were able to return to the U.S. in August 2021.

Her daughter Jade was born in Louisiana in 2023.

Julia was told in February 2025 to begin bringing both of her daughters to her regular ICE check-ins, the lawsuit states.

On April 22, Julia, who was now pregnant, attended a check-in with her daughters as her partner waited outside. She said she was told her family was being transferred to Alexandria and that a judge would determine their fate in the U.S., according to the lawsuit. Her partner alleges he was told his family was transferred hours later and he was not given time to speak to Julia.

Later that night, Julia was told she would be deported along with her children.

Her attorney was allegedly told by ICE that Jacob, Julia’s partner and also an immigrant, would be detained as well if he attempted to pick up his daughter Jade, who is a U.S. citizen.

While Jacob and the family attorney fought to temporarily stop the removal of Julia and her children, an ICE officer allegedly told Julia to write on a piece of paper that her daughter Jade would be going with her to Honduras.

“When Julia objected, the officer threatened Julia that Jade would be immediately sent to a foster home in the United States if Julia did not write a note stating that Jade would be deported to Honduras with her,” the lawsuit states, adding that Julia did as instructed under duress.

“At no point was Julia provided an opportunity to arrange for care of her U.S. citizen daughter Jade in the United States.”

DHS said in its statement to NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are safe and protected.” The agency said parents “can take control of their departure” by self-deporting.

Julia and her children were sent to Honduras on April 25 on the same plane as Rosario’s family.

Rosario said in a statement that in Honduras she lacks the resources to care for her children the way they need.

“Since returning, my daughter has gotten sick and struggled with anxiety, and I’ve been struggling with my own health issues too,” she said.

Julia said in a statement she thought she and her children were going to a regular appointment, but she was lied to. “I never imagined they would send me and my children to Honduras,” she said.

“Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard,” she said. “We were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-ice-officer-vl-506p-9f45d8.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 17:57:30.406094

President Donald Trump said he may declare a national emergency to maintain control of Washington, D.C.'s police force if Congress doesn't work with him to extend the current federalization plan.

Trump made the statement during a press conference at the Kennedy Center in Washington, arguing he can maintain control over the Metropolitan Police Department indefinitely if he declares a national emergency. Under the current structure, the federal government took control over the MPD for a 30-day period on Monday.

""Your federalization of the police has a 30-day limit unless Congress acts to extend it. Are you talking to Congress about extending it, or do you believe 30 days is sufficient?"" asked Daily Signal White House reporter Elizabeth Troutman Mitchell.

""Well, if it's a national emergency, we can do it without Congress. But we expect to be before Congress very quickly. And again, we think the Democrats will not do anything to stop crime, but we think the Republicans will do it almost unanimously. So we're going to need a crime bill. That we're going to be putting in, and it's going to pertain initially to DC. We're going to use it as a very positive example.""

TRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS—BUT SOME WELCOME IT

Trump announced his D.C. crime and homelessness crackdown last week, calling in the National Guard and federal law enforcement in addition to federalizing the MPD.

Law enforcement has arrested more than 100 people since Aug. 7, which includes 43 who were arrested Tuesday, a White House official told Fox Digital Wednesday morning. The arrests are part of Trump’s March executive order, which established the Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force, ahead of Trump's Monday announcement federalizing the D.C. police department.

""President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox Digital. ""In less than one week, over 100 violent criminals have already been arrested and taken off of the streets in Washington, D.C. President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital.""

The White House says those living in homeless encampments in the nation's capital will have two choices in the coming days: accept treatment at a homeless shelter, or go to jail. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt delivered the message during a Tuesday press conference.

""Seventy homeless encampments have been removed by the U.S. Park Police,"" Leavitt said, adding that the Metropolitan Police Department would be joining the Park Police in the effort. ""There are only two homeless encampments remaining in D.C. federal parks under the National Park Service's jurisdiction, and the removal of those two remaining camps is scheduled for this week.""

It is unclear how many other immigrants arrived in Massachusetts through the app-based program and are in the same situation.","Three immigrant plaintiffs and the Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts are suing the Trump administration in federal court over its cancellation of a parole program.

Democracy Forward and Massachusetts Law Reform Institute filed the suit in the District of Massachusetts on Monday, challenging the end of the CBP One app, a online appointment system and subsequent parole program for people seeking to legally immigrate to the United States.

The complaint states that the government’s decision to end CBP One earlier this year resulted in immigrants ”living in the United States legally to being deemed 'illegal aliens’ overnight.“ Immigrants who came in through that app system lost legal status and are technically undocumented. The suit seeks to reverse that decision for parolees already in the United States, restoring the parole they had been granted.

“We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who lost their jobs, their homes, and their access to food, health care, and they even now face the threat of detention or deportation back to dangerous conditions,” said Ciro Valiente, spokesperson for Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts.

Plaintiffs said the decision by the Trump administration is a violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, and that the government can only end parole early on a case-by-case basis, not en masse like what happened with the CBP One cancellation.

Launched in 2020, the CBP One program was initially for commercial trucking companies to schedule cargo inspections. The app was expanded in 2023 to allow migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry on the southern border. Immigrants seeking entry without appointments would typically be turned away. Over two years, nearly a million people scheduled appointments.

The three individual plaintiffs include a Haitian woman living in Massachusetts and the Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts, which said it has at least 473 parolees in Massachusetts, and nearly 5,000 in its organization nationwide. The other plaintiffs are a Cuban woman living in Texas and a woman living in Ohio, originally from Venezuela. The plaintiffs are seeking class certification so the court’s decision would apply nationwide.

The Massachusetts individual plaintiff, anonymized as “Olivia Doe,” is a Haitian who arrived through the app, and had a border patrol inspection before being allowed into the U.S. Her parole was supposed to continue until Nov. 30, 2026, and she also has a pending asylum hearing for December 2027. Her work permit has been revoked, along with her legal status.

It is unclear how many other immigrants arrived in Massachusetts through the app-based program and are in the same situation. The thousands of people nationwide with the legal status received an April email from the Department of Homeland Security, which said: “It is time for you to leave the United States.” The email includes no reasoning for the termination of people’s status.

Last week, FAIR’s marquee 2025 report estimating the illegal alien population in the U.S. was updated to include, at the end, a state-by-state breakdown based on new data. FAIR’s study was the first to account for the Census Bureau bombshell showing millions more illegal aliens live in the U.S. than previously thought. It is now clear from this update that the 2021-2024 wave of illegal immigration had its strongest impacts in places far from the border and least equipped to handle them.

Estimating each state’s illegal alien population in 2025 meant challenging previous assumptions because, as the report details, illegal immigration itself drastically changed over the past few years. For example, a border wall, high prices, and a slow economy made traditional gateway California a much less attractive destination for illegal aliens than in past decades. Permissive policies drew illegal aliens from across the entire world, rather than mostly from nearby countries like Mexico, and these new arrivals were less drawn to established illegal alien communities.

At the same time, the Biden administration was flying illegal aliens directly into cities in the interior of the U.S. at taxpayer expense. Administration actions like the abuse of immigration parole authority made it easier for illegal aliens to work outside well-established destinations. The result was that newly arrived illegal aliens had far more options, and many unsuspecting cities and towns across the U.S. suddenly found themselves overwhelmed.

Because of these changes, entirely new methodology was needed to estimate the illegal alien population by state. FAIR weighted how fast the foreign-born population grew from 2021-2025 in each state when estimating their current illegal alien populations. This also required separating Biden administration-era illegal aliens from earlier arrivals in our data because the places they ended up in the U.S. were vastly different. These new state population estimates are not directly comparable with earlier years because of the new methodology. However, this is only because our estimates have improved as the proverbial dust settles from the disastrous 2021-2024 illegal migration wave.

While “sanctuary cities” took in many of the most recent arrivals, our estimates show surprisingly high populations in areas far outside these bastions of non-cooperation. Florida, for example, has strong state pro-enforcement policies and requires local governments to cooperate with immigration enforcement. Unfortunately for Floridians, it was also the largest entry point for flights carrying inadmissible illegal aliens allowed in by the Biden administration. This has caused its illegal alien population to swell compared to traditional gateways like New York and California.

Last Thursday, President Trump announced that the Department of Commerce is starting work on a new census that would not count illegal aliens present in the United States.

The announcement states that the census would be based on data from the 2024 election. Conducted every 10 years, the next census had been scheduled for 2030.

The rapid growth of the illegal alien population in the U.S. threatens to significantly affect congressional representation in the House of Representatives, which also determines Electoral College apportionment for presidential elections. After four years of failed anti-borders policies, the total illegal alien population is now estimated to be at least 18.6 million, enough to account for roughly 24 House seats. And because the number of House seats is fixed by law at 435, when one state gains a seat, another state loses that seat. Following the 2020 census–after which more than 10 million illegal aliens poured into the country under the Biden administration–New York, Illinois, and California all lost one House seat each, while Florida gained one seat and Texas two.

The move from President Trump is the latest measure in a battle that started during his first administration. In 2019, the first Trump administration attempted to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, only to be blocked by the Supreme Court, which called the attempt “contrived.” In a 2020 memorandum, President Trump then determined that “[f]or the purpose of the reapportionment of Representatives following the 2020 census, it is the policy of the United States to exclude from the apportionment base aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status under the Immigration and Nationality Act.” That memo was revoked by President Joe Biden immediately after he took office in 2021.

Congress has already taken steps to ensure that only U.S. citizens are counted for the purposes of apportionment. On January 7, Congressman Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.) reintroduced H.R. 151, the Equal Representation Act. That FAIR-supported bill would add a citizenship question to the census starting in 2030 and amend existing law to ensure that noncitizens are not counted towards congressional or Electoral College apportionment. According to Congressman Edwards: “America will be paying the consequences of the previous administration’s open border policies for decades to come. Mass illegal immigration has already diluted the voice of American citizens in the U.S. House and Electoral College. The Equal Representation Act will reverse these problems by asking a very simple question on the U.S. Census, ‘Are you a citizen of the United States?’ Americans deserve fair and equal representation, something that will not be possible until we eliminate the influence of noncitizens in our elections.”

Critics meanwhile, have signaled that such changes would immediately face pushback. Following President Trump’s announcement, American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Voting Rights Project Director Sophia Lin Lakin warned that, “We won’t hesitate to go back to court to protect representation for all communities.” The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights also published a factsheet last month on the Equal Representation Act, claiming that citizenship questions on the census would “frighten large numbers of people away from participating in the census entirely.” According to the Leadership Conference, illegal aliens not participating in the census would result in the “misallocation of trillions of dollars in vital federal and state funding for the next decade, unfairly depriving communities throughout the country of needed resources.”

Without commonsense reform, the next census, and resulting congressional and Electoral College reapportionment, could be seriously distorted. Voters have given the Trump administration and 119th Congress a clear mandate to enforce our immigration laws and reverse the effects of harmful open-borders policies. Americans deserve to have their voices fully represented in our nation’s capital, not diluted by individuals who chose to enter the country illegally.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/census-1020.jpg.webp?itok=36l4RYyp,N,,2025-08-13 15:56:58.749163

About 800 National Guard troops filed into Washington, D.C., on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said — without substantiation — that they were needed to reduce crime in the “lawless” national capital. Thousands of miles away, a judge in California is hearing arguments about whether the president’s recent decision to federalize Guard personnel in Los Angeles during protests against immigration raids violated federal law.

Trump has also created militarized zones along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of a major shift that has thrust the army into immigration enforcement like never before.

The cases in both California and Washington mainly hinge on Posse Comitatus Act, which passed in 1878 and largely prevents the military from enforcing domestic laws. Experts say that in both cases there are clear limitations to the law’s enforcement.

Here is what to know about the law.

Posse Comitatus Act stops military from enforcing US law

The Posse Comitatus Act is a criminal statute that prevents the military from enforcing domestic law. It also prevents the military from investigating local crimes, overriding local law enforcement or compelling certain behavior.

Posse Comitatus can be bypassed by a congressional vote or in order to defend the Constitution. The Insurrection Act of 1807 can also trigger the suspension of the Posse Comitatus Act and allows the president to deploy the military domestically in cases of invasion or rebellion.

There is an exception for the U.S. Coast Guard, which has some law enforcement responsibility. The military is also allowed to share intelligence and certain resources if there is an overlap with civilian law enforcement jurisdiction, according to the Library of Congress.

Law was enacted after Reconstruction era

The law was enacted in 1878 following the post-Civil War era known as Reconstruction. Pro-segregationist representatives in Congress wanted to keep the military from blocking the enforcement of Jim Crow laws that allowed racial segregation.

But the spirit of the law also has roots going all the way back to the Revolutionary War, when the founders of the United States were scarred by the British monarchy’s absolute military control, said William C. Banks, a professor at the Syracuse University College of Law.

“We have a tradition in the United States, which is more a norm than a law, that we want law enforcement to be conducted by civilians, not the military,” Banks said.

That ethos — ingrained in National Guard personnel starting in basic training — becomes especially powerful in the case of the Posse Comitatus Act, because the law has hardly been tested before now, said Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.

“There is no authoritative precedent on exactly where these lines are, and so that’s why over the years the military’s own interpretation has been so important,” Vladeck said.

Law applies to ‘federalized’ troops

The Posse Comitatus Act typically doesn’t apply to the National Guard because members of the Guard report to the governor, not the federal government.

But when Guard personnel are “federalized” they are bound by the act until they are returned to state control, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

The state of California said in a federal lawsuit that the Trump administration violated the act when it deployed National Guard soldiers and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles following June protests over immigration raids.

The Trump administration has argued that the Posse Comitatus Act does not apply because the president used a provision known as Title 10 to federalize the troops. It allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government,” or when the president is otherwise unable “to execute the laws of the United States.” Attorneys for the federal government also argue that the troops are not enforcing domestic laws and are only acting to protect federal property and agents.

In Washington, by contrast, the president is already in charge of the National Guard and can legally deploy troops for 30 days without congressional approval.

Vladeck said that both deployments over the past three months suggest that the Trump administration “appears to be trying to dance around the Posse Comitatus Act” rather than disregard it altogether.

“There is a lot in the water about the Trump administration being lawless. What is striking is actually how much the administration is trying to wrap itself in the law,” Vladeck said.

Law depends on executive branch policing itself

Beyond the legal exceptions written into the law, there is a practical question of how to enforce it, said Joseph Nunn, counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Liberty and National Security Program.

Because the Posse Comitatus Act is a criminal statute, not a civil one, the U.S. Department of Justice is responsible for prosecution in criminal court, Nunn said.

“It’s premised on the executive branch policing itself,” he said. That leaves unclear legal standing for whether a state government like California’s has a right to sue in civil court in the first place.

The ruling in the California case will likely be a narrow interpretation based on the circumstances of the Guard’s deployment in Los Angeles, Vladeck said. But he said it could still dictate how the administration uses the Guard in other cities like Chicago and New York, where Trump has threatened to federalize troops next.

Last year, the State Department published 103 pages on Israel’s “significant human rights issues.” The new report is just nine pages long.

The congressionally mandated human rights reports, which are used to guide U.S. decisions on diplomacy and aid, have been turned into wholly political documents built to soft-pedal abuses by the administration’s allies and target countries with whom the Trump administration has clashed.

The report on Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip was just one of 200 hollowed-out reports on human rights that the State Department released Tuesday, which, as expected, whitewash the records of some of the world’s worst violators of human rights. Experts said the report on Israel was among the most egregious, with its page count plummeting 91 percent from last year.

While previous editions of the report on Israel — including reports from President Donald Trump’s first term — included significant material on abuses documented by the United Nations and human rights groups, such accounts were mostly omitted from the new report.

“The first Human Rights Report of Secretary Rubio’s tenure can be summarized in just a few more words than it appears to be written in: few truths, many half truths, and nothing like the truth,” said Josh Paul, who spent more than 11 years as the director of congressional and public affairs at the State Department bureau that oversees arms transfers to foreign nations before resigning in 2023 over U.S. military assistance to Israel. “Its coverage of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza appears to have been written by someone who has been blindfolded, earmuffed, had a sock stuffed in their mouth, and then censored.”

Last year’s report referenced “significant human rights issues” – language which is absent from the report released on Tuesday. The report also omits reference to the genocide case that Israel faces at the International Court of Justice over its war on Gaza. Also absent is mention of the International Criminal Court arrest warrants issued for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The section on war crimes and genocide only states: “Terrorist organizations Hamas and Hizballah continue to engage in the indiscriminate targeting of Israeli civilians in violation of the law of armed conflict.”

“Although the Biden administration continued to provide essentially unconditional support for Israel’s military operations in Gaza, the 2023 Human Rights Report on Israel/Palestine documented a large number of Israel’s significant human rights violations,” said Annelle Sheline, who served as a foreign affairs officer in the Office of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor until last year and previously worked on annual country human rights reports. “In contrast, for 2024 — a year characterized by Israel killing likely hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in an indiscriminate campaign of bombing and starvation, in direct violation of U.S. law — the Human Rights Report documents almost none of Israel’s human rights abuses, focusing instead almost exclusively on abuses committed by Hamas.”

The brief section on press freedom in the new report also offers a whitewash of the slaughter of Palestinian journalists. It reads: “NGOs and journalists reported authorities restricted press coverage and limited certain forms of expression, especially in the context of criticism against the war or sympathy for Palestinians in Gaza.”

That is a watered-down version of an already cautious chronicle in last year’s report, which stated: “NGOs and Palestinian journalists reported authorities restricted press coverage and limited certain forms of expression, particularly for Palestinians. These included restricting Palestinian journalists’ movement in Israel, as well as using violence, arrests, intimidation, imprisonment, and closure of media outlets on security grounds, according to the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedoms.” The report released in 2024 also cited figures from the Committee to Protect Journalists on the number of reporters and other media workers killed.

Paul, the former State Department official, noted that the new report “suggests that scores of journalists have been killed ‘due to the Israel-Hamas conflict’ — rather than, as is the case, ‘by Israel’ — while also reporting with a straight face Israel’s claim that ‘a number of individuals who posed as journalists … were members of or had direct ties to Hamas and other terrorists in Gaza.’”

On Sunday, Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif was killed alongside several other colleagues in a targeted Israeli attack on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City. The Al Jazeera Media Network condemned the killings as “yet another blatant and premeditated attack on press freedom.”

The section on torture in this year’s report on Israel focuses on the physical, psychological, and sexual abuse of Israeli hostages by Hamas. Regarding torture of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, the report says, “Shin Bet (the Israel Security Agency) and police used violent interrogation methods that it referred to as ‘exceptional measures,’ but the Ministry of Justice did not provide information regarding the frequency of interrogations or the specific interrogation methods used.” Last year’s report referred to “reports of systemic torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment of Palestinian detainees in prison facilities after October 7.”

“This contrast demonstrates most clearly that from the perspective of the Trump administration, if a U.S. partner abuses human rights, Washington does not care,” said Sheline, who also resigned, in March 2024, to protest the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza. “This will have implications far beyond the actions of Israel’s murderous regime, contributing to all U.S. security partners knowing they can abuse their populations with impunity.”

Officially called “Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,” the annual documents are required by law to be “a full and complete report regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights” in nearly 200 countries and territories worldwide. They are used “by the U.S. Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Branches as a resource for shaping policy and guiding decisions, informing diplomatic engagements, and determining the allocation of foreign aid and security sector assistance,” according to the State Department.

“The Human Rights Reports have been among the U.S. Government’s most-read documents,” said Charles Blaha, a 32-year State Department official and now senior adviser to DAWN, a nonprofit organization that promotes democracy and human rights in the Middle East and North Africa. “This year, the Israel, West Bank, and Gaza Reports’ significant omissions render them functionally useless for Congress and the public as nothing more than a pro-Israel document.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25047476708100-e1755109916769.jpeg?fit=4390%2C2195&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-13 15:57:02.980325

Jon Ossoff’s office (D-Georgia) has revealed rampant human rights violations committed against immigrants in detention in the first six months of President Donald Trump’s second term, including dozens of incidents involving the mistreatment of children and pregnant women.

Of the 510 credible reports of human rights abuses uncovered by the investigation, Ossoff’s office identified 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse of people in immigration detention, 14 reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 reports of mistreatment of children.

During the senator’s monthslong investigation, which began in January, Ossoff’s staff “interviewed and received credible reports of abuse from dozens of witnesses and sources, including correctional staff, law enforcement officials, attorneys, detainees and their family members, doctors, and nurses.”

They spoke with 46 people in detention and conducted numerous site visits, although “obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees.”

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called the report “garbage” and denied the allegations of abuse. Ossoff said DHS’s response is “absurd.”

“For DHS to immediately issue a blanket denial without any due-diligence or investigations of these credible reports of human rights abuses in U.S. facilities, is absurd,” Ossoff said. “It suggests they don’t take seriously their obligation to investigate credible reports of human rights abuses in their facilities.”

The senator’s investigation reported on several incidents that involved the mistreatment of children. In one case, a child, who is a U.S. citizen, was hospitalized three times while detained with her mother.

“[W]hen the girl began vomiting blood, the mother begged for medical attention,” the report says. “A CBP guard reportedly responded, ‘Just give the girl a cracker.’”

In another case, a family was arrested and detained on their way to an emergency medical appointment for their daughter who was recovering from brain surgery. The government also deported a 4-year-old who was receiving treatment for kidney cancer. In April, immigration officers abducted the child and his sister, who are both U.S. citizens, along with their mother when they arrived for an immigration appointment. Within 24 hours, they were deported to Honduras.

Ossoff’s office identified more than a dozen credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women detained by DHS. They have been denied adequate medical care and timely checkups, as well as sufficient meals and snacks, according to the investigation. One anonymous agency official reported “seeing pregnant women sleeping on floors in overcrowded intake cells.”

A partner of a pregnant woman in DHS custody relayed their horrific experience to Ossoff’s office. The woman bled for days before she was taken to the hospital, where “she was reportedly left in a room, alone, to miscarry without water or medical assistance, for over 24 hours.” DHS denied reports of pregnant women sleeping on the floor without providing evidence and insisted that detention of pregnant women is “rare.”

Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, told NBC News that she met with the woman, who was 23 years old and had been living in Georgia. The woman told Yoon that she had experienced and witnessed “terrible conditions,” including, NBC News reported, “overcrowding, people forced to sleep on the floor, inadequate access to nutrition and medical care, as well as abusive treatment by the guards, lack of information about their case and limited ability to contact their loved ones and legal support.”

The senator’s investigation also uncovered numerous allegations of physical and sexual abuse against immigrants. At the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas, staff slammed a man’s head in the ground and handcuffed him for stepping out of line in the dining hall, according to the man’s attorneys. At another lockup, staff reportedly forced at least seven people into “stress positions” to punish them for “laughing and conversing.”

There were at least two 911 calls from the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California “referencing reported sexual assaults or threats of sexual assaults,” and at least four emergency calls from the South Texas ICE Processing Center referenced sexual abuse.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush’s solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government’s lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown.

An unusual spectacle plays out in Baltimore today. The U.S. Justice Department will face off against all 15 federal judges in the state of Maryland. The DOJ has sued them, arguing they exceeded their authority. NPR's Carrie Johnson reports.

CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: A few months ago, as the Trump administration cracked down on immigration, the chief federal judge in Maryland imposed a 48-hour pause on certain cases filed by people who feared they might be next in line for deportation.

PHILIP PRO: It was a sensible step. It's something courts do all the time.

JOHNSON: That's Philip Pro. He's a retired federal judge from Nevada who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan. Judge Pro is not involved in this case, but he's speaking up to defend sitting federal judges who can't speak for themselves.

PRO: A two-business-day extension is such a reasonable and brief period that I don't think it could frustrate any executive powers. That's a crisis that's made by the executive with their timing.

JOHNSON: The Trump administration does not see it that way. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the entire federal district court bench in Maryland. Hans von Spakovsky's a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

HANS VON SPAKOVSKY: Well, it's an unprecedented lawsuit, but then what the chief judge did there was unprecedented - issuing a standing order to automatically grant an injunction, which violates all kinds of rules and regulations.

JOHNSON: In court papers, the Justice Department says the Maryland court lacks jurisdiction over those kinds of immigration cases and that the judges sidestepped requirements set out by the Supreme Court.

VON SPAKOVSKY: And that requires actually hearing evidence to meet those standards.

JOHNSON: Both sides are due in court in Maryland today. A federal judge from out of state will oversee the dispute. The DOJ has won some support from immigration hawks and conservative interest groups, but a wide array of advocates are backing the Maryland judges. They include the Maryland State Bar Association, dozens of law firms and retired judges. To them, the case threatens judicial independence and amounts to threatening judges simply for doing their job.

U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn’t issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration’s extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented.

Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland’s 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration’s aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies.

At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed.

The Justice Department, which filed the lawsuit in June, says the automatic pause impedes President Donald Trump’s authority to enforce immigration laws.

But attorneys for the Maryland judges argue that the suit was intended to limit the power of the judiciary to review certain immigration proceedings while the administration pursues a mass deportation agenda.

“The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush’s solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit”

Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case.

Cullen also asked the government’s lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court.

“I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration’s case.

Hedges denied that the case would “open the floodgates” to similar lawsuits. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement.

“The United States is a plaintiff here because the United States is being harmed,” she said.

Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. If allowed to proceed, he could also grant the government’s request for a preliminary injunction that would block the Maryland federal bench from following the conditions of the chief judge’s order.

The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order.

Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government.

The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.”

Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump’s immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured.

The administration later brought Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee.

The suit in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia argues that the Department of Homeland Security’s new policy to limit or block lawmakers from visiting immigrant detention facilities is unlawful. The members cite an appropriations law in effect since 2019 that grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“This oversight informs potential legislation on the subject of immigration detention, ensures that administration officials are carrying out their responsibilities consistent with federal law, and ensures that funds appropriated to DHS and ICE are being used appropriately on the ground,” according to the suit.

DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

As the Trump administration aims to carry out mass deportations, one of the few tools Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have is oversight of immigration detention centers.

It’s already led to clashes between Democratic lawmakers and immigration officers after New Jersey Democrats protested the reopening of a detention center.

The lawmakers said that since June, they have tried to obtain information about conditions at DHS facilities “for the purpose of conducting real-time oversight of that facility” and each “of those attempted oversight visits has been blocked by” DHS.

For example, Colorado’s Jason Crow, who is part of the suit, said this month he was denied entry to an ICE facility to conduct oversight.

“​​As part of its campaign of mass deportation, the Trump-Vance administration has stretched the U.S. immigration detention system far beyond its capacity,” the suit said.

The suit cites the deaths of 11 people while in immigration custody in the past five months and the unlawful detainment of U.S. citizens, often without access to legal counsel.

“More people are being held by the United States in immigration detention than ever before, with many facilities housing more individuals than they were built to contain,” according to the suit. “Reports of mistreatment have been widespread and have included disturbing details of overcrowding, food shortages, lack of adequate medical care, and unsanitary conditions.”

The suit is being led by the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which is representing the House lawmakers, most of whom are in leadership roles or top Democrats on committees, such as Bennie Thompson of Mississippi on Homeland Security, Jamie Raskin of Maryland on Judiciary and Robert Garcia of California on Oversight and Government Reform.

The other Democrats include Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Adriano Espaillat and Dan Goldman of New York; J. Luis Correa, Jimmy Gomez, Raul Ruiz and Norma Torres of California; Crow and Joe Neguse of Colorado; and Veronica Escobar of Texas.",https://highlandcountypress.com/sites/default/files/36998-acd99b42-6825-4670-9083-1cf8208792ba_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 14:57:26.781580

A small town in rural Tennessee will soon be the site of a privately-run Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.

The town of Mason’s 600-bed prison has been sitting empty for nearly four years, but the West Tennessee Detention Facility will soon be filled with ICE detainees from across the mid-South. The mayor and aldermen narrowly approved the contract at a contentious townhall Tuesday night.

Before a crowd of chanting protestors, Mayor Eddie Noeman stressed the economic opportunities for cash-strapped Mason — and his own status as a first-generation immigrant from Egypt.

“Maybe I agree, disagree, but at the end of the day, I’m (looking) for the benefit of the town of Mason,” Noeman said.

A few Mason residents voiced their support for the contract and the jobs it could bring, but a majority spoke against reopening the facility.

“This particular detention center will be less than 20 minutes from my son’s high school. And when he graduates, this is not the job I want him to be able to have,” said resident Civil Miller-Watkins. “Tonight, you’re here to decide how much a Black and Brown body costs … All money is not good money.”

The detention center will be run by CoreCivic, a for-profit prison operator that is currently the subject of a federal civil rights investigation for chronic understaffing and “endemic” violence. The state of Tennessee has fined the company nearly $45 million since 2022 for its inability to staff prisons.

CoreCivic lobbyist Jerry Lankford said the reopening of the prison under ICE will create 240 jobs with an annual salary of $55,000.

“We’ve already had several hundred people submit applications or interest in these jobs,” Lankford said, speaking over shouts of protest from the crowd. “The government partners share a deep commitment to humane care. We are fully committed to that. Our top priority is the safety of the people in our care, our staff and the community.”

Mason resident Darryle Dowell said he worked for the prison when CoreCivic, then called the Corrections Corporation of America, was promising $20 an hour. He said he only received $10 an hour despite a promotion.

“I don’t see no prison,” Dowell said. “I see a concentration camp.”",https://wpln.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/Mason_ICE_AP_25224743518164.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 17:56:54.042967

The divided U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit panel found a lower judge erred when he restored the flow of funds in March.

Two groups of grant recipients sued over allegations the cancellations infringe on the separation of powers since Congress had appropriated the money, but the panel ruled they can’t bring such a claim.

“The district court erred in granting that relief because the grantees lack a cause of action to press their claims. They may not bring a freestanding constitutional claim if the underlying alleged violation and claimed authority are statutory,” U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote for the majority.

An appointee of former President George H.W. Bush, Henderson was joined by U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, whom Trump appointed. They noted federal law still allows the Comptroller General to step in and sue.

U.S. Circuit Judge Florence Pan dissented. She was appointed by former President Biden.

“The majority holds that when the President refuses to spend funds appropriated by Congress based on policy disagreements, that is merely a statutory violation and raises no constitutional alarm bells,” Pan wrote.

Pan called the decision “as startling as it is erroneous,” writing that it latches onto a legal argument the administration hadn’t fully developed.

“My colleagues in the majority excuse the government’s forfeiture of what they perceive to be a key argument, and then rule in the President’s favor on that ground, thus departing from procedural norms that are designed to safeguard the court’s impartiality and independence,” Pan wrote.

Trump on his first day in office ordered the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to freeze foreign assistance payments, leading to a blitz of litigation that quickly reached the Supreme Court at an earlier stage of the case.

The Justice Department appealed again after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali in March ruled the administration must make available foreign assistance that Congress appropriated for fiscal year 2024. Ali was nominated to the bench by Biden.

Ali’s order also required USAID pay out bills owed through Feb. 13 under existing contracts and grants, but that part of the injunction was not on appeal. Court records indicate substantially all of the owed payments are now complete.

“Today’s decision is a significant setback for the rule of law and risks further erosion of basic separation of powers principles,” said Lauren Bateman, an attorney at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group that represents the grant recipients who are suing.

“We will seek further review from the court, and our lawsuit will continue regardless as we seek permanent relief from the Administration’s unlawful termination of the vast majority of foreign assistance,” she continued. “In the meantime, countless people will suffer disease, starvation, and death from the Administration’s unconscionable decision to withhold life-saving aid from the world’s most vulnerable people.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/AP25034609359130-e1744216200927.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-13 14:57:39.452866

Daouda Begnon II Kone was removed to Burkina Faso Aug. 5 pursuant to a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

During his immigration proceedings, the court found Kone was ineligible for immigration benefits and that he participated and assisted in the persecution of others during the Sept. 16, 2015, coup d’etat while he was a member of the Presidential Security Regiment under the regime of President Blaise Compaore.

Kone was convicted in Burkina Faso of complicity in an attack on state security, voluntary assault and battery, and murder. He was sentenced to serve seven years in prison, including five years suspended.

“The removal of Kone underscores the important work of ICE HSI agents in investigating those who apply for immigration benefits under false pretenses,” said ICE Homeland Security Investigations Detroit acting Special Agent in Charge Jared Murphey. “You cannot come to the U.S. and try to hide war crimes.”

“The dedicated officers of ERO Detroit are committed to removing this public safety threat and others like him from our communities across Michigan and Ohio,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Detroit acting Field Office Director Kevin Raycraft. “I encourage members of the public to report additional human rights violators to the ICE tipline at 866-DHS-2-ICE.”

The case was investigated by HSI New York and supported by the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center along with significant assistance from HSI and ERO Detroit’s Cincinnati sub-office.

Established in 2009, the Human Rights Violators and War Crimes Center furthers the government’s efforts to identify, locate and prosecute human rights abusers in the U.S., including those who are known or suspected to have participated in persecution, war crimes, genocide, torture, extrajudicial killings, female genital mutilation and the use or recruitment of child soldiers.

Bush, a Republican.","BALTIMORE — A judge on Wednesday expressed some skepticism about an unprecedented lawsuit in which the Trump administration sued all 15 Maryland-based federal judges over a standing order related to deportation cases.

The lawsuit is the latest escalation of the Trump administration's war on the judiciary, which has been marked by criticism of judges who have ruled against the government over President Donald Trump's bold and aggressive use of executive power.

At issue is a standing order issued by Chief Judge George Russell on May 21 and updated a week later that set rules for handling cases involving immigrants facing immediate risk of deportation. The order applies a temporary stay of deportation for two business days while the case is considered.

The Justice Department sued, saying Russell had no authority to issue such a blanket order that effectively acts as a broad injunction against government actions without any assessment of whether the individual immigrants have valid cases.

But U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, who normally sits in Virginia and was assigned the case because Maryland judges cannot participate, questioned whether the Justice Department took the correct approach in filing a lawsuit.

""You probably picked up that I don’t have a very good poker face,” he said, addressing Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Hedges. “I have some skepticism,” he added.

There are other avenues the government has to challenge the order, he said, including by appealing in a case involving an individual immigrant in which the standing order is applied.

Noting that the Supreme Court in recent months has acted quickly on a flurry of cases involving the Trump administration, Cullen said the dispute may have been resolved by now if the government had filed a regular appeal.

""If recent precedent is any guide, you would already have a decision,"" he added.

Cullen did, however, appear more sympathetic to some of the government's arguments on the merits, noting that government lawyers made a ""fair point"" that even a two-day delay acts as a form of temporary injunction.

A former prosecutor, Cullen was appointed by Trump in 2020 with the backing of Virginia’s two Democratic senators. He said he plans to issue a ruling by Labor Day.

The standing order came in response to the flurry of actions taken by the Trump administration relating to immigration, including moves to deport people without due process. One of the most high-profile cases in the country, involving a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported back to his native country before eventually being returned, arose in Maryland.

The order states that when an immigrant files a petition for habeas corpus in a federal court in Maryland, the government is temporarily prevented from deporting them until the claim can be adjudicated.

The automatic stay has been applied to at least 12 cases so far, the government says.

The standing order is intended in part to ""preserve existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of this court over pending matters,"" Russell wrote.

Hedges argued Wednesday that the order imposes restrictions on the government that courts in most immigration cases have no power to impose.

""We are seeing a huge problem,"" she said.

Hedges added that the lawsuit was not undertaken lightly and similar actions would not become commonplace.

""This is not an assault on the separation of powers,"" she said.

In response to the lawsuit, the Maryland judges hired a legal team that includes Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general under President George W. Bush, a Republican.

Clement warned in court that if the lawsuit was allowed to move forward toward a trial, it would create a ""nightmare scenario"" in which judges could be deposed and internal judiciary documents could be reviewed by the government.

""All of that is avoided if you go the ordinary route,"" he added, referring to the government filing an appeal in one of the cases rather than suing judges.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250716-pam-bondi-vl-310p-3fb757.jpg",N,,2025-08-13 13:57:52.870208

Attacking democratic U.S. allies for so-called free speech violations while seeking to imprison law-abiding college students at home for peaceful expression against U.S. foreign policy exemplify this administration’s destructive and hypocritical approach to human rights. At the same time, expunging all mention of gender-based violence, LGBTQI+ persons, persons with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups from these reports is a radical move out of step with the American people, international human rights norms, and decades of past practice, including the first Trump administration.”

“Such changes undermine the historic credibility of these reports and their purpose in informing key U.S. government decisions on issues such as security assistance, foreign aid, and whether to provide protection to people fleeing human rights abuses. They also undercut the courageous efforts of political activists, human rights defenders, and others seeking to improve conditions in their home countries,” Zeya concluded.

U.S. law enacted over four decades ago mandates that the State Department provide annual reports on “the observance of and respect for internationally recognized human rights” in every country around the world. It is widely agreed that “internationally recognized human rights” include those articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (which the U.S. had a key role in drafting and which draws on the core rights in the United States’ own founding documents) and treaties to which the U.S. is a party such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Nevertheless, the Trump administration’s most recent reports eliminate information on a wide range of these rights, including the right to peaceful assembly, the right to a fair trial, the right to freedom of movement, the right to not be returned to a country where one would suffer torture or persecution, the right to non-discrimination (including for women, racial and ethnic minorities, indigenous persons, LGBTQI+ people, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized groups), and the right to participate in one’s government. They also exclude information on key governance issues such as corruption. Such reporting has been included in these reports for many years under both Republican and Democratic administrations and its absence means that Congress and others will have far from the complete picture they need to make informed and responsible decisions about U.S. policy and its implementation. It will have particularly negative consequences for asylum seekers seeking to prove the risks they may face in their home countries.

The reports also noticeably skew the reporting on particular countries where the Trump administration has aligned political interests. For instance, in the reports on El Salvador and Hungary, the State Department concludes that there are no “credible reports of significant human rights issues.” At the same time these reports assert that there have been no changes in the human rights situation in both countries since 2023, when the reports on those same countries itemized a wide range of significant issues. Likewise, the reports on key U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia withhold or downplay accounts of abuses there, compared to recent years. Strikingly, the 2024 reports give Hungary a clean bill of health on human rights, while concluding that the human rights situations in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom have worsened due to issues relating to alleged restrictions on freedom of expression and acts of antisemitism. While some of these concerns may be valid, they are given disproportionate attention relative to the many other serious abuses occurring elsewhere around the world. The 2024 reports also elevate attention to alleged abuses by governments in South Africa and Brazil for which the Trump administration has expressed particular antipathy.

The Trump administration is threatening to sue and withhold federal funds from more than 20 ""sanctuary"" states, cities and counties, because of their lack of cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The new list, released Aug. 5 by the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Public Affairs, includes three states and one city in New England: Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Boston, Massachusetts.

""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design,"" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice will continue bringing litigation against sanctuary jurisdictions and work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to eradicate these harmful policies around the country.""

Inclusion on the list comes with the explicit threat of lawsuits and federal funding halts. And border czar Tom Homan has previously promised to ""flood"" those jurisdictions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In February, he said he would be ""bringing hell"" to Boston.

Several federal judges have blocked the administration's previous efforts to punish some of those jurisdictions, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

Earlier this year, the White House published and then almost immediately withdrew a significantly longer list after many communities on the list said they were erroneously included. In many of the jurisdictions included on the new list, including Boston, local leaders have argued that allowing police to partner with ICE discourages crime victims and witnesses from coming forward regardless of their immigration status.

In announcing the new list, which also includes both New York City and the state of New York, Chicago and San Francisco, the White House highlighted how Louisville, Kentucky, had agreed to end sanctuary policies while facing threat of a lawsuit.

What is a 'sanctuary jurisdiction'?

There's no specific legal definition of a sanctuary jurisdiction, but Bondi's office said it considered things like failure to collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, providing government benefits to undocumented immigrants, or refusing to share immigration information about jail detainees.

Federal courts are currently weighing several lawsuits brought by the Trump administration against jurisdictions on the sanctuary list. A federal judge last month threw out the Trump administration's sanctuary jurisdiction lawsuit against Chicago and surrounding Cook County.

Is Boston a 'sanctuary city?'

Under the Trust Act, Boston city law enforcement officials are prohibited from cooperating with ICE to carry out civil warrants. The 2014 law makes many characterize Boston as a sanctuary city, though Boston Mayor Michelle Wu's administration doesn't use the term. Boston police officers work with immigration officials only on criminal warrants.

“Whenever someone commits a crime, whenever there’s a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable,” Wu said during a March hearing in front of Congress. “If ICE deems that they are dangerous enough to obtain a criminal warrant, we hold them accountable.”

During that hearing, Wu touted the city's safety record and pushed back against ""the false narrative"" that all immigrants are criminals.

“The false narrative is that immigrants in general are criminals, or immigrants in general cause all sorts of danger and harm, that is actually what is undermining safety in our communities,” Wu said.

Massachusetts was named on the original list of sanctuary states released in May, but it wasn't included this time. MA Gov. Maura Healey has said several times the Massachusetts isn't a sanctuary state.

Which communities have been described as immigrant 'sanctuaries'?

According to the Department of Justice, the following communities are offering ""sanctuary"" to immigrants who lack the legal right to be in this country.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said he was pelted with bottles and had a knife pulled on him while speaking to migrants in a camp in northern France.

The Conservative MP posted a video on social media discussing the incident with Daily Express journalist Zak Garner-Purkis who has accompanied him on his visit to France.

In the clip, Philp says: ""I found it pretty shocking - you said behind me somebody had pulled out some sort of machete and we left pretty quickly.""

Mr Garner-Purkis says the man was ""swinging it around in the air"", adding: ""It was clear he was doing it to send a message to the other people there - whether it was a case of 'don't speak'.""

In the video, the two men are recounting the incident while walking along the side of a road at which point objects can be seen being thrown at them.

Mr Garner-Purkis says ""they are throwing bottles at us"" and Philp says: ""Right, we've got to go.

Philp later posted a message on social media reading: ""Just had a knife pulled on us in the new Jungle camp by Dunkirk and then pelted with bottles while trying to speak to migrants.""

The shadow minister has said he has been visiting the north coast of France to ""find out more about what's happening on the ground with the illegal migration crisis"".

The number of people trying to get to the UK by crossing the English Channel in small boats has been increasing for around eight years.

Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 170,000 people have arrived in small boats.

In 2022, 45,755 made the journey, in 2024 it was 37,000 and as of 11 August this year, 27,029 people have arrived in the UK.

In the first three months of the year, Afghans made up the top nationality of people arriving by small boat, followed by Syrians, Iranians, Vietnamese and Eritreans.

In a bid to reduce numbers making the crossing, the Labour government has taken steps to ""smash the gangs"" that organise crossings including spending £100m to fund 300 National Crime Agency officers to tackle people-smugglers.

It has also reached a 'one-in, one-out' agreement to send some arrivals back to France and in exchange, the UK will take in asylum seekers in France who have not tried to make the crossing.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the deal was a ""product of months of grown-up diplomacy"" which would ""deliver real results"".

The Conservatives have criticised the government for scrapping their Rwanda plan which aimed to send arrivals to the East African country where they would have had their asylum applications processed.

Earlier this week, Philp said: ""Labour tore up our deterrents before they were even in place, and the results are there in black and white.

""When I went to the Channel to see Labour's France returns deal in action, the truth was obvious. Within half an hour of arriving off the French coast, I watched two packed dinghies being escorted into UK waters. Every illegal migrant should be removed immediately upon arrival.""

A Labour source said: ""When Chris Philp became immigration minister in February 2020, only 2,400 people had crossed the Channel in small boats, and there were just 10 asylum hotels in operation.

""By the time he left that job 19 months later, 25,500 people had crossed the Channel and there were 149 asylum hotels in place. This crisis exploded under his watch, yet he now has the brass neck to act as though he is just learning about it for the first time.""

Louise Calvey, head of the Asylum Matters charity, has said the government's 'one-in, one-out' deal with France was ""yet another attack on the human right to seek sanctuary"".

""In reinforcing the criminalisation of people exercising their legal right to seek asylum, our government continues to ignore the Refugee Convention – which permits travel by irregular means to seek sanctuary – and punish people for using the only means available to them to reach safety.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/86a5/live/aa2be660-783c-11f0-aa29-15a69a839271.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 14:57:43.412719

“ICE’s tactic of snatching people in and around state courts was unjust and instilled fear in so many people.","By Ryan Schwach

A group of public defender organizations and immigration nonprofits are calling on a federal court to dismiss the Trump administration’s lawsuit challenging a New York State law that protects immigrants when they appear in court.

The organizations said in a brief filed in federal court on Monday that the state’s Protect Our Courts Act safeguards the rights of immigrants attending court hearings. They argued that eliminating it would only strengthen President Donald Trump's deportation efforts and further endanger local immigrant communities.

The Protect Our Courts Act protects immigrants from civil arrests in and around New York State courts and when traveling to and from state courthouses, absent a judicial warrant or court order.

The ongoing suit from Trump’s Department of Justice continues as Trump exerts federal authority in the nation’s capitol and threatens to expand it to cities like New York.

“Immigrants make up an important part of New York’s social fabric, and laws that ensure that they have full access to state services and functions advance public policy goals unrelated to immigration and benefit the entire state,” the brief, filed by the Legal Aid Society, Make the Road New York, Brooklyn Defender Services and a handful of other organizations said.

In June, the Trump administration announced its suit against POCA, as well as two Governor Andrew Cuomo-era executive orders which further prevent civil immigration arrests at other state facilities and deter government employees from sharing information with the federal government.

The federal lawsuit alleges that the laws create “intolerable obstacles,” to Trump’s heavy-handed federal immigration enforcement, which has recently targeted migrants attending mandatory and routine court hearings for arrest, including in New York.

Separately, the Trump DOJ has also targeted New York City over its sanctuary city laws on similar grounds. That lawsuit remains ongoing.

“Through these enactments, New York obstructs federal law enforcement and facilitates the evasion of federal law by dangerous criminals, notwithstanding federal agents’ statutory mandate to detain and remove illegal aliens,” the lawsuit reads.

While most of the enforcement has been carried out at federal courts like the one at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, deportation arrests have been made at state courts as well. The Trump administration appears to want to increase those arrests.

According to the data obtained by the Immigrant Defense Project through a Freedom of Information Law request, ICE officers have entered state courthouses more than 30 times this year, resulting in four arrests – all made with warrants.

During a budget hearing in February, Chief Administrative Judge Joseph Zayas said court brass had met with ICE officials to discuss their protocols and highlight the protections of the Protect Our Courts Act.

“I certainly appreciate that we have the Protect Our Courts Act, and that we were prescient enough to see the need for that,” Zayas at the time. “I understand that in some of the meetings that our folks have had with regional ICE officials, that they are aware of that act, as well.”

Zayas said that the protocols were communicated to judges and court employees.

“We’re prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure that the [Protect Our Courts Act] is followed,” he said.

During the hearing, Zayas said he was aware of attempts by ICE to enter courthouses, but to his knowledge, they had only done so with a judicial warrant, which is in line with state law.

“We haven’t had any indication that the ICE officers have done anything other than follow our procedure,” he said. “As soon as these folks come to our courthouse, they are directed to a designated judge who reviews the purported warrant or detainer to determine whether it is a judicial warrant.”

The Office of Court Administration declined to comment on the suit when it began in June.

The Legal Aid Society, along with the other organizations, are seeking to get the POCA suit – which is in the United States Northern District of New York – entirely dismissed.

“New York has a constitutional duty to ensure equal access to justice, and to benefits and services, for all New Yorkers — regardless of immigration status — and that principle was at the heart of both POCA and these executive orders,” said Meghna Philip, director of the special litigation unit at the Legal Aid Society. “The second Trump administration has openly targeted sanctuary jurisdictions. This lawsuit is another example of that political attack, and it should be dismissed.”

POCA came about in 2020 when the Trump administration increased arrests by ICE agents in state courts.

The bill’s text said that the trend had a “damaging impact on all New Yorkers, not just immigrant communities, as the operation of our judicial system and public safety are undermined.”

Monday’s brief said that the broader legal community supported POCA because “civil arrests in or near courthouses undermine the integrity of New York’s justice system.”

“These laws were enacted during the first Trump Administration in direct response to ICE’s predatory presence at New York state courthouses and other state facilities, which spread fear, and denied New Yorkers’ access to the courts, and to state programs, benefits, and services,” said Philip.

Immigration rights groups included in the brief said that protecting immigrants’ ability to access the courts is crucial to protecting their overall rights.

“In our state courts, the stakes are high – judges are determining whether to deprive community members of their liberty, separate them from their families, or strip them of their livelihoods,” said Executive Director of the Immigrant Defense Project Yasmine Farhang. “ICE’s tactic of snatching people in and around state courts was unjust and instilled fear in so many people. The Protect Our Courts Act changed the landscape for the better and we strongly join the call to urge this lawsuit be dismissed.”

Should the Trump administration win its suit, it would likely mean a further crackdown of immigrants within courthouses, which is already happening en masse in federal courthouses.

Last week, the NYCLU sued the Trump administration over its treatment of detained immigrants at 26 Federal Plaza, where ICE has held people in a makeshift detention center.

The lawsuit claims detainees are held often for days on end without access to showers, clean clothes or an attorney.

Late Tuesday, a federal judge granted the NYCLU a temporary restraining order in the case, preventing ICE from holding people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order would also require ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats, provide access to medical care, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained, according to the NYCLU.

“Today’s order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” said Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project. ""We’ll continue to fight to ensure that peoples’ rights are upheld at 26 Federal Plaza and beyond.”",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b9ffe0f1137a680c2c08250/5ba02661cd8366eb6ec50772/689cb08fea3e815db0867270/1755099441693/POCA+1.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-08-13 12:59:06.611854

Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, there’s been a 566 percent increase in 287(g) agreements, with 765 new agreements signed nationwide as of mid August.
But states like Florida and Georgia have passed laws requiring all counties in their states to participate in 287(g).
They’ve already passed laws restricting local cooperation with ICE, outlawing 287(g) in all counties.
Local officials can also do their part to reject 287(g) agreements, prioritizing community safety over deportation quotas.","This spring, a 19-year old university student named Ximena Arias-Cristobal was sent to an immigrant detention center in Dalton, Georgia for an alleged traffic violation. The traffic charges were eventually dropped, but it was too late. Authorities in Dalton had already called ICE under a federal program that turns police encounters into deportation pipelines.

With her final exams approaching and her family’s future depending on her academic success, Ximena was detained in a privately run detention center notorious for inhumane conditions and severe rights violations.

Unfortunately, her story is not an isolated incident. It’s part of a broader reality across the country as local police departments become extensions of federal immigration enforcement through what are called 287(g) agreements.

That refers to Section 287(g) of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. The program authorizes ICE to train and deputize state and local law enforcement to carry out immigration duties, effectively turning police officers into ICE agents while conducting their routine police work.

287(g) perpetuates racial profiling and other civil and human rights abuses. But the Trump administration is leading a big push to expand the program. Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, there’s been a 566 percent increase in 287(g) agreements, with 765 new agreements signed nationwide as of mid August.

These agreements are generally limited to certain cities, counties, or state agencies. But states like Florida and Georgia have passed laws requiring all counties in their states to participate in 287(g). Florida Governor Ron DeSantis even pushed universities to sign agreements that turn college campuses into targets of mass deportation. Apparently no space is safe for immigrant communities.

This program is eroding public safety and trust in law enforcement. When people fear that dialing 911 could result in the deportation of themselves or a loved one, crimes go unreported, victims stay silent, and witnesses refuse to cooperate with criminal investigations.

A 2018 study by the Cato Institute found no evidence that these partnerships with ICE decreased crime rates. They simply made communities less safe for everyone.

Expanding 287(g) agreements normalizes racial profiling and discrimination. That led President Obama to scale back the program in 2012 after repeated instances of constitutional abuses in Maricopa County, Arizona, yet it’s been resurrected under Trump and is now growing exponentially.

And so are the abuses.

Jose Alvaro was buying baby formula when he was arrested in Lubbock, Texas after police pulled him over for a license plate issue and called ICE. Despite having no criminal record, Alvaro was kept in immigration detention, leaving his wife and three children alone.

Despite the administration’s claim that it’s focusing on deporting “criminals,” stories like Jose’s Ximena’s are no exception. In one recent study, 71.5 percent of the 57,000 immigrants in ICE custody had no criminal convictions.

It’s clear these agreements are making our communities less safe. But other states are fighting back. California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, New Jersey, and Colorado provide blueprints for resisting this program statewide. They’ve already passed laws restricting local cooperation with ICE, outlawing 287(g) in all counties.

Other state lawmakers must follow their lead and refuse to turn their communities into hunting grounds for vile immigration policies. Local officials can also do their part to reject 287(g) agreements, prioritizing community safety over deportation quotas.

We can also pressure universities and institutions to reject pressure to implement these agreements. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC.org) provides a toolkit to mobilize against expanding ICE authority and a map of agreements across the country.

Call your representatives and local police, and talk to your friends and family. Together we can protect our immigrant neighbors — and make our communities safer for everyone.",https://otherwords.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_2640047485.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 13:57:23.901106

The project was developed and led by retired financial executive and immigration advocate Tom Cartwright for nearly six years. Human Rights First will continue Tom’s critical work under a new name: the ICE Flight Monitor.

Between 2020 and 2025, Tom Cartwright tracked over 40,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flights, providing an unprecedented window into the hidden operations of the U.S. immigration enforcement system.

Cartwright’s journey is both unlikely and inspiring: a financial executive who, in retirement, transformed into a leading expert on immigration enforcement flights. Driven by a profound commitment to justice and accountability, he applied his data and analytical expertise from the financial sector to expose the vast, opaque scale of ICE flights. His volunteer work has become an indispensable tool, informing litigation, shaping congressional oversight, and galvanizing public awareness around immigration enforcement practices.

“Tom Cartwright has demonstrated extraordinary innovation and dedication in building this initiative from the ground up, and we are honored to carry his work forward,” said Uzra Zeya, CEO and President of Human Rights First. “His work brings essential transparency to U.S. government actions impacting thousands of lives and stands as a powerful example of citizen-driven accountability in defense of human rights and democracy.”

“It’s been my honor and privilege to virtually accompany and acknowledge the dignity of nearly 800,000 people deported—and millions moved between detention centers—under ICE Air’s covert and opaque process. This work has always been about bringing transparency to a system designed to operate in the shadows. I am so thankful that the dedicated team at Human Rights First will not only continue this work but expand and elevate it to a higher level,” said Tom Cartwright.

At a time when communities across the country are being ripped apart by lawless ICE enforcement actions, people (including families) are being detained in inhumane conditions and deported without due process to an expanding list of countries, the ICE Flight Monitor provides accessible, reliable data — essential for accountability.

The annual report, part of the US State Department’s global survey of human rights and covers the 2024 calendar year, criticized what it said were “serious restrictions” on free speech and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.

While the UK maintains it is striking a balance between protecting speech and keeping citizens safe, Vance claims the UK has got that balance wrong.","The Trump administration has published a report claiming that human rights in the United Kingdom “worsened” over the past year.

The annual report, part of the US State Department’s global survey of human rights and covers the 2024 calendar year, criticized what it said were “serious restrictions” on free speech and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.

Although other reports in the series claimed human rights also regressed in countries like France and Germany, the list of grievances in the UK was far longer, underscoring the supposed backsliding in the age of social media.

Specifically on freedom of speech in the UK, the US report said that “the government generally respected this right” but that “there were specific areas of concern, including involving restrictions on political speech deemed ‘hateful’ or ‘offensive.’”

A UK government spokesperson said that free speech is “vital for democracy,” and that “we are proud to uphold freedoms whilst keeping our citizens safe.”

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in February, Vice President JD Vance – who is currently on vacation in England’s rural Cotswolds – claimed that free speech across Europe is “in retreat” and singled out Britain as the country where the “basic liberties” of citizens had been caught “in the crosshairs.”

The report singled out the response by what was then the young government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the murder of three schoolgirls by Axel Rudakubana, the British son of Rwandan migrants, in the northern English town of Southport last year.

The murders – and misinformation about the identity of the perpetrator – sparked anti-immigration riots across the country, prompting some to set fire to a hotel used to house asylum seekers while people were inside.

In the wake of the Southport killings, government officials “repeatedly intervened to chill speech as to the identity and motives of the attacker,” the report said.

Although the report implied nefariousness on the part of the British government, prosecutors applied existing laws, such as the Public Order Act 1986 and the Communications Act 2003, to punish speech deemed “indecent or grossly offensive.”

To stem the rioting, Starmer – a former director of public prosecutions – pledged that those involved would face the “full force of the law.” That summer, nearly 2,000 people were arrested and more than 1,000 people were charged.

Although the riots swiftly died down after the initial spasm of outrage, many on the British right criticized the government’s response as heavy-handed, designed to throttle conservative views.

“While many media observers deemed ‘two-tier’ enforcement of these laws following the Southport attacks an especially grievous example of government censorship, censorship of ordinary Britons was increasingly routine, often targeted at political speech,” the report said.

It cited the sentencing in July of Lee Joseph Dunn to eight weeks in prison for “posting a meme suggesting a link between migrants and knife crime.” Dunn pleaded guilty to sending messages that were “grossly offensive,” which prosecutors said risked “worsening community tensions.”

Dunn’s case was not unusual. In another high-profile instance, Lucy Connolly, a mother and former nanny, was sentenced to 31 months in prison after calling for mass deportation and urging hotels housing immigrants to be set on fire. “If that makes me racist so be it,” she posted on X at the time.

While the UK maintains it is striking a balance between protecting speech and keeping citizens safe, Vance claims the UK has got that balance wrong. During a meeting last week with UK Foreign Minister David Lammy, the vice president said he did not want other countries to “follow us down what I think was a very dark path under the Biden administration” by censoring conservative views.

Following Vance’s Munich speech, and his more recent interventions, many in Britain have accused him of hypocrisy and cited the Trump administration’s detention of students over pro-Palestinian speech and taking legal action against broadcasters for what it deems hostile news coverage.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/shutterstock-editorial-15417695c.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-13 12:58:36.712491

Immigrants’ rights groups, lawyers and lawmakers have warned for weeks about deteriorating conditions inside the building, which also houses immigration courts.
Thousands of people across the country have faced arrest after showing up for court-ordered ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.
Unlike federal district court judges, immigration court judges operate under the direction of the attorney general’s office.","A federal judge in New York has ordered Donald Trump’s administration to improve conditions inside a makeshift detention center in downtown Manhattan, where detainees reported little access to food and water, sleeping on cement floors and not having anywhere to bathe for days or weeks at a time.

The order from District Judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday arrived just hours after Department of Justice lawyers admitted that immigrants inside the holding facility don’t have access to medication and aren’t allowed to meet with lawyers in person.

A lawsuit from civil rights groups includes several grim accounts from inside the facility on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza, including allegations that a 20-year-old detainee was forced to wear blood-soaked clothing after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents didn’t provide her with a pad.

In court filings, detainees said they were fed inedible “slop” and were forced to sleep in cells surrounded by the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces in rooms with open toilets.

Other detainees reported spending as much as three weeks inside the facility without a chance to bathe or brush their teeth. Another man said he watched a detainee have a seizure for 30 minutes before medical help arrived.

Kaplan ordered ICE to improve detainees’ access to personal hygiene products and medical care, as well as free, unmonitored and confidential calls with lawyers within 24 hours after they are detained.

Cells must also be cleaned three times a day, according to the order.

The order also prohibits people from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person, which shrinks the capacity of the largest hold room to roughly a dozen or so people.

Tuesday’s order “sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” according to Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project, among groups that sued the administration over conditions at the facility.

In a statement shared with The Independent, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the judge’s order and lawsuit “are driven by complete fiction about 26 Federal Plaza.”

“The fact of the matter here is the Trump administration is carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history and is removing the worst of the worst from American communities,” she added. “Any claim of subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false. 26 Federal Plaza operates as a processing center, brief intake for illegal aliens, and then transfer to an ICE detention center meeting national standards for care and custody, which are in most cases better than facilities which detain Americans.”

Homeland Security intends to appeal Kaplan’s order.

In court filings, Hugo Elias Sanchez Trillos described spending nearly three weeks inside that facility, with a three-day break in between when he was transferred to Nassau County jail.

“I was in the same clothes for 19 days, without ever having an opportunity to bathe,” he wrote.

The room “smelled terrible because no one had bathed,” according to Joselyn Chipantiza Sisalema. “There was no bathroom paper, and the guards would throw only a few paper napkins into our room,” she wrote.

Detainees were served food only twice a day, around 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., and “we got water only when the guards felt like it,” Sanchez Trillos wrote.

“The food was processed and awful; it was difficult to eat. It came inside plastic bags that were usually cold,” he said. “The guards would eat their own food in front of us, things like pizza and hamburgers. … We were so hungry and it felt [like] they were jeering at us.”

Videos from inside the facility show roughly two dozen people crammed in, lying on a cement floor with nothing but emergency blankets and thin sheets, steps away from a toilet separated only by a waist-high partition.

“Look how they have us like dogs in here,” the person filming the videos can be heard saying in Spanish.

Footage obtained by the New York Immigration Coalition provides outsiders with a first glimpse of the room, which federal officials have prevented members of Congress from observing.

In the clips, the men inside are seated on benches that line the walls or are lying on aluminum emergency blankets on the bare floor. Two toilets in the room, one of which appears to be covered by tinfoil, are blocked off by a small partition. No doors separate the toilets from the rest of the room.

Following Tuesday’s order, the “shadow 10th floor detention center must be shut down permanently,” coalition president Murad Awawdeh said in a statement.

Immigrants’ rights groups, lawyers and lawmakers have warned for weeks about deteriorating conditions inside the building, which also houses immigration courts. Federal law enforcement officers have been stationed in the building’s hallways since at least May 20 to make arrests moments after immigrants appear in court.

The “hold room” is not intended to hold people for longer than 12 hours, according to ICE’s internal guidance. In May and June, when arrests at immigration check-ins and courthouses began to skyrocket, immigrants were being held inside the room for 29 hours on average, according to a review from New York City news outlet The City. Within those two months, 81 people were detained there for four days or more at a time.

Detentions peaked on June 5, when 186 people were held there overnight, The City found.

Thousands of people across the country have faced arrest after showing up for court-ordered ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings as part of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Unlike federal district court judges, immigration court judges operate under the direction of the attorney general’s office.

The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review has issued guidance to judges to grant motions from government lawyers to immediately dismiss immigrants’ cases, making them easy targets for arrest and removal.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/12/21/40/federal-plaza-detention.png?trim=18,0,64,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-08-13 12:58:42.760117

She was pinned to the ground, handcuffed and put into an unmarked black van by masked federal agents.

The arrest put a spotlight on the risks faced by a growing number of volunteers who work to document immigration enforcement actions across Southern California.

Trebach is a member of Unión del Barrio, an immigrant rights organization, one of several advocacy groups that conduct local patrols to respond to and document immigration enforcement operations in Southern California.

For the last several months, the registered nurse, alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol, has volunteered her free time to help document masked federal immigration officials coming into and out of Terminal Island, which is being used as a staging area for immigration enforcement operations.

The Department of Homeland Security blamed Trebach for inciting her own arrest, saying in a statement that she “jumped in front of moving vehicles, causing [Border Patrol agents] to swerve out of the way.”

Trebach allegedly “continued to hit the car with her signs and fists while yelling obscenities at agents. After vehicles evaded her, she again physically blocked and impeded CBP from completing their duties.”

Federal agents arrested her on suspicion of impeding and obstructing federal law enforcement. However, Trebach was released from the federal detention center in Los Angeles on Saturday night without criminal charges, according to National Nurses United, a union and professional association of registered nurses.

Immigrant advocates alleged Trebach was targeted for her political activism. On the morning of her arrest, Trebach’s supporters say, federal agents swerved their vehicle toward the group of advocates and Trebach dropped her sign, which possibly hit the vehicle.

Despite the risks, immigrant advocacy groups say they have seen a growing interest among community members to get on the front lines to document immigration arrests.

The Community Self Defense Coalition, an immigrant advocacy organization made up of about 80 subgroups across Los Angeles County, has been getting calls from concerned residents asking for resources for their neighbors and wanting guidance on how to create their own supportive network, including local patrols.

Advocates say the best way to get involved is to volunteer with a local group that can train and prepare you for patrols and documenting enforcement operations.

“We must do so, however, in a way that keeps us safe, that doesn’t jeopardize our security and our constitutional rights because the times in which we’re living are just a bit too aggressive,” said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights.

What are your rights when documenting immigration enforcement actions?

You have the 1st Amendment right to observe, take photographs and record video of immigration enforcement in public places, which includes streets and sidewalks, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, and Witness, a nonprofit that advocates for the documentation of human rights violations.

“Do so in a way that you know ensures both your safety and ensures that you also are not getting involved in the [enforcement] actions whereby you can be charged with interference,” Cabrera said.

Immigration enforcement officials can arrest you for interfering or obstructing an operation if they believe you are getting between a federal officer and the person they’re arresting.

In this environment, whether you’ve been alerted to an arrest taking place or have stumbled into one as a bystander, advocates say an operation can happen quickly and the situation can escalate.

If you decide to document, you should consider “how ICE prioritizes their own safety and their potential aggressive response to your presence,” according to Witness.

You also should consider how to document someone who is being detained.

Advocates have mixed feelings about recording or taking photos that identify a person being arrested.

Some recommend that you try to avoid exposing the arrested person’s identity, instead focusing on recording law enforcement officials.

However, other organizations, such as Instituto de Educacion Popular del Sur de California (IDEPSCA), will temporarily post a screenshot of those who have been arrested on its Instagram account to help identify the arrested person and notify their family.

How can you safely document an arrest?

If you encounter an arrest or enforcement operation, Manuel Vicente, director of radio station and immigrant rights group Radio Jornalera, suggests the following safety tips before you hit the record button or snap a photo:

Remain calm.

Keep a safe distance from immigration enforcement officers and the person who is being arrested.

Do not interfere with immigration enforcement operations.

Narrate factual context such as location, date, time, number of immigration officials, badge numbers, whether the officers are on foot or in vehicles, whether the officers are carrying any weapons.

If an immigration official tells you to back away, comply and record yourself doing so (for example, point the camera toward your feet to show you are moving backward).

Don’t post the video to social media. Instead, share it with a local advocacy group or rapid response network so they can verify the documented information.

Either during or after the incident, call your local rapid response network to notify and share any documentation with them.

New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry said they are in contact with Ms Shaw but did not comment further.","A woman from New Zealand who was detained by US immigration with her young son at the US-Canada border feared she was being kidnapped.

Sarah Shaw, 33, and her six year-old were detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on 24 July when she drove her two eldest children to Vancouver airport in British Columbia for a direct flight to New Zealand to visit their grandparents on a holiday.

However, the mother and son were detained when they tried to cross the border to re-enter the US, where she was staying for over three years and is working as a youth counsellor at a juvenile detention facility in Washington.

“They are confined in horrible, isolated conditions with extremely limited access to communicate with legal counsel and bordering abuse,” her friend Victoria Besancon, who is trying to raise money to secure her release, said.

She said Ms Shaw initially thought she was being kidnapped as they were bundled into a white van with no markings at the Canadian border.

""I remember her on the phone being absolutely panicked. She originally thought she was being kidnapped, she didn't even realise she was being detained originally,” Ms Besancon told RNZ.

""They were put into a giant white van, there were no markers on it, and not a lot was explained to them, so she was absolutely terrified.""

She claims Ms Shaw has not been given formal charge paperwork, has not been added to ICE’s detainee locator system, and has been denied the chance to present evidence of her legal status.

She said her friend has been forced to spend what little commissary funds she has on basic items such as toothbrushes and shampoo for her son.

""She is in a locked room with five bunk beds, she's allowed to walk around the facility from 8am to 8pm, but outside of that she is locked in a cell with other families.""

Aside from the staff, she and her son are the only English speakers, calling it “kind of like being in jail”.

Ms Shaw is among the many foreign nationals who have ended up in detention centres as part of Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown on immigrants. Centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi have been dubbed Detention Alley.

Ms Shaw’s lawyer, Minda Thorward, told local media she had a temporary immigration document which made her eligible for re-entry into the US, but there was an “administrative error” with it.

The Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE), representing Ms Shaw, has demanded her release.

“The trauma this has already caused for her and her son may never be healed,” said Mike Yestramski, the union’s president, who also works as a psychiatric social worker at Western State hospital.

He said the union “vehemently opposes ICE practices” and Mr Trump’s immigration policies.

New Zealand’s foreign affairs ministry said they are in contact with Ms Shaw but did not comment further.

This means that even as more flights are carrying ICE detainees, they have become much harder to track, raising accountability concerns.
Immigration flights have taken place under Democratic as well as Republican administrations in the past, but the increase is notable in its expansiveness as well as volume.
In July, Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border tracked 207 deportation flights to several dozen countries, but 727 domestic “shuffle flights” of ICE detainees being moved within the US — the highest number since he began tracking flights in 2020, he said.
Today, the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based CSI Aviation is the largest private contractor for ICE Air.","Amid the hubbub of passengers and planes shuttling in and out of the international airport in Richmond, Virginia, each week there’s also a steady stream of flights bearing men and women in handcuffs.

Last week, CNN was there to see some of these passengers — detainees in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — being unloaded from unmarked white vans, lined up under the wing of a Boeing 737. One by one, some 50 detainees were told to board the aircraft.

According to data from immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border, Richmond is one of about 70 domestic hubs that the Trump administration has used as stoppage points for ICE flights that shuttle detainees in its custody between detention centers around the country, with the goal of eventually deporting them.

As President Donald Trump moves to remove as many as 1 million immigrants a year from the US, putting more detainees on more airplanes, and with more frequency, has become a key feature of carrying out that endeavor.

Though flights have been a part of US immigration operations for years, the speed and scale of the ICE program today is unprecedented. Since Trump’s inauguration, there have been more than 1,000 deportation flights to other countries, up 15% over the January to July period last year, according to Witness at the Border.

The flights are operated by a mix of private charter companies and at least one commercial airline, who are subcontractors to ICE, with a smaller portion carried out by military aircrafts.

But recently, experts have noticed a new trend.

Beginning in March, major companies operating the flights began requesting that their tail numbers — identifiers for planes akin to license plates on cars — be removed from public flight-tracking websites, according to Ian Petchenik of Flightradar24, one such website.

These websites provide real-time tracking of flights, displaying their positions, routes and other relevant data. They help consumers track flight delays, but are also a notable tool for public accountability.

The move to block tail numbers became possible after the Federal Aviation Administration last year broadened its rules to allow companies the ability to request their information be removed by filling out a form online.

This means that even as more flights are carrying ICE detainees, they have become much harder to track, raising accountability concerns.

“This is vital information to be able to understand how ICE is conducting its enforcement and deportation activities,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel for the ACLU National Prison Project. “Sometimes this is the only information that the public has with respect to where ICE is placing people because of a general lack of transparency around detention and deportation under this particular administration.”

These changes have made it far harder for relatives of those detained and transported by ICE to find their loved ones, according to Guadalupe Gonzalez, a spokesperson for La Resistencia, an immigration advocacy group. “Families can’t track where their loved ones are being sent, they’re just being disappeared.”

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not return CNN’s request for comment to clarify whether the agency had requested the tail numbers be hidden and why.

A spokesperson for Avelo Airlines, a commercial airline that has devoted three of its aircraft to ICE flights, told CNN in an email: “Flights operated on behalf of the United States government are often unidentified at the government’s request. As subcontractors to the United States government, we ask that you direct your questions to them.”

GlobalX Airlines, a charter company, told CNN in an email that it “is not authorized to comment on matters related to the ICE contract,” and referred CNN to ICE. Eastern Air Express, another major charter flight provider, did not respond to a request for comment.

Where does ICE fly?

Immigration flights have taken place under Democratic as well as Republican administrations in the past, but the increase is notable in its expansiveness as well as volume.

Besides the increase in deportation flights, there has been an even bigger rise in flights transporting detainees between airports within the US, according to Witness at the Border. These trips move detainees between detention facilities, as more ICE arrests means those in custody are being shuffled between sites around the country in a complex, coordinated scramble to find available beds.

In July, Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border tracked 207 deportation flights to several dozen countries, but 727 domestic “shuffle flights” of ICE detainees being moved within the US — the highest number since he began tracking flights in 2020, he said.

A booming business

A vast network of private firms operates the flights, and the industry around them, from refueling to security.

Today, the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based CSI Aviation is the largest private contractor for ICE Air. It does not operate flights directly but rather acts as the federal government’s main broker for subcontracting flights and flight-related operations.

In February 2025, CSI Aviation won an award of $128 million as the prime contractor for ICE flight operations. The contract is now worth more than $321 million.

The company works with subcontractors that operate the flights. Among the top subcontractors for flights in July were GlobalX, Eastern Air Express and Avelo Airlines, according to data from Witness at the Border.

Leaders at firms involved in the administration’s deportation operation have strongly backed Trump and his party.

CSI Aviation CEO Allen Weh is a GOP donor who has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the party and its candidates. The company hosted a Trump campaign rally at one of its hangars in Albuquerque in October 2024. Eastern Air Express, which Witness at the Border observed operating 24% of ICE flights in July, also owned and operated a 737 used for the Trump/Vance campaign.

A question of transparency

Last month, La Resistencia, which has been tracking ICE flights on the US West Coast, noted in a report on these activities that in addition to masking their tail numbers, flights are also changing their air traffic call signs.

An air traffic call sign is an identifier a flight uses to communicate with air traffic controllers and usually contains some indication of the flight’s operator.

The air traffic call sign now being used by most of these ICE flights is “Tyson ”— the same call sign Trump used for his personal plane after he was elected in 2016.

La Resistencia said in its report: “We have witnessed extensive efforts on behalf of ICE air contractors to make their immigration work as hard to observe as possible.”

Gonzalez, the La Resistencia spokesperson, said: “Our biggest concern is transparency. If we can’t observe how humans are being treated, we are worried human rights will be violated.”

She described what she saw inside as “sickening” and “worse than prison” – immigrant detainees were held in overcrowded, moldy cells and many reported that they did not have reliable access to food, water or medical care.

Two months later, Ansari returned to the remote desert complex to conduct another congressional oversight visit. This time, she was denied entry.

It wasn’t an isolated incident. From New York to California, Democratic members of Congress have been repeatedly blocked from entering Ice detention facilities where thousands of noncitizens – many with no criminal convictions – are being held.

Democratic officials’ legislative checks – a legal right for members of Congress – have consistently confirmed reports that immigrant detainees are being kept in “filthy” and “inhumane” conditions with little regard for due process. Now, the facilities have become a battleground in the intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers over the president’s supercharged immigration agenda.

“The administration’s goal is to intimidate us and bully us, bully us out of doing our jobs for sure,” Representative LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey Democrat who has been accused of assaulting federal agents during a confrontation at the Delaney Hall detention center, told the Guardian. “If they can get away with doing this to me, they can get away with doing it to anyone. But more importantly, imagine what they’re doing in the dark to others who are not of an elected status, who are not in public eye view.”

McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, said her concerns took on new resonance when, a month later, detainees at the hastily-converted jailhouse pushed down a dormitory wall – an act advocates described as an outcry against hunger and overcrowding.

Republicans accuse Democrats of failing to follow protocol, and say their unannounced visits are more political grandstanding than genuine congressional oversight. But Democrats counter that it is their responsibility to shed light on the most hidden aspects of Trump’s deportation agenda, which has ensnared Daca recipients, legal residents and even US citizens.

A report released last week by Democratic senator Jon Ossoff’s office, compiled in part from site visits, found widespread human rights abuses in immigrant detention centers, including the mistreatment of pregnant women and children. “Obstruction of Congressional oversight by the Department of Homeland Security has been an impediment to site visits and interviews with detainees,” the report noted. The DHS sought to debunk the report, calling its allegations “garbage” and saying Ossoff and his staff have never been denied oversight visits.

Last month, a dozen Democratic members of Congress filed suit over a Trump-era DHS policy requiring members of Congress and their staff to provide a week’s notice before any requested visit. They say the requirement is more than red tape – it is unconstitutional. The rule, the lawmakers argue in their suit, unlawfully restricts their oversight authority and prevents a co-equal branch of government from doing its job.

Under a provision of federal law that funds Ice, the government may not prevent a member of Congress “from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens”. Requiring advance notice, Democrats say, gives the administration time to create a misleading picture of daily operations.

“This is kind of like general oversight 101,” Colorado representative Jason Crow, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs, told the Guardian. “You announce a visit, and they roll out what they want you to see, and things are dressed up and cleaned up.”

Crow has conducted site inspections at immigration detention sites in his district since 2019 – and he helped pass the law that solidified Congress’s right to make unannounced inspections. In July, he was blocked from entering a center in Aurora.

Similar confrontations are playing out nationwide. On Wednesday, a delegation of Democratic representatives from New York, including the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Adriano Espaillat, were turned away from a center in Brooklyn now housing detained immigrants under a new agreement with the Bureau of Prisons.

“This blatant lack of respect towards the legislative branch is a deterioration of checks and balances,” Espaillat said after the encounter. “All while they hide their atrocities from the public.”

In a response posted on X, the DHS called the lawmakers’ efforts “deeply unserious”. “These members did not follow proper protocol and schedule their visit. Instead they brought a gaggle of media to drive clicks and fundraising emails,” the department said.

In a statement, department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Ice had imposed the new visitation policy to protect the president’s constitutional authority to carry out immigration enforcement and protect agency personnel from “a surge in assaults, disruptions, and obstructions to enforcement – including by member of Congress themselves”.

“A week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority,” she said.

As relatives and lawyers struggle to locate and contact people in Ice custody, advocates say congressional visits are essential to building a public record of conditions inside facilities that operate far from public view.

“We are not talking about a mistake here and there,” said Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice-president of the Latino Vote Initiative at UnidosUS. “We’re talking about a pattern of abuse that is happening in multiple communities, and bearing witness to that, and building that record so that members who may want to … are not able to say that this is happenstance or anecdotal.”

Ice arrests and detentions rose sharply in the first six months after Trump returned to the White House. In Democratic-leaning states masked Ice agents are frequently arresting immigrants at worksites, in the streets and in mass roundups – aggressive tactics that triggered protests in cities such as Los Angeles. Their targets are increasingly people with no criminal records at all.

As arrests soar to record numbers, the nation’s immigration detention system – a patchwork of government-run and private facilities – is buckling under the strain. By late June, it was over capacity by more than 13,500 people, according to a Guardian analysis of public data from the Deportation Data Project. Ten immigration detainees have died in federal custody so far this year, compared to 11 deaths in all of 2024.

McLaughlin called claims of overcrowding and poor conditions at Ice detention centers “categorically false”. The agency, she added, has “worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space” to accommodate the Trump administration’s mass arrest and incarceration operation.

The scramble to create more detention beds has seen the agency sign new contracts with private prisons companies, as well as federal and state prisons. The secretary of the DHS, Kristi Noem, recently touted plans to open a detention center in Indiana it calls the “Speedway Slammer”, following the opening of “Alligator Alcatraz”, a facility built in the middle of the Florida Everglades. Last week, the Pentagon said Fort Bliss, an army base in Texas, was prepared to accept as many as 1,000 immigrant detainees by the end of the month.

On Tuesday, the Trump administration was ordered to improve conditions inside an immigration holding facility in New York City, after advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of detainees who described being kept in unsanitary and overcrowded cells, without access to basic necessities, including hygiene products.

Shortly after immigration raids swept Los Angeles in June, triggering days of tense protests, Congresswoman Judy Chu of California said her office began receiving urgent requests from advocates and worried family members asking for help locating people believed to be held at a center in the remote desert town of Adelanto.

Chu had visited the facility several times during her years in office. But on 8 June, guards scrambled to lock the fence when she arrived with California congressmen Gil Cisneros and Derek Tran, she recounted. The trio shouted their names and held up signs identifying themselves as members of Congress – but they were turned away.

“It was illegal, of course, because we have this right to go in,” Chu said in an interview.

More than a week later, Chu and a larger delegation of California Democrats were granted access to the facility and were able to meet with people detained during the raids, including a Daca recipient. Some said they had gone days without a change of clothes and were, in many cases, unable to call their families or legal representatives.

“We must keep on trying, because otherwise we don’t know what will happen to these detainees,” Chu said, vowing to push for more access. “The less attention that is being given through our oversight inspections, the more [DHS] thinks it can get away with the worst conditions possible.”

Congressman Jay Obernolte, a Republican of California, came away with a different impression when he toured the Adelanto facility in July, days after Trump deployed the national guard and active duty marines to quell the immigration protests that had erupted across Los Angeles. In a statement, he said that those in custody at the facility have “access to medical care, legal counsel, meals, and the full rights guaranteed under federal law”.

“Facilities like Adelanto exist to help Ice enforce our immigration laws and keep our communities safe,” he said. “The vast majority of detainees housed here have committed serious crimes in addition to being present in our country illegally. They are being processed quickly, fairly, and humanely.”

In a statement,​ a spokesman​ for the private prison firm GEO Group said that​ the detention facilities it operates, like Adelanto in California and elsewhere across the country, provide “around-the-clock access to medical care​” as well as “in-person and virtual​ legal and family visitation” in addition to other services. ​The detention centers adhered to strict federal detention standards on safety, food and medical care in addition to the facility’s capacity, the spokesman said, stating: “Simply put, our facilities are never overcrowded.​”

As Democratic officials continue to face barriers, they have started sharing best practices for securing access.

Before visiting a facility in Eloy, Arizona, to check on a local restaurant owner held there in Ice custody, Congressman Greg Stanton consulted another member of Congress for advice. He brought a copy of the law that affirms members’ oversight rights and asked to speak with senior officials on site.

Still, he was refused entry.

“I think others feel the same way I do, which is, you don’t get to pick and choose which laws you follow,” Stanton said. “And it may be inconvenient to have a member of Congress show up and try to do their duty of oversight, but that doesn’t matter. This is what the law says, and you’ve got to follow the law.”

Brian Todd, a spokesman for the private prison contractor CoreCivic, which operates the Eloy Detention Center, said that while the company endeavors to be “as accommodating and transparent as possible,” all congressional visits must be coordinated through Ice’s office of congressional relations. He also said that the facilities were closely monitored by federal observers to ensure compliance and said claims of poor food or water quality at the center were “patently false”.

“We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people,” Todd said, “but the fact is we operate safe, secure facilities that provide high quality services for our government partners at Ice”.

Crow, the Colorado congressman, began inspections of a privately operated immigration facility outside Denver in 2019, following repeated community reports about poor conditions, disease outbreaks, access to medical care and poor food storage.

“I represent a lot of immigrants and refugees, and frequently we’re dealing with their families or with constituents and checking on individual conditions or access to counsel for residents of our district,” he said.

At first, access was limited – prompting his push to strengthen protections for members of Congress. He eventually created a toolkit complete with a template for oversight visits, which he now shares with other members of Congress.

“There are egregious abuses occurring on a daily basis around the country, everything from unmarked vans with masked agents jumping out and grabbing people … to the lack of access to legal counsel and a variety of abuses,” he said. “So that’s what we’re worried about. And clearly this administration wants to hide their activities.”

McIver, whose charges stem from an attempt to shield Newark mayor Ras Baraka from arrest during a protest at the facility, said she still has a right to conduct oversight visits – she remains a member of Congress and serves on a homeland security committee. But with a serious legal case pending, she has opted not to return – for now.

“They’re using me as an example to try to be as cruel as possible to me and humiliate me and intimidate me, hoping that that will carry over to other people,” she said.

Despite the risks, other Democratic members of Congress are still showing up – even when doors are slammed in their faces – because, as McIver put it, “it’s their job”.

“They’re not stopping.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5e8c31fa66c31441785afe2dfa22db12524b0c8/309_0_3334_2667/master/3334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=369ada45a7b76078181dd620027d196f",N,,2025-08-13 10:56:21.499644

His small law office in New England currently handles 5,000 immigration cases, many of them assigned to the Chelmsford Immigration Court, just outside Boston.

But on a recent Wednesday afternoon, seven of nine appointments were rescheduled.

The next day, two out of three were pushed.

And the following day, four out of six got delayed.

""The court is not functioning,"" Born said. He said some of his clients have waited more than a decade for their court hearings.

""Now that's being taken away. So the little light at the end of the tunnel for these people who have been following the American dream and playing by all the rules is increasingly being snuffed.""

The Chelmsford Immigration Court opened last year as a way to reduce the backlog on the overloaded Boston court, which used to process immigration cases for much of New England. Chelmsford and Boston are now the only courts located in New England, two of about 70 immigration courts and adjudication centers nationwide.

Eight months into the Trump administration, there are only seven judges listed on the court's website, down from the 21 intended to serve. One of those seven is set to retire in the coming days, NPR has learned. Another has been detailed to review cases in Indianapolis.

NPR spoke with nearly a dozen of the judges assigned to work at the Chelmsford Immigration Court who are no longer there. All attest to a clear pattern: judges vacating their benches, increased political pressure and a growing dread of not knowing if their jobs are safe.

The Chelmsford court has hemorrhaged judges in recent months; many of those hired in the last two years have now been fired or resigned. The judicial vacancies there exacerbate a national backlog of about 3.7 million cases in the immigration court system.

The Trump administration's twin efforts to downsize the federal government and increase immigration arrests are colliding in the immigration system, where immigration courts are run as part of the civil service inside the Department of Justice — apart from the judicial branch, which controls other federal courts.

Postponed day in court

The loss of court judges and staff throws a wrench in the already-limited due process afforded to immigrants seeking relief from deportation, former employees at Chelmsford and lawyers said.

""People know not everybody is going to win,"" Stephanie Marzouk, an immigration attorney in Boston, said about her clients. ""But at least they'll have a chance to have their case heard before a judge who is going to treat them fairly and get some sort of reasoned decision out of it.""

But Marzouk and Born said instead of getting their day in court, their clients are seeing cases postponed by years — even as far out as 2029.

In the meantime, those awaiting final resolution could be arrested or deported, as part of the Trump administration's broader effort to boost mass deportations.

""Whatever date I got today, it will definitely be rescheduled again because at this point, there are not enough judges in that court to address the amount of people and cases,"" said Diecelis Escano, another attorney with cases at Chelmsford.

On July 18, a week after the latest round of dismissals, the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the agency immigration courts are in, posted an immigration judge vacancy announcement, which includes Chelmsford as a location.

Kathryn Mattingly, a spokesperson for EOIR, said reducing the immigration court backlog was one of her agency's highest priorities.

""Under this Administration, the total pending caseload of immigration court cases has fallen by more than 391,000 cases,"" she said, ""and EOIR will continue to use all of its resources to adjudicate immigration cases fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly consistent with due process.""

Boston is an immigration hotspot

The Chelmsford court is part of a region already feeling pressure from not having enough immigration judges.

White House border czar Tom Homan vowed back in February he would be ""bringing hell"" to Boston, pledging to crack down on illegal immigration there. It's one of 18 cities the Department of Homeland Security recently labeled a ""sanctuary jurisdiction"" that ""impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.""

Immigration lawyers report a growing number of cases that are often time-sensitive.

The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration judges, said Chelmsford is among those courts with the biggest decrease in judges in the nation.

""The court will be there physically, but there will be no judges to hear the cases,"" union president Matt Biggs said about what could happen if the downsizing trend continues. He said the administration now has 600 judges nationwide, down from 700 at the end of the Biden administration.

Chelmsford opened for business in April 2024 and was meant to reduce the backlog on the overloaded Boston court. In interviews, former court personnel and lawyers estimate some 70,000 immigration cases were transferred from Boston to Chelmsford then.

EOIR at the time said it wanted to add 21 judges to help process more cases, from asylum applications to final approval of deportation orders.

""It was all for nothing""

Nationally, the union has not identified clear patterns over whom the administration is choosing to dismiss.

There have been three rounds of firings, including getting rid of a class of new judges that had not even taken the bench yet. The dismissals included former Homeland Security prosecutors, veterans, decades-long federal employees, and those with years of immigration law experience.

Others have chosen to leave the bench voluntarily in expectation of layoffs or to take advantage of early retirement.

The vacant halls of the court betray the remnants of judges whose names have been swiftly scrubbed from the EOIR website.

Tucked in a corner on the second floor is the name plate for Nancy Griffiths, an immigration judge who left her decades-long job as a judge at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and moved from Phoenix to work at Chelmsford.

""It was such an incredibly proud moment. My family came to Washington for my investiture ceremony. My children robed me,"" Griffiths said.

She said she will leave her employment in September.

""We were so excited — and a year and a half later, we're scrambling and trying to figure out what to do with our lives and put our lives back together,"" she said.

Griffiths recalls the ""demoralizing"" process of helping colleagues pack up their offices after they received termination notices.

""People's lives have been torn upside down and that is a waste,"" Griffiths said. She said some people moved away from spouses and children, and EOIR spent money on training and building the new court. ""That was all for nothing,"" she said.

Leaving thousands of cases behind

Former Judge Angela Munro received the email in April notifying her that her employment would be terminated and placed on administrative leave — just a few days shy of the end of her two-year probationary period. Munro spent 16 years working at EOIR, first as a law clerk and then at the Board of Immigration Appeals.

""I didn't have blinders on. I knew what was possible,"" Munro said — given the layoffs of other probationary employees in the federal government. ""But I also knew in my mind that I was doing a good job and that immigration judges are supposedly needed.""

Munro had about 4,000 cases on her docket, she said, and had completed about 1,000. She describes her dismissal as ""abrupt and traumatic."" She returned to her desk around 3 p.m. after issuing what ended up being her final oral decision on an asylum case. That's when she saw an email asking her to pack up her office and be out that day.

Each laid-off or departing judge leaves about 4,000 cases each for their colleagues to pick up, NPR found in its interviews. Tens of thousands of cases are now estimated to have been affected by the loss of judges at Chelmsford.

Former Judge Jenny Beverly, who left EOIR in July, said she was preparing to be assigned thousands of extra cases on behalf of judges who had been let go.

""I wanted to be a part of the system to help move things along,"" Beverly said about her reasons for joining the Chelmsford court.

Beverly commuted up to two hours each way from her home in Maine to adjudicate cases in Chelmsford. Her decision to leave came after leaders at EOIR requested that she shift her workload to handle cases in New Jersey to focus on those already in detention.

""Here I was sitting in Massachusetts, but being asked on short notice to handle cases in New Jersey. And according to my boss, it was because EOIR was prioritizing those cases instead,"" Beverly said. She shared internal communication with NPR that backed up that request.

""Any immigration judge can hear any case at any time, and adjudicating detained immigration cases remains a high priority for the agency,"" Mattingly, the EOIR spokesperson, said in response to questions about judges being moved.

Backlogs grow as EOIR dismisses judges

As more people have been placed in detention, and judges have been dismissed, EOIR has strained with the pressure of keeping up with cases. For example, Beverly left EOIR on July 2, but still had two hearings on the electronic TV schedule in the Chelmsford waiting area on display on July 27.

Griffiths, the judge who moved from Phoenix, noted that her own docket included pending cases from 2013 that over the years had bounced from one judge to another.

The judicial vacancies in Chelmsford exacerbate a national backlog of millions of cases in the immigration court system.

The most recent judicial terminations came after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that immediately allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including for hiring more immigration judges.

The Homeland Security Department has moved quickly to recruit attorneys who will represent ICE in courts like Chelmsford. But the Justice Department has not launched a similar recruitment campaign to hire more immigration judges, despite posting positions online.

Immigration advocates have raised concerns that without the resources to properly process those arrested, the limited due process afforded to some immigrants is undercut.

""EOIR continues to adjudicate immigration cases fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly consistent with due process,"" Mattingly told NPR as a response to those concerns.

Judges said that courtroom misconduct, complaints from private or government attorneys, or an inability to manage caseload were among the reasons judges were dismissed in the past.

But the most recent groups of terminated judges have been left to guess why they were not kept on beyond their two-year probationary period.

Instead of reasons specific to them, each got a short email — similar to one sent to other laid-off employees at the Justice Department and other agencies.

""Pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment,"" according to the emails shared with NPR.

""It was my silent protest""

George Pappas was among the latest judges to be dismissed in July. He listened to cases until his last day but had been expecting the termination notice since the April round of firings — and had already cleared out his office in preparation.

""Anything that was still hanging on my walls was taken down. I took out all my personal belongings,"" Pappas said. ""From that point forward, I worked in a blank room and it was my way of taking control of that which I could control. It was my silent protest.""

Sitting in a nearly empty apartment, he prepared to move back home to North Carolina. He closed his 20-year independent practice to serve as an immigration judge, where he said he wanted to make a dent in the backlog of cases.

""I didn't grant asylum to everybody, but when I did, I changed somebody's life,"" he said. The day he got his notice, he said, he had spent several hours listening to a case where in the end he granted a cancellation of removal, a protection from deportation that allows people to pursue a green card.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8368x4707+0+439/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2F70%2Fd5613ba94ff5b6dcf331254ef7e7%2F20250530-immigration-courts-nierman-1192911.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 10:56:26.139788

As the plaintiffs didn't have the required standing, McFadden concluded the court could not decide the merits of the case.
Broader 'Self-Deportation' Strategy The plaintiffs argue that the policy—which the Trump administration says aligns immigration enforcement with the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act—is part of a broader ""self-deportation"" strategy.","A federal appeals court on Tuesday declined to halt the implementation of a national registry for noncitizens, delivering a procedural victory for the Trump administration in a case that has drawn sharp criticism from immigrant rights advocates.

In a ruling issued in the name of the court as a whole (a ""per curiam"" order), rather than attributed to a specific judge, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected an emergency request from several advocacy groups to block the Alien Registration Requirement (ARR) while litigation continued.

Judges Karen Henderson, Robert Wilkins, and Bradley Garcia—appointed by Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden, respectively—found that the plaintiffs had not met the ""stringent"" standard for an injunction, pending appeal.

Why This Matters

The D.C. Circuit's refusal to pause the ARR means the rule will remain in effect nationwide for months while the appeal plays out. For the Trump administration, the decision represents a step toward reinstating strict enforcement measures grounded in decades-old immigration laws.

For immigrant rights groups, it signals an uphill legal battle against a policy they say will deter participation in public life and expose millions to heightened surveillance and potential prosecution.

The ruling also underscores that the outcome is not being determined along partisan lines—judges appointed by presidents from both parties agreed the plaintiffs had not met the legal standard for an emergency injunction.

What To Know

The regulation, which took effect April 11 after a lower court ruling, requires all noncitizens aged 14 and older to register their fingerprints and carry an identification card or face potential fines or imprisonment. Younger children must be registered by a parent or guardian and re-register upon turning 14.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) estimates the rule could affect between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people, primarily those who entered the country without documentation.

Canadians staying longer than one month also fall under the requirement.

The panel's decision on Tuesday leaves in place an April 10 ruling by U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, who determined that the plaintiffs—Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, United Farm Workers of America, Casa Inc. and Make the Road New York—had not demonstrated that the registry would ""erode their core missions"" and presented only speculative harm.

As the plaintiffs didn't have the required standing, McFadden concluded the court could not decide the merits of the case.

Broader 'Self-Deportation' Strategy

The plaintiffs argue that the policy—which the Trump administration says aligns immigration enforcement with the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act—is part of a broader ""self-deportation"" strategy.

Carl Berquist, general counsel for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, told Courthouse News that the measure ""melds into the administration's entire self-deportation plan of rolling out these [ICE] raids, repurposing the CBP One app into this CBP Home app with a self-deportation tool and trying to roll out some kinds of incentives for people to take action.""

The policy had a ""severe chilling effect"" on noncitizens, Berquist added, implicating ""their Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate"" and ""their First Amendment right to assemble and to protest,"" He described the case as ""a little bit below the radar"" compared with higher-profile immigration disputes but maintained the harm is ""substantial nonetheless.""

The National Immigration Law Center has also warned that enforcement could lead to increased racial profiling. In a statement, the group said: ""While their stated targets are undocumented immigrants, the very mechanics of enforcing registration expand the target to anyone who looks or sounds foreign to law enforcement.""

Newsweek contacted Carl Berquist and the National Immigration Law Center for comment via email on Thursday outside of regular office hours.

What People Are Saying

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: ""The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws—we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce."" An emailed statement carried by Courthouse News continued: ""We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.""

What Happens Next

According to DHS, certain categories of immigrants—including green card holders, individuals with removal orders, people holding Employment Authorization Documents, those admitted with visas, border crossing card holders, and others—are already considered registered under existing law.

The D.C. Circuit has set an expedited schedule for the case, with the plaintiffs' brief due September 16, the government's response due October 16, and a reply from the plaintiffs due November 6.

Oral arguments will follow, with a date to be determined.

For now, the ARR remains in effect nationwide, and both sides are preparing for a legal confrontation in the fall that could test the scope of federal authority over noncitizen identification and tracking.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2662078/texas-protests.jpg,N,,2025-08-13 07:57:53.262775

Here's What It Should Look Like - The Fulcrum,"Edward Saltzberg, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://thefulcrum.us/rule-of-law/immigration-reform,"It was under President Clinton that the immigration enforcement system that we know today was created.
Obama tried to answer the challenge of undocumented immigrants with a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill that included a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented individuals.
The Local Economy: Less immigration enforcement cooperation increases economic benefits such as local income per capita, average wages, GDP, and employment rates.
Opponents of Sanctuary Policies Sanctuary policies also have their opponents.
The Effectiveness of Immigration Enforcement: Sanctuary laws create a culture of hostility towards federal law and slow down the work of immigration authorities.","Their extra-legal status is a problem because: They have no rights and are thus subject to abuse. They are not entitled to federal benefits, so their welfare and that of their communities are impacted. They are part of a huge black market of labor that the government cannot regulate. Bottom line, you have 11 million people living here who are not integrated into the larger society.

Contrary to Trump, the problem is not that they are criminals, take jobs away from Americans, and use up resources; those are all lies, fabrications. Undocumented immigrants are no more likely to be criminals than the rest of the population. They are mostly hard-working, tax-paying people with families, trying to eke out an existence in a new country. They don't take away jobs from Americans because American workers don't want the jobs immigrants take. And as a general matter, they are not eligible for federal benefits. The one exception is that they are entitled to access public education.

Those are the facts. But before talking about an answer to the immigration problem, we need to talk about the reasons for having a particular immigration policy to begin with.

Immigrants were welcomed by our country in the 19th century because, first, they supplied people to populate the vast new areas that had been added to our country, and later, they supplied the vast unskilled labor pool that our expanding country and industry desperately needed. America would not have been able to become the economic powerhouse it is without these immigrants.

Where do things stand today? As seen by the reaction of agriculture, meatpackers, and various other businesses, undocumented immigrants are critical to their ability to grow and process the produce and meat needed by our country to feed itself. These are jobs that pay so poorly, with working conditions that are so bad, that Americans have no interest in applying for these positions. Without the flow of undocumented immigrants, this part of our economy would grind to a halt. That would not be in the national interest.

So the question is, why don't we increase our legal immigration quotas to allow the influx of workers this country desperately needs? Why do we not provide a path to citizenship for those who are already here, working and paying taxes?

The answer is xenophobia and bigotry. There are many Americans, not just White supremacists, who don't like the fact that white people will soon no longer be the majority race in the U.S., largely because of the huge influx of Hispanics over the past few decades.

Democrats are viewed as being weak on immigration. Republicans hold up the picture that all but one of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates responded in a debate that they favored decriminalizing illegal entry into the U.S. But it wasn't always so. It was under President Clinton that the immigration enforcement system that we know today was created.

Obama tried to answer the challenge of undocumented immigrants with a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill that included a 13-year path to citizenship for undocumented individuals. It passed the Senate with substantial Republican support because of the hard line it took on border security. But the Republican-controlled House didn't even take up consideration of the bill. A possible explanation: This xenophobic attitude is especially prevalent in rural areas, and in rural areas lies the strength of the Republican Party.

In the years since then, Trump has done a great disservice to this country by painting a false picture of undocumented immigrants as criminal scum. Because this picture has been embraced as fact by his supporters, it will make it that much harder to pass the legislation necessary to integrate these immigrants into our nation and legally provide agriculture and other industries with the flow of unskilled labor they need to function.

So what's the political and humane solution to the immigration problem? The answer is again a package combining strict border security with immigration reform.

All illegal immigration must be stopped at the border through strict enforcement of our laws.

Undocumented immigrants who are currently in the U.S., working and paying taxes, and who have not been convicted of crimes, should be given a path to citizenship with their families (children and parents) who are already here.

Those undocumented immigrants under 60 who are already here and who do not choose to take advantage of the path to citizenship should be subject to deportation, humanely, back to their country of origin.

The legal immigration quota from Mexico, Central America, and other relevant countries should be increased substantially to allow for the labor needed by American businesses.

A major education program should be undertaken by the federal government to correct the damage done by Trump to the reputation of undocumented immigrants in the minds of many Americans.

The federal government should institute ESL (English as a Second Language) courses for all immigrants.

Some minimum level of mastery of the English language should be required for renewal of a Green Card or other legal status for all immigrants under 60 after they have been here for two years. (Such a requirement already exists for citizenship.)

The last points may be controversial because many people, mostly Democrats and people of color, are against the idea of making English the country's official language and thus would likely be against mandatory English training as well as the language requirement for Green Card renewal.

But if the idea of immigration is to integrate immigrants into the flow of the American economy and society within a reasonable period of time, then a minimum mastery of English should be required, not just for citizenship but for Green Card holders (permanent residents) as well. The idea is not to disrespect the immigrants' culture but to ensure that immigrants are also able to partake in American culture and be part of our society. I am in fact in favor of vibrant ethnic and racial subcultures coexisting with American culture (see my blogpost ""Pluralism or DEI?"").

We are a nation of immigrants. But it's important to realize that this fact was not the result of some do-gooder, humanitarian policy, as exemplified in Emma Lazarus' famous poem that is enshrined at the Statue of Liberty. It was instead the result of the government's acknowledgement of an economic reality—that a major influx of people was needed to grow our country and prosper. This has been the basis of the government's immigration policy through much of our history, despite the xenophobic reaction of much of the population—even of immigrants once they became established—to new waves of immigrants.

The government must again react with good policy in the face of popular xenophobia.

As immigration has grown politically contentious, some towns and cities have enacted sanctuary policies to limit local agencies’ cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. First emerging in the 1980s, with San Francisco becoming the first in the nation to pass a sanctuary law relating to immigration, these laws historically reduce and restrict local and federal coordination. Sanctuary city policies often rest on the following arguments:

Federalism: Cities and states are not required to enforce federal law.

Public Safety: Immigrants have less fear of interacting with law enforcement and are more likely to report crimes, cooperate, and serve as witnesses.

Community Health: Immigrants can access basic public services like education and healthcare.

The Local Economy: Less immigration enforcement cooperation increases economic benefits such as local income per capita, average wages, GDP, and employment rates.

In line with the Tenth Amendment, federalism emphasizes the federal government’s responsibility to enforce federal laws and reduces local and state cooperation to that end. Upheld in Printz v. United States and Murphy v. NCAA, the Supreme Court has frequently upheld this separation in landmark cases. With respect to immigrant violators of state or local crime, ICE can issue an “immigration detainer” requesting local officials to hold an individual for up to 48 hours beyond their normal release to allow time to secure their federal detention. However, local authorities do not have to honor this request when sanctuary policies are enacted.

Sanctuary policies layer protections on immigrants in interactions with law enforcement regardless of documentation status. Many sanctuary policies prevent police from asking or sharing information regarding immigration status, which advocates say allows immigrants to contact 911 without hesitation in the event of an emergency. Police agencies also argue that these sanctuary policies are essential in encouraging crime reporting and cooperation in case building.

Protections also extend to immigrants’ access to public services, such as public schools and medical care. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Plyler v. Doe in 1982 paved the way for legislation implementing these protections, as it held that states cannot prevent the children of undocumented immigrants from attending public schools except in cases of potential threat to state interests. Now, states with sanctuary cities like California can prohibit public schools from making immigration status inquiries.

By increasing immigrants’ geographic security through these protections, sanctuary cities also see a boost in economic activity. In fact, one study at Oregon State University found a correlation between “overall per capita income, wages, GDP, and total employment” and the degree of protection for immigrants under sanctuary policies. Although unable to receive public benefits, many undocumented immigrants also pay taxes and boost local revenues, contributing 37.3 billion dollars towards state and local funds. Also in 2022, immigrants paid 96.7 billion dollars in taxes, of which 59.4 billion dollars was allocated to the federal government.

Opponents of Sanctuary Policies

Sanctuary policies also have their opponents. They argue that such policies undermine:

The Rule of Law: Sanctuary cities challenge federal prerogatives over immigration enforcement.

Public Safety: Law enforcement has to release individuals who have committed a crime back into the community despite their pending immigration status.

The Effectiveness of Immigration Enforcement: Sanctuary laws create a culture of hostility towards federal law and slow down the work of immigration authorities.

Public Budgets: Jurisdictions spend taxpayer dollars to provide services to undocumented immigrants.

While sanctuary laws are constitutional under the principle of federalism, opponents argue theycontribute to a legal “nullification crisis.” They argue the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, and states and localities lack the authority to set immigration policy. They point to one federal law that prohibits any level of government from preventing the sharing of immigration status with the federal government. Critics argue that sanctuary laws that prohibit information sharing violate this exclusive federal jurisdiction.

Opponents have also raised concerns about the undocumented immigrants accused, charged, or convicted of committing crimes. In some cases, local police in sanctuary cities might release rather than detain these individuals, potentially facilitating the continuation of their crimes. In 2015, Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant, shot and killed Kathryn Steinle in San Francisco. Even after facing several felonies and deportations, local officials still declined to honor the ICE detainer request. Even so, many sanctuary laws also include exceptions for serious and violent crimes.

Sanctuary laws also hinder the work of immigration enforcement. Even if ICE does not utilize local facilities, they can foster a culture of hostility towards ICE operations and reduce effectiveness. In 2018, Mayor Libby Schaaf of Oakland tweeted a warning to immigrants of ICE activity in the city. ICE respondedby criticizing Schaaf’s action as endangering agents and allowing targets to avoid arrest.

Despite economic benefits to the greater city, critics argue that undocumented immigrants place a fiscal burden on local jurisdictions. From public education to medical services, Fair reported that illegal immigration had accrued a net cost of 150.7 billion dollars to United States taxpayers by 2023. In Tennessee, educating undocumented students costs the state 3.9 million dollars annually, and in Florida, two billion dollars are spent providing education and healthcare to undocumented immigrants. Even with the current cost of the undocumented migrant crisis in New York City, research estimates its five billion dollar cost for the two years will double in 2025.

Conclusion

The divide between federal, state, and local governments over immigration enforcement is a contentious and unresolved issue. Despite sanctuary cities’ laws and disputed net gains, the conflict ultimately boils down to a legal debate over federal and state jurisdiction. In lieu of an answer, President Trump signed an executive order in February 2025 to end federal funding for sanctuary cities, kicking off a storm of reactionary lawsuits which may yield a settlement.

The Mason Board of Mayor and Aldermen called a special meeting to review two contracts: one between the town and CoreCivic, and one between the town and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

After a chaotic exchange between aldermen and a crowd of constituents and residents of nearby towns in West Tennessee, the board approved the CoreCivic contract 4-1 with two abstentions. The ICE contract passed 3-2 with two abstentions.

Neither document was provided to the public prior to the meeting, and town attorney Nathan Bicks said he and others were working on the CoreCivic contract until Monday, giving the board about 24 hours to review it in its final form before the vote.

Crowds flanked the 1,500-person town’s Main Street more than 40 minutes before the meeting began, holding signs decrying ICE and opposing the facility’s reopening.

The 600-bed prison closed in 2021 after the Department of Justice, under order from then-President Joe Biden, did not renew its contract with CoreCivic to operate the facility. President Donald Trump reversed Biden’s order against contracting with private detention facilities in January.

Mason Mayor Eddie Noeman, the first Egyptian immigrant to represent the town, voted in favor of both contracts, citing the job and economic opportunities that would come with reopening the facility.

“We need everybody’s support, everybody’s business here,” he said. “We open arms for everybody. We’re not against nobody.”

Alderman Virginia Rivers, who previously served as the town’s vice mayor, disagreed.

“I feel you should have been notified and made aware of this situation before now,” Rivers told the audience. “I understand and support the need to deport actual criminals, but the majority of the people who are being deported and detained are lawful citizens.”

“We, as the officials of the Town of Mason that was elected by the citizens, should consider the consequences and the hurt that this will cause our local community, our neighbors, Tennessee schools, and many families,” Rivers said, adding that entering into a contract with CoreCivic and ICE would “make our city complicit in the abusive treatment of immigrants.”

Mason officials held the meeting in the Mason Fire Department garage across the street from Mason City Hall to accommodate some of the larger crowd. The remaining audience stood outside the garage doors, chanting and drumming through most of the meeting. Officials passed around a microphone attached to a karaoke machine, and audience members repeatedly yelled out that they could not hear what officials were saying.

The majority of audience members who spoke at the meeting opposed the contracts.

Those who spoke in support pointed to property tax, impact fees and utility revenue that would come from the facility. CoreCivic stated the facility would generate about $325,000 in annual property taxes, and an estimated $1.2 million in annual utility payments. When fully operational, the facility would generate about $200,000 in annual impact fees to the town, according to the company.

Eloise Thompson, a fifth-generation resident of nearby Fayette County, said she was against Mason “becoming a for-profit center for human suffering.”

She said Mason has other alternatives to create jobs and stimulate the local economy that “speak more to the character of who we are.”

Darryle Donell, a veteran and Mason resident, said he previously worked at the facility when it was run by Corrections Corporation of America, which later became CoreCivic.

“That prison ain’t never been good for the town,” he said, calling for transparency, honesty and loyalty from town leaders. “I don’t see no prison. I see a concentration camp.”

Christa Poindexter, another Mason resident, approached Noeman during the meeting and asked why he supported the contracts.

“I want the job. Jobs,” he said.

At one point, at least three board members — Noeman, Vice Mayor Reynaldo Givhan, and Alderman Alethea Harris — exited the building during a period of public comment.

Givhan voted in favor of the CoreCivic contract but abstained from voting on the ICE contract.

“When I moved here 20 years ago, CCA or CoreCivic employed several of my family members, and it was thriving,” he said after the meeting adjourned. “I was actually excited when we first got word that they were coming, that it was going to reopen.”

The “negative connotation that’s connected with just the word ICE … you feel it, and in your heart of hearts, you have to be able to look at yourself in the mirror,” he said of his abstention.

Givhan said he exited the building, which was not air conditioned, during the meeting to “get some air” and pray. He said he did not talk to other board members and did not see other members talking to each other.

CoreCivic Public Affairs Manager Brian Todd said 2,100 people have already applied for the roughly 240 job openings at the facility. These roles would pay a starting salary of about $26.50 per hour, according to a statement distributed by CoreCivic representatives at the meeting.

“You all may feel that there’s no oversight and accountability at the facility, and that is far, far from the truth,” CoreCivic representative Jerry Langford said. “The facility will operate with strong oversight and accountability … our government partners will have a presence at that facility while we’re operating, including regular audits and on-site monitors. Both our company and the government partners share a deep commitment to humane care.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-97/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/mason002seqn-1024x6831755079454.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=7mQX6nGM,N,,2025-08-13 10:56:39.914730

Now, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn these rulings.
The district court then concluded that ""sole reliance on the four enumerated factors does not constitute reasonable suspicion.""
The United States also argues in its brief to the Supreme Court that the district court order requiring compliance with the Constitution will unduly interfere with ICE.
Finally, the government argues in the Supreme Court that a federal district court cannot issue a remedy that applies throughout the district.","Of the dozens of district court orders stopping Trump administration violations of the U.S. Constitution, none is more important than the recent temporary restraining order to prevent ICE from violating the Constitution. On July 12, United States District Court Judge Maame E. Frimpong, in the Central District of California, issued a TRO, saying that she was presented with a ""mountain of evidence"" proving ICE's stops were without reasonable suspicion and were based on race. On Aug. 1, the United States Court of the Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Perdomo v. Noem, upheld Judge Frimpong's order.

Now, the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn these rulings. The brief it has filed is stunning in seeking to make ICE's actions unreviewable, even when it is clearly violating the Constitution. It is imperative that the court, which has overwhelming sided with President Trump, affirm the lower courts.

The law is clear that the Fourth Amendment requires that police, including ICE, must have reasonable suspicion to stop someone and probable cause to take them into custody. The law is also well established that police violate equal protection if they use race as a basis for deciding who to stop or arrest.

Judge Frimpong found that ICE was violating these basic constitutional requirements. The focus was on ICEs use of roving patrols to stop individuals. As the 9th Circuit said, these ""contact teams"" ""typical[ly] ... consist of three to five agents who contact individuals in public places such as streets, sidewalks, and publicly accessible portions of businesses."" ICE official Kyle Harvick said, ""Certain types of businesses, including carwashes, were selected for [contact team] encounters because past experience demonstrated that they are likely to employ persons without legal documentation. During operations in Los Angeles, [federal] agents temporarily detained individuals, and made arrests for immigration violations and federal criminal statutes.""

The plaintiffs include individuals who were stopped and detained solely based on their race. The plaintiffs also included associations, such as the United Farm Workers, the Los Angeles Worker Center Network, and the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights whose members have been stopped by ICE without reasonable suspicion and based on race.

The district court found that the plaintiffs were ""likely to succeed in showing that the seizures are based upon the four enumerated factors"" or a subset of them. Those factors are (1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location; and (4) the type of work one does. The district court then concluded that ""sole reliance on the four enumerated factors does not constitute reasonable suspicion.""

It is striking that the United States does not deny that ICE was doing this. Indeed, the 9th Circuit, in upholding the district court's temporary restraining order against ICE, powerfully explained: ""Defendants did not dispute the district court's finding that detentive stops requiring reasonable suspicion have occurred. They did not dispute that these detentive stops have been based solely on the four enumerated factors. They did not challenge the district court's findings that those stops are part of a pattern of conduct that has apparent official approval. And, finally, they did not meaningfully dispute the district court's conclusion that sole reliance on the four enumerated factors, alone or in combination, does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of reasonable suspicion.""

In other words, the government does not deny that it is systematically and intentionally violating the Constitution. Instead, its argument is that the federal court lacks the authority to stop the unconstitutional conduct. It is no less than a claim that the government can blatantly violate the Constitution and no court can stop it.

The government makes three arguments in its Supreme Court brief. First, it contends that plaintiffs lack standing under City of Los Angeles v. Lyons because they cannot show that they personally will be stopped again by ICE. In Lyons, the Supreme Court held that a man who had been stopped by Los Angeles police and subjected to a chokehold lacked standing to challenge police use of chokeholds because he could not show it was likely that he would be choked again in the future. But the existence of an admitted ICE policy of stopping people based on race, speaking Spanish, presence at a particular location, and the type of work one does, makes it realistic that the plaintiffs will be stopped again by ICE agents. As the 9th Circuit explained: ""each of the individual plaintiffs has standing to seek injunctive relief because there is a 'realistic[] threat[]' that each will be stopped without reasonable suspicion as part of Defendants' Operation at Large.""

The United States also argues in its brief to the Supreme Court that the district court order requiring compliance with the Constitution will unduly interfere with ICE. But ICE, like all parts of the government, must comply with the Fourth Amendment and equal protection. As the 9th Circuit explained, ""Defendants, of course, 'cannot reasonably assert that [they are] harmed in any legally cognizable sense by being enjoined from constitutional violations.'""

Finally, the government argues in the Supreme Court that a federal district court cannot issue a remedy that applies throughout the district. The government says a court cannot issue a district-wide relief, but rather only provide relief to the named plaintiffs. That makes no sense and would make it impossible to stop illegal government practices within a federal district. The government relies on Trump v. CASA. But that case disapproves of nationwide injunctions. The court did not discuss injunctions within a federal district. How can unconstitutional government actions ever be stopped if a court is limited to giving relief to just the parties in a lawsuit?

Of course, that is exactly what the Trump administration is trying to establish: the government can violate the Constitution and no court can stop it. That just cannot be right.

The district court rightly said that ICE could not use four factors in making a stop: (1) apparent race or ethnicity; (2) speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; (3) presence at a particular location; and (4) the type of work one does. All of these are innocuous and violate no law. ICE should not be able to use them to stop or apprehend people. Period.

The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration in many cases about separation of powers, such as the authority of the president to fire agency officials. I hope the court sees this case differently. It involves fundamental aspects of individual freedom and equality. In light of the undisputed facts in the case, the Supreme Court should not stay the district court's order. ICE must comply with the Constitution.",https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dailyjournal-prod/articles/images/000/387/081/medium/shutterstock_2615419741.jpg?1755029465,N,,2025-08-13 08:56:37.486142

The Virginia-based fourth US circuit court of appeals in a 2-1 decision said the unions were unlikely to prevail on claims that Doge would violate federal privacy laws by accessing data at the US Department of Education, treasury department, and office of personnel management.

The court refused to block Doge’s access to the agencies’ computer systems and data such as social security numbers and individuals’ citizenship status pending the outcome of the case.

The decision reverses a temporary injunction issued by a federal judge in Maryland, which had been paused by the appeals court in April.

The agencies involved in the case and the unions that sued, which include the American Federation of Teachers and the National Federation of Federal Employees, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Donald Trump after taking office in January launched Doge, then headed by the billionaire Elon Musk, to dramatically shrink government bureaucracy and federal spending.

Doge, which is not a formal government agency, has overseen job and spending cuts at nearly every federal agency and has been the focus of numerous lawsuits. Musk stepped down from Doge in May after publicly falling out with Trump.

The fourth circuit on Tuesday said the unions that sued along with a group of military veterans had not shown how they would be injured by Doge accessing agencies’ computer systems. They also probably lacked legal standing to sue because that access is not a “final agency action” that can form the basis of a lawsuit, the court said.

A dissenting judge said it was prudent to temporarily block access to the data while the case plays out, and that the standard his colleagues had imposed on the plaintiffs was too high.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a7e7422099cbac8912b8bda4b94252fe4459ce/456_0_2282_1826/master/2282.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f467e67c761c1986e84e1034f65f2c08",N,,2025-08-13 07:58:20.424040

This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe.

For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.
In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened.","A key annual United States government report on global human rights abuses has drastically shifted focus, with references removed to abuses based on sexual orientation, and poor conditions downplayed in ally nations while taking aim at those who have clashed with President Donald Trump.

Released on Tuesday, the 2024 State Department Human Rights Report, was issued months late as Trump appointees altered an earlier draft dramatically to bring it in line with America First values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, and “Liberty,” and “Security of the Person.”

The department referred to its new report as “streamlined” and focused on remaining “aligned to the administration’s executive orders”.

While the 2023 report contains a lengthy introduction with numerous appendices and citations, the newest report has a single introductory page that stresses a desire to “minimize the amount of statistical data in the report”. An NPR analysis found individual country reports are, on average, one-third the length of the previous year’s.

There is no mention of discrimination against women, members of the LGBTQ community, or on the basis of race in the latest report introduction.

Instead, the report sounds an alarm about the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa, both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues.

Any criticism of governments for their treatment of LGBTQ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appears to have been omitted.

The report’s section on Israel is much shorter than last year’s edition and contains no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. Some 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian group Hamas in October 2023.

While last year’s report underscored numerous acts of anti-Semitism in Hungary, noting that a local survey found half the population were “moderately or strongly anti-Semitic”, the new report says the close Trump ally has “made combating anti-Semitism a top priority, publicly emphasizing its welcoming and open environment for Jews”.

The report claims “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador – where Trump has gained help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house migrant deportees in a high-security mega-prison.

Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that the report “purposefully fail[ed]” to capture rights abuses in a number of countries.

This year’s Human Rights Report from the US Department of State shows a visible effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe.

On Monday, rights group coalition the Council for Global Equality sued (PDF) the State Department to release report documents, alleging the department had potentially manipulated its latest human rights report.

For decades, the State Department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

This year’s report was prepared following a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in April, wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists,” saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”.

Taking aim at Brazil and South Africa

In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation had declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro, among others.

Bolsonaro is on trial before the Supreme Court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 electoral loss to leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Trump has referred to the case as a “witch hunt” and called it grounds for a 50 percent tariff on Brazilian goods.

In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year’s report said the human rights situation significantly worsened. It stated that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

In last year’s report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.

Trump, earlier this year, issued an executive order that called for the US to resettle Afrikaners, describing them as victims of “violence against racially disfavored landowners,” allegations that echoed far-right claims but which have been contested by South Africa’s government.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-18T212340Z_299766331_RC20PFAHKLDB_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-ELSALVADOR-VENEZUELA-1755026732.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-12 23:57:31.666618

The Smithsonian Institution said that a placard was removed for reasons related to consistency and because it “blocked the view of the objects inside its case”.","The White House has ordered an extensive review of the Smithsonian museums and exhibitions in advance of next year’s 250th anniversary of the United States, with the goal of aligning the institution’s content with President Donald Trump’s interpretation of US history.

In a letter sent on Tuesday to Smithsonian Institution Secretary Lonnie Bunch III, the White House laid out in detail the steps it expects the organisation to take so that museum content can be reviewed for a focus on “Americanism”.

The federal government will review public-facing museum content, such as social media, exhibition text and educational materials, to “assess tone, historical framing, and alignment with American ideals”, the letter said.

“This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President’s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,” the letter added.

In a statement responding to the letter, the Smithsonian said it remained committed to “scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history”.

“We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind and will continue to collaborate constructively with the White House, Congress, and our governing Board of Regents,” it said.

The White House said that the review is in line with the Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History Executive Order, which Trump signed in March.

At the time, the Congressional Black Caucus, made up of Black members of the US Congress, described the Trump administration’s efforts to restrict the Smithsonian Institution as “whitewashing our nation’s history”.

“Donald Trump’s idea that the National Museum of African American History and Culture is guilty of distorting our nation’s history or painting our ‘founding principles’ in a ‘negative light’ is patently ridiculous,” the caucus said in a statement.

“Let’s be clear, Black history is American history. Any rhetoric that opposes this notion is not only factually incorrect but blatantly racist,” the caucus said.

“It is the Trump Administration that bans books, words, and phrases that do not fit their narrative. It is the Trump Administration that wants to erase and retell our history,” the caucus added.

The White House said the review would initially focus on the National Museum of American History, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the National Museum of the American Indian, the National Air and Space Museum, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.

The museums under review are all located in Washington, DC, where the president this week ordered the deployment of the US National Guard to tackle a purported crime wave that city officials in the capital have refuted.

The museums all offer free admission and attract millions of visitors each year, with the National Museum of American History alone recording 2 million in-person visits in 2024.

The Smithsonian has repeatedly denied allegations that it has changed or removed exhibit details in response to pressure from the Trump administration. Recently, the institution removed references to Trump’s two impeachments from an exhibit on the US presidency. The Smithsonian Institution said that a placard was removed for reasons related to consistency and because it “blocked the view of the objects inside its case”.

“We were not asked by any Administration or other government officials to remove content from the exhibit,” the Institution said.

The Smithsonian Institution, which runs 21 museums and the National Zoo, said at the time that the impeachment section of the museum would be updated in the coming weeks to “reflect all impeachment proceedings in our nation’s history”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25163573387889-1755043215.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-13 00:56:27.767375

Poor prison conditions in El Salvador were not included. There was an entire paragraph from last year's report.

Instead, the report simplifies the conditions, saying there were ""no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,"" which also appears again in the section for Hungary.

Human rights violations of peaceful assembly in China are also missing.

According to an analysis conducted by , this year's reports are about one-third the length of last year's. The reports on El Salvador and Moldova are more than 75% shorter.

During a State Department briefing on Tuesday, spokesperson Tammy Bruce emphasized the Trump administration's commitment to human rights, although she refused to comment on why exactly these sections were removed.

She pointed out that some of the edits stem from the changeover in presidential administrations.

She said the report does not reflect a change in U.S. policy when it comes to human rights. The State Department also stopped ranking countries.

Bruce added that although reports are important, it is also about action.

The DOJ then showed a clip from President Trump's press conference Monday where he announced he is deploying the National Guard in D.C.","As closing arguments began, the California DOJ gave historical context about the Posse Comitatus Act, which dates back to 1878. It prohibits the use of military to execute U.S. laws, without authorization of Congress or by the Constitution.

California noted the 8th Circuit has called PCA ""the embodiment of a long tradition of suspicion and hostility of military force for domestic purposes.""

CA DOJ: ""Occupation of a civilian city by nearly 5,000 troops for 60 days will have and has had a prescriptive effect on that population. That is exactly the kind of standing army the founding fathers feared. Each of the incidents is a PCA violation.""

CA DOJ goes back to the Trump administration's key defense, that the military deployment was solely for protection of federal property and personnel. Photographs were again shown of troops in a blockade line and interacting with a protestor. ""Defendants cannot wordsmith their way around the law. Calling it 'security' doesn't make it any less illegal.""

The CA DOJ concluded closing arguments asking for a permanent injunction to ""bring a halt to the unlawful military crusade across this state.""

Before US DOJ started closing arguments, Judge Breyer asked Eric Hamilton (US deputy asst AG) this: ""Is there any limitation to use of the military in an operation which is being conducted by federal agents? For example, one, does there have to be a threat? Two, does there have to be some evaluation for threat in terms of consequences of the threat? Three, is there anything, I haven't seen any evidence in this case, as to the adequacy or inadequacy of local law enforcement addressing that threat?""

Hamilton says there isn't anything in Posse Comitatus Act that requires some pre-operation threat assessment. The ""National Guard was federalized in early June because of violent protests in the LA area and we have seen at trial evidence of violence that persisted in July.""

Judge Breyer continued with many questions for Hamilton (US DOJ) in quite impassioned tone. ""Unless military is the first line of defense...it's usually local law enforcement that is the first line of defense. But there is no evidence in these situations...that they were unable or unwilling to enforce the law... Is that a correct analysis?""

Then Hamilton got into his closing arguments, also starting with the Posse Comitatus Act. He highlighted 9th Circuit cases that mention military being used as ""backup security."" Quote from Kahn (9th Circuit. 1994): ""The district court concluded that the Navy provided only logistical support and backup security...therefore did not violate the law.""

Now as to POTUS authority to federalize National Guard (see 10 USC 12406), Hamilton mentions the rebellion clause saying, ""It's a rebellion because (Trump) says it's a rebellion."" Judge Breyer does not seem satisfied with that answer and continued Q &A.

Hamilton referred back to witness statements, including Monday testimony from Army Deputy Chief of Staff William Harrington, who said the Guard had no interactions with civilians in reference to a July 7 MacArthur Park operation which took ""20 minutes."" Harrington testified that they did not engage in law enforcement activities.

Note: These were only closing arguments for the evidentiary portion of the trial. Judge Breyer said he's expecting arguments on ""legal issues"" Wednesday.

Court has resumed for Day 2 of the Newsom v. Trump bench trial in U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer's San Francisco courtroom. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman is back on the witness stand first thing this morning. He commands Task Force 51, the Guard contingent that Trump admin sent to LA in June.

DOJ lawyer is questioning Sherman about a June 23 memo from Sec. Hegseth about the LA mission, reading: ""Service members may not perform direct law enforcement activities such as searches, seizures, evidence collection or arrest."" Sherman testifies troops did not violate that.""

Sherman says he wants the public to know ""we were doing exactly what we were told to do, exactly in line with federal law, and that we were not conducting law enforcement operations,"" adding the Guard was in LA to protect federal personnel and property, nothing else.

A U.S. Army North Fifth Army slideshow was shown in court again, which has guidance about ""prohibited law enforcement functions"" under the Posse Comitatus Act. It was a long list, but these are in red: security patrols, traffic controls, crowd control, riot control.

Sherman says his understanding, according to Trump and Hegseth memos, is those functions are red because the Guard can legally do under certain circumstances. Judge Breyer had a series of follow-up questions, asking why would those be listed as prohibited if soldiers can perform those duties.

Then came California Department of Justice Deputy AG Jane Reilley for the cross-examination. It was about a half-hour or so questioning from both parties largely about specifics of the Department of Defense's request for Guard assistance in LA.

Reilley asked Sherman if the DoD asked the Guard to set up perimeters, would he grant the request? He says without an identified imminent threat, it would have ""never gone past our legal review.""

The DOJ then showed a clip from President Trump's press conference Monday where he announced he is deploying the National Guard in D.C.

It was this quote from President Trump: ""We have other cities also that are bad, very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad. New York has a problem, and then you have, of course, Baltimore and Oakland. We're not going to lose our cities over this...we're going to clean up D.C. real quick.""

The CA DOJ asks Sherman if he has received any word or request for sending more National Guard troops to other California cities (like Oakland, as Trump mentioned Monday). Sherman said no.

With no further questioning, he was dismissed as a witness.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17503297_081125-kgo-ap-national-guard-2-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-13 00:56:31.537854

In Tuesday's order, Kaplan ordered immigration officials to provide 50 square feet per person.

""We’ll continue to fight to ensure that peoples’ rights are upheld at 26 Federal Plaza and beyond,"" the statement continued.","A federal judge on Tuesday ordered federal immigration officials to immediately improve conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility, following complaints by detained migrants of filthy, overcrowded rooms and a lack of basic hygiene products.

U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement(ICE) to reduce capacity, improve cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in holding rooms inside 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Lower Manhattan.

The order comes after a lawsuit filed on behalf of detained migrants claimed they were subjected to unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, extreme temperatures, and a lack of access to soap, toothbrushes, and other essentials, according to The Associated Press.

The migrants said they were fed inedible ""slop"" and were subjected to the stench of sweat, urine and feces, in part due to the rooms having open toilets.

One woman said that during her period, she couldn’t access menstrual products because only two were made available to an entire room of women, court filings revealed.

At a hearing Tuesday, the plaintiffs’ attorney, Heather Gregorio, described the facility as having ""inhumane and horrifying conditions.""

DOJ attorney Jeffrey Oestericher acknowledged that detainees were receiving only two meals per day and were not provided medication or sleeping mats. However, he pushed back on the overcrowding claims, according to reports by The Hill.

""Present conditions are relevant,"" Oestericher told the judge at the hearing. ""To the extent they are talking about overcrowding, it does not appear presently that there is overcrowding.""

""I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,"" he added. ""I think there is some factual disagreement.""

In Tuesday's order, Kaplan ordered immigration officials to provide 50 square feet per person. This means the largest hold room’s capacity will be brought down to about 15 people after detainees said there had been at least 40, according to The Associated Press.

The cells must also be thoroughly cleaned three times a day. Officials are additionally required to provide clean bedding mats and an adequate supply of soap, toothbrushes, toothpaste and other hygiene products.

The judge also ordered officials to ensure detainees have confidential telephone calls with lawyers, including interpreters for those who do not speak English.

""My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,"" the judge said at the hearing on Tuesday. ""I have no enforceable way of assuring that any progress that, in fact, has been made won’t backslide very quickly.""

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”

It added that the government “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to undermine democracy” and specifically mentioned suppressing the speech of Bolsonaro and his supporters.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/news/npr-stories/nx-s1-5500039/ap25223556235849-scaled-e1755042943949-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 23:57:39.619986

The 26 Federal Plaza site has become a flashpoint in New York as the city contends with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration.
The holding cells are on the 10th floor, just two floors below an immigration court.","A United States federal judge has ordered immigration authorities to improve conditions at a New York City facility following reports of overcrowding, inadequate food and unhygienic conditions.

On Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order that mandated Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to implement reforms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan where one floor contains holding cells for migrants and asylum seekers.

The restraining order requires the government to limit capacity at the holding facility, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,” Kaplan said.

Under Kaplan’s order, the government will be forced to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products.

He has also instructed immigration officials to allocate 4.6 square metres (50 square feet) per person, shrinking the capacity of the largest room from 40 or more detainees to just 15.

Finally, to ensure access to legal representation, Kaplan said the government must ensure detainees have accommodations to make confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

Inside the complaint

The changes come in response to a complaint filed by lawyers for a Peruvian asylum-seeker named Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was taken into custody on August 8 after appearing for a scheduled court date.

He was imprisoned at 26 Federal Plaza after his arrest. But his lawyers have argued that Barco Mercado and others in the facility have faced “crowded, squalid, and punitive conditions”. They also said they were denied access to their client after his arrest.

Barco Mercado testified that the holding room was “extremely crowded” and “smelled of sewage” and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Barco Mercado has since been transferred to a facility in upstate New York.

In court filings, other detainees complained that they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products while locked in the 26 Federal building.

They also said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and faeces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

A mobile phone video recorded last month showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four holding rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

ICE responds to allegations of ill treatment

At Tuesday’s hearing, a government lawyer conceded that “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” said Jeffrey S Oestericher, a representative for the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York.

The government also tried to downplay allegations of overcrowding at the facility and inhumane conditions.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, the assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that 24 people were held in the building’s four holding rooms as of Monday.

That number was well below the 154-person limit imposed by the city fire marshal for the floor.

Zanello also said that each room was equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products were available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products.

The 26 Federal Plaza site has become a flashpoint in New York as the city contends with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration.

The holding cells are on the 10th floor, just two floors below an immigration court. The building also houses the New York field office for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other government offices.

While ICE has conducted high-profile raids on factories, farms and other workplaces elsewhere in the country, New York City has seen its immigration arrests largely unfold in court buildings, as migrants and asylum seekers exit their civil immigration hearings.

Critics have denounced such arrests as violations of the right to due process. They warn that, by carrying out arrests in court buildings, officials could discourage foreign nationals from pursuing lawful paths to immigration.

But in January, the Trump administration rescinded guidelines that limited immigration arrests in “sensitive locations”, court buildings generally considered to be among them.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250808__2229095057__v2__MidRes__IceDetainsImmigrantsInsideNewYorkCityCourthou-1755036091.jpg?resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-12 22:56:37.256848

Judge Lewis Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.

Cellphone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes or other hygiene products. They said they were fed inedible “slop” and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period could not use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

Kaplan ordered immigration officials to allocate 50 sq feet per person – shrinking the largest hold room’s capacity to about 15 people after detainees said 40 or more were being jammed in. The building, home to immigration court and the FBI’s New York field office, has become an epicenter of Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day and provide an adequate supply of hygiene products. Addressing concerns that detainees were not able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential legal telephone calls.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,” Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” government lawyer Jeffrey S Oestericher said, adding that he agreed “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated”.

The lawsuit – filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union – sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called “inhumane and horrifying conditions”.

Some detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza far longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.

Murad Awawdeh, the president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, welcomed Kaplan’s ruling as a “step forward” but said the facility “must be shut down permanently”.

New York City comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June after he tried to lock arms with a person authorities were attempting to detain, said the decision “is a much-needed rebuke of Trump’s cruel immigration policies”.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, of Ice’s New York City field office of enforcement and removal operations, wrote that as of Monday, a total of 24 people were held in the building’s four hold rooms – well shy of the city fire marshal’s 154-person cap.

Each room has at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap, teeth cleaning wipes and feminine products, Zanello said.

Sergio Barco Mercado, the lawsuit’s named plaintiff, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing.

Barco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the US in 2022, said his holding room was “extremely crowded”, cold and “smelled of sewage”, and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said. “There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Another detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the US when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration hearing. He said officers told him he’d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.

Lopez Benitez said an officer showed him a cellphone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers blasted air conditioning and doled out meals that “looked like dog food”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/768b50d6a459ff9e1ebc05b79455ec078fa390c0/333_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2fc6b26e867700091fab04b044d132a",N,,2025-08-12 22:56:49.344669

The video posted on Facebook shows Enforcement and Removal Operations officers — or arresting officers working under ICE — forcibly taking two people into custody.

The driver in the video drives onto the property, then stops next to three vehicles, including two large grey Ford SUVs. The officers are seen urging the driver to go away.

The driver gets out of the vehicle and says, “Why are you stopping my guys?” as one officer escorts a man with his hands behind his back.

As the confrontation continues, one ICE officer tells the driver that he is “impeding a federal investigation” and that the officers will arrest him, too.

“They’re my workers, they’re my workers,” says the driver in the video. “They didn’t do anything for you guys to stop them. They didn’t do anything.”

The situation escalates as two officers pull the passenger out of the stopped vehicle and pin him to the ground on his stomach.

The video later shows the two SUVs driving out of the property, with the two people in custody inside.

Property Manager at Alpine Mountain Ranch and Club Audrey Williams noted that she had seen the video and confirmed that it was on the ranch’s property, but she was not at work when the arrests occurred.

Williams added that the ranch gates open around 6:45 a.m. each morning and remain open during business hours for the public to access various construction sites across the property.

According to Jerry Hernandez, the executive director of the local organization Integrated Community, ICE activity has also been seen at a construction site in town and at a bus stop on 7th Street, where three people were said to have been arrested.

While Hernandez did not have an exact number of people who were taken into custody, he confirmed that two people in custody were currently en route to Denver.

“One of the things that we had confirmed was that ICE could not and did not engage in traffic stops,” said Hernandez. “So we were telling our clients, ‘Don’t worry, they can’t pull you over.’ But apparently, that’s not the case because of this branch (Enforcement and Removal Operations).”

Hernandez said one of the men arrested in the video was issued an “order of removal,” which was most likely the reason for the traffic stop. However, Hernandez noted that the man had been “compliant” with his court dates.

Police Chief Mark Beckett said law enforcement has not recently communicated with ICE about an increased presence or recent arrests, but noted that this isn’t unique to Steamboat Springs.

“We’re hearing from different sheriffs and chiefs across the state … ICE and (Enforcement and Removal Operations) are operating without any notification,” said Beckett. “We haven’t been approached. Our policy is still what it was (earlier this year), which is we’re not going to participate in enforcement action. That’s probably why they aren’t notifying any local agencies anymore.”

“What they told us originally was they were going to focus on those who were actually wanted criminally, like gang members,” continued Beckett. “But, you know, all I have to go on is the same thing you’re seeing.”

Beckett added that he couldn’t be sure if ICE is arresting migrants without criminal histories, but noted that the Steamboat Springs Police Department “continues to support all of our populations, including the undocumented community.”

Routt County Sheriff Doug Scherar also said he was unaware of an increased ICE presence in the county, and noted that the sheriff’s office does not participate in any immigration enforcement.

“Unfortunately … (ICE) has put themselves in a silo right now, so we don’t hear anything at all,” Beckett said. “And frankly, I don’t think we’re going to. I think that’s going to be how they will continue to move forward. They’re just going to do whatever they’re going to do.”

Scherar encourages anyone concerned about an increased ICE presence in the community should reach out to Integrated Community for assistance.

“I know the community is very, very afraid and concerned,” said Hernandez. “We have families that are not sending their kids to school or that are not going to work because of this.”

For those impacted, Hernandez stressed utilizing “Know Your Rights” websites and other resources provided by Integrated Community.

“These types of events can cause high levels of anxiety and mental health stress on children,” Hernandez added. “It’s important for us to continue to be supportive of each other.”

“We make (the links) available to our clients so that they can be informed when someone comes knocking on their door. Regardless of status, you have rights,” Hernandez explained.

Hernandez also emphasized taking steps to plan ahead, like putting a legal fund in place, establishing a caregiver for children or placing “Know Your Rights” cards in vehicles and houses.

“If (migrants and immigrants) are in a mixed-status household, who can pick your kids up from school? That all needs to be spelled out ahead of time,” said Hernandez.

The results were alarming.

“When we began in 2000, we recorded 150 to 160 cases of human rights and constitutional rights violations,” said Garcia, executive director of Border Network for Human Rights. “What we did with those findings is to educate the community about their rights during encounters with law enforcement and also approach the agencies we believed were engaged in a pattern of constitutional violations.”

The complaints included racial profiling, physical and psychological abuse, warrantless searches, arbitrary arrests and instant deportations without due process. Some things have improved during that 25-year period – there were years when no complaints were reported against the U.S. Border Patrol, for instance, and the agency reined in its vehicle pursuit policy to cut down on accidents.

“We educate the people and sometimes we educate the agencies themselves on how the community sees them and how they should always be cognizant of their rights,” Garcia said.

But new worries have surfaced with a new U.S. president bent on the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and the arrival of thousands of soldiers to West Texas and Southern New Mexico. In addition, a federal immigration agency is rushing to hire new agents to look for and deport migrants.

Those are some of the reasons behind BNHR’s latest abuse documentation campaign set to begin this month. The group is setting up 30 tables near international ports of entry, in churches and businesses in neighborhoods with a high Hispanic or immigrant population from El Paso to Del Rio, Texas, and from Anthony, New Mexico, to Albuquerque.

“We will not prejudge. We have an objective documentation process. We ask if their rights are violated, they tell us then we go about verifying the allegations. Are there any witnesses? We learned that from journalists – that it is necessary to have who did what to whom, where and when. If we cannot verify, we won’t take the case,” Garcia said.

The volunteers range from moms of school-aged children to retirees. They will wear T-shirts with the documentation campaign logo and large badges with their names.

Some of them told Border Report they already have witnessed abusive behavior from law enforcement in their communities.

“They went into a place looking for one person and they took many. They detained a mother (in front of) a school and brought down her children from the bus. All the kids were upset,” said Maria Salazar.

She told the story of a neighbor who is a lawful permanent resident and whose vehicle was targeted by immigration agents looking for an unrelated individual. “They punctured her tires, and now they don’t want to pay for the damage,” Salazar said.

Lourdes Vasquez is a New Mexico activist who will be visiting churches, stores and other gathering places in Las Cruces, Anthony, Chaparral and Sunland Park.

“We see lots of worries in the community. They hear about ICE going into homes. They have been stopped walking in their neighborhoods,” Vasquez said, adding it is important for these residents to not be afraid of documenting these run-ins for the sake of accountability.

Garcia said he will present a report in October with the findings of the latest two-month documentation campaign. He said he will show the report to leaders of federal and local law enforcement agencies so they have a chance to respond.

Last year, Border Report reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection after Garcia released his 2024 abuse documentation report. CBP urged the complainants then to file formal complaints through official channels as soon as possible.

Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.
Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars.
The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.
“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.","A man who was held in a federal detention facility after Whitefish, Montana, police pulled him over for an allegedly faulty taillight in April has filed a lawsuit alleging racial profiling and a violation of his constitutional rights against the city of Whitefish, Whitefish Police Chief Bridger Kelch, and Officer Michael Hingiss, who conducted the traffic stop.

Beker Rengifo Del Castillo, 33, is a Venezuelan citizen who was leaving a job near Whitefish Lake on April 24 when Hingiss stopped him, according to the lawsuit, allegedly for a broken brake light. Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection, and Del Castillo was left in the custody of a Customs and Border Protection officer and subsequently taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, “a horrific and traumatic experience,” according to court documents.

Whitefish City Attorney Angela Jacobs told the Daily Montanan in an email that the city cannot comment on active litigation.

The lawsuit was filed in federal district court in Missoula. Del Castillo is represented by Upper Seven Law.

In the lawsuit, Del Castillo’s attorneys allege that Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection because Beker “only speaks Spanish” and Border Patrol may “want to check him,” despite Del Castillo providing “proof of his lawful presence in the United States in the form of his valid REAL ID compliant driver’s license.”

According to the complaint, Del Castillo entered the United States in July 2024 through the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela Parole Program. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services approved Del Castillo’s application for work authorization on July 23, 2024, and issued him a Social Security number.

Del Castillo was leaving a work site with a coworker, in separate vehicles, this spring when Hingiss followed behind the two cars. According to the complaint, Hingiss called Customs and Border Protection “due to a language barrier,” but then left Del Castillo with a federal officer to “continue” the immigration investigation. The complaint states that the Border Patrol agent noted that Del Castillo may have legal status.

“Del Castillo’s story shows why untrained municipal police should not masquerade as federal immigration cops,” the lawsuit states.

Following his transfer to an ICE detention facility, Del Castillo was held until April 30, and then released with “no place to stay and no way to get home.”

“Because of this incident, (Del Castillo) is reluctant to leave his home and attempts to avoid all contact with law enforcement, fearing he will again be detained and incarcerated based on discrimination and without cause,” the complaint states. “(He) quit his jobs to avoid the risk of being racially profiled and incarcerated without basis while driving to and from work.”

According to the complaint, the Whitefish Police Department has a policy about immigration violations that Hingiss broke while detaining Del Castillo and calling Border Patrol. The policies include prohibiting officers from detaining “any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil warrant;” and no one who is “otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status are unresolved.”

The policies, according to the lawsuit, also state that an officer must notify a supervisor when detaining someone for an immigration violation, and seek approval before conducting an arrest for an alleged immigration offense and before transferring an individual to federal immigration authorities.

During a Whitefish City Council meeting in May, Police Chief Kelch told councilors the city had policies that “that strictly prohibit biased-based policing and improper profiling,” according to reporting by the Flathead Beacon. Kelch also stated that “we did not call Border Patrol for interpretation services.”

The lawsuit seeks actual, general and punitive damages and legal costs from the city of Whitefish and the police officers.",https://cdn3.creativecirclemedia.com/lafromboise/original/20250812-161707-539-1vets.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:57:13.513576

WASHINGTON – In the Houston, TX area alone U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 356 criminal illegal alien gang members during the first six months of the Trump administration. In the first six months of the Biden administration, just 75 gang members were arrested in the Houston, TX area. To put these figures into perspective, it’s a 375% increase in arrests of gang members under the Trump administration in this area. In 2021, the ICE Houston field office arrested 115 gang members during the entire year.

These 356 gang members were collectively convicted of 1,685 criminal offenses including murder, child sex crimes, sex trafficking, arson, and theft.

In total, ICE arrested members of more than 40 different gangs including 39 MS-13 gang members, 25 Tren de Aragua gang members, six Latin Kings gang members, 159 Paisas gang members, and 26 Tango Blast gang members.

“Thanks to President Trump and Secretary Noem, these illegal alien gang members are off America’s streets. Across the country, ICE law enforcement is targeting these vicious gangs that rape, maim, and murder Americans for sport,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to dismantle transnational criminal terrorist gangs. In Houston area alone, we have already arrested more than three times as many gang members as the Biden administration arrested in Houston in all of 2021. The days of unchecked gang violence are OVER.”

“The Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,” Abbott wrote.

Texas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats.","Texas Republican leaders said Tuesday that they were prepared to end their stalemated special session and immediately begin another standoff with Democrats in the GOP’s efforts to redraw congressional maps as directed by President Trump.

It’s the latest indication that Trump’s push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections will become an extended standoff that promises to reach multiple statehouses controlled by both major parties.

Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows confirmed the plans during a brief session Tuesday morning that marked another failure to meet the required attendance standards to conduct official business because dozens of Democrats have left the state to stymie the GOP’s partisan gerrymandering attempts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Burrows said from the House floor that lawmakers will not attempt to reconvene again until Friday. If Democrats are still absent — and they have given no indication that they plan to return — the speaker said Republicans will end the current session and Gov. Greg Abbott will immediately call another.

The governor, a Trump ally, confirmed his intentions in a statement.

“The Special Session #2 agenda will have the exact same agenda, with the potential to add more items critical to Texans,” Abbott wrote. “There will be no reprieve for the derelict Democrats who fled the state and abandoned their duty to the people who elected them. I will continue to call special session after special session until we get this Texas first agenda passed.”

Abbott called the current session with an extensive agenda that included disaster relief for floods that killed more than 130 people. Democrats balked when Abbott added Trump’s redistricting idea to the agenda. Burrows on Tuesday did not mention redistricting but chided Democrats for not showing up for debate on the flood response package.

The redistricting legislation would reshape the state’s congressional districts in a design aimed at sending five more Republicans to Washington.

The scheme is part of Trump’s push to shore up Republicans’ narrow House majority and avoid a repeat of his first presidency, when the 2018 midterms restored Democrats to a House majority that blocked his agenda and twice impeached him. Current maps nationally put Democrats within three seats of retaking the House majority — with only several dozen competitive districts across 435 total seats.

Texas Republicans have issued civil warrants for the absent Democrats. Because they are out of state, those lawmakers are beyond the reach of Texas authorities.

Burrows said Tuesday that absent Democrats would have to pay for all state government costs for law enforcement officials attempting to track them down. Burrows has said state troopers and others have run up “six figures in overtime costs” trying to corral Democratic legislators.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bf2ddc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+267/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2Fed%2F1b0e203a942f3d3aa404f8533e53%2Fa7a8eb55acb240fb9e3778e27161ab8c,N,,2025-08-12 21:56:32.434549

In the past it meant people living in the U.S. could receive benefits under this classification, regardless of immigration status. This is no longer the case.

But the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Director Russell Vought might ""employ a pocket rescission sometime before the Sept. 30 government funding deadline,"" said The Hill.
The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and therefore any rescission request that pauses funding after August 16 (45 days before the end of the fiscal year) would qualify as a ""pocket rescission.""
A pocket rescission is ""neither a rescission nor is it legal,"" said the Center for American Progress.
Can anyone stop a pocket rescission?","The Constitution unambiguously grants Congress the power to determine how tax dollars are spent, an uncomfortable reality for the Trump administration's efforts to unilaterally slash spending. Many of the cuts recommended by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in the spring therefore needed the retroactive blessing of Congress, a process known as ""rescission."" And media reports suggest that the Trump administration is soon set to escalate its war on Congress' spending power by using something dubbed a ""pocket rescission"" to block funding without giving Congress enough time to consider the request.

What is the Trump administration trying to do?

Congress frequently rescinds money it has previously allocated for all kinds of reasons. But the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Director Russell Vought might ""employ a pocket rescission sometime before the Sept. 30 government funding deadline,"" said The Hill. Vought's plan involves using not the ordinary rescission process driven by Congress but rather section 1012 of the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. This allows the president to pause, or impound, allocated funding for 45 days. If Congress doesn't act to officially rescind the funds, the executive branch is obligated to resume the spending.

This actually happened quite recently. In July, the Republican-controlled Congress complied with the Trump administration's request to rescind $9 billion in spending, including funding for public broadcasting. While critics lambasted Congress for capitulating to the White House, the maneuver was legal. The Trump administration, however, is reportedly planning to use this provision in a way that the U.S. government has recently deemed unlawful. This so-called ""pocket rescission"" is ""when a president asks Congress to rescind (or cancel) funds very close to the end of the fiscal year,"" said the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Because ""not enough time is given to consider this request,"" the president is ""bypassing congressional authority over government funding"" and taking a knee to let the clock run down on spending he dislikes.

The current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, and therefore any rescission request that pauses funding after August 16 (45 days before the end of the fiscal year) would qualify as a ""pocket rescission."" The GAO is an independent, non-partisan agency located in the legislative branch that was created to ""make sure that the appropriation laws enacted by the Congress are properly implemented,"" said the American Enterprise Institute.

A pocket rescission is ""neither a rescission nor is it legal,"" said the Center for American Progress. After all, a ""loophole that allowed the president to impound funds over the will of Congress"" would ultimately ""undermine the entire intent of the law."" But the ""OMB asserts that there is nothing controversial about pocket rescissions,"" said Lawfare. The record shows ""they have been used this way before,"" and past presidents, including Jimmy Carter, employed them without being accused of precipitating constitutional crises.

Can anyone stop a pocket rescission?

During the second Trump administration, the boundaries of legality are being redrawn by the president in conjunction with a Supreme Court determined to legitimize virtually every action by the White House. This dynamic was perhaps clearest when the Supreme Court blessed the Trump administration's decision to fire Democratic members of the bipartisan National Labor Relations Board, in clear violation of congressional statute and existing Supreme Court precedent on the matter. While the Supreme Court's May decision in that case was ""technically a temporary one,"" it nevertheless ""clearly forecasts the eventual outcome of the case when it is argued before the court,"" likely sometime in 2026, said NPR.

So while pocket rescissions are of dubious legality according to widespread understandings of the U.S. Constitution as it existed prior to Trump's second inauguration, the Supreme Court seems quite unlikely to halt them. Instead, in keeping with the doctrine of the ""unitary executive theory,"" the court will almost certainly grant the Trump administration wide latitude to interpret existing law as it sees fit.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HgQyeQACUm2GyfwU7ohNdL.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:38.163935

The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, ordered the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold fewer people in the 10th-floor holding cells of its Lower Manhattan offices at 26 Federal Plaza. ICE has been accused of detaining dozens of migrants for days or weeks there in tight quarters meant to hold detainees for just a few hours.

The judge also ordered ICE to allow migrants to place calls to their lawyers and to ensure access to proper medical and hygienic care following allegations that detainees were deprived of showers, given meager meals and forced to sleep on the concrete floor without any bedding.

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday by legal organizations representing a Peruvian immigrant, Sergio Alberto Barco Mercado, who was arrested by ICE and held at 26 Federal Plaza last week.

Judge Kaplan issued a temporary restraining order while he fully reviews the case and considers whether to issue a longer-lasting order. ICE has repeatedly denied that the cells at 26 Federal Plaza are overcrowded or that conditions are inadequate.

The ruling is a short-term victory for immigration activists who have spent months denouncing the conditions in the holding cells. They have filled up as ICE has increased arrests in New York’s immigration courts, straining the agency’s detention capacity. Many of the more than 3,200 people ICE has arrested in the New York City area since Jan. 20, when President Trump’s second term began, have been detained at 26 Federal Plaza at some point, according to new federal data released this week.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.
Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.” Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.
“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration’s changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

“With the release of the U.S. State Department’s human rights report, it is clear that the Trump Administration has engaged in a very selective documentation of human rights abuses in certain countries,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

“In addition to eliminating entire sections for certain countries – for example discrimination against LGBTQ+ people – there are also arbitrary omissions within existing sections of the report based on the country,” it said.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro’s speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”

It added that the government “undermined democratic debate by restricting access to online content deemed to undermine democracy” and specifically mentioned suppressing the speech of Bolsonaro and his supporters.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/689bbd28c97df4.24897754.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:44.415442

While the White House deploys the National Guard in Washington, D.C., a judge in California is looking at how President Trump has used the guard troops in Los Angeles. Trump sent them in to confront protests, some violent, against immigration enforcement operations in the city. But legal questions remain. Here's Laura Fitzgerald with CapRadio in Sacramento.

LAURA FITZGERALD, BYLINE: Trump deployed around 4,000 National Guard troops to LA in early June. At the time, he said the protests against the immigration crackdown were out of control.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We had some bad people. We have people, they look in your face and they spit right in your face. They're animals. And these are paid insurrectionists. These are paid troublemakers.

FITZGERALD: In June, a federal judge ruled the deployment was illegal and ordered that control be returned to California. But an appeals court disagreed and allowed Trump to maintain control. The state alleges Trump illegally used the military for domestic law enforcement. David Carrillo, a constitutional law expert at University of California, Berkeley, who filed briefs supporting the state in the case, says it could set a precedent for when the guard is deployed elsewhere.

DAVID CARRILLO: I think it is fair to say this is the most significant modern example of a court taking a hard look at the factual justifications for the exercise of federal power in this area.

FITZGERALD: Witnesses Monday recounted what the troops were doing, setting the stage for lawyers to argue whether those were law enforcement duties or not. A couple hundred National Guard troops remain. The trial is scheduled to go through Wednesday.

“Everybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles?
And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.” Raids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds.
Labor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.
Lizzet, a McDonald’s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.","Several hundred workers, organizers and immigrant advocates gathered in palm-tree-dotted MacArthur Park on Tuesday to denounce the Trump administration and immigration raids it has carried out in the city and in other parts of California.

Rows of parked cars clogged a stretch of Park View Street in the morning, blocking traffic. Scrawled on windshields and bumpers in chalky white and printed on taped signs were slogans “ICE out of LA” and “Stop the Trump terror.”

From atop a truck, Service Employees International Union California President David Huerta addressed the crowd.

“Our fight is for working people. ... It’s a fight against authoritarianism. It’s a fight to restore democracy in this country,” said Huerta, who was injured and detained by law enforcement in early June while documenting the first major immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles this summer. “Everybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles? And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.”

Raids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds. The ongoing threat to the many immigrant workers that local labor groups count among their members, as well as criminal charges of conspiracy to impede an officer brought against Huerta, have ignited protests in recent months.

Labor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.

On Tuesday, speakers urged people not to purchase from major companies including Home Depot, Walmart, Target and fast-food restaurants that they contend are not doing enough to protect their employees.

A spokesperson for Home Depot previously told The Times the company had not been notified of any of the raids at its locations ahead of time and that the company was not involved in any of the operations.

“We are going to take back MacArthur Park,” said Felipe Caceres, an organizer with SEIU 721. “For 24 hours we are reclaiming our power to stop the Trump terror. For 24 hours we are going to boycott companies.”

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The park, which is nestled in the heart of a dense immigrant community, has become a symbol ever since July 7, when federal agents descended on it with horses and armored vehicles, carrying rifles and in tactical gear.

“It’s important to reclaim this space, where ICE staged a show of force. So that’s what we’re here to do,” said Marissa Nuncio, executive director of the Garment Worker Center.

Local unions and labor groups have rallied to support their members in recent months.

The Garment Worker Center has worked to deliver food to garment manufacturers sheltering at home and held “Know Your Rights” trainings. As car wash workers across the region have been snapped up in raids, the CLEAN Carwash Worker Center has scrambled to track deportations and connect families with legal services.

The union representing Southern California hotel workers, Unite Here Local 11, has pressed hotel owners to push back on the Trump administration’s rhetoric and provide additional protections for the many in its workforce who are asylum seekers, immigrants with Temporary Protected Status and recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.

Cooks and cashiers with the California Fast Food Workers Union this week penned a letter to fast-food businesses urging them to commit to protecting workers by barring federal agents from entering spaces that they do not have proper warrants to enter.

“Fast-food worker bosses, whose side are you guys on? Are you going to sit here and just let [the federal government] run all over us? We’re asking you today to stand up with us and protect us,” said Anneisha Williams, a member of the state’s Fast Food Council, at the Tuesday rally.

Lizzet, a McDonald’s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.

Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, ruling in a lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees, issued a temporary restraining order requiring U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to limit capacity, ensure cleanliness and provide sleeping mats in so-called hold rooms at 26 Federal Plaza, a government building in Manhattan.

A cell phone video recorded last month by a detainee showed about two dozen men crowded in one of the building’s four hold rooms, many lying on the floor with thermal blankets but no mattresses or padding.

In court filings, detainees complained they had no soap, toothbrushes and other hygiene products. They also said they were fed inedible “slop"" and endured the “horrific stench” of sweat, urine and feces, in part because the rooms have open toilets. One woman having her period couldn't use menstrual products because women in her room were given just two to divvy up, the lawsuit said.

Kaplan instructed federal immigration officials to allocate 50 square feet (4.6 square meters) per person — shrinking the capacity of the largest hold room to about 15 people, down from the 40 or more individuals that detainees said were being jammed into the rooms. The building, home to immigration court, the FBI‘s New York field office and other federal offices, has become a hotbed of arrests and detention amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

The judge ordered the government to thoroughly clean the cells three times a day, provide adequate supplies of soap, towels, toilet paper, toothbrushes, toothpaste and feminine products. Addressing concerns that detainees weren't able to communicate with lawyers, Kaplan ordered the government to make accommodations for confidential, unmonitored and unrecorded legal telephone calls.

“My conclusion here is that there is a very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury, given the conditions that I’ve been told about,"" Kaplan said at a hearing Tuesday where a government lawyer conceded that some of the complaints were valid.

“I think we all agree that conditions at 26 Federal Plaza need to be humane, and we obviously share that belief,” government lawyer Jeffrey S. Oestericher said, adding that he agreed “inhumane conditions are not appropriate and should not be tolerated.”

The lawsuit — filed by the immigrant rights organization Make the Road New York, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the American Civil Liberties Union — sought court intervention to end what plaintiff lawyer Heather Gregorio called “inhumane and horrifying conditions.""

Some detainees have been held at 26 Federal Plaza for days or even weeks before being sent to other facilities — longer than the 72-hour norm, Gregorio said.

In a sworn declaration, Nancy Zanello, an assistant director of ICE’s New York City Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote that as of Monday a total of 24 people were held in the building’s four hold rooms — well shy of the city fire marshal’s 154-person cap.

Each room is equipped with at least one toilet and sink, and hygiene products are available, including soap and teeth cleaning wipes, and feminine products, Zanello said.

Sergio Barco Mercado, the named plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a court filing that he was held at 26 Federal Plaza for two days last week after his arrest there while leaving an immigration court hearing. He was subsequently transferred to an upstate New York detention facility.

Barco Mercado, a native of Peru who said he sought asylum in the U.S. in 2022, said his hold room was “extremely crowded,"" cold and “smelled of sewage,"" and that the conditions exacerbated a tooth infection that swelled his face and altered his speech.

“We did not always get enough water,” Barco Mercado said in a sworn declaration. ""There was one guard who would sometimes hold a bottle of water up and people would wait to have him squirt some into our mouths, like we were animals.”

Another detainee, Carlos Lopez Benitez, said he fled violence in Paraguay in 2023 and was seeking asylum in the U.S. when he was arrested in July while leaving an immigration court hearing. Officers pressed him to self-deport, he said, and told him he’d be in detention until a 2029 hearing on his asylum application.

Lopez Benitez said an arresting officer showed him a cell phone photo of his arrest and mocked him for crying. In his holding cell, he said, officers kept the air conditioning blasting and doled out meals that “looked like dog food.""

Silver said it can be hard to say when one rally, one boycott, or one action will tip the balance.","Immigrant-rights advocates undertook a daylong “community stoppage” Tuesday with a 24-hour boycott of various businesses, plus rallies opposing federal immigration enforcement operations.

The action, which began at midnight Tuesday, was organized by several groups, including the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights Los Angeles, Service Employees International Union Local 721, Central American Resource Center of Los Angeles and the Garment Worker Center.

Participants were urged to join events scheduled throughout the day and to support individuals and families affected by immigration raids.

The coalition also called for a boycott of The Home Depot, Target, Walmart and fast food restaurants.

“These corporations whether implicitly or not have allowed their facilities to be used as places where federal agents violated workers’ rights and have inflicted pain and terror in our community and families,” Jorge-Mario Cabrera, a spokesman for CHIRLA, said in an email to City News Service.

“These corporations benefit on a daily basis from our hard-earned dollars and yet remain silent in light of the attacks against Angelenos and workers,” he added.

Organizers said the boycott was aimed at showing the economic influence of immigrant communities and to demand an end to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids and the expansion of private detention centers.

“This is an action that will involve supporters or our community who dislike the way the federal government is overreaching and violating workers’ due process and rights,” Cabrera said. “This community stoppage is the precursor of more actions to come later in the year calling on the federal government to stop these racist raids.”

The day of action began with a midnight fast-food workers strike at a restaurant near MacArthur Park, followed by a second walkout at 5 a.m. A “Take Back Our Park” coffee and breakfast was held early Tuesday morning at Park View and Wilshire Boulevard, followed by a 10 a.m rally at MacArthur Park involving hundreds of people.

Participants were expected Tuesday afternoon to march from MacArthur Park to the county Hall of Administration. A 5 p.m. rally was also planned at Placita Olvera (Olvera Street), followed by a march to the downtown federal detention center, where a vigil will be held.

A spokesman for The Home Depot issued a statement saying, “Immigration enforcement agencies are the best sources if you have questions. We aren’t notified that these activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.”

Target and Walmart did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Plans for the community stoppage were announced last week at a news conference at MacArthur Park. The announcement came a day after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security conducted a raid at a Home Depot on Wilshire Boulevard, where agents hid in a Penske truck and descended on day laborers at the site. ICE arrested approximately 16 individuals as a result of the raid.

Aggressive ICE raids began June 6, resulting in the arrest of 2,792 immigrants in Los Angeles County and six surrounding counties who are suspected of living in the United States without legal permission.

Homeland Security previously announced that fewer than 1,400 immigrants were arrested in the region last month.

Some immigration experts suggested the decrease was due to a federal court order limiting the scope of immigration-enforcement operations in the area.

A federal judge last month issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from stopping individuals in violation of the Fourth Amendment and requiring the government to provide detained individuals with access to counsel.

The federal government appealed the ruling, but last week, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to put a stay on the ruling. The federal government has appealed the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The restraining order, however, did not prevent last Wednesday’s operation involving the Penske truck. On X, U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles Bill Essayli acknowledged the operation, writing, “For those who thought immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again. The enforcement of federal law is not negotiable, and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.”

Essayli defended the raid as being within the scope of reasonable suspicion.

CHIRLA was among groups who sued the federal government for their “roving patrols” and enforcement tactics.

“We’re so proud of the work we did to document all of the abuses that led our courts to say you do need a temporary restraining from the federal agents as they are conducting immigration enforcement throughout the Los Angeles region,” Angelica Salas, executive director for CHIRLA, previously said.

“We believe in the courts, and we believe in the Constitution, and we’re going to continue to fight in the courts because we have rights, and we’re going to affirm those rights in every way possible,” she added.

Additionally, participants in Tuesday’s community stoppage were encouraged to purchase from local street vendors and, if possible, buy them out.

“There’s so many street vendors who feel terrorized, so if you can go to your local street vendor to buy their flowers, buy their food and buy the things that they’re selling because they deserve to have an opportunity in this moment that they are suffering,” Salas said.

Ike Silver, an assistant professor of marketing at the USC Marshall School of Business, told City News Service that he was pessimistic about seeing a clear impact as a result of a single boycott on the policy of any presidential administration.

“That said, to the extend that these kinds of events can add up through time, the cumulative impact can be to draw attention, raise awareness, change public opinion in the hopes that if enough of these happen over time, there will be sort of a shift in what’s demanded of leadership of business and of government,” Silver told CNS.

According to Silver, success of the boycott can be measured differently depending on the goals of the organizers.

“So my sense is that a 24-hour boycott is not likely to change Home Depot’s bottom line all that much in and of itself, but if it activates Angelenos who might otherwise not be paying attention or not be aware of Home Depot’s, or other businesses connection to this issue, then that can be sort of a different success metric, such that those people might demand action,” Silver said.

Silver said it can be hard to say when one rally, one boycott, or one action will tip the balance.

“In the context of something like the Civil Rights Movement, it’s hard to say which boycott, which sit-in, which march was the one that changed things, but we can see that in aggregate over the course of history these kinds of actions do take effect — and so there’s an element of keeping faith,” Silver told CNS.",https://mynewsla.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/shutterstock_1268966-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:58.669489

UC Riverside’s findings come amid reports of immigration enforcement activity on or near school grounds in the wake of policy changes allowing these actions under President Donald Trump.
In January, the Trump administration changed longstanding DHS policy to allow enforcement action on school grounds and other “protected areas,” which were previously considered safe from ICE raids.
That incident, which happened off of school grounds, was at least the third known time Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time.
Multiple lawsuits have been filed to challenge that policy change, including one as recently as July.","Dive Brief:

The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies — which include allowing enforcement on school grounds, prolonged and increased immigration detention, and ambiguity around who may be targeted — are having “ripple effects” on immigrant children and children who are U.S. citizens living in mixed-status families, according to a new report from psychiatric researchers.

Chronic anxiety over detention or deportation is linked to absenteeism, classroom disengagement and heightened emotional distress, leading students “to avoid school or withdraw from public life.”

The July report calls schools “critical sites for early identification and support” but added they can also be places where immigrant youth “experience trauma-related avoidance, disengagement, or behavioral challenges.”

Dive Insight:

Students impacted by the current administration’s immigration policies face academic decline and social isolation, in addition to missing out on developmental supports that include access to trusted adults and school-based mental health services, per the report.

The researchers from University of California, Riverside and New York University suggest students may benefit from schools adopting trauma-informed practices, curbing punitive discipline, and ensuring students receive mental health support with special considerations for immigration-related issues.

UC Riverside’s findings come amid reports of immigration enforcement activity on or near school grounds in the wake of policy changes allowing these actions under President Donald Trump.

In January, the Trump administration changed longstanding DHS policy to allow enforcement action on school grounds and other “protected areas,” which were previously considered safe from ICE raids. However, DHS has since clarified that it expects enforcement activity in schools to be “extremely rare.”

In April, officers from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement attempted to enter two elementary schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, saying that they were conducting ”wellness checks.″ The officers reportedly made false claims that they had parents’ permission to speak with the students.

This month, ICE apprehended a parent during morning student drop-off hours in California’s Chula Vista Elementary School District while two children were reportedly in the car at the time of the arrest. That incident, which happened off of school grounds, was at least the third known time Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have arrested family members during school pick-up or drop-off time.

“In this context, emotional distress becomes both an understandable and adaptive response to a life shaped by surveillance and exclusion,” the UC Riverside report said. “These dynamics underscore that immigration policy does not operate solely as a legal system—it functions as a structural determinant of health.”

The report confirms school leaders’ concerns that recent immigration policies are negatively impacting families and students, creating environments of fear and, in some cases, leading to absenteeism.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed to challenge that policy change, including one as recently as July.

Denver Public Schools became the first school district to challenge the policy, saying in a February lawsuit that the Trump administration had created fear in students and families and led to a noticeable drop in school attendance across the district — particularly in schools with immigrant families.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3jfwuIvOgm52XyEnORvxzsp1O_GN6cj59Krr3SUUCWA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI3NDE2ODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-12 19:56:50.650961

“(D.C.’s) out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border,” Trump said at a Monday press conference where he was flanked by members of his Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He vowed to do the same in more cities governed by Democrats.

Trump’s return to the White House was led by a campaign promise of mass deportations, tying newly arrived immigrants at the southern border with high crime rates and the need to use troops to detain and remove those migrants.

Since Inauguration Day, the president has sent thousands of National Guard members to be stationed at the U.S.-Mexico border and has militarized strips of land along the border, putting migrants into contact with military personnel.

Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard in June in response to unrest over immigration raids was seen as a test case for use of the state-based military forces. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California wrote on X on Monday that Trump “was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles” with that order.

“He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America,” Newsom said. “This is what dictators do.”

‘Quick Reaction Force’

Now the Trump administration is evaluating plans to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” composed of 600 National Guard members to remain on stand-by in order to be quickly deployed to any U.S. city undergoing a protest or other civil unrest within an hour, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

The groups, who would be armed with riot gear and other weapons, would be split evenly between Alabama and Arizona, according to the Post.

The DOD proposal also calls for a rotation of service members from Army and Air Force National Guard units based in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee, according to the Post.

National Guard members are typically in reserve and are some of the first responders to natural disasters.

The Department of Defense and the National Guard did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment about the “Quick Reaction Force” plans. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Which cities are next?

At the Monday press conference, Trump specifically cited four cities that could see similar National Guard movements: Baltimore, Chicago, New York City and Oakland – all heavily Democratic cities led by Black mayors. Violent crime in all those cities has continued to trend downward, according to each city's police database.

Baltimore County, Maryland, Cook County, Illinois, New York City and the entire state of California also all are on a new “sanctuary jurisdiction” list issued by the Department of Justice on Aug. 5. They are identified as “having policies, laws, or regulations that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

But, unlike the district, where the president has control over the National Guard, state governors, under the law, have had control over their National Guard members.

Additionally, while Trump has seized control of the 3,400 officers in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department for 29 days due to the district's Home Rule Act, experts don’t see how that can legally be done with other local police departments.

“What they are doing in D.C. cannot be replicated outside of D.C. All of this is only possible because D.C. is not a state,” said Joseph Nunn, a counsel in the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program. “There's no playbook for them to do what they seem to want to do outside of D.C.”

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified Trump’s statements about sending in National Guard members into cities.

“The president is speaking about what he’d like to see take place in other cities across the country,” she said. “When the time comes we’ll talk about that. Starting with our nation's capital is a great place to begin and it should serve as a model.”

Trump said he hoped other cities were “watching.”

“Maybe they’ll self clean up and maybe they'll self do this and get rid of the cashless bail thing and all of the things that caused the problem,” the president said.

Nunn said that even if the president were to federalize a state’s National Guard, those members would be subject to the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which generally bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

“There is no statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act that allows the military to participate in local law enforcement,” Nunn said.

Los Angeles

A trial is underway this week challenging the president’s move to federalize California National Guard members, in a suit filed by Newsom, after an appeals court temporarily upheld Trump’s move.

The president deployed 4,000 members of the National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles after protests erupted against aggressive immigration actions by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting raids in Home Depot parking lots.

But the legal issue before a San Francisco court is not if the president’s actions were unlawful, but on the political question of who has authority over the National Guard.

Other governors in the states Trump mentioned as candidates for National Guard activation pushed back on the notion.

Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, who served in the U.S. Army, said in a statement that the president’s decision to call in the National Guard to the District of Columbia “lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”

Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the president could not send in the National Guard to Chicago.

“Let’s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” he said.

The conflict between Trump and the Democrats comes at the same time Newsom has threatened to launch a redistricting of California’s congressional districts in order to nullify Texas’ attempt to redraw maps to add more Republican seats to the U.S. House.

And Pritzker is hosting in Illinois the Texas Democrats who left the state to prevent the state legislature from having a quorum after Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session for redistricting.

Military forces

Since taking office for his second term, the president has signed five executive orders that lay out the use of military forces within the U.S. borders and extend other executive powers to speed up Trump’s immigration crackdown.

More funding also soon will be at hand for Trump’s mass deportations. The massive tax and spending cut bill enacted in July has as its centerpiece $170 billion for the administration's immigration crackdown. It bolsters border security, increases immigration detention capacity and adds fees to legal pathways for immigration, among other things. Thousands more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are slated to be hired.

Some Republican governors have agreed to deploy their own National Guard members to aid the Trump administration in immigration enforcement, such as in Iowa and Tennessee. The secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, sent National Guard to the southern border in Texas when she was governor of South Dakota.

Nunn said that while it’s not typically normal for states to use National Guard members for local policing there is some precedent, such as when New York had members stationed in the New York City subway.

“What is unprecedented is the federal government using military personnel for sort of crime prevention, for regular policing,” Nunn said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/2025-08/nationalguarddc.jpg?h=6eff8031&itok=1Y4cZBEi,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:48.777357

Speaking at a town-hall event for the bureau's employees, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also suggested that when tallying the country's population, the census should differentiate people living in the U.S. without legal status from other residents, according to three Census Bureau employees, who asked NPR not to name them because they fear retaliation.

Lutnick said if a person has ""broken into the country,"" they need to be counted in the census, but they should be counted as someone who has ""broken into the country,"" the three employees confirmed to NPR.

Lutnick's remarks come amid a Republican-led campaign to use census data to redraw congressional voting maps in Texas and other states ahead of next year's midterm election in an attempt to maintain GOP control of the House of Representatives.

Amid this rare mid-decade redistricting push, Trump, Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and some GOP lawmakers in Congress have floated conducting a census before the next scheduled count in 2030 so that new results can be used to redistribute House seats among the states and redraw maps of congressional voting districts — all before the 2026 election.

Lutnick acknowledged legal hurdles facing any census before 2030

Given the short timeline, census experts have dismissed the idea of a 2025 or 2026 census as practically impossible. It usually takes the bureau more than a decade to prepare a count, and planning for the upcoming 2030 census began six years ago.

Lutnick's comments on Tuesday mark the first known acknowledgement by a top Trump administration official of the potential legal hurdles facing any attempt to carry out the president's census call.

The remarks also appear to reference Trump's Aug. 7 social media post calling for the U.S. census to, for the first time in the country's history, exclude people without legal status.

The 14th Amendment requires the ""whole number of persons in each state"" to be counted in the 2030 census apportionment numbers, which are set to be used to determine each state's new share of House seats and Electoral College votes.

Testifying before Congress, Lutnick has faced questions from lawmakers about his position on who should be counted in the census. During his Senate confirmation hearing in February, Lutnick told Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii: ""Since the first sentence of the 14th Amendment of that clause says we will count each whole person, I promise you we will count each whole person. That's what the Constitution says. And we will stick right to it rigorously.""

But asked in June by Republican Rep. Dale Strong of Alabama about his thoughts on ""consistency from state to state not allowing non-U.S. citizens to be counted"" in the census, Lutnick said: ""Consistency makes sense.""

Some Republicans are still pushing for a census before the 2026 midterms

Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to carry out a national tally ""in such Manner as they shall by Law direct."" In Title 13 of the U.S. Code, Congress directed the commerce secretary to follow a once-a-decade census schedule. That federal law also allows for a mid-decade census in 2025, but it can't be used to redistribute House seats and a legal deadline to prepare for such a count has already passed.

Still, Trump said in the social media post that he instructed the Commerce Department to ""immediately begin work"" on a ""new"" census that excludes people living in the states without legal status. Trump has not clarified whether his post was referring to the 2030 census or an earlier one.

Hours after Trump's census call, the Commerce Department said in a statement that the Census Bureau ""will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the Census to better understand our robust Census data"" and ""accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.""

The department replied with that same statement when asked by NPR on Tuesday whether Lutnick has communicated to the White House his position on Congress' authority over the census and whether the commerce secretary plans to propose adding a census question about a person's immigration status, which the bureau has yet to test.

The press offices for the Census Bureau, which is part of the Commerce Department, and the White House did not immediately respond to NPR's inquiries.

Trump has publicly backed a proposal by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to change current federal law and allow for a new census, redistribution of House seats and a new round of congressional redistricting before the 2026 midterm election.

Greene's bill also calls for excluding not only people without legal status, but all people living in the states without U.S. citizenship, such as green card holders, from what the 14th Amendment requires to be the ""whole number of persons in each state.""

Last week, Republican Rep. Randy Fine of Florida, introduced a similar proposal. Together, both bills currently have less than a handful of sponsors and are stuck in committee.

On Monday, another Republican official from Florida weighed in on the census with a letter to Lutnick referencing Trump's ""recent census directive"" by social media post.

Florida's state Attorney General James Uthmeier — a former Trump administration official who helped come up with a failed plan to exclude people without legal status from the 2020 census apportionment numbers — made two proposals.

Uthmeier suggested states get new shares of House seats before the 2026 midterm election based on a census ""recount"" in areas of states that the Census Bureau estimates it over- or undercounted in 2020. He also proposed ""correcting"" the census data used to guide trillions in federal funding for public services in communities with those miscounting estimates. The bureau's researchers and an internal watchdog have raised concerns about the usability of those estimates.

""We are energized by President Trump's leadership,"" Uthmeier wrote, ""and we look forward to hearing from you and working together to resolve these issues.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2Fbe%2Fcd3a700c4718b0bbab36ddb64f36%2Fgettyimages-2197465985.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:56:50.549900

Instead, the US state department sounded an alarm about what it said was the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa – both of which Washington has clashed with over a host of issues.

Criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQ+ rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted. Washington referred to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine mainly as the “Russia-Ukraine war”.

The report’s section on Israel was much shorter than last year’s edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza. About 61,000 people have died, according to the Gaza health ministry, as a result of Israel’s military operations in response to an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023.

The report was delayed for months as Trump appointees altered an earlier state department draft dramatically to bring it in line with “America First” values, according to government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. The report introduced new categories such as “Life”, “Liberty” and “Security of the Person”.

“There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses,” the 2024 report said about El Salvador, in sharp contrast with the 2023 report that talked about “significant human rights issues” and listed them as credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.

Washington’s bilateral ties with El Salvador have strengthened since Trump took office, as the administration has deported people to El Salvador with help from President Nayib Bukele, whose country is receiving $6m from the US to house the migrants in a high-security mega-prison.

The Trump administration has moved away from the traditional US promotion of democracy and human rights, seeing it as interference in another country’s affairs, even as it criticized countries selectively, consistent with its broader policy towards a particular country.

One example is Europe, where Trump officials repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they see as suppression of rightwing leaders, including in Romania, Germany and France, and accused European authorities of censoring views such as criticism of immigration.

For decades, the state department’s congressionally mandated Human Rights Report has been used as a blueprint of reference for global rights advocacy.

This year’s report was prepared after a major revamp of the department, which included the firing of hundreds of people, many from the agency’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which takes the lead in writing the report.

The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, in April wrote an opinion piece that said the bureau had become a platform for “left-wing activists”, saying the Trump administration would reorient the bureau to focus on “Western values”.

In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the state department found the human rights situation declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes. This year’s report took aim at the courts, stating they took action undermining freedom of speech and disproportionately suppressing the speech of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, among others.

Bolsonaro is on trial before the supreme court on charges he conspired with allies to violently overturn his 2022 presidential election loss to the leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Trump has referred to the case as a “witch-hunt” and called it grounds for a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods.

August 12, 2025 4:40 pm

NEW YORK – In a win for immigrants’ rights, a U.S. District Court granted a temporary restraining order today that would improve conditions for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at 26 Federal Plaza. Notably, the order prohibits ICE from detaining people in spaces with less than 50 square feet per person. The order would also require ICE to improve access to hygiene, provide sleeping mats and access to medical care, and ensure people detained can make free, unmonitored, and confidential calls to their lawyers within 24 hours of being detained.

The order comes just days after the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union, Make the Road New York, and Wang Hecker LLP filed a class action lawsuit over the abusive conditions at 26 Federal Plaza. The order will remain in place for at least 14 days while the judge considers longer-term relief.

Quotes from co-counsel are as follows:

“Today’s order sends a clear message: ICE cannot hold people in abusive conditions and deny them their Constitutional rights to due process and legal representation,” said Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project. ""We’ll continue to fight to ensure that peoples’ rights are upheld at 26 Federal Plaza and beyond.”

Harold Solis, Co-Legal Director of Make the Road New York, said, ""We welcome the decision by Judge Kaplan to place clear limits on the disturbing and unlawful conditions to which immigrants have been subjected at 26 Federal Plaza. This ruling sends a hopeful message, one that reinforces what everyone knows to be true: ICE cannot confine people in inhumane conditions, nor can it obstruct their access to counsel. We will remain vigilant to ensure ICE complies with the court’s order.”

“The conditions and lack of attorney access at 26 Federal Plaza have been horrifying and unconscionable,” said Heather Gregorio of Wang Hecker LLP. “Judge Kaplan’s Temporary Restraining Order imposes basic accountability on ICE and requires that it meet constitutional standards, as all human beings deserve.”

“The Constitution requires that no one — especially someone unlawfully arrested at their immigration hearing, which happened to so many people in this case — should have to endure the dehumanizing conditions we've challenged in 26 Federal Plaza,"" said Bobby Hodgson, Assistant Legal Director at the New York Civil Liberties Union. “We look forward to continuing this fight and stopping ICE's unconstitutional detention practices at 26 Federal Plaza for good.”

Festivals take a stand Another way Connecticut Puerto Ricans have spoken out against ICE is with their dollars.
And when we say community, it's not just a Puerto Rican community, it's the New Haven community,” Rodriguez said.","The week President Trump was inaugurated, Connecticut’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus spoke out against what they say is racial profiling of Latino communities by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Over the summer, reggaeton artist Bad Bunny publicly shamed ICE after witnessing a detainment on the island. And Wesleyan alum and legendary Nuyorican Lin Manuel Miranda recently turned the 10th anniversary of his Broadway hit “Hamilton” into a fundraiser for immigrants.

Here in Connecticut, Puerto Ricans are increasingly standing with their fellow Latinos against the immigration crackdown.

When a New Haven high schooler from Guatemala was detained by ICE in July, it wasn’t just Latinos who came out to the rally for his return.

Rev. Nathan Empsall is the priest-in-charge at St. Paul and St. James Episcopal Church in Wooster Square. He says attendance at the food pantry and clothing closet the church partners with is down in recent weeks, and volunteers say it’s because of fears of ICE.

“If this was about enforcing justice and laws like the authoritarians tell us,” he told rallygoers, “they wouldn't arrest people outside courthouses, they wouldn't target Puerto Rican neighborhoods, and they wouldn't be arresting our 11th graders.”

Empsall says he was referring to cases reported in similar communities, like the detainment of a Puerto Rican veteran in Newark in January and the presence of a dozen ICE agents outside of a Puerto Rican museum in Chicago in July.

In a statement to Connecticut Public, ICE Boston spokesperson James Covington said “these rumors only serve to cause fear and incite violence toward our brave officers.” He said the idea that ICE is targeting Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the state is “not only ludicrous and dangerous, but completely false.”

“What I find as ludicrous and dangerous is the racial profiling that is happening right now and that is being advanced by ICE,” said Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.

Matos is Puerto Rican and has lived and worked as an advocate in Connecticut for over two decades.

“I will tell you personally that I have fielded a number of phone calls from Puerto Ricans asking me if they should carry their passports because they're planning to head to Puerto Rico, and they're afraid of the experience that they will have and the possibility that they will be stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” she said.

Why? Because of Newark, Chicago, the Puerto Rican restaurant that was raided in Philadelphia, the Puerto Rican family that was detained while out shopping in Milwaukee.

“There are examples throughout the entire country of Puerto Ricans being detained. That is why Puerto Ricans, Latinos, brown and Black people are afraid,” Matos said. “Even when they benefit from US citizenship, that does not stop the level of fear.”

Concerns spread at celebrations

Fear was a real concern for Elba and Carmelo Valle at the Salsa Meets Jazz Festival in downtown Hartford. Half of their Puerto Rican friend group headed to Parkville Market afterward to keep the party going. But that day, during a Peruvian festival at the market, a rumor started to spread that ICE was there and arresting folks.

“Who knows where it can happen?” Elba said. “And then, if we see that, it's just the anger. It's really anger. It's not right. It's not right the way they're going about it, I don't think.”

Carmelo brought up a common argument against the recent deportations: ICE is separating families.

“Yeah,” Elba agreed, “they're separating families. It's heartbreaking.”

At Parkville Market, it turns out EMS was just responding to a medical emergency that day. But the fear that any official in uniform could be ICE increasingly keeps many Latinos home — and some Puerto Ricans questioning what their role is in all this.

“What can we do?” Elba said. “What can we do but get closer together? You know what I'm saying? Come as a community and as a family to, you know, at least try to help out.”

Officials ‘call out’ the targeting of Latinos

The National Puerto Rican Agenda released a statement that reads, in part, “As a national organization rooted in the Puerto Rican diaspora, we know firsthand the importance of family unity, community stability, and the struggle for dignity and inclusion. Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, we will not remain silent while our immigrant brothers and sisters are dehumanized.”

Connecticut State Rep. Christopher Rosario echoes that sentiment. He’s a member of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus and represents many Puerto Ricans in Bridgeport.

“Even though we — quote, unquote — shouldn't have anything to worry about, as we are citizens, Puerto Rico always gets second class treatment from the federal government, so it's just no different,” Rosario said.

Rosario says he’s heard the reports, too, of U.S Citizens being detained, even if briefly, in other states.

“And anytime there's an incident where there's a Puerto Rican, or anyone, for that matter, that's detained or held by ICE, we must call it out and work with our federal authorities to make sure this doesn't happen,” he said.

Festivals take a stand

Another way Connecticut Puerto Ricans have spoken out against ICE is with their dollars.

Avelo Airlines is one of the cheapest ways to fly direct from New Haven to San Juan to visit loved ones on the island. But after Avelo signed up to run deportation flights for the Trump administration, pro-immigrant protesters and the group Puerto Ricans United came out against the decision. Joe Rodriguez is the president of PRU and a vice president at the National Puerto Rican Agenda.

“We're community first. And when we say community, it's not just a Puerto Rican community, it's the New Haven community,” Rodriguez said. “And when our brothers and sisters are reaching out to us for support, we need to be there, because they have been there for us in our time of need: be it Hurricane Maria and other natural disasters where our community has partnered with us.”

PRU puts on New Haven’s Puerto Rican festival each year, and for the last two, Avelo has been a sponsor of the event. This year PRU’s board voted unanimously to cut ties.

“We felt it only right, given who we are as an organization, our values and what we stand for, to stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters and say before we even engage in conversations, we're going to just nip it in the bud now and say, ‘No, we're not going to do it,’” he said.

In an emailed statement to NPR, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy called the decision to run deportation flights “a sensitive and complicated topic.”

""After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 Crewmembers employed for years to come,” he said.

Rodriguez says he knows many Puerto Ricans are now willing to go out of their way — driving to other airports and spending more money — to avoid supporting a contractor for deportation flights.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b1a072/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F48%2Fc2%2Ff0d1a711471bac6fb31ffa382153%2F250611-newhaveniceprotest-ab23426xxx.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:57:05.546658

ABC15 reached out to DHS to find out more about what crime the people at Southwest School had been accused of.","PHOENIX — Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity around Valley schools has grown in the past few weeks, in some cases, taking place while parents or guardians are walking children to school, according to a watchdog group monitoring ICE movements.

Video obtained by ABC15 shows an ICE agent and a student walking together to Southwest School, which serves students from kindergarten to eighth grade, on Dobbins Road in south Phoenix on Tuesday, August 5.

Vehicles that appear to be from ICE are also lined up near school property lines, though not on the school's property itself.

People First Project, which tracks ICE encounters around the Valley, said the student was walked to school by the agent after their guardian was detained by ICE.

Roosevelt School District, which operates Southwest School, said it was aware of ICE's presence last week and was ""actively monitoring the situation,"" noting it had not been contacted by any immigration enforcement agencies.

“We understand how deeply concerning these reports may be for many of our families,” Dr. Ashley Hodge, President of Roosevelt School District Governing Board, said in a statement shared with ABC15. “On behalf of our entire Board, we want to assure you that the safety, dignity, and well-being of every student and family remain at the heart of our mission.”

On Monday, parents at the school were surprised to learn about the operation.

""That's kind of strange to me,"" Mark Childress, whose son attends preschool at Southwest, said. ""I think certain places are sacred ground... kids should feel safe coming to school.""

It's unclear how many people were detained during the operation, which took place around 7:30 a.m. on Tuesday, on the second day of school. People First Project said as many as three people were pulled over and potentially detained by ICE.

Clarissa Vela, founder of People First Project, says the group keeps its eye on ICE activity as a way to ensure agents are following the law.

""We're not anti-police, we just want to make sure that people are being treated fairly and their rights are not being violated,"" she said.

Vela said monitors in her group have witnessed ICE running plates at schools and picking up parents who were going through the legal immigration process. Vela said her group was unsure what, if any, crimes the guardians of the Southwest students were being accused of.

People First Project has seen an uptick in interactions with ICE near schools recently, with Vela saying she was aware of about 40 cases in the last week.

ICE's ability to conduct operations around schools is a change made in the last few months.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security memo sent out on the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration rescinded a policy stopping ICE from detaining people and conducting immigration operations in ""sensitive"" areas such as churches and schools. The guidance was put in place during President Joe Biden's administration.

Phil Ortega, an Arizona immigration attorney, views the decision to drop the sensitive area policy as an attempt to intimidate immigrants into engaging in public life.

""My personal opinion was that the recission of that policy was just a way to strike fear into the community and cause individuals that would normally feel safe to, you know, send their kids to school or to go to churches,"" Ortega said. ""This would discourage them from doing those things.""

With classes back in session and an increased federal emphasis on boosting ICE detention numbers, both Ortega and People First Project expect to see more ICE activity near schools.

ABC15 reached out to DHS to find out more about what crime the people at Southwest School had been accused of. DHS said it couldn't share more information about the operation or the individuals involved unless ABC15 could identify the individuals.

Arizona Superintendent Tom Horne declined to comment on the operation, saying it was between the district and ICE.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c6b1c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/854x448+0+16/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2Fbd5%2F5c3d34b8b29a45469a86c02775b7a2cf%2Fbd5c9620b4e048db9d6e59a6acf7eff8%2Fposter_7c414f421a8b44d8a894f0d4470c56d7.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 18:57:09.930907

Kim Reynolds says 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers will be deployed to offer ""administrative and logistical support"" to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement beginning in September.

Reynolds announced the mission on Tuesday, Aug. 12. The mission is a response to a request by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and will begin Sept. 8.

""Just as we supported Texas when the Biden Administration left them to defend the border, Iowa will continue to assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws — this time, by working with the Trump Administration to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in our state,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""By providing administrative and logistical support, the Iowa National Guard will free up local ICE officials to continue their work outside the office to enforce the law and keep our state safe.""

Reynolds said Aug. 6 in Cedar Rapids that the Iowa National Guard was ready to ""step up and help"" ICE with logistics and other administrative tasks, but at that time no agreement had been finalized.

Now, Reynolds said the U.S. Secretary of Defense has authorized the use of the 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers under Title 32 of the federal code, which means the soldiers will be on active duty under state, rather than federal control, but the federal government will cover their pay and benefits.

The mission is approved through Nov. 15.

National Guard mission latest step Reynolds has taken on immigration

The National Guard mission is the latest step Reynolds has taken to direct state officials to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

This spring, the Iowa Department of Public Safety signed what's known as a 287(g) agreement with ICE to deputize a three-member DPS task force to carry out some federal immigration enforcement functions, including arresting and interrogating people who are in violation of federal immigration laws.

Reynolds also filed a complaint with the Iowa attorney general's office alleging that Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx violated Iowa law with a Facebook post discouraging law enforcement to cooperate with ""detainer"" requests from federal immigration officials if they weren't approved by a judge.

Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Marx, but later dropped the lawsuit. Winneshiek County does comply with ICE detainer requests, despite Marx's post.

In past years, Reynolds has deployed Iowa National Guard soldiers and Iowa State Patrol troopers to the U.S.-Mexico border to assist Texas with immigration enforcement efforts.

Immigrant rights groups criticize National Guard mission

Immigrant rights groups have criticized Reynolds' support for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts and now the Iowa National Guard's participation in immigration enforcement.

""Using Iowa troopers against Iowa communities will not stand,"" said Alejandra Escobar, an organizer with Escucha Mi Voz Iowa, said during an Aug. 5 rally in Cedar Rapids.

Joe Henry, Iowa state political director for the League of United Latin American Citizens of Iowa, said using National Guard troops for immigration enforcement will cause more problems than solutions and Reynolds should focus on more serious issues.

""Gov. Reynolds’ plan is a misuse of Iowa’s resources. Immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility not the job of Iowans in our state,"" Henry said in a statement Aug. 11. ""The governor should be putting her efforts toward the real problems we’re facing in Iowa like climbing cancer rates, the second-worst economy in the nation, poor access to health care and dangerous levels of water pollutants in our rivers.""

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it’s not a threat to one country, it’s a threat that’s growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.
“It’s very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.
As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.’s mass deportation agenda.
At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups.","On the final day of the Second Pan-American Congress this month, more than 60 delegates from 12 countries made their way into the Secretary of Public Education headquarters in downtown Mexico City. As leaders from the Americas walked through the building’s passages and patios, many stopped to take pictures in front of the walls lined with murals from famous artists, including Diego Rivera.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site served as the location of the final plenary of the three-day gathering aimed at uniting progressive and democratic forces in the Western hemisphere to take on rising far right authoritarianism.

Delegates representing communities from as far as Nunavut in Canada to the extreme southern tip of South America eventually took their seats in the Ibero-American Hall, a space adorned with a massive, nearly 1,500-square-foot mural, appropriately called “The Union of Latin America” by Roberto Montenegro.

From this hall, the message from Mexico was unambiguous: The peoples and the elected representatives of this hemisphere are ready to act to confront the global threat of fascism.

“We are of course facing an authoritarian threat in the world: it is the return of fascist positions to power,” María José Pizarro, a Colombian senator from the ruling Pacto Historico coalition, told Truthout. “In the face of this, we must therefore build joint strategies that allow us to confront it in the best possible way in countries where this is already happening, and in those where it is not, to prevent the return of this type of government.”

When it comes to hemispheric relations, U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued what has been described as a “divide and conquer” strategy, leveraging the national interests of one country against another and pitting neighbors against each other in order to squeeze out concessions from leaders. Trump has been able to follow this strategy to varying degrees of success, in part due to the lack of unity regarding the threat he represents to the entire world.

“[Fascism] is not a regional threat, it’s not a threat to one country, it’s a threat that’s growing worldwide,” said Pizarro.

From the Atlas Network, a coalition of right-wing think tanks and advocacy groups that promote neoliberal policies globally, to Trump’s open and blatant interference inside Brazil in order to back his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro, in the face of charges over his effort to carry out a coup after losing the 2022 election, the far right has been successful in building trans-national links.

One aim of the Pan-American Congress is to break down barriers between progressives and anti-fascists who have historically lacked an institutional space to better coordinate their own regional response.

One standout feature of this gathering was the participation of elected representatives from the United States, including Ilhan Omar (D-Minnesota), Jesús “Chuy” García (D-Illinois), Delia Ramírez (D-Illinois), and Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan); Canadian Members of Parliament (MPs), such as interim New Democratic Party leader Don Davies, Leah Gazan, and Lori Idlout; and MPs from the governing Liberals, such as Michael Coteau, also attended.

Pizarro, who is also a potential candidate for Colombia’s 2026 presidential election, described the participation of U.S. and Canadian lawmakers at the Pan-American Congress as “fundamental” and expressed optimism that this would be the beginning of a closer relationship with progressives in North America.

“We don’t see ourselves as isolated from North America, but rather the opposite, as part of an American continent that integrates us all,” said Pizarro. “We rarely have the opportunity to listen to each other, to talk, especially today when the United States government is speaking out strongly about its position on Latin America, its relationship with Latin America, and that conversation with progressive Democratic congressmembers, of course, must be strengthened,” she added.

The enthusiasm for building closer ties goes both ways.

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib said she drew inspiration from her conversations with other lawmakers fighting for their communities and the power of connecting with fellow activists across the Americas.

Tlaib drew parallels from her experience growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in a neighborhood impacted by corporate pollution with the stories she heard from colleagues at the congress from Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico.

“These corporations don’t care about these borders. They come and extract, make us sick, and just leave us with nothing,” said Tlaib.

But now she says she feels “less alone in this fight against corporate greed, against corporate polluters, against those that don’t care about our communities thriving.”

Tlaib cited her conversations with Canadian MPs about the need to collaborate in the fight against the environmental threat posed by the Line 5 pipeline that threatens water systems in both the U.S. and Canada.

“We are now building these bridges and creating a movement that brings all of us together and understanding that connectivity,” Tlaib told Truthout.

Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman to serve in U.S. Congress and an important voice on the global stage speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians, also expressed gratitude at the centering of the Palestinian people’s cause at the gathering. At every event over the course of the weekend, speakers spoke up in support of Palestine in no uncertain terms, firmly expressing their solidarity.

“It’s very rare that you see that in the United States Congress, but we saw it at the Pan-American Congress,” said Tlaib.

Coming on the heels of July’s Emergency Conference on Palestine, which likewise saw world leaders gather to take action in an attempt to halt the genocide, delegates at the congress said recognizing the state of Palestine was only a starting point.

“In our view, much deeper actions, much more forceful voices — and of course, the role being played by multilateral organizations, which have been stripped of their value and the ability to defend life in the face of the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian people — are essential,” said Pizarro.

Meanwhile, Colombian Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs Mauricio Jaramillo Jassir argued that countries with progressive governments have no choice but to break diplomatic relations with Israel.

In addition to calling for an end to the genocide against the Palestinian people, participants in the conference discussed Trump’s human rights violations against migrants and refugees, and the need to confront climate change.

During his speech at the opening session, Mexican Senate President Gerardo Fernández Noroña said the two defining features of the rising fascist threat in the world were the suffering inflicted on Palestinians and the abuse of migrants by the U.S.

“It is an unjust, vile, incorrect persecution where, by virtue of being a migrant, or the color of your skin or your nationality, people are persecuted,” said Noroña.

The mistreatment of migrants is the clearest case study on the necessity of confronting fascism in the Americas. Trump has leaned on allies like El Salvador’s far right President Nayib Bukele, who infamously agreed to detain more than 230 Venezuelan migrants sent from the U.S. in his notorious mega-prison before negotiations between Caracas and Washington eventually secured their release.

Mexico in particular has faced enormous pressure from both U.S. political parties to crack down on migrants transiting through its territory as they try to reach the United States. More recently, the Mexican government has had to face down repeated tariff threats from Trump over the issue of migration.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has explicitly declined to become a third-country destination for non-Mexican asylum seekers and has resisted U.S. efforts to impose such arrangements. As a result, the Trump administration has secured agreements with Guatemala and Honduras instead, arrangements that ultimately serve to undermine efforts by any one country in the region to resist the U.S.’s mass deportation agenda.

The selection of Mexico City as the host of the Second Pan-American Congress (the first having been held last year in Bogotá, Colombia) offered delegates the opportunity to learn from the political project known locally as the “Fourth Transformation,” the leftist national political project to shift Mexico to a post-neoliberal model that began with the election of Andrés Manuel López Obrador in 2018 and continued under President Sheinbaum.

With the election of Sheinbaum in 2024, Mexico proved to be one of the few countries that bucked a trend in which voters ousted incumbents and replaced them, in many cases, with right-wing populists, such as Javier Milei in Argentina.

Sheinbaum, who has been lauded for repeatedly standing up to Trump, welcomed delegates at the National Palace, allowing representatives from throughout the hemisphere to share their experiences resisting the U.S. president — and also to share firsthand how Mexico has been able to not only navigate an intemperate neighbor, but also continue to press forward with its anti-neoliberal political agenda.

Canadian MP Leah Gazan, a member of the Wood Mountain Lakota Nation who represents Winnipeg in Canada’s House of Commons, said her time in Mexico left her feeling renewed and hopeful.

“What’s happened in Mexico is so inspiring … and to see women, progressive women, strong women, leading the narrative about the importance of humanizing politics, the importance of rooting democracy and human rights, is a refreshing change from what we’re witnessing in Canada right now,” Gazan told Truthout.

“I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from the Global South,” said Gazan.

The challenge facing elected representatives now is translating the positive experiences from the congress in Mexico into action in their home countries.

During a Pan-American Congress event at the Esperanza Iris Theatre in Mexico City, U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar renewed her pledge to fight for marginalized communities throughout the hemisphere from her place inside the U.S. Congress, signaling to the peoples of the Global South that they have an ally in her.

“Since being in the elected office, I’ve made an effort to set myself apart as somebody who sees the global community as one, someone who understands our destinies and our fates are intertwined, someone who understands that being in the United States provides us with great privileges but also with responsibilities,” Omar told Truthout.

Omar has repeatedly expressed her solidarity with the Global South, especially Latin America, by participating in an on-the-ground delegation to Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador in 2022, and through numerous legislative initiatives focusing on migration and human rights.

The U.S. representative also shared her view that progressives in the U.S., especially those in elected office, have an elevated duty to end U.S. policies that harm people throughout the world, saying, “It is our policies that are actively responsible for sanctions, for militarization, for exploitation, and it is up to us to make sure that we are lifting our voices collectively to say, ‘No, there is another way.’”

Trump’s aggressive approach to relations with his neighbors in the region may have caught many somewhat off guard, but more than six months into his second term, leaders from this hemisphere have now adapted and are forming new united strategies to take on Trump.

At the close of the 2025 Pan-American Congress, delegates reported the discussions and proposals from the various working groups. From efforts to advance an explicit recognition of systemic racism throughout the Americas, to calls for a new global order based on human dignity and solidarity among nations, there was widespread consensus on the need for stronger international cooperation to confront the global rise of fascism, denouncing its role in migrant persecution in the U.S., and the genocide in Gaza.

With the next Pan-American Congress set to take place in Uruguay next year, delegates such as Omar and Tlaib expressed a sense of hope and optimism that the gathering in Mexico City will serve as a turning point.

“There is nothing like our sisters down south and what they deal with, but [they] continuously find joy in the work that they do on behalf of the communities they serve, and that is inspiring and I’ll take that with me,” concluded Omar.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/030825_Clausura_Congreso_Panamericano-27.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 16:56:38.343319
,Policy,2025-08-12 20:37:48+00:00,The Washington Times,Rushing for the exit: Illegal immigrant population down 1.6 million under Trump crackdown,"Stephen Dinan, The Washington Times https:, www.washingtontimes.com",,,,,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/aug/12/illegal-immigrant-population-16-million-trump-crackdown/,"Over the past six months, though, the illegal immigrant population has been dropping at nearly 270,000 a month, or more than twice the rate of increase under Mr. Biden.
Using other assumptions, Mr. Camarota is able to estimate the illegal immigrant population from the CPS data.
Mr. Camarota said the total U.S. population could decline this year, for the first time since the 1930s.
It’s possible that the foreign-born, illegal immigrants in particular, are now lying and claiming to be U.S.-born legal residents.
It’s also possible that some households with illegal immigrants have stopped responding to the CPS, which could affect the numbers.","President Trump is booting out illegal immigrants faster than President Biden added them, according to the latest Census Bureau numbers, which show an unprecedented drop in the number of immigrants living in the U.S.

The total number of foreign-born people dropped by 2.2 million from January to July, and most of that — 1.6 million — was among the illegal immigrant population, said Steven A. Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies who crunched the numbers.

It’s an almost unfathomable turnaround from the Biden years, when illegal immigrants surged into the U.S. at record rates, netting about 120,000 new people each month.

Over the past six months, though, the illegal immigrant population has been dropping at nearly 270,000 a month, or more than twice the rate of increase under Mr. Biden.

“The best evidence we have is that the illegal population is now falling at a rate that even exceeds the massive growth that we had in Biden’s four years,” Mr. Camarota said.

The decline coincides with a massive effort by the Trump administration, which is increasing formal arrests and deportations and has invested heavily in machinery to try to encourage illegal immigrants to leave on their own.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that foreign leaders in the hemisphere tell her they are seeing a wave of people arriving in their countries after having left the U.S.

“Over and over again, I’m hearing that hundreds of thousands of their citizens are coming home, voluntarily,” she said.

The new data comes from the Current Population Survey, a monthly Census Bureau report that is used to produce data such as the monthly unemployment figures. One of its questions prods respondents to reveal where they were born, which produces the overall immigration number.

In January, it stood at 53.3 million, an all-time high in sheer number and as a percentage of the total population.

Last month, it dipped below 51.1 million.

Using other assumptions, Mr. Camarota is able to estimate the illegal immigrant population from the CPS data. He figures that rose from 10.2 million at the start of the Biden years to 15.8 million in January, before tumbling to 14.2 million now.

Not all the illegal immigrants went home. Some are part of the normal churn of migration, such as gaining legal status or dying. That was true for the Biden years as well.

Mr. Camarota said most of those who left were likely newcomers from the Biden years or were otherwise less rooted in the U.S., and thus it was easier to pick up and leave.

That could presage diminishing returns for Mr. Trump’s enforcement push.

The implications of the drop are massive.

Mr. Camarota said the total U.S. population could decline this year, for the first time since the 1930s.

The natural net increase from births is about 500,000. If the U.S. has already shed more than 2 million people, that would easily swamp the births.

Mr. Camarota said the decline gives communities breathing space after the increases of the Biden years.

“It’s likely that this represents a savings in money for the taxpayer,” he said. “It will take pressure off schools and hospitals and other services. It’s likely it will potentially create job opportunities for Americans.”

Immigrant rights groups say the downside to a drop is that businesses will lose part of their workforce.

Indeed, farmers and hospitality groups have been flooding the Trump administration with complaints that they can’t get workers to show up anymore amid the high-profile wave of immigration arrests.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated some form of leniency for illegal immigrants who work in those areas of the economy, though he has yet to deliver any concrete policy change.

Mr. Camarota said there may be good reason to wait.

He said there is no evidence from the numbers that the employment of the U.S.-born has fallen. Indeed, the data suggests it has surged in recent months, which could mean people who have struggled to hold jobs are now gaining them.

“That doesn’t mean bad economic news, necessarily,” he said. “It probably means per capita GDP has gone up.”

The CPS data does come with some caveats.

It’s possible that the foreign-born, illegal immigrants in particular, are now lying and claiming to be U.S.-born legal residents. Mr. Camarota said that’s not likely.

It’s also possible that some households with illegal immigrants have stopped responding to the CPS, which could affect the numbers.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/07/15/Immigration_Courts_Arrests_70071_c0-250-6000-3750_s1200x700.jpg?2cb823f519263a3e55a419724463fd44fb7f7c61,N,,2025-08-12 20:56:54.582866

Hours after Trebach was detained, ICE made its first arrest of a protester in San Francisco.
In videos obtained by Mission Local, the San Francisco protesters, a short woman in her 50s and a taller middle-aged man, are tackled to the ground by ICE agents.","While Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have arrested at least 38 U.S. citizens protesters in Los Angeles this year, last week’s arrest of two protesters in downtown San Francisco appears to be the first time the agency has detained citizens here, according to immigration lawyers from the Bay Area.

“I haven’t seen ICE arresting [U.S. citizen] protestors in the Bay since entering the legal field nearly 20 years ago,” wrote Aliya Karmali, an Oakland immigration attorney and member of the Demonstrations Legal Support Collaborative.

On Friday, ICE agents tackled and detained two protesters, both U.S. citizens, outside the San Francisco ICE field office at 630 Sansome St.

ICE has “been known to racially profile and detain people who may not have documentation of their citizenship,” wrote Karmali, referring to the detention — and sometimes deportation — of U.S. citizens. But now, she continued, they seem to be expanding their authority over all citizens, to arrest for federal crimes in L.A. and here.

But even if ICE detains someone, that federal crime still must be proven through a trial. According to reporting by the Los Angeles Times, only seven of the 38 people charged by ICE in L.A. have been successfully indicted. The rest signed plea deals, had their charges reduced significantly, or even had their cases dismissed — in a number of instances because Department of Homeland Security officers made false statements about the arrests.

That seven out of 38 success record is dismal. For context, around 90 percent of general federal prosecutions result in the defendant pleading guilty, and most others are convicted during trial.

“Trump’s directive to ICE agents to arrest protesters — just like much of his administration’s immigration agenda — is unlawful,” wrote Jennifer Friedman, interim director of the Immigration Unit at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office. “Arresting U.S. citizens,” Friedman continued, is “an extremely concerning overreach of civil immigration enforcement authority” and “completely unprecedented as far as I know.”

Is it legal for ICE to arrest citizens? The answer is, sometimes, yes. But ICE is held accountable to two seemingly dueling provisions.

One policy defines clearly that “ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen.”

Another authorizes immigration officers to arrest any person, regardless of immigration status, “for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States,” if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a felony has been committed.

So while ICE officers don’t have the legal power to arrest citizens for immigration violations (which they appear to violate every time they arrest U.S. citizens who they suspect are undocumented), ICE officers are legally allowed to arrest citizens for federal crimes, so long as they have reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed.

But an ICE officer can only conduct these arrests if they’ve been certified for “successfully completing a training course encompassing such arrests.” That’s impossible to check as most of the ICE officers seen in public cover their faces and don’t wear identifying information, making it impossible to identify the ICE officer to check his or her training record.

One such arrest happened last Friday, when ICE officers took U.S. citizen Amanda Trebach into federal custody, outside Terminal Island, a military base off the coast of Los Angeles that ICE has been using to prepare for raids. Trebach was released the following day with no charges, after hundreds of protesters expressed support for her freedom.

Hours after Trebach was detained, ICE made its first arrest of a protester in San Francisco.

In videos obtained by Mission Local, the San Francisco protesters, a short woman in her 50s and a taller middle-aged man, are tackled to the ground by ICE agents. One of the people detained, who asked for anonymity given their ongoing case, reported bruises on their ribs and wrists.

Other video footage shows that San Francisco police officers, who previously arrested over 200 anti-ICE protesters in June, and the Federal Protective Services (“Homeland Security’s Domestic Police Force”) were also at 630 Sansome St. earlier in the day. But agents wearing ICE uniforms were the ones to make the detentions.

The protesters were held for approximately two and half hours in separate holding cells inside the federal building, after being stripped of their personal belongings. When released, they were served a number of citations that the protesters deny — including interference with public duties, which ICE has leveraged against many of the people that agents detained in L.A.

It’s unclear whether the protesters in San Francisco were simply detained, or formally arrested and booked. They won’t know for sure until the Northern District of California’s U.S. Attorney decides whether to press charges, which could take weeks or not happen at all.

The story was updated the afternoon of Aug. 12.

The corrected story is below.

A 4-year-old boy’s ongoing care for stage 4 kidney cancer was interrupted when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers illegally deported him, his sister and mother “without even a semblance of due process,” attorneys for the family say.

Though they are U.S. citizens and were born in Louisiana, the boy and his 7-year-old sister were deported to Honduras along with their 25-year-old mother, who is a Honduran citizen, on April 25, according to a federal lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Louisiana on July 31. The filing uses pseudonyms for the family, referring to the brother and sister as Romeo and Ruby and their mother as Rosario.

Before their deportations, Romeo, now 5, was receiving “life-saving” treatment at a New Orleans children’s hospital for his “rare and aggressive form” of cancer, following his diagnosis at age 2, a complaint says.

“As a direct consequence of ICE’s unlawful conduct, Romeo was deprived of much-needed continuity in his treatment, and he has faced substantial health risks due to his inability to access emergency specialized care and the routine critical oncological care that was available to him in the United States,” his family’s attorneys wrote in the complaint.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Romeo and his family, as well as a second family also wrongly deported by ICE under similar circumstances on April 25, according to the National Immigration Project, Gibson Dunn, Most & Associates, and Ware Immigration, groups representing the case.

The second family includes Julia, 30, a mother from Honduras. She has two daughters, Jade, 2, a U.S. citizen born in Baton Rouge, and Janelle, 11, also a Honduran citizen. Those names are also pseudonyms.

The same week of both families’ deportations, Rosario and Julia separately went to what they thought were supposed to be “regularly scheduled check-ins” with an ICE contractor.

However, officers with ICE apprehended both women and their children “in hotel rooms” in secret, the National Immigration Project said in a July 31 news release.

ICE “denied them the opportunity to speak to family and make decisions about or arrangements for their minor children, denied them access to counsel, and deported them within less than a day in one case and just over 2 days in the other,” the advocacy organization said.

According to the lawsuit, ICE did not let Rosario or Julia decide whether they wanted their children to come with them to Honduras or to make arrangements for them to stay in the U.S. with other loved ones.

“Given Romeo’s cancer and specialized medical needs, Rosario wanted both of her U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States,” the complaint says.

DHS, however, maintains both women wanted their children with them.

In response to McClatchy News’ request for comment for DHS and ICE on Aug. 11, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “the media and Democrat politicians are force-feeding the public false information that U.S. citizen children are being deported. This is false and irresponsible.”

“Rather than separate their families, ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates,” McLaughlin added. “The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children with them back to Honduras.”

The lawsuit has been brought against Attorney General Pam Bondi, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, ICE and ICE Director Todd Lyons, as well as New Orleans ICE Field Office Director Brian Acuna, the office’s Assistant Field Office Director Scott Ladwig and the office’s former director, Mellissa Harper.

Justice Department spokesperson Natalie Baldassarre declined to comment.

‘Detained and deported U.S. citizens’

After being deported in April, Rosario said in a statement shared in National Immigration Project’s news release that life in Hondorus has been “incredibly hard.”

“I don’t have the resources to care for my children the way they need,” Rosario said.

The morning of April 25, ICE officers are accused of waking Rosario, Romeo and Ruby and forcing them into a van.

They drove them to an airport in the Alexandria area and had them flown to Honduras, the lawsuit says.

With her son still in need of specialized treatment for his cancer, which had spread to his lungs, she has to send Romeo “back and forth” from Honduras to the U.S. for care, without her, according to the complaint.

“Even though she has very limited financial resources, Rosario has already had to pay for flights and travel companions to enable her children to return to the United States for Romeo’s necessary medical appointments,” the complaint says.

Romeo, whose health has worsened, has been temporarily staying in the U.S. for cancer treatment, according to the filing.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare that ICE wrongly arrested, detained and deported Rosario, Romeo and Ruby, as well as Julia, Jade and Janelle, in violation of their constitutional rights.

“This whole situation has been incredibly stressful,” Julia said in a statement shared by the National Immigration Project.

“Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband behind, and that’s been very hard,” she added.

In a statement to McClatchy News, National Immigration Project attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones said “ICE put these families through a series of incredibly traumatizing experiences, taking actions that are completely shocking from a human perspective and illegal even by ICE’s own standards.”

“ICE denied these families the fundamental opportunity to make meaningful choices about the care and custody of their children, and detained and deported U.S. citizens in flagrant violation of its own policy and the law,” Alvarez-Jones added.

The families are seeking an unspecified amount in damages and demand a jury trial.

Days later, his mother and sister made a decision that likely pleased the Trump administration: They followed Colindres out of the United States.

Colindres’ mother, Ada Bell Baquedano Amador, told Spectrum News 1 that she and her two kids had left Honduras to escape rampant violence in the country. In 2023, an immigration judge denied their asylum application and issued a final order of removal. Now, Baquedano Amador was wearing an ankle monitor, and the Trump administration had given her 30 days to leave the United States. With her son gone, she decided to return with her daughter to the country they’d once fled.

“Thank God, this is all going to be over,” Baquedano Amador said.

That sentiment, variations of which have reverberated across the country, is exactly what President Donald Trump wants. There are millions of undocumented people in the United States ― far more than Trump will likely be able to deport on his own. So the administration is working overtime to create a pervasive atmosphere of punishment, uncertainty and fear that it hopes will convince people in the immigration legal system to leave the United States on their own.

The Trump administration has claimed that those who “self-deport” now will get the chance to reenter the U.S. later. (“Self-deport” is not a legal term; two Mexican American satirists invented it over 30 years ago.)

But leaving the country without following specific legal procedures could make it far more difficult to return ― and the administration has consistently failed to inform people in immigration proceedings of crucial details that could affect their future cases.

Meanwhile, the administration has filled airwaves with advertisements urging people to leave the country, plastered jails and courtrooms with misleading information, cut funding for legal aid programs, announced steep penalties for not leaving the country after receiving a removal order, revived a World War II-era law threatening criminal prosecution unless people who aren’t citizens register with the government, and massively ramped up efforts to arrest and jail people during the course of their proceedings. Officials have also used the brutal conditions in immigration detention as self-deportation propaganda.

“DHS has made it abundantly clear that those who are in our country illegally have a choice — they can leave the country voluntarily or be arrested and deported,” a department spokesperson told HuffPost in a statement.

Some of the intimidation and pressure tactics are obvious, like painting immigrants as “foreign invaders,” or having masked agents jumping out of rental trucks and making arrests in immigration court. Others are just coming into view. The New York Times reported last week on a pattern in which immigration officials have arrested and detained parents, separating them from their children and threatening to send the children to shelters unless the parents agree to be deported as a family ― an echo of Trump’s first-term “family separation” policy. And a DHS spokesperson recently pressured DACA recipients to “self-deport,” even though the program offers a temporary protection from deportation.

Voluntary departures from the U.S. have spiked in recent weeks.

The fear tactics and hyperaggressive enforcement, critics say, have also turned the immigration system on its head.

Where the government was once at least marginally concerned with protecting the legal rights of migrants and asylum seekers, it is now actively seeking to subvert those protections, all with the goal of purging the United States of millions of unwanted neighbors as quickly as possible.

“I really feel like the whole purpose behind this is to overwhelm the system at every single point possible,” said Imelda Maynard, director of legal services at Estrella del Paso, which provides free immigration legal services to migrants and refugees in West Texas and New Mexico.

“I really feel like the whole purpose behind this is to overwhelm the system at every single point possible.”

“It’s all working hand-in-hand to try and get people to have no hope, and to just say, ‘This is too hard, I give up.’”

‘And Then Chaos’

The pressure campaign has included a sustained effort to limit legal resources available to people in immigration detention.

Unlike in criminal court, people in immigration proceedings are not guaranteed a lawyer if they can’t afford one, even though legal representation is a key factor in the success of immigration cases.

To help address this gap, the federal government has historically provided funding for efforts like the Legal Orientation Program, in which legal service providers give people in immigration detention information about the immigration system and their legal rights.

Not anymore. The Trump administration terminated these programs in April. Legal aid groups have sued in response, and while some terminations have been halted by judges, children and adults alike are being left without key legal information as their cases proceed.

For Estrella del Paso ― which is among those fighting in court to restore the legal aid programs ― the terminations have ended access to lists of who is being held in local immigration detention centers, as well as eliminated the free, private phone lines detainees once used to consult with the group’s staff in confidence.

With the legal aid programs gone, the Trump administration has pursued an aggressive, often misleading campaign to convince people to simply leave the country, even though this could end up negatively impacting future efforts to reenter the United States.

“You have a cutting off of information first, so that people don’t have access to correct information, followed by disinformation ― and then chaos,” Maynard said.

Case in point: The Trump administration has blanketed detention centers and immigration courtrooms around the country with posters pressuring people to abandon their legal cases and leave the country. Attorneys and other observers say the information on the posters is misleading or downright false.

Advertisement

One version of the poster, a red-and-blue “Warning To Self-Deport,” has been spotted across the country in hallways, detention center libraries, and attached to case files ― “even orders granting relief, like asylum,” according to Amelia Dagen, a staff attorney for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which provides free legal representation to people in the immigration system and participates in impact litigation.

“Individuals who have just won asylum are eventually going to be eligible to apply for green cards, and then for citizenship, and so this messaging about self-deportation doesn’t even apply to them, because they are no longer deportable,” Dagen added. (Like Estrella del Paso, the Amica Center has sued the administration over terminations of legal aid programs in which it participates.)

But the issues with these posters go far beyond who’s receiving them.

Among them: The posters make no mention of the expansive legal rights of undocumented people to remain in the United States. People who fear persecution in their home country are allowed to remain in the United States while they make an asylum case to an immigration judge, for example, or to pursue protections under the international Convention Against Torture.

Advertisement

But the poster doesn’t say any of this. Instead it uses charged language that has no legal significance ― “illegal alien,” “self-deport” ― and absolutist phrases that don’t represent how immigration law actually works. For example, it threatens “immediate deportation” for people who don’t immediately leave on their own, though so-called “expedited removal” only applies in specific circumstances. Similarly, it warns of being “barred from returning,” even though bars to reentering the United States are based on individual circumstances and are often temporary.

What’s more, the poster ignores the fact that simply leaving the United States could have catastrophic legal consequences. If someone leaves the country without resolving their immigration case ― and if they miss a scheduled immigration hearing as a result ― they could receive a deportation order in absentia, which in turn could make them ineligible for certain forms of legal relief in the future, or possibly lead to a bar on reentry. For those who have lived out-of-status in the United States and accrued “unlawful presence,” leaving the country this way could lead to a multiyear bar on coming back to the United States.

One U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “Self-Deportation” webpage does acknowledge this issue, but makes no firm commitment to addressing it.

“If you’re already in proceedings before a Department of Justice immigration judge, leaving may result in a bar to reentry, which means you may not be able to return to the U.S. for a specific period of time,” the page says. “ICE may agree to seek dismissal of removal proceedings if you prove you left the U.S. on your own — and that way, you may be able to avoid getting a final order of removal (and the negative consequences that come with it).”

There are specific ways people can leave the country while protecting their legal rights, including requesting voluntary departure from an immigration judge. But every immigration case is unique, and respondents should ideally work with an attorney to chart their path forward ― something else the poster doesn’t mention.

Instead, it vaguely promotes “future opportunity for legal immigration” if people heed its warning.

Trump’s attacks on legal aid programs, combined with his administration’s aggressive focus on pressuring people to surrender their rights, is a noxious mix, especially for the most vulnerable populations in detention.

When Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) visited Florida’s infamous Krome detention center in June, his staff observed that the center’s Behavioral Health Unit ― “a unit dedicated to assisting individuals with mental health needs” ― had “a flyer in a common room in the unit that asked, ‘Do you want to go home?’ and provided information about how to self-deport.”

Two months prior, the administration had ordered legal service providers to discontinue the National Qualified Representative Program, which for over a decade provided government-funded attorneys for people in immigration proceedings who’ve been found mentally incompetent to represent themselves.

Three weeks ago, a federal district judge ordered the administration to reinstate the policy, writing in a motion granting plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction that without the program, “People who have been adjudicated by immigration courts to be mentally incompetent under existing procedures will be left to do precisely what a court has just found they are not capable of doing—represent themselves in legal proceedings.”

Advertisement

“Although Defendants insist that there are sufficient safeguards in place without the NQRP to mitigate the harm to individuals deemed mentally incompetent, the record provides substantial reason to conclude otherwise,” Judge Amir Ali of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia wrote.

It’s not clear how many people who qualified for that program gave up their legal rights in the intervening months.

‘You May End Up Here’

The Trump administration, particularly Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has been explicit that it is leveraging the terror of languishing behind bars, for months or even years, in order to coerce people into leaving the country.

In March, after the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan men, without charge, to El Salvador’s most infamous prison for indefinite detention where they faced brutal beatings and alleged sexual assault, Noem shot a video from inside the prison.

“I also want everybody to know: If you come to our country illegally, this is one of the consequences you could face,” she said. She called the prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, “one of the tools in our toolkit.”

Then, in May, Noem said, “If you are here illegally, self-deportation is the best, safest and most cost-effective way to leave the United States to avoid arrest.”

Advertisement

And during a July press conference marking the opening of the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center ― the tent city was erected on a Florida Everglades airfield in a matter of days, and is already renowned for its terrible conditions and ostentatious cruelty ― Noem, sitting next to Trump, held up a flier urging undocumented people to leave the country.

“If you don’t,” she warned, “you may end up here.”

Noem and others in the administration have worked hard to make that threat a reality.

The administration has abandoned the Biden-era policy of prioritizing the arrest of serious criminals and recent arrivals, and is instead detaining whoever it can get its hands on, including by arresting people at immigration court, carrying out large-scale raids and pressing people on the street to share information about their immigration status. The number of people in immigration detention hit a record high in June, and the share of those arrested by immigration agents who don’t have any criminal record at all has continued to increase, according to the government’s own data.

“On the ground, people are very concerned and fearful, because even people who know their rights are seeing that ICE is not abiding by the law,” said Jessie Hahn, a senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy organization focused on low-income immigrants. Hahn recounted a know-your-rights training for farmworker advocates and attorneys in California, where federal law enforcement has carried out raids targeting agricultural workers.

“I was getting all these questions in the chat, like, ‘What about when they break the car windows?’ And it gets to a point where I’m not sure what to say to people, other than ‘call the television station,’ because that’s a violation,” Hahn said. “And our ability to hold them accountable for that violation is really important, and yet there are widespread violations happening on the part of ICE right now, in the way that arrests are being conducted.”

At the same time, conditions in detention centers have grown dire, veteran legal observers say.

“The conditions are the worst that we’ve ever seen,” said Denise Noonan Slavin, who spent decades as an immigration judge, including 15 years at the Krome detention center in Miami.

“People are basically being treated like animals, in unsanitary conditions, with no access to medical care, legal counsel or family,” said Slavin, who is now a senior adviser at Americans for Immigrant Justice, a nonprofit law firm involved in several lawsuits against the administration. (The DHS spokesperson told HuffPost the same thing it has told dozens of other outlets since July: “Any claim that there are subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.”)

Slavin said people seem to be “disappearing” for days at a time in ICE’s network of detention centers, and noted that 2025 has been a particularly deadly year for immigration detention, in part because immigration agents are arresting people who in the past likely would have been allowed to live freely.

Isidro Perez, a 75-year-old man who arrived in the United States from Cuba in 1966, was one of those who recently died in ICE custody. Perez served an 18-month prison sentence in 1984 ― 40 years ago ― on cannabis charges, but had lived the intervening decades without incident, The Miami Herald reported, working as a mechanic, and rescuing cats and dogs.

He was arrested by immigration agents at a Key Largo community center in June, and died three weeks later. Perez’s friend and former partner told the Herald he’d called her from detention, describing sleeping on the floor in an overcrowded facility. Yet another man died in ICE custody last week.

In the past, immigration detention was reserved for the tiny fraction of undocumented people seen as a danger to the community, or as flight risks. But over time, through Democratic and Republican presidents, the number of people in detention has grown dramatically. Now, the Trump administration has moved to prohibit bond hearings for people who crossed the border without authorization, a description that applies to millions of people, and one that means people arrested could remain behind bars for months or years as their cases proceed. And billions of dollars in new funding from Congress could explode the number of available detention beds.

Immigration detention is not like federal or state prison; people aren’t sent there after receiving a conviction and a sentence, and it’s not supposed to be a punishment.

Advertisement

But that’s how the administration is treating it. A “Self-Deportation Fact Sheet” warns that if undocumented people don’t leave the country, “ICE will put you in a detention facility. Some people remain in detention for months.”

“People in detention are there indefinitely,” said Silky Shah, executive director of Detention Watch Network. “They don’t have a sentence, they don’t actually know when or if they’ll be released, whether they’ll be released back into the United States, or if they’ll be deported. So there’s just so much deep uncertainty.”

That uncertainty “does a lot to psychologically compel somebody, and they might be like, ‘These conditions are terrible, this is awful, maybe deportation is an answer,’” Shah said.

Because “self-deported” isn’t a legal category, we don’t have precise numbers regarding how many people have voluntarily left the United States. We also don’t know what the Trump administration considers a “self-deportation,” or if they are counting these figures in their overall deportation numbers.

More immigration cases concluded with voluntary departures in June than in any other month for at least 27 years, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, an independent organization that collects and analyzes federal records. Still, this is partially a result of the Trump administration’s fixation on immigration enforcement. Recent months have seen highs for immigration court outcomes overall, and voluntary departures made up a very small portion of the sum of people leaving the country as a result of immigration proceedings.

“Case records from [the Executive Office for Immigration Review] confirm what many have witnessed in courtrooms across the country,” said Adam Sawyer, a data analyst at Relevant Research. “About 3,700 people chose to voluntarily depart in June 2025. That’s more voluntary departures than we have seen in any single month since at least 1998.”

CBP Home, the Trump administration’s app for immigrants to “report their intent to depart,” provides some more insight. The app is a mutation of the Biden-era “CBP One” app, which allowed people to schedule asylum appointments with immigration officials. Now, on the contrary, the “self-deport” posters decorating detention centers and courthouses ― as well as Noem’s television advertisements ― direct people to the app as a first step toward exiting the United States. In exchange, the administration has promised to cover travel costs, waive fines related to immigration offenses, and even give out $1,000 “exit bonuses.”

DHS did not answer questions about how much money has actually been distributed, but a spokesperson pointed to a press conference Noem held Friday, in which she said that “thousands and thousands” of people had used CBP Home. Noem also said “hundreds of thousands of people” ― and later, “over a million people” ― had left the United States on their own accord without necessarily using the CBP Home app. She did not cite any evidence for the claim, other than what she said she’d heard from foreign officials.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in April that “5,000 people have used the app to self-deport as of the start of April,” in the outlet’s words. On June 25, The Atlantic cited an unnamed senior administration official who said “that more than 7,000 people have signed up so far, and of those, more than 3,000 have confirmed departures using the app.” On July 23, CBS News referred to internal government data to report “the Department of Homeland Security has tracked over 13,000 self-deportations since the start of Mr. Trump’s second term.”

“If you go on the CBP Home app and go home now, you will get the chance to come back to the United States legally,” Noem claimed during the “Alligator Alcatraz” press conference. Otherwise, you may end up deported “and never get the chance to come back,” she said. But being deported doesn’t necessarily equate to a lifelong ban on reentry, and there’s nothing to indicate using CBP Home has any affect on someone’s ability to come back to the United States at a later date.

The CBP Home app seemingly does not include any acknowledgement of the rights immigrants could be abandoning if they leave the country the wrong way. A DHS privacy impact assessment makes no mention of sharing any data on voluntary departures with the immigration court system.

And despite Noem’s statement about “the chance to come back” to the U.S. ― and similar, even-less-legible noise from Trump ― the administration has not gone to Congress with any proposal for making legal reentry easier for people who voluntarily leave the country.

The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that studies immigration, summarized the issue in June: “Noem and other administration officials have also said that self-deportees ‘may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,’ which may seem to offer a new immigration pathway or access to a visa. How the administration could accomplish this is unclear, given most unauthorized immigrants are barred from re-entry for multiple years and it is the absence of sufficient legal pathways in the first place that has prompted many to enter illegally or overstay a visa.”

“The CBP Home self-deportation thing is a joke, from a legal perspective,” said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies trends in immigration enforcement.

“The CBP Home self-deportation thing is a joke, from a legal perspective.”

“Your ability to either come back or not come back has nothing to do with CBP Home,” he added. “There are people who are leaving, and they’re going to have a bar [to reentry] and they’re going to technically, legally, ‘abandon’ their applications for relief and get an in-absentia removal order... At the same time, [the administration has] said, ‘Use this app or we’re going to find you and deport you. And you’re never going to be allowed to come back.’ Well, that’s not true, either. That is not an honest, factual statement. Deportation does not automatically result in a permanent bar.”

Several people have also run into trouble after attempting to leave the country without identification documents ― which they either didn’t have to begin with, or were taken by immigration agents in the United States, Noticias Telemundo reported last month.

And though the administration promised to “deprioritize” the detention of people who sign up to leave the country through CBP Home, that’s not guaranteed. Last month, a man who pursued voluntary departure through CBP Home was arrested by immigration agents who falsely accused him of skipping appointments, 285 South, a metro Atlanta immigration-focused publication, reported.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Tuesday released human rights reports for countries worldwide, which eliminate mentions of discrimination faced by LGBTQ people, reduce a previous focus on reproductive rights and criticize restrictions on political speech by U.S. allies in Europe that American officials believe target right-wing politicians.

The reports, which cover 2024 before President Donald Trump took office, reflect his administration’s focus on free speech and protecting the lives of the unborn. However, the reports also offer a glimpse into the administration’s view of dire human rights conditions in some countries that have agreed to accept migrants deported from the United States under Trump's immigration crackdown.

“This year’s reports were streamlined for better utility and accessibility in the field and by partners,” the State Department said.

The congressionally mandated reports in the past have been frequently used for reference and cited by lawmakers, policymakers, academic researchers and others investigating potential asylum claims or looking into conditions in specific countries.

The reports were delayed by the Trump administration's changes

The reports had been due to be released in March. The State Department said in an overview that the delay occurred because the Trump administration decided in March to “adjust” the reports, which had been compiled during the Biden administration. Among other deletions, the reports do not include accounts from individual abuse survivors or witnesses.

“Frequently, eyewitnesses are intimidated or prevented from reporting what they know,” the overview said. “On the other hand, individuals and groups opposed to a government may have incentive to exaggerate or fabricate abuses. In similar fashion, some governments may distort or exaggerate abuses attributed to opposition groups.”

Human rights groups decried the changes in focus and omissions of certain categories of discrimination and potential abuse.

The new reports “reveal a disturbing effort by the Trump administration to purposefully fail to fully capture the alarming and growing attacks on human rights in certain countries around the globe,” Amnesty International said in a statement.

The reports do follow previous practices in criticizing widespread human rights abuses in China, Iran, North Korea and Russia.

Laying out the poor human rights records of countries accepting migrant deportees

Although such deportations did not begin until after Trump took office, the reports, with one notable exception, detail general poor human rights conditions in many of the countries that have agreed to accept migrants, even if they are not citizens of that nation.

The exception is El Salvador, which was the first of several countries in Latin America and Africa to agree to accept non-citizen migrant deportees from the U.S. Despite claims from rights advocates to the contrary, the report about the country says “there were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses” in El Salvador in 2024 and that “the government took credible steps to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses.”

Human rights groups have accused authorities of abuses, including at a notorious prison where many migrants are sent.

However, for Eswatini — a small country in Africa formerly known as Swaziland — South Sudan and Rwanda, the reports paint a grimmer picture. All have agreed to accept third-country deportees from the United States.

In all three countries, the reports noted “significant human rights issues included credible reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings, torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment … serious restrictions on freedom of expression and media freedom, prohibiting independent trade unions or significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”

Those governments “did not take credible steps or action to identify and punish officials who committed human rights abuses,” the reports said.

Singling out the treatment of white South Africans

South Africa was also singled out for its human rights situation “significantly worsening.” The report pointed to unfair treatment of white Afrikaners following the signing of major land reforms that the Trump administration has said discriminate against that minority, which ran the country’s apartheid government.

That system brutally enforced racial segregation, which oppressed the Black majority, for 50 years before ending in 1994.

With the signing of that law in December, the report said that “South Africa took a substantially worrying step towards land expropriation of Afrikaners and further abuses against racial minorities in the country.”

It also said the government “did not take credible steps to investigate, prosecute and punish officials who committed human rights abuses, including inflammatory racial rhetoric against Afrikaners and other racial minorities, or violence against racial minorities.”

This year, the administration admitted as refugees some groups of white Afrikaners.

Accusations of European allies restricting right-wing speech

The reports take issue with what the Trump administration believes are restrictions on free speech imposed against generally right-wing voices in the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The reports use identical language to say that human rights conditions in each of the three NATO allies “worsened during the year.”

The executive summaries for each of the three reports say “significant human rights issues included credible reports of serious restrictions on freedom of expression, including enforcement of or threat of criminal or civil laws in order to limit expression; and crimes, violence, or threats of violence motivated by antisemitism.”

These governments have rejected such assertions that have been made by senior U.S. officials, including Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Targeting Brazil over allegations of restricting Bolsonaro's speech

Similar freedom-of-speech issues were raised in Brazil, which has more recently provoked Trump’s ire by prosecuting his ally — former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro — and led to the imposition of massive U.S. tariffs and sanctions against Brazil’s Supreme Court chief justice.

“The human rights situation in Brazil declined during the year,” the report said. “The courts took broad and disproportionate action to undermine freedom of speech and internet freedom by blocking millions of users’ access to information on a major social media platform in response to a case of harassment.”",https://7b1de02a7bcf9c1df487-6849f9022b05f72b83236695aa4e9a0a.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/uploads/ap/2025/1297380/image-0.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 20:57:02.031669

Several sources involved in the consultation process, some of whom have requested anonymity as the bill’s wording is not finalised, have said that roundtable discussions in April prompted concessions from the Allan government.

This included dropping plans for a full ban on “face coverings” at protests, which was planned to carry a fine of up to $2,000. Instead, it is understood the government will propose penalties only when a person wearing a face covering is refusing to cooperate with police or believed to be committing a criminal act.

A senior Victorian government source said such a measure, combined with anti-vilification laws set to take effect in September, would allow authorities to “unmask” neo-Nazis, who marched through Melbourne’s CBD in face coverings at the weekend.

Anastasia Radievska, protest rights campaigner at the Australian Democracy Network said the shift was the result of “broad opposition” to the plan, including by human rights, legal, faith, First Nations and disability rights groups.

“The prohibition on masks has serious impacts on community health, the participation of people with disabilities, the participation of victim-survivors of domestic and sexual violence in protest. It’s not an appropriate way to address the problems of racist violence, which is what the laws were advertised as tackling,” Radievska said.

“These groups have worked to ensure that any restrictions that are introduced – although we’ve argued that Victoria doesn’t need new protest restrictions – are appropriately targeted and don’t impact on the participation of these vulnerable groups in protests – and actually target radicalised violence and hate.”

An outright ban on attachment devices such as chains, glue or locks, which are commonly used in climate protests, is also expected to be narrowed and will apply only when there is a community safety risk.

This would mean non-violent acts such as those committed by Zelda D’Aprano – who is immortalised in bronze outside Trades Hall after she chained herself to a government building to protest against the lack of equal pay for women – would not be affected.

The proposal for “safe access” areas around places of worship, which was also floated by the government in December, has been described by several stakeholders as “dead in the water”. But this was disputed by the government source who said it was still being considered, though was proving “incredibly complex”.

However, a ban on the display of terrorist symbols at protests is likely to proceed, despite reservations about how “terrorist organisation” could be defined.

Stakeholders were initially told the changes would be introduced when parliament resumed after the midwinter break but the timeline has now shifted to the end of the year.

The premier, Jacinta Allan, told reporters on Tuesday the laws would not be aimed at protests but at extremist behaviour.

“People who are taking the opportunity to engage in extreme and dangerous behaviour under the guise of participating in a protest – that’s what the new laws will be cracking down on., she said.

It comes after Victoria’s new police chief, Mike Bush, ruled out a permit system for protests in a series of interviews last month, noting they had not been effective in other states.

Labor’s rank-and-file has also pushed back, with state conference carrying a motion earlier this month calling on the government to abandon its proposed changes.

“Inconvenience is not a form of violence,” it said, noting several wins of the labour movement were only possible as a result.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d372fec67c9d687ef6a2f72683295cd62599723c/337_685_3121_2498/master/3121.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb053f1738b22f05d3867b20f3e5e693",N,,2025-08-12 16:56:42.430204

Cotrin said “there’s no way” Epstein would have killed himself, which is what prison officials say happened in his jail cell at a Manhattan prison in 2019. Cotrin worked for Epstein for 18 years, and said in all that time he never witnessed any abuse.

Cotrin, along with Epstein’s brother, also said there are forensic inconsistencies in the report claiming Epstein took his own life. A review by the FBI and the Department of Justice ruled out murder.

Media Miss by the right: Investigation reveals hundreds of human rights abuses in US immigrant detention centers

An investigation out of Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office uncovered more than 500 credible reports of human rights abuses at immigrant detention centers across the U.S.

Investigators reportedly found evidence of both physical and sexual abuse, and that children and pregnant women were among the victims.

Reports show some detainees claimed they were denied medical care and that they were held in overcrowded rooms with only one bathroom. Detention officials also reportedly used flash-bang grenades when a toilet was flooded in protest.

The investigation also found some children, who were U.S. citizens and had serious medical conditions like cancer, were held in these detention centers alongside their parents.

The October session will feature 10 arguments over five days, while the November session will feature nine over five days.

Both sessions include important cases. On Oct. 15, the court will hear oral arguments in a Louisiana case that could limit the federal Voting Rights Act, and on Oct. 7 it will hear a challenge to Colorado’s ban on “conversion therapy.” In November, there will be oral argument in a case involving the methods used to assess a defendant’s claim that he is intellectually disabled and therefore cannot be executed.

When the court hears argument in Louisiana v. Callais, it will be the second round of arguments in the case, which comes to the court as a challenge to the congressional map that the Louisiana Legislature adopted in 2024. That map, which contained a second majority-Black district, followed a federal court’s ruling that a 2022 map, which contained only one majority-Black district, violated Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which prohibits election practices that result “in the denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.” A group of voters describing themselves as “non-African American” went to federal court, where they argued that the 2024 map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander – that is, it relied too heavily on race.

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case in March, but it did not issue an opinion in the case. Instead, on the last day before the court’s summer recess began, it announced that the case would be reargued in the fall. On Aug. 1, the justices instructed the litigants in the case to file briefs discussing whether the creation of a second majority-Black district in the 2024 map violates the Constitution – a question that at least one voting-rights expert suggested could call into question the constitutionality of Section 2 of the VRA.

On Oct. 7, the justices will hear argument in Chiles v. Salazar, a challenge to Colorado’s ban on “conversion therapy” – therapy to “convert” an individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity. A federal appeals court in Denver upheld the law, reasoning that it regulated the health-care profession rather than therapists’ speech.

And in Hamm v. Smith, on Nov. 4, the justices will consider how and whether courts should assess a defendant’s claim that he cannot be executed because he is intellectually disabled when he has taken multiple IQ tests.

Both the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Friday told federal union representatives that the agencies would be canceling all collective bargaining agreements, effective immediately.

USCIS and FEMA are ending the use of office space and resources for union activities, revoking official time, and halting grievance and arbitration processes, according to emails viewed by Federal News Network. The two agencies said federal union representatives are expected to return to other work duties full-time.

Neither USCIS nor FEMA responded to Federal News Network’s requests for comment on their decisions to terminate the union contracts.

The cancellations at USCIS impact union contracts with both the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council.

AFGE Local 4060, which represents FEMA employees, said it would continue to fight the Trump administration in court.

“This is an unprecedented attack on the rights of federal workers,” AFGE Local 4060 officials wrote in an email to bargaining unit members, obtained by Federal News Network. “AFGE will continue to litigate the case in district court, confident in our legal position. We remain committed to opposing the government’s appeal and will fight for both preliminary and permanent relief for all AFGE members.”

A few other agencies have also moved forward with ending their collective bargaining agreements. USCIS and FEMA’s announcements come after the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Environmental Protection Agency similarly terminated their union contracts and canceled all use of official time for union representatives.

The agencies’ actions follow an appeals court decision that allowed the Trump administration to move forward with implementing President Donald Trump’s March 27 executive order to terminate union activities at most agencies, while the litigation remains ongoing.

Trump’s order cited a narrow legal provision that allows the president to suspend collective bargaining for national security reasons. Following the order, multiple federal unions sued the administration, arguing that it targeted federal unions that had spoken up against the administration, using speech that is protected under the First Amendment.

But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that based on the language of the executive order and a White House fact sheet, Trump would have taken the action to cancel union activities anyway — regardless of what the federal unions had said.

AFGE National President Everett Kelley has vowed to continue to fight in court over Trump’s anti-union actions, and believes AFGE “will ultimately prevail.” The Washington Post first reported the news of USCIS and FEMA ending their collective bargaining agreements.

Inside Higher Ed analyzed more than 40 lawsuits related to higher education that were filed against the Trump administration. More than a dozen cases contested grant cuts, making that the most-litigated issue before the courts. The second-most frequent theme of litigation was the reduction in force at the U.S. Department of Education. Lawsuits have also challenged federal crackdowns on international students and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.

District courts have ruled against the Trump administration in nearly two-thirds of the lawsuits, Inside Higher Ed found. And at the appellate level, seven rulings went against the Trump administration, while only two reversed lower court injunctions blocking grant terminations related to anti-DEI executive action. White House officials have accused judges who block administration policy of overstepping their authority.

The Trump administration nonetheless has notched wins in a smaller number of cases to reach the Supreme Court to date. Justices have overturned three lower court rulings that cleared the way for mass layoffs at the Department of Education and cuts to teacher training grants, Inside Higher Ed reported.

Still, the publication’s analysis shows that much of the litigation is yet to be resolved. Almost a quarter of the 40 cases remain undecided, and where a district judge has issued a ruling, 18 cases have been appealed. Of those, nine cases await an appeals court decision. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has only ruled in three of the five higher education-related cases that have reached the court.

Litigation has become a major strategy of groups opposing the administration’s efforts to overhaul colleges and universities since President Donald Trump’s return to office. Professional associations, including the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, as well as Democratic state attorneys general, including those in California, have led many of the lawsuits opposing the Trump administration’s policy.

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell wrote in an email to Inside Higher Ed that state attorneys general will “continue to hold the line because our children and the future of our democracy depend on it.”

There are obviously a variety of reasons why the right wing press’ targeting of judges and putting them in danger of violence is problematic. One of those issues is how poor the journalists’ understanding is of their subject matter. I have written a couple of times now about the Palestinian family who have been turned into a political football.

I have explained that the process they used to make their application was the one required by the Home Office. Yet why let the facts get in the way of a piece attacking an Upper Tribunal judge who made one of the decisions in that case, as the Mail on Sunday did yesterday (do not go find this and give them any clicks unless you are going to submit a complaint!).

The piece again focussed on the fact that the family had applied under the Ukrainian scheme, before then also wrongly attributing the recent High Court decision in the family’s case against the Foreign Office to the same Upper Tribunal judge (the judgment was bizarrely referred to in the paper as the judge having a “public spat” with the Foreign Secretary). I would be embarrassed to publish an article that rife with errors, but perhaps I am being generous by assuming that inaccurate coverage of migration issues is based on a misunderstanding rather than deliberate misinformation.

There are plenty of Upper Tribunal judges out there making decisions that would delight the right. I have seen cases where evidence has been ignored and people returned to danger, yet balance is clearly not what they are after here.

On Free Movement, we covered the new UK/France returns agreement with an explainer on the treaty, new appendix to the immigration rules and caseworker guidance. We have a lot more information about the part of the scheme that will bring people to the UK, including the expression of interest application form. The team at Refugee Legal Support also gave their perspective as an organisation working with people in northern France.

Also last week, the July roundup podcast is out and there were a couple of appeals against SIAC decisions, one on deprivation and one on costs. Today we published a really useful explainer on how to change employer if someone is on a skilled worker visa.

Last week Dallas residents asked the city council whether the city would opt into ICE's 287(g) Program, which allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Johnson — a Democrat whose district includes Dallas, Collin and Denton counties — sent a letter to Chief of Police Daniel Comeaux Friday asking for a detailed explanation of the Dallas Police Department's current policy regarding the program.

In the letter, Johnson said the program has resulted in the detention and deportation of individuals without criminal records.

""These instances raise critical civil rights concerns and can damage trust between immigrant communities and local police, particularly when reports surface of individuals being detained without clear identification or justification,"" she said.

KERA reached out to the Dallas Police Department for comment and will update this story with a response.

Johnson set a deadline of Aug. 21 to receive a written response from Comeaux answering six questions related to the police department's immigration policy.

The questions are:

Has your department entered into any Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) or informal agreements with ICE or other DHS agencies?

What is the criteria used to determine when and how DPD engages with ICE or assists in immigration enforcement?

Does your department collect or share immigration status information during routine policing?

What is the department’s process for ensuring transparency and accountability in federal partnerships?

Are DPD officers ever stationed or detailed to work alongside ICE officers, and if so, in what capacity?

Has your department received funding, equipment, or other resources from ICE or DHS this year? If so, for what purposes?

Comeaux has faced criticism after saying his department would fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in a Fox News interview earlier this year.

""If there's a federal agency that's doing an operation and they need our assistance, we'll be there to help them,"" he said, ""as long as they're doing it by the law and doing it with respect.""

He later clarified the department's policy, saying his comments were specifically about those with felony warrants, but reiterated the department would continue to assist ""federal partners.""

A police spokesperson told KERA News last week the commissioner's position and the department's approach to immigration issues had not changed.

So, while it doesn’t look like the political theater behind Trump Burger is going to work in Beainy’s favor, nothing is a guarantee.
Beainy claims he purchased Hawa’s 50 percent stake for $65,000, and Hawa, who started the original Trump Burger in Bellville, says this is untrue and has filed a countersuit seeking $1 million in damages.
Earlier this year, Eater visited the Houston restaurant and walked away quite unimpressed.
The final verdict came down to Trump Burger serving as a refuge for someone who “supports [the Trump] administration’s many compromising decisions.” Apparently, the restaurant can serve as a refuge for those people — just not the country.","The co-owner of restaurants dedicated to feverish support of President Donald Trump is facing the brunt of one of the MAGA movement’s most beloved policies — deportation.

Roland Mehrez Beainy, a Lebanese immigrant who began operating the Trump Burgers mini-chain in 2020, has been accused of overstaying his visitor’s visa, which expired in February 2024, according to the Guardian. As a result, the 28-year-old was arrested by immigration officials in May.

Beainy has also been accused of having an assault charge on his record and orchestrating a fake marriage in order to gain permanent residency — members of his own family called it a “sham designed to game the system,” according to the New Republic. The Department of Homeland Security says there’s no proof that Beainy and the woman he allegedly tried to secure legal status through ever lived under the same roof.

In a statement provided to Fox, ICE said that, under the Trump administration, it’s “committed to restore integrity to our nation’s immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have.”

Beainy is calling the allegations against him “90 percent untrue” and has his immigration hearing scheduled for November 18, 2025.

So, while it doesn’t look like the political theater behind Trump Burger is going to work in Beainy’s favor, nothing is a guarantee. Trump is known to help friends and supporters, even going as far as pardoning the rapper Kodak Black, who was granted release when he was serving time for making a false statement to buy a firearm.

Ever the busy man, Beainy is fighting immigration proceedings while still owning Trump Burgers in Flatonia, Kemah, and Houston, and is also embroiled in legal battles over the chainlet. There’s one involving the landlord at the Kemah location, where there’s an accusation of an unlawful takeover. Beainy is also battling with Iyad Abuelhawa (also known as Eddie Hawa) over who actually owns what stake in the restaurant. Beainy claims he purchased Hawa’s 50 percent stake for $65,000, and Hawa, who started the original Trump Burger in Bellville, says this is untrue and has filed a countersuit seeking $1 million in damages.

Earlier this year, Eater visited the Houston restaurant and walked away quite unimpressed. “The chargrilled burger patties are thick but bland, topped with a waxy cheese that lacks any memorable flavor,” says former regional editor Brittany Britto Garley. The atmosphere is painted as gauche and kind of creepy. Britto Garley spotted a little boy wearing a shirt that read “Daddy’s Home,” in reference to Trump’s re-election. The final verdict came down to Trump Burger serving as a refuge for someone who “supports [the Trump] administration’s many compromising decisions.” Apparently, the restaurant can serve as a refuge for those people — just not the country.

The Hudson Correctional Facility, which has been closed since at least 2014, was previously operated by the GEO Group, which runs the Aurora detention facility.
If it serves as an ICE processing facility with that bed count, ICE will have nearly doubled its detention capacity in the state.
The agency was seeking to add roughly 1,000 new detention beds in the Denver operational area, which includes both Colorado and Wyoming.
According to state records, the Hudson facility was built in 2009 on 50 acres and has just over 300,000 square feet inside its buildings.","Federal immigration authorities intend to open a second Colorado detention center in Hudson — about 30 miles northeast of Denver — members of the state’s congressional delegation were told this week.

Through a spokeswoman, U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen confirmed to The Denver Post that she and other lawmakers were told of the plans for Hudson during a visit to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora on Monday morning.

In a proposal sent to ICE earlier this year, Highlands REIT, a Chicago-based real estate investment trust, offered the shuttered private prison it owns in Hudson as a potential new detention center, according to records obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union. The Hudson Correctional Facility, which has been closed since at least 2014, was previously operated by the GEO Group, which runs the Aurora detention facility.

When it was open, the prison had a capacity of 1,250 beds. If it serves as an ICE processing facility with that bed count, ICE will have nearly doubled its detention capacity in the state. The Aurora facility is contracted to hold up to 1,360 people.

Neither GEO nor Highlands REIT responded to messages seeking comment Monday. Spokespeople for ICE also did not return emails seeking more information.

But agency officials had previously signaled that Hudson was a likely option. Robert Guadian, the head of ICE’s Denver field office, told Fox31 in April that the agency was in talks with GEO to open a facility in the town of roughly 1,600 people.

That was before the competing submittals were made public in July by the ACLU. The former Hudson Correctional Facility was one of six potential sites offered to ICE earlier this year, according to records the ACLU obtained through a records request.

The agency was seeking to add roughly 1,000 new detention beds in the Denver operational area, which includes both Colorado and Wyoming.

Immigration arrests have surged in Colorado so far this year, and congressional Republicans steered $45 billion to ICE last month to build new detention centers as part of President Donald Trump’s tax bill.

Bryce Lange, Hudson’s town manager, told The Post that he wasn’t aware of any confirmed plans as of late Monday afternoon. He said government officials had not provided any information to him or officials in other towns and counties that were home to potential detention centers.

A spokeswoman for Weld County said county leaders were also not aware if the site had been chosen. In a statement, Gov. Jared Polis spokesman Eric Maruyama said that ICE has “not shared any details of plans to expand with the governor’s office.” Maruyama said Polis called on ICE to be more transparent with its operations in the state.

His powerful “call to conscience” underscored the moral and religious limits for police agents of the state, and that one’s conscience requires acting accordingly.

Romero’s courage moved millions of people, who proclaimed him a saint after his assassination. The time has come for America’s clergy to rise to that level of courage and issue a “call to conscience” to ICE agents in their congregations that they consider resigning their jobs because of ICE’s ongoing human rights abuses.

No one disputes the need for a fair immigration system that meets U.S. constitutional standards and international human rights principles and, for Christians, is consistent with the Gospel. Nor can one dispute that ICE operations abuse, and are repugnant to, these norms, for which ICE makes no apologies.

Roving patrols of ICE agents with masked faces have seized thousands of people, young and old, across the country, at home, work, driving, and on sidewalks, and shoved them into unmarked SUVs. They have upended nursing home and home care staff, disrupted crop harvesting, and arrest people near schools and churches. Parents are suddenly ripped from their children, and children yanked from foster homes. Asylum-seekers are imprisoned when they show up for hearings—no due process, just random deportation to countries foreign to them.

Countless videos attest to ICE’s inhumane conduct. The Guardian published a video of ICE using a stun gun on a worker and slamming him to the ground. When his companion, a citizen, says, “Don’t resist” to diffuse the situation, they arrest him for interfering with his friend’s arrest. The agents are laughing. One says, “They’re starting to resist more now,” to which another replies: “We’re going to end up shooting some of them.” The callousness of that flippant remark, unrebuked by ICE, is telling and frightening; it reflects ICE’s culture.

Almost 57,000 people are incarcerated in ICE detention centers nationwide. Human rights reports and the media paint a brutal picture of cruelty. “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Everglades, which officials inaugurated with disgusting mirth, is particularly inhumane. Neither it nor other centers meet the standards for U.S. jails and prisons: unsanitary conditions, denial of access to lawyers, family, and clergy; overcrowding; scarce medical attention. Deaths have occurred.

ICE agents cannot justify their actions as “just following orders.” The Nuremberg trials of Nazis rejected that rationalization. Under international law, “just following orders” never justifies being part of the machinery of human rights abuse; nor is it ever consistent with the Gospel of Jesus.

Some Catholic bishops are speaking out, Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville for one. The presiding U.S. Episcopal bishop, Sean Rowe, has declared, “Once the church of presidents, the Episcopal Church must now be an engine of resistance.” Texas Episcopal Bishop Andy Doyle as pointed in the direction of the Confessing Church, which formed in 1934 Germany to oppose the regime’s human rights violations when other church leaders were subservient to Hitler’s anti-Jewish nationalist agenda.

Verbal remonstrations by bishops are good but inadequate. Some bishops have attended detention hearings in solidarity with immigrants; but, of the country’s 500 Catholic and Episcopal bishops, that number is infinitesimal.

People like the Dorothea Project moms are imploring the bishops to do more. They need to take the Archbishop Romero step and issue a “call to conscience,” suggesting to ICE employees that the time has come for them to resign their positions and find other employment. The more resignations of conscience, the quicker humane immigration reform.

Bishops must bring the moral issue to the fore. Cautiousness in this situation is perilous and harmful. They must pose the tough question of ICE agents who profess Christianity: how do you square this maltreatment of people’s human rights and their dignity with your conscience and the Gospel? How can you work for a police agency that so badly and cruelly treats people who have lived good and honest lives after escaping persecution, terror, or sheer economic necessity? How can you again endanger them and return them to where they had to flee?

As Jesus put it, no person can serve two masters.

MSF calls on governments in the region to shift away from harsh deterrence tactics and towards humane migration and protection policy.

Mexico City, 12 August 2025 - In its first six months in office, the current US Administration has implemented the most restrictive and dehumanising migration policy seen in years, abandoning hundreds of thousands of people hoping to seek asylum in the US and leaving them stranded in danger in Mexico and Central America, says a new report by the international medical humanitarian organisation Médecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders (MSF).

The report highlights how the US government’s policies and rhetoric criminalising migration have echoed throughout Latin America. MSF calls on all governments across the Americas to renounce deterrence and abandonment tactics and instead implement humane policies that ensure access to asylum, medical care, and protection along the Latin American migration corridor.

“These policies, combined with the drastic reduction of aid and the humanitarian footprint along the migration route, have had a devastating impact on the wellbeing of people trying to seek safety,” says Franking Frías, Deputy Manager of Operations for MSF in Mexico and Central America. “This suffering is deliberately made invisible, hidden by the inaccurate narrative that migration has stopped. But every day, we see the consequences in patients who are living with untreated injuries, trauma from sexual violence, and severe mental health conditions that make their daily life impossible.”

Released today, the report, 'Unwelcome. The devastating human impact of migration policy changes in the United States, Mexico and Central America', showcases how recent policy changes have eroded the right to seek asylum and left many migrants and asylum seekers stranded with nowhere safe to go, trapping them in a cycle of physical, emotional, and institutional violence. The report is based on analysis of MSF medical data and in-depth interviews with patients of many nationalities in various stages of migration, and with MSF staff working along the migration route in Panama, Honduras, Guatemala, and Mexico.

Since late January, the US government has closed the main avenues to request asylum and protection—including shutting down the CBP One application and ending humanitarian parole— heightened security at the border with Mexico, and deported people in unconscionable conditions, including deporting people in shackles, sending deportees to third countries, and separating families.

“We feel abandoned and unprotected,” says a Honduran woman who is stuck in Reynosa, in northern Mexico. “We never wanted to enter the United States illegally. We ask for benevolence for cases like mine: mothers who have been waiting for a long time with children, who want to give them a better life. We have already gone through a process; we already had a right. We have been victims of scams, the cartels, we have been deceived, we are traumatized.” The woman had secured an appointment through CBP One for three days after the app was shut down and all appointments were cancelled.

On top of this, several countries across the Latin American migration corridor have also strengthened deterrence measures. Law enforcement agents and immigration authorities in the region have forcefully returned migrants, restricted people’s movements, and dismantled urban camps where people with nowhere else to go were sheltering. They have closed migration reception stations, dissolved gatherings in public spaces, carried out raids, arbitrarily detained people, increased patrolling, and complicated and reduced access to bureaucratic procedures—including asylum processes.

“We were held captive for 60 days,” says a Venezuelan man stranded in Ciudad Juárez, northern Mexico. “[Criminals] hit me on the head, pulled a tooth, and shoved a gun in my mouth to take pictures and call one of my sons in the United States. My son and son-in-law paid the ransom, and we were released. The plan was to go to the United States. The rest of my family is there waiting for us. But with this US government, we don't know what to do.”

Carmen López, MSF Manager for Mobile Health Activities, shares the story of a Venezuelan patient she assisted in Guatemala. The man and his son were deported earlier this year from the US, despite having entered through CBP One: “First, they were held in a detention centre in the United States separately for about 20 days. Later, they were deported to Mexico. During the transfer to the Mexican authorities, his backpack containing personal items and savings was stolen. They were left in Villahermosa [a town in southeastern Mexico]. They had to start their return [to Venezuela] without money. He was very frustrated because he had gone through the legal process, and it had all been a lie in the end.”

For many, returning to their country is not an option, either because of a lack of financial resources or fear of what they fled in the first place—such as, the political and economic crises in Venezuela or Cuba, rife violence in Haiti, conflict in peripheral regions of Colombia, or threats from criminal groups and a lack of opportunities in Ecuador and other Central American countries. “We were given a 24-hour ultimatum to pay an amount of money we didn’t have,” says a Salvadoran woman in Tapachula, southern Mexico. “Migrating was neither a political choice nor a search for better economic opportunities. It was an urgent decision to save our lives.”

With seeking asylum at the United States southern border now close to impossible, tens of thousands of people are seeing Mexico as the only alternative option. But MSF teams witness how asylum procedures in Mexico have become lengthier and more complex in several cities. In parallel, violence perpetrated by organised crime groups and other actors remains alarming, including kidnappings, extortion, robberies, sexual violence, and labour exploitation. “Violence is much more evident now,” says Ricardo Santiago, who coordinated MSF programmes in northern and southern Mexico. “Before—given the large number of people on the move—some would be spared, whereas today most of the people I've spoken with have been victims of violence. There is no escape.”

MSF teams in the region, particularly in Mexico, have seen an increase in psychological needs among patients and a high proportion of people with severe mental health issues despite a reduction of medical activities since the slowing of migration flows. In recent years, many patients have had an obvious need for mental health support because of the recurrent violence suffered and the precarious living conditions endured along the migration route. But on top of these experiences, people now face uncertainty provoked by the drastic and numerous policy changes, which trigger despair once people realize that all they endured to reach the US was in vain.

“The symptoms are increasingly intense,” says Lucía Samayoa, MSF Project Coordinator in Tapachula. “They're living under a lot of pressure and stress. Many people require pharmacological treatment, with a more structured, longer therapeutic process.”

Moreover, stranded migrants and asylum seekers have dispersed, becoming more invisible —due to fear of prosecution, detention, and deportation in the midst of a stigmatising environment, in which they are repeatedly labelled as criminals.

“Today, migrants are less accessible and the humanitarian system is unprepared to effectively address their vulnerabilities and complex needs,” says Frías. “Behind every policy is its impact on real people: survivors of torture, families escaping danger, and children navigating border crossings alone. Their health, safety, and dignity are legal and moral obligations. All governments in the region must act now to protect, not punish, people in search of safety, and create safe immigration pathways.”

“The immigration courts have proven so many people to be U.S. citizens after ICE has arrested them.","The immigration court system was already strained when Donald Trump took office in January. Since then, he’s taken dramatic steps to undermine it even further.

Over the last seven months, Trump has fired immigration judges, weakened due process rights for those facing deportation and pressured judges to rule in the administration’s favor.

Some of those fired judges, immigration attorneys and other experts say the end result will be that these courts are either destroyed or left so dysfunctional that they can’t effectively guarantee basic rights.

Trump and his team have made clear that they value speed in immigration courts as agents try to meet an unrealistic goal of 1 million deportations in a year. After Republicans in Congress set aside a historic amount of money for deportations, border czar Tom Homan said he wanted to raise the 3,000 daily arrest quota to 7,000.

In theory, people facing deportation should have a chance to make their case before a judge, with proceedings taking months or years in some cases. But now, with a little more than 600 immigration judges, down from roughly 735, they are getting less time and ability to do that.

Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney based in Georgia, says that Trump is intentionally “overwhelming” immigration courts.

“It appears what they’re doing is moving forward with a plan to eliminate due process and immigration judges,” Kuck said. “The due process system created over the last 50 years is frustrating their goal of deporting a million people because it’s physically impossible to have a million cases go through immigration court in one year.”

Trump has cast doubt on the need for due process for undocumented immigrants.

Trump himself has even cast doubt on the need for due process for undocumented immigrants.

“We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,” the president said in April, claiming it would require “hundreds of thousands” of hearing.

Lawyers such as Kuck and several former immigration judges told me the Trump administration is undermining immigration courts across the board, from firing immigration judges to detaining more immigrants, leading to a backlog in courts. The result is that a long troubled system is now near a breaking point.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson argued that new funding approved for the court system in Trump’s megabill will help with the backlog.

“There are currently efforts underway to hire additional immigration judges,” Jackson said. “Illegal aliens going through removal proceedings receive more than sufficient amounts of due process — anyone suggesting otherwise is lying. Any illegal alien who wishes to avoid deportations can self-deport.”

Some $3.3 billion in funding was approved for immigration courts in the megabill, but the law also placed a cap of 800 immigration judges — a number considered far too small to efficiently process the nearly 4 million pending immigration cases. Most experts say the system would need 2,000 to 3,000 judges to process the cases efficiently and fairly.

That same bill guaranteed some $45 billion for immigration detention, and nearly $30 billion for enforcement, including the hiring and training of some 10,000 new ICE agents

Immigration judges are technically employees of the executive branch under the Justice Department, but for the past roughly 50 years, judges have operated with independence and decided cases without interference.

But that norm is being destroyed, say many immigration attorneys and several former immigration judges.

Recently, ICE and the Justice Department declared millions of undocumented immigrants are not eligible for bond release from detention as their cases are processed — a change to nearly 40 years of precedent followed by immigration judges to guarantee due process. Historically, denial of bond was applied to people who recently crossed the border, not longtime residents regardless of documentation status. The Homeland Security Department did not respond to a request for comment about the change.

Victor Nieblas, a longtime immigration attorney in Los Angeles and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said denial of bond is a tactic to increase deportations.

“The longer you’re detained, the easier it’ll be for you to decide ‘I’d rather go home,’ and so you sign a voluntary return or a voluntary deportation,” he said.

Since January, roughly 106 immigration judges have either been fired by the Trump administration, resigned, or were transferred to another part of the Justice Department, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.

One fired judge, who requested anonymity fearing retaliation from the administration, said the cuts showed the Trump administration wants immigration courts to “collapse.”

“It’s never been like this before,” said the former judge, who had served for years under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Jennifer Peyton, a recently fired assistant chief immigration judge in Chicago, said the administration is pressuring understaffed judges to speed up their decisions.

Judges have been told they should decide each case within a single hearing block, which runs from two to three hours.

Instead of taking time to conduct research on the legal questions in a case, judges have been told they should decide each case within a single hearing block, which runs from two to three hours.

“You’re creating an environment for the remaining judges where I’m sure everyone’s looking over their shoulder, worried they’ll be fired,” Peyton said. “They are definitely trying to make the system stop working.”

George Pappas, a Boston immigration judge fired last month, said the “drumbeat” started in February. He was told by his superiors to “be careful” with how he ruled and speed up dismissals of pending cases, which would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest an undocumented immigrant and put the person in an expedited removal without a hearing.

“That direct pressure undermined my ability to rule neutrally,” Pappas said. It all added “a layer of self policing,” he said, saying that would lead to a “total eradication” of the current system.

A Justice Department official did not answer questions about the accusations leveled by immigration judges who were fired by the Trump administration. Instead, the DOJ official accused the Biden administration of pressuring immigration judges to make certain decisions, and said the Trump administration is looking to hire judges who will expeditiously reduce the backlog of cases.

After the passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, the earlier version of immigration courts required that cases be decided by “special inquiry officers” who were not required to be lawyers, as they are now. In 1973, immigration judges were created by regulation.

Asked whether the administration wants to change the required qualifications for immigration judges, both the White House and the Justice Department declined to answer.

If the system reverts, hiring standards could be changed and loyal Trump officials could become judge and jury, Kuck said.

But to do so would likely set off legal challenges. And immigration policy experts warn a broken due process system for undocumented immigrants will impact Americans as well.

“Getting rid of due process is a threat to everyone in the United States who’s here legally or who is a citizen,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies for the CATO Institute. “The immigration courts have proven so many people to be U.S. citizens after ICE has arrested them. In terms of your rights, it matters that we have a system for reviewing whether someone is entitled to be in the United States or not.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-donald-trump-vl-1210p-2b01c1.jpg",N,,2025-08-12 17:57:08.261033

When it comes to the United States’ immigration policy, we’re beginning to see how bad things can get.

A story this week by the Idaho Statesman’s Carolyn Komatsoulis showed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are upping their game in Idaho, smashing a Meridian man’s car window to detain him.

At the same time, Idaho State Police have signed an agreement with ICE to join a “Task Force Model,” which uses racial profiling to let local police question people on the street about their immigration status, according to another Idaho Statesman story. Even though Gov. Brad Little said his orders to the State Police were limited to specific duties, the agreement still gives Idaho officers the power to interrogate anyone believed to be an immigrant, to arrest immigrants under certain conditions and to transport immigrants to detention facilities, according to the Statesman story.

Civil rights organizations are sounding the alarm over ICE’s obvious violations of constitutional rights, including U.S. citizens getting caught up in mass arrests and deportations, inhumane conditions for immigrants in federal prisons and unconstitutional raids.

Not to mention deporting detainees — without proper adjudication as to whether they are in the country without legal authorization — to foreign countries, including a brutal torture prison in El Salvador and the dangerous and inhumane establishment of “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida.

You may be completely fine with all that, unconcerned with inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of human beings, including children. You may be fine with stray innocent bystanders getting caught in the wide net that’s been cast (as long as it’s not you, of course).

But consider this: A rough estimate by the University of Idaho’s McClure Center put Idaho’s workforce count at about 27,000 undocumented immigrants, mostly working in agriculture, construction and service industries.

Idaho industry professionals report that in agriculture, dairy and hospitality industries, businesses employ unauthorized workers to meet their labor needs because authorized workers cannot be found.

So what happens if Trump fulfills his campaign promise — with the help of Idaho State Police — and rounds up nearly 27,000 undocumented immigrants in Idaho?

Employers in agriculture, construction and service industries are going to be in a world of hurt, to say the least. The people Republican leaders believe are out there lining up to take these jobs exist only in their minds.

Finding workers is already a key concern for Idaho businesses today, according to the U of I report, even with undocumented workers. These businesses report that they have to adapt to the lack of workers by forgoing business growth opportunities, cutting back production or even closing, according to the U of I report.

This doesn’t even include the contributions that undocumented immigrant workers make to Idaho’s economy through their spending and taxes.

Those contributions “are likely in the billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs,” according to the report.

Despite recent poor jobs reports, the United States still faces a labor shortage in the millions.

Rounding up and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could have a devastating effect on the economy, perhaps none more so than Idaho’s.

But maybe that’s what it’s going to take for Congress to do its job and adopt immigration reform.

U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson’s Farm Workforce Modernization Act would be a good place to start. It would create a pathway to legal status by creating a category called Certified Agricultural Worker for undocumented farmworkers who have done at least 180 days of agricultural work over the past two years.

It would reform the H-2A Guestworker Program by expanding eligibility to include dairy and other year-round agricultural work, and by adding flexibility for employers.

It would still require employers to attempt recruiting U.S. workers first before using the H-2A program, and establish a mandatory E-Verify system for agricultural employment to ensure future workers are authorized to work legally.

An earlier version of the bill passed the House with bipartisan support, but it got nowhere in the Senate.

Perhaps things weren’t bad enough.

The U.S. has been skating along like this for decades, with an untenable and unsustainable immigration policy, blindly looking the other way while undocumented immigrants do work that other Americans won’t do, spend money that bolsters the economy and pay taxes that help to provide government services.

If we let President Trump and ICE continue with this reckless, inhumane and unconstitutional deportation crusade, we’re going to see just how bad it can get.

Maybe that’s what it will take to get Congress to fix our broken immigration system.

In letters sent to the chief judges of five federal district courts last week, the Reporters Committee expressed concerns about Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(c), a little-known rule that blocks public access to immigration case filings via PACER, the electronic system for federal court records, forcing journalists to visit the courthouse to view them in person.

“This restriction prevents timely public access to fast-moving legal developments and impedes the ability of the press to report on critical, newsworthy matters,” the Reporters Committee argues in the letters, which were sent to federal courts in New York, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. “Timely public access to judicial records is not just good public policy — it is a matter of constitutional importance.”

The letters note that the Reporters Committee regularly hears from journalists who struggle to cover developments in immigration cases because of the rule’s restrictions. Additionally, the letters argue that the rule’s restriction on access is both too broad and too narrow to reasonably serve its purported goal of protecting sensitive information.

Federal courts have the authority to lift Rule 5.2(c) access restrictions. In June, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit removed restrictions in the case of Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University scholar who is challenging whether his detention was legal. The move came in response to a motion Reporters Committee attorneys filed on behalf of The Intercept.

Is it still possible to obtain Italian citizenship iure sanguinis?","The Constitutional Court has ruled on Citizenship by descent. Discover the impact of Judgment 142/2025 and what it means for applicants.

With Judgment no. 142, filed on 31 July 2025, the Italian Constitutional Court dismissed the questions of constitutionality raised by the Courts of Bologna, Rome, Milan and Florence, which had sought to place limits and additional requirements on the automatic recognition of citizenship for the children of Italians born abroad.

The question put to the Court

The referring Courts challenged Act 91/1992, arguing that it allows millions of people with no substantial ties to Italy, other than blood descent from an Italian ancestor, to obtain Citizenship.

The Act states that ""the child of an Italian father or mother is a citizen by birth"", imposing no limits beyond proof of lineage.

The Court was therefore asked whether it was legitimate to introduce further requirements.

What the Constitutional Court decided

The Court, considering the doubts unfounded, held that:

It is not its task to restrict citizenship by means of a ""manipulative"" judgment that would introduce conditions not set by Parliament;

The legislature enjoys wide discretion in determining the requirements for Citizenship;

The current provisions (subject to distinctions introduced by Act 74/2025) that accord citizenship to anyone who is the child of an Italian citizen do not breach the Constitution.

Accordingly, the Court declared:

complaints of unreasonableness and disproportionality inadmissible;

references to unproven international obligations inadmissible;

allegations of unequal treatment with other routes to citizenship unfounded.

Consequences of Judgment 142

The ruling:

does not affect Decree-Law 36/2025, which lay outside the issues decided;

clarifies that the new rules introduced in 2025 (Decree-Law 36/2025, converted into Act 74/2025) do not apply to cases pending before 28 March 2025.

Therefore:

Applications lodged before 28 March 2025 continue under the previous rules;

Applications submitted on or after that date are subject to stricter conditions (e.g. generational limits, proof that an ancestor resided in Italy).

For a closer look at the new criteria: Italian citizenship iure sanguinis—2025 new rules

Suspended proceedings must be resumed

Proceedings that had been stayed awaiting the Court's decision must now be resumed under the pre-2025 legislation.

Constitutional Court and Decree-Law 36/2025: the next step

A further question of constitutionality has been raised by the Turin Court against the 2025 reform.

A hearing is scheduled for the coming months, and the outcome could significantly change the current landscape.

When should you consult a lawyer?

The rules on Italian Citizenship, especially after the 2025 reforms, have become increasingly complex.

It is advisable to consult a law firm in order to:

confirm entitlement to Citizenship by descent or identify alternative routes;

prepare documentation correctly;

avoid errors in the application;

bring proceedings, if necessary, to secure recognition.

Doug LaMalfa faced a mostly hostile crowd Monday during his first North State town hall meeting in several years.

Residents at LaMalfa's town hall meeting in Red Bluff peppered him with a wide range of questions and comments on such topics as immigration, redistricting, the Epstein files, support for Israel, tariffs, wildfires, climate change, forest management and changes to Medicaid.

Many times he was shouted down by members of the audience, who held up green cards to show approval or red pieces of paper for disapproval.

""You just embarrass yourself when you act like that,"" LaMalfa said after several people yelled out ""You're a liar,"" and ""Tell the truth!""

It was the second rowdy crowd the Republican lawmaker faced Monday. He held a similar town hall earlier in the day in Chico, where members of the audience shouted obscenities at him.

Jill Smith, a lifelong Red Bluff resident, said the crowd of about 350 people was upset because it had been years since LaMalfa had held a public meeting in Tehama County.

""All these people are angry. They have concerns. I have concerns. I could vote Democrat or Republican as long as I think they're doing something good for our country. But right now I don't see that happening with this, and that's why everybody's angry,"" Smith said.

LaMalfa was criticized for many of his votes in Congress, including his support in 2021 not to certify the 2020 election that ushered in Joe Biden as president and this year for backing President Trump and his many executive orders, which some on Monday said usurped power from Congress.

""You made a choice to violate your oath to the Constitution,"" Max Walter of Redding said, referring to LaMalfa's vote not to certify the 2020 presidential election. ""And every day since then, you have violated your oath. But you have loyalty, you have loyalty to a felon (Trump), to somebody who mocks people in wheelchairs, to someone who mocks women.""

On questions about tariffs, LaMalfa said he supported them, claiming they would bring jobs back to the U.S. He also said he supported release of the Epstein files, but wanted to make sure the names of victims aren't released.

Roy Reddin asked if LaMalfa supported the type of congressional redistricting that is proposed in Texas.

""Currently the Texas legislature is very close to to an epic gerrymandering where they are going to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters by realigning their districts. So my question to you, is in two parts: Do you support what the Texas legislature is doing and why should California not do the same thing for five seats, one of which could be yours,"" Reddin said.

Although redistricting congressional districts happen at the state level, LaMalfa said he opposed attempts at redistricting such as what is happening in Texas, where the state legislature has proposed redrawing congressional district maps.

The redistricting plan in Texas could lead to the state picking up an additional five Republican seats in Congress, helping the GOP retain a majority in the House next year.

But other states, including California, have vowed to re-draw congressional district boundaries, if Texas goes through with its plan.

Not everyone was critical of LaMalfa. One woman said she was an immigrant and she supports LaMalfa because he backs the Trump administration's actions against undocumented immigrants.

""He's an honest Christian man and he's fighting for us,"" one woman said.

One woman who spoke out said many of the issues that came up Monday were moral issues that transcended a political climate that has become too divisive.

""I'm afraid to stand up for my rights because I might get shot,"" she told LaMalfa, citing the shootings of state legislators in Minnesota this summer.

The Council for Global Equality (CGE) has accused the administration of a ""cover-up of a cover-up"" to keep the reports buried.

Each year, the department is required to report on the practices of other countries concerning individual, civil, political, and worker rights protected under international law, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Governments and international groups have long cited these surveys as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative sources on the state of human rights, informing policy surrounding foreign aid and asylum.

The Foreign Assistance Act requires that these reports be sent to Congress by February 25 each year, and they are typically released in March or April. But nearly six months later, the Trump administration has sent nothing for the calendar year 2024.

Meanwhile, NPR reported in April on a State Department memo requiring employees to ""streamline"" the reports by omitting many of the most common human rights violations:

The reports... will no longer call governments out for such things as denying freedom of movement and peaceful assembly. They won't condemn retaining political prisoners without due process or restrictions on ""free and fair elections.""

Forcibly returning a refugee or asylum-seeker to a home country where they may face torture or persecution will no longer be highlighted, nor will serious harassment of human rights organizations...

...reports of violence and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people will be removed, along with all references to [diversity, equity, and inclusion] (DEI).

Among other topics ordered to be struck from the reports: involuntary or coercive medical or psychological practices, arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, serious restrictions to internet freedom, extensive gender-based violence, and violence or threats of violence targeting people with disabilities.

Last week, The Washington Post obtained leaked copies of the department's reports on nations favored by the Trump administration—El Salvador, Russia, and Israel. It found that they were ""significantly shorter"" than the reports released by the Biden administration and that they struck references to widely documented human rights abuses in these countries.

In the case of El Salvador, where the administration earlier this year began shipping immigrants deported from the United States, the department's report stated that were ""no credible reports of significant human rights abuses"" there, even though such abuses—including torture, physical violence, and deprivation have been widely reported, including by Trump's own deportees.

Human rights violations against LGBTQ+ people were deleted from the State Department's report on Russia, while the report on Israel deleted references to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial and to his government's threats to the country's independent judiciary.

""Secretary Rubio's overtly political rewriting of the human rights reports is a dramatic departure from even his own past commitment to protecting the fundamental human rights of LGBTQI+ people,"" said Keifer Buckingham, the Council for Global Equality's managing director. ""Strategic omission of these abuses is also directly in contravention to Congress's requirement of a 'full and complete report' regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights.""

In June, the CGE sent a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the State Department calling for all communications related to these decisions to be made public. The department acknowledged the request but refused to turn over any documents.

""The world is watching the United States. We cannot risk a cover-up on top of a cover-up,"" Perryman continued.

Andrea Velez was in downtown Los Angeles on June 24 when she was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. She was charged with assaulting a federal officer while he was attempting to arrest a suspect.

The Department of Justice later dismissed her case without prejudice. The agency did not immediately return a request for comment on Tuesday.

Velez, who works as a production coordinator for a shoe company, recalled seeing federal agents when her mother and sister dropped her off at work.

“It was like a scene,” she told NBC Los Angeles. “They were just ready to attack and chase.”

Velez said she felt someone grab her and slam her to the ground. She said she tried to tell the agent, who was in plainclothes, that she was a citizen, but he told her that she “was interfering with what he was doing, so he was going to arrest me.”

“That’s when I asked him to show me his ID, his badge number,” she said. “I asked him if he had a warrant, and he said I didn’t need to know any of that.”

A federal criminal complaint alleged that an agent was chasing after a man, and Velez stepped into the agent’s path and extended her arm “in an apparent effort to prevent him from apprehending the male subject he was chasing.”

The complaint said that Velez’s arm hit the agent in the face.

Velez said she denied any wrongdoing and insisted she was a U.S. citizen. She was taken to a detention center in downtown Los Angeles where she gave officers her driver’s license and her health insurance card, but she was still booked into jail.

She said she spent two days in the detention center, where she had nothing to drink for 24 hours.

Velez said the ordeal traumatized her, and she has not been able to physically return to work.

“I’m taking things day by day,” she told the news station.

Her attorneys told NBC Los Angeles that they are exploring legal options against the federal government.

Her story echoes those of others who have said they were wrongfully detained by immigration agents under President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations.

Job Garcia, a Ph.D. student and photographer, said he was tackled and thrown to the ground by immigration agents for recording a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles.

DC Circuit vacates judge's order to hold US in contempt for ignoring TRO blocking immigrant removals

A federal appeals court has vacated an order by a Washington, D.C., federal judge that found probable cause to hold the federal government in criminal contempt for violating his order blocking the removal of a group of immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated an April 16 order by Chief U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg of the District of Columbia in a 2-1 per curiam decision Friday.

How Appealing links to the Aug. 8 decision and links to news coverage, including stories by the New York Times and the Washington Times.

The immigrants were taken to a prison in El Salvador in Central America but were later transferred to Venezuela, according to the New York Times.

D.C. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas and D.C. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, appointees of President Donald Trump during his first term, wrote separate concurring opinions with differing reasons for their decision to vacate Boasberg’s probable cause order. D.C. Circuit Judge Corneila T.L. Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, dissented.

In a commentary at the Volokh Conspiracy, Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, said his quick reading of the opinions leads him to think that Boasberg “on remand would have jurisdiction to proceed with some form of criminal contempt,” minus a “purge” option that drew objections from Rao.

Boasberg had said the federal government could purge itself of contempt by giving the immigrants a chance to challenge their removal in a habeas proceeding by asserting custody over them.

Boasberg issued the probable cause order, which included the purge option, even though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled April 7 that the immigrants’ case had been filed in the wrong venue. Boasberg said the Supreme Court decision, which lifted his temporary restraining order, “does not excuse the government’s violation.”

Rao, however, said Boasberg lost authority to coerce compliance with his order after the Supreme Court vacated it. She went on to say punishment through contempt “might still be available in these circumstances, but the district court cannot use the threat of such punishment as a backdoor to obtain compliance with a vacated and therefore unenforceable TRO.”

The dissent would not have vacated Boasberg’s probable cause order, while Katsas said he would vacate the order and terminate the criminal contempt proceeding.

Katsas said the case could be resolved based on ambiguities that resulted in different interpretations of Boasberg’s order.

The government had contended that the order banned removal of the immigrants from U.S. territory, but that had happened before he entered the TRO. Boasberg, however, said the order barred removal of the immigrants from U.S. custody, and his order was likely violated by their transfer to El Salvadoran custody.

The ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the party accused of contempt, Katsas said.

Although Katsas thought that the case could be resolved based on ambiguity, he also said Boasberg acted “to vindicate a TRO that the Supreme Court had vacated for lack of jurisdiction.”

He said Boasberg’s order “raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses. And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.”

The federal department publicly criticized U.S. Rep. Don Beyer (D) in a press release after he visited Farmville Detention Center on Friday. It accused him of prioritizing detainees with criminal convictions over crime victims.

“He continues to do the bidding of dangerous criminal illegal aliens that endanger his own constituents,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. “When will Congressman Beyer meet with the American victims of these illegal aliens’ violent crimes?”

Beyer fired back via a spokesperson on social media, criticizing conditions at the detention facility about an hour and 15 minutes southwest of Richmond.

“Federal regulations require minimum standards of care for all detainees, and unfortunately the medical resources at this facility were clearly woefully inadequate to meet those standards,” Aaron Fritschner, Beyer’s deputy chief of staff, said on X.

“Improving these conditions would be a far better use of time for the staff of the Department of Homeland Security than attacking Members of Congress for doing their jobs by engaging in oversight of the Executive Branch.”

Beyer, who had been talking about visiting Farmville for months, requested to meet “a number of detainees” at the detention center. They included people who had been kept in solitary confinement, who had recently experienced mental health crises and who had faced long delays in getting access to crucial medical treatment, Fritschner said.

DHS said that the detainees also included people convicted of assault and battery, burglary, distribution of drugs and driving under the influence. The agency claims that two of them are gang members, although only one detainee is listed as having a conviction for gang participation.

In an interview with the local news site WRIC, Beyer described “an enormous medical burden” at the detention center, which he said has only one physician and is struggling to get more nurses.

“Rep. Beyer also met with an older man who was detained by ICE when he went to his green card interview,” Fritschner told ARLnow. “DHS did not include this man in their list, but it’s the kind of case that has so many people in our community upset about what DHS and ICE are doing.”

Beyer told WRIC that “maybe as many as three quarters” of detainees at the center “only have a civil reason for being there.”

DHS disputes this, claiming that 66% of people detained at the center have been either charged or convicted of crimes in the United States.",https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/PXL_20250501_193747234.MP_.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 12:58:37.738820

NSGB is the U.S.’s oldest overseas military installation, but it was not the first.
With all this in mind, Congress surely understood the risk that the U.S. military could be used for civilian law enforcement purposes abroad.
This is true even if doing so provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement.
NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. On that basis alone, U.S. laws should apply there.","On Jan. 29, President Trump issued an executive order directing the expansion of the Migrant Operations Center (MOC) at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay (NSGB) for “high-priority criminal aliens.” Since then, approximately 500 migrants—initially apprehended in the U.S.—have been detained at NSGB, and another 9,000 are being vetted for transfer. Detainees are under the supervision of the U.S. military and have been housed both in the MOC and at Camp Six—which at one point held alleged members of al-Qaeda. While the military is reportedly only acting in support of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the facts suggest their role is more “direct [and] active.” This raises the important possibility that the administration is violating the Posse Comitatus Act (PCA). This article outlines how the use of the U.S. military to supervise the detention of migrants at NSGB would violate the PCA, analyzes whether such a violation is actionable, and presents possible remedies.

The PCA

The PCA prohibits using “any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws[,]” but the law is unclear about what uses of military personnel are improper, and it leaves out entirely the issue of extraterritoriality. The first question has largely been fleshed out by the courts, leaving us with three tests for actions that “execute the laws”: first, any military act that is “regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature and causes the citizens to be presently or prospectively subject to regulations, proscriptions, or compulsions imposed by military authority”; second, “the direct active participation of federal military troops in law enforcement activities”; and third, “any [military] activities that pervade the activities of civilian law enforcement officials.” See also Bissonette v. Haig, United States v. Redfeather, and United States v. Jaramillo.

The use of “citizen” may seem problematic in the current context—which involves noncitizens—but the issue can be easily dispatched with because the term, as used in Bissonette, seems to be a colloquial distinction of petitioners from civilian law enforcement officers (LEOs) and the military. It is doubtful that this distinction has any real significance because the PCA is a criminal statute; as with all criminal statutes, the focus is on the acts and intent of the person accused of violating it—not on the victim.

Civilian LEOs assigned to correctional facilities exercise power that is regulatory, proscriptive, and compulsory by any typical understanding of those words, and consistent with how they were applied in Bissonette. These LEOs restrict the detainees’ freedom of movement, often using armed guards along the perimeter of a facility. The presence of guards is direct, as defined in Redfeather, because it involves personnel rather than just equipment. The personnel’s role is also active, as defined in Redfeather, because it involves searches, seizures of contraband and other evidence, and the pursuit of escaped detainees, and it may involve criminal investigations and the interrogation of witnesses. If these tasks are performed by uniformed members of the military, or even civilian employees of the Defense Department, it could constitute a PCA violation.

Declarations by both detainees and members of the military—filed in Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem and Espinoza Escalona v. Noem—show that the military is being used in violation of the PCA. Mirroring Bissonette’s use of military personnel and resources to create roadblocks and an armed perimeter for the purpose of confining the citizens of Wounded Knee, NSGB employs military personnel and Camp Six’s walls to similarly contain noncitizen detainees in a manner that is regulatory, proscriptive, and compulsory.

Second, the military’s role here is both direct and active. Rather than merely engaging in a protective service of federal assets or providing assistance to civilian law enforcement, service members are engaging in strip searches, restraining detainees for out-of-cell movement, cell searches, direct supervision, serving food, and regulating and supervising phone use.

Finally, the military presence at Camp Six likely pervades that of civilian law enforcement. ICE “cannot be said to have been ‘lawfully engaged’ in the ‘lawful performance’ of their official duties” because those duties had been overtaken by the military. As of February, 900 service members were deployed to NSGB. The “Guard Force” at Camp Six consists of 28 soldiers, seven or eight Akima contractors, and only two ICE agents per shift. All three of the tests for what it means to “execute the law” are met, meaning that the PCA has been violated.

(Extra)territorial Application

No cases have addressed whether the PCA applies extraterritorially. As assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel, William Barr opined that the PCA does not apply outside the territory of the U.S. However, that memo was written in 1989, and NSGB has undergone significant changes since then. The memo was written before NSGB was used as temporary housing for HIV-positive migrants interdicted at sea, 9/11, and the Bush administration’s expansion of NSGB to house enemy combatant detainees.

For these reasons, the memo’s rationale is less persuasive and is certainly non-dispositive. Below I address this issue in two parts: First, I argue that PCA violations at NSGB are actionable because NSGB is territorial; second, I argue that PCA violations committed at NSGB should be actionable even if it is considered extraterritorial.

The Case for Territoriality

NSGB is the United States’s oldest overseas military installation. It is located within the sovereign territory of Cuba but has been under the legal jurisdiction and control of the U.S. since 1903. The treaty contains no termination date and has no provision for unilateral termination, effectively making it an indefinite lease agreement. The treaty does not expressly limit the uses of the land, but it also does not contemplate the detention of migrants apprehended within the U.S. Rather, it expressly says that the lease is to be used for coaling and a naval station. This traditional use was precisely how NSGB was used until the 1990s. Until now, no non-U.S. territory—including NSGB—has ever been used to detain migrants who were first apprehended and detained within the U.S.

The clearest reason why the PCA should apply at NSGB is that it is a de facto territory of the U.S., a fact the government concedes. According to the government, “there is no Cuban government presence at NSGB and no way for Cuban authorities to exercise any control over the detainees.” Additionally, “while [the detainees] have physically departed the [U.S.] …[,] DHS has not completed the removal mission and has certainly not surrendered them to the control of the Cuban government.” The government went on to cite the finding in Boumediene v. Bush that NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. As a de facto territory, NSGB is legally indistinguishable—for the purposes of applying the U.S. Constitution and statutes—from Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.

In Boumediene, the Supreme Court held that noncitizen detainees at NSGB can challenge their detention with a writ of habeas. Although the issue of habeas is not entirely analogous with the question posed here, Boumediene remains relevant because it addresses the extent to which the laws of the U.S. apply to noncitizen detainees housed at NSGB. It is especially on point because the Court’s reasoning relied on the degree of objective control that the U.S. asserted over an otherwise foreign territory.

The Court observed that “questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.” Speaking to these factors, the Court noted that, since the U.S. has had complete and uninterrupted control of NSGB for more than 100 years, under an indefinite lease it would be impossible for the political branches to govern it without legal constraints. NSGB is “no transient possession. In every practical sense [NSGB] is not abroad; it is within the constant jurisdiction of the [U.S.]” The Court also held that “the detainees … are held in a territory that, while technically not part of the [U.S.], is under the complete and total control of our government.” As this concept relates to the general circumstances of the U.S.’s control over NSGB, and not solely habeas, this characterization of the territory ought to apply equally to questions of PCA violations occurring at NSGB.

Notably, this expansion of what is considered U.S. territory would not extend to all foreign facilities operated by the U.S. military. In Al Maqaleh v. Gates, the court remarked that “while it is certainly realistic to assert that the [U.S.] has de facto sovereignty over [NSGB], the same simply is not true with respect to Bagram[, Afghanistan].” Bagram was an active war zone at the time of the case, and the U.S. does not hold the same type of indefinite lease agreement with Afghanistan as it does with Cuba.

The Case for Extraterritoriality

Even if NSGB is not territorial, the PCA should still apply. Congress is silent on the matter, and no court has spoken on the issue. This creates a presumption against extraterritoriality, but presumptions are not insurmountable. Other U.S. laws without explicit extraterritoriality provisions are applied there. Aside from Boumediene extending the right of habeas to detainees at NSGB—and the subsequent filings of statutory habeas petitions by and for both enemy combatant and migrant detainees—there is also case law illustrating that criminal statutes can be applied to conduct committed at NSGB. Also relevant is the hope that the government is using some lawful basis to detain individuals at NSGB in the first place.

Criminal Statutes

Capt. John Nettleton—a former Guantanamo commander—was charged and convicted under 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(2), for making false statements at NSGB. Congressional intent for extraterritoriality had previously been read into § 1001 and, for the same reasons, the same should be done for the PCA. In United States v. Walczak, the court based its reasoning on the nationality principle of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the text, and the rationale in United States v. Bowman.

First, the nationality principle holds that a state has jurisdiction over its citizens for crimes committed outside of its territory. Under this principle, even if NSGB is outside of U.S. territory, those violating the PCA at NSGB would still be under U.S. jurisdiction for criminal offenses because they are U.S. citizens.

Second, the PCA reads in its entirety:

Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, or the Space Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.

While perhaps less clear, there are similarities between the PCA and § 1001. Walczak focused on the phrase “Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department of agency of the [U.S.]” and held that § 1001 applied to the false statements made on Customs forms without regard to the place where the offense occurred because the Department of the Treasury is a “department of the [U.S.]” Similarly the PCA focuses on “departments”—or rather branches of the U.S. military. While the text is not dispositive, it suggests that the location is irrelevant because the criminal conduct is the improper use of military branches and the branches—or “departments”—are necessarily deployed all over the world.

Third, in Bowman, the Court noted that to limit the

locus [of certain offenses] to the strictly territorial jurisdiction would be greatly to curtail the scope and usefulness of the statute, and leave open a large immunity for frauds as easily committed by citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries as at home. In such cases, Congress has not thought it necessary to make specific provision in the law that the locus shall include the high seas and foreign countries, but allows it to be inferred from the nature of the offense.

NSGB is the U.S.’s oldest overseas military installation, but it was not the first. In fact, in 1867, Congress was planning on using Midway Island in much the same way that NSGB was traditionally used—as a naval station and coaling depot. The Senate also consented to a treaty in 1878 that would have permitted a naval station to be built in Samoa. The PCA was enacted that same year—showing that Congress was contemplating overseas military installations and the PCA at the same time.

In 2021, Congress added the Space Force to the enumerated branches of the PCA. In doing so, they necessarily contemplated not just extraterritorial—but extraterrestrial—use of military power. Also relevant is that at this time, the U.S. operated around 750 foreign-based military installations, and the function of NSGB had been expanded to include temporary housing for HIV-positive migrants and long-term detention of enemy combatant detainees. With all this in mind, Congress surely understood the risk that the U.S. military could be used for civilian law enforcement purposes abroad. Knowing that, Congress did not create new exceptions or repeal the PCA. It chose to expand it.

Just like in Bowman, Congress’s intent can be inferred because the scope and usefulness of the PCA would be greatly curtailed if the U.S. could choose to move a class of persons to a foreign based military installation in order to avoid sanction for actions which—if committed within the territorial U.S.—would constitute a violation of the PCA. Otherwise, the large number of foreign-based military installations would enable immunity for violations committed in foreign countries. And, as the military is deployed worldwide and the statute criminalizes an improper use of the enumerated branches, congressional intent for extraterritoriality can be inferred from the nature of the offense. Put together, the nationality principle, the text, and the Bowman rationale weigh toward the PCA overcoming the presumption against extraterritoriality.

Basis for Detention

It is unclear what authority is being used to justify migrant detention at NSGB—it does not come from a specific act of Congress, and it was not within the contemplated uses found within the treaties with Cuba. Statements made by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, indicating that detention would be temporary pending deportation unless other countries would not accept the migrants, suggest that this authority comes from 8 U.S.C. §1537(2)(C), 8 U.S.C. §1231(a)(2)(A), or 8 U.S.C. §1231(g)(1). Critically, no provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) has an extraterritorial provision.

Military Purpose Doctrine

The Military Purpose Doctrine is important to consider as a possible exception to the PCA. It authorizes the military to actively participate in direct law enforcement activities when done for the primary purpose of furthering a Defense Department or foreign affairs function of the U.S. This is true even if doing so provides an incidental benefit to civilian law enforcement. But using the U.S. military to supervise detention of migrant detainees at NSGB is not just an incidental benefit.

This is clear from the recent use of the military in Los Angeles. By carefully limiting the permissible role of federalized troops in California to “protect[ing] the safety and security of federal functions, personnel, and property,” the government has shown us that illegal immigration is primarily a civilian law enforcement activity. Though they accompany ICE agents on immigration raids, military service members are present only to protect federal law enforcement and assist by establishing a security perimeter. They cannot conduct law enforcement activities. This point has been made time and time again—in social media posts, news reports, official statements, and court filings.

The government has also demonstrated that detention on a military installation is a civilian law enforcement activity. Large swaths of land along the U.S.-Mexico border have been designated as military installations and, while soldiers can temporarily detain trespassers there, they must turn them over when an appropriate law enforcement entity can assume custody.

Remedies

The available facts show that the PCA is likely being violated. Ubi jus, ibi remedium—for every wrong there is a remedy. Here, violators face the criminal sanctions enumerated in the statute and/or a variety of civil actions including ultra vires claims and habeas relief. A civil rights action may also be appropriate, but the probability of success is minimal. Because the guilty actors are federal instead of state agents, the suit would have to be brought as a Bivens action rather than a § 1983 suit. Bivens, however, will not be discussed at length here, as the Supreme Court has drastically limited Bivens actions and the probability of success is miniscule.

Ultra Vires Claim

An ultra vires claim can be brought, despite sovereign immunity, when the plaintiff brings suit against an official in their official capacity, can show that the official acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act, and seeks a prospective relief other than monetary damages. This is illustrated by a parallel case. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has brought an ultra vires claim arguing that the way the National Guard is being used in Los Angeles either amounts to or creates the risk of an imminent PCA violation.

Turning to the case at NSGB, neither the plaintiffs in Espinoza Escalona v. Noem nor those in Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem brought claims related to the PCA—but they could have, because in both cases, officials have likely exceeded their authority, in violation of the PCA, by housing noncitizen detainees under military supervision. While petitioners could not seek monetary damages through an ultra vires claim, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against future transfers would be appropriate, as both are proscriptive remedies.

Injunctive Relief

Emergency injunctive relief is proper to prevent additional transfers to NSGB. The question is to what extent it can be applied. Hundreds of cases have been filed against the Trump administration, and the scope of emergency injunctive relief has been a cornerstone issue. The Supreme Court recently kiboshed universal injunctions, which might suggest that each person has to file their own lawsuit to obtain relief—even if the wrong spawns from an executive order affecting millions of people. Fortunately the Court has left open several avenues for widespread relief: Plaintiffs may be able to certify nationwide classes; the Administrative Procedure Act might enable courts to set aside unlawful actions; and states could either file in state court and obtain nationwide injunctions upon showing of a “patchwork” of individual injunctions is insufficient to protect their interests or file a suit against the government directly in the Supreme Court.

Habeas

Habeas is the mechanism used to challenge legality or duration of confinement. Habeas jurisdiction is proper here for two reasons: Migrant detainees are “in custody under or by color of the authority of the [U.S],” and they are “in custody in violation of the … laws … of the [U.S.]”—namely the PCA. Additionally, the detainees here are in “the immediate physical custody of American forces who answer only to an American chain of command.” For these reasons, habeas relief should be granted and migrant detainees at NSGB should be released—whether that be into the U.S. or by removal to another country.

***

It would be patently unlawful to use the military in this way within U.S. borders; it is dangerous to suggest that by removing detainees to a black site in the Caribbean the government is allowed to act with impunity. NSGB is a de facto territory of the U.S. On that basis alone, U.S. laws should apply there. But even supposing this is not true, there is reason to believe that the PCA should be interpreted to apply extraterritorially. In either case, there are remedies available for the migrants who have been, are, or will be detained under these conditions at NSGB.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-12 12:59:04.779627

But he wound up at Riverside Regional Jail that night anyway. Moments after his court hearing on Friday he was picked up by immigration officers. Over the weekend, the agency transferred Momand to a detention facility in Farmville, where he remained on Monday.

Momand arrived in the U.S. with his family in the aftermath of the military’s hectic exit from Afghanistan in 2021, according to his immigration attorney, Miriam Airington-Fisher. His defense lawyer, Casey Coleman, said his father “made significant contributions to the U.S. government in Afghanistan.”

It’s possible that he was targeted because of the felony charge, despite it being dropped by an agreement with prosecutors. A spokesperson for ICE did not return a request for comment Monday morning regarding Momand’s arrest.

In 2009, Congress authorized resettlement programs for Afghans and Iraqis affected by America’s long-running wars in those countries. Since then, around 50,000 visas have been granted to Afghans who were employed by the U.S. government, according to the State Department. Another group of refugees was welcomed in after the U.S. exit from Kabul in 2021.

The Biden administration said many of the more recent admissions “took significant risks to support our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan.”

The Department of Homeland Security at the time said all visa recipients were rigorously vetted — thousands of applicants to the program continue to be denied each year, according to statistics from the Department of State.

Airington-Fisher, an immigration attorney of 17 years, said Special Immigrant Visas are reserved for the “most meritorious cases.” She described her client’s arrest as a clumsy waste of government resources.”

His family was scheduled for a formal green card interview this week, she said.

“They can say a million times that they are arresting the worst of the worst, that they are MS-13, that they are gang members, but that’s just not who they’re arresting,” said Airington-Fisher. “They’re arresting people like Arman, whose family filed all the proper paperwork.”

On Monday, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin sent CBS 21 the following statement about the woman's detention:

ICE arrested Estrelita Soliman-Ramos, a criminal illegal alien from the Philippines, on August 4, 2025. Her criminal history includes two arrests for theft. “On July 28, 2025, she was pulled over by local police for driving without a license and improperly restraining a child. On August 4, she reported to York ERO, and she was taken into custody.

While McLaughlin stated that Soliman had initially been in the country legally, that status had not been the case for over two decades:

She legally entered the U.S. on a B-2 tourist visa that allowed her to remain in the U.S. until March 4, 2000. Over 25 years later, she is still illegally in the U.S. A judge issued her a final order of removal in 2011, and her appeal was denied.

Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.

A GoFundMe created on behalf of the family, which had raised over $81,000 as of Monday morning, said Soliman began her green card process last year.

As she worked through the process, the woman received a notice from ICE asking her to appear and register for an ""Alternatives to Detention"" program on Aug. 4.

After a bit of discussion and guidance from Riverside Mayor Patricia Lock Dawson and TODEC executive director Luz Gallegos, the mock city council unanimously voted to fund mental health workshops for their community.

“They are learning the building blocks. They are being the change that needs to be seen,” said chaperone Julio Roman, dad to a 6- and 9-year-old on the trip. “If you read about it, you hear about it in books, it’s nothing like being here and having the privilege of coming in and actually seeing how the process works.”

Using civic knowledge to push for change

That’s been the intention of Monarcas Luchadoras, which translates to monarchs in the struggle. The program aims to equip school-age children, many of whom are immigrants or come from immigrant families, with an understanding of how to enact change. They’ve learned how laws are passed as well as how to recognize problems in their community and push for solutions through organizing.

Though the mission hasn’t wavered over the program’s nearly four decades, it has felt especially important this summer, she said — especially as kids are confronted with very real fears over separation.

“It’s a very different program to other summers,” said Gallegos, who is an alumna of the program. “We see the pain in the kids.”

The conversations the younger kids are having aren’t too different from those of the older ones, Gallegos said. They have all wanted to know why events are unfolding and how they align with American values.

“We are seeing kids as young as 4 years old knowing what ICE is, knowing that they may be undocumented, knowing that their parents and family and friends are undocumented,” she said.

The students took advantage of a rare field trip and explored art installations at The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art & Culture and learned about the historical figures whose statues make up the city’s Civil Rights Walk.

At the museum, a few kids lingered in front of a painting of a low rider, while others ran toward an installation with glass seashells typically used to call out to gods such as the Aztec goddess Cihuateotl, who was depicted at the installation.

“They’re teaching me how to keep up our culture, how to help other people, not just ourselves, how to be nice and kind, how to be respectful,” fifth-grader Garcia said.

Stepping up for Riverside’s immigrant community

The children have learned a lot just by being in the environment, said Linda Cruz, whose three children soaked in the new experiences, including her 3-year-old daughter Mia, who joins the group at events like Monday’s field trip.

Her children have also helped TODEC pack groceries and educational materials for families too scared to leave their homes.

“They’re seeing the anxiety, and they’re also seeing that, with that anxiety, they can do something,” Cruz said. “It’s giving them confidence that I think a lot of people in our community lack.”

Gallegos and other TODEC leaders have pushed kids to think about solutions even if they’re not old enough to vote. The center has also taken children to Sacramento, Moreno Valley and Riverside County to speak on how immigration enforcement has affected their friends and families.

And they’ve encouraged kids to share their own ideas as they learn to use their voices. Zoey Roman, 9, wants to find more ways to help families pay for groceries as parents stay home from work because of the raids.

“You guys have power,” Gallegos reminded the group as the youthful city council prepared to cast their mock vote calling for community mental health services. “Without your voice things can’t happen.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3aa8445/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2574x1351+0+182/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fea%2F24ed262e41dd9874d3a374527cc2%2F1516562-me-0804-todec-kids-rcg-1981.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 10:56:19.915659

If you haven't yet, you may want to read Part 1 (or listen), Part 2, Part 3, or Part 4 before diving into this analysis.

The Deportation Data Project released new figures yesterday covering ICE enforcement activities through the end of July, obtained through their ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This data provides an updated picture of immigration enforcement trends that builds on previous analysis of ICE arrest patterns.

The latest data shows that overall arrest numbers decreased between June and July, marking a notable month-to-month decline. However, these figures remain elevated when viewed against recent historical context, indicating that immigration enforcement continues at levels significantly higher than previous periods.

ICE's daily arrest numbers also tell an important story about enforcement capacity and policy. Despite previous reports of a 3,000-per-day arrest quota, daily figures have consistently fallen short of reaching this threshold, with no significant increase in recent daily totals.

This discrepancy becomes more convoluted when considering recent court filings from the Department of Justice that have challenged the existence of such a policy altogether, contradicting earlier public statements and media reports that supported the existence of these daily quotas.

I’ll leave it to the lawyers to decide whether the administration’s touting of a daily goal of 3,000 arrests does or does not constitute a quota. It seems that, once again, the administration likes to say one thing in public, then something different in official filings—reminiscent of Trump’s debunked allegations that the election was stolen. In any case, regardless of whether 3,000 daily arrests was a “goal” or a “quota”, the administration is not meeting it. The data makes that clear.

Perhaps the most significant finding from previous analysis continues to hold true in the July data: the demographic composition of ICE arrests remains skewed toward individuals with no criminal history. The surge in arrests that peaked at the end of May and continued through mid-June was primarily driven by enforcement actions against immigrants without criminal backgrounds.

While this number retreated from its previous high by the end of June and maintained lower levels throughout July, immigrants with no criminal history still represent the largest single category of ICE arrests through the end of July. Remarkably, this group continues to exceed the number of arrests involving immigrants with criminal convictions—a pattern that raises important questions about enforcement priorities and resource allocation.

These trends in ICE enforcement data reveal the ongoing tension between stated policy objectives and actual implementation on the ground. As the Deportation Data Project continues to extract information through litigation, these updates provide crucial transparency into immigration enforcement patterns that might otherwise remain hidden from public scrutiny.

The persistence of high arrest numbers, combined with the continued focus on individuals without criminal histories, suggests that current enforcement practices remain at odds with stated priorities of focusing resources on those who pose genuine public safety concerns. As new data becomes available, tracking these patterns will be essential for understanding the real-world impact of immigration enforcement policies.

But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp benefits.
Those who may lose SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, the CBO estimates.
But the Food Research & Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the food police and start investing in real solutions”.
“That means increasing Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.","Republican-led cuts to public assistance programs – carried out at the behest of Donald Trump’s administration – will lead to 2.4 million fewer Americans receiving food stamps, among them families with children, the non-partisan congressional budget office (CBO) has found.

The estimate, published Monday, forecast that the number of people receiving food stamp benefits in an average month would drop after Republican lawmakers expanded work requirements to some parents, older enrollees and others.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), formerly known as food stamps, in 2024 served an average of 41.7 million people monthly, or 12.3% of the US population. Federal spending on the program amounts to almost $100bn, and benefits average $187.20 a month.

But Trump’s congressional agenda bill, which the president signed into law in July, requires parents of dependent children to work for their food stamp benefits. The Snap program has long required certain able-bodied adults to work to receive benefits for longer than three months.

But the bill broadened the requirement to parents of dependent children – requiring that those with kids ages 14 and older work, volunteer or participate in job training at least 80 hours monthly.

The bill – which places more responsibility for food programs and other benefits onto states – requires that adults ages 55 to 64, veterans, people experiencing homelessness and former foster care youth meet the mandate, though it exempts Native Americans, according to CNN.

The CBO estimates that US households, on average, will see an increase in the resources available to them as a result of the bill – but “the changes in resources will not be evenly distributed among households”.

Those who may lose SNAP benefits include 300,000 adults who live with children ages 14 and older, the CBO estimates.

The agency said it “estimates that, in general, resources will decrease for households toward the bottom of the income distribution, whereas resources will increase for households in the middle and toward the top of the income distribution”.

But the highest earners, with incomes of nearly $700,000, on average, will see a $13,600 jump in their incomes, or about 2.7%.

Overall, middle-income Americans, who earn about $86,000 on average, will get an $800 increase in federal assistance overall while those who earn less than $24,000 will see their projected incomes drop by about $1,200 a year.

The estimates come as the federal government is shifting costs of benefit programs onto states.

“Hunger is a public health crisis, and Snap is one of the most effective tools we have to address it – reducing food insecurity, improving health outcomes, and lowering long-term health care costs,” the Food Research & Action Center said recently, after the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) moved to restrict certain junk foods, including sodas and candy, from products that can be purchased with Snap benefits.

“For years, Snap has used taxpayer dollars to fund soda and candy – products that fuel America’s diabetes and chronic disease epidemics,” HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr said in a statement.

But the Food Research & Action Center said the Trump administration “needs to stop being the food police and start investing in real solutions”.

“That means increasing Snap benefits, expanding access to affordable food, and scaling up evidence-based programs like fruit and vegetable incentives,” the group said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1f826e74a361b72e6ca893bb7fc51dfa8514b49/728_0_5001_4000/master/5001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8598e8381f8da165e8b00c33e687bfe2",N,,2025-08-12 12:58:29.179277

“That’s not how it works.” Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too.
That law suffered a setback last month when, after a lengthy court battle, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that it cannot apply to private companies, paving the way for more federal detention centers to open.
“I think they have an insatiable appetite for this, and it’s not about violent criminals,” Menendez said.","Rep. LaMonica McIver said she will continue to fight for congressional oversight of immigration detention centers, despite facing federal charges accusing her of assaulting officers during a May visit to a migrant jail in Newark.

McIver (D-10) told the New Jersey Monitor at an event in Jersey City Monday that the case against her has been “definitely stressful.”

“When you talk about a person coming to charge you because you were there to do your job and they’re telling you you can get 17 years in prison, that’s nothing to joke with. I’m a mother, I’m a wife, I have a family,” she said.

McIver was joined by Rep. Rob Menendez (D-08) at Hudson County Community College in Jersey City for what they billed as a dialogue series to discuss their “shared experiences and work fighting for our communities in the time of Trump.”

The two recalled an immigration raid in Newark that occurred less than 48 hours after President Donald Trump took office for his second term, along with their often confrontational visits to detention centers.

McIver, Menendez, and Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-12) showed up at Delaney Hall, a 1,000-bed migrant detention center in Newark, on May 9 for an unannounced inspection of the facility. Their visit ended in chaos, with federal officers arresting Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and charging him with trespassing, then later charging McIver and accusing her of shoving agents as they took Baraka into custody. She pleaded not guilty, and her trial is tentatively set to begin in November (the charges against Baraka were quickly dropped).

Menendez recalled from his visit to Delaney Hall that the building was dirty, the telephones were not working, and the three members of Congress got stuck in an elevator. Baraka and other Newark officials have accused Delaney Hall’s owners, private prison firm Geo Group, of opening the facility without proper city permits and inspections.

McIver noted on Monday that after the incident at Delaney Hall made national headlines, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to stop members of Congress from making unannounced visits to immigrant detention centers by requiring them to alert the department seven days in advance. An appropriations law in effect since 2019 grants a lawmaker the ability to conduct oversight of such centers without prior approval from the department or Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“It hasn’t changed — it’s just that the administration wants it to change, so they literally put out a guidance, but you can’t just change policy because you want to,” McIver said. “That’s not how it works.”

Menendez noted that he and other members of New Jersey’s House delegation fought federal policies on immigration under the Biden administration, too. He was among the lawmakers who signed a letter sent to then-President Biden urging him to stop fighting a New Jersey law that bars companies from contracting with ICE to detain immigrants.

She enrolled in school, working first as a nursing assistant, and then as a registered nurse in nursing homes.
William Brangham: The move was just one of several efforts to rescind the status of thousands of noncitizens working legally across the United States.
Dr. David Himmelstein, HUNTER COLLEGE: There are already huge numbers of vacancies for nursing home workers and for home care workers.
Job losses would include health care workers, but also support positions like maintenance staff and housekeepers like Vanessa Joseph.","Amna Nawaz:

More than a million immigrants work in health care in the U.S., and they make up an increasing share of caregivers for elderly and disabled Americans. That includes medical professionals, but also the housekeepers and the janitors that keep nursing homes running. These facilities already face labor shortages.

And now, as William Brangham reports, the Trump administration's immigration policies could make it even more difficult to find workers.

William Brangham:

She fled her native Haiti and settled in Florida. After the devastating 2010 earthquake, the Obama administration granted her and thousands of other Haitians temporary protected status, or TPS, which allowed them to remain in the United States and work legally, but didn't provide a path to permanent residency.

As TPS for Haitians was repeatedly extended, Edelyne got married, bought this house. She also had a daughter, who is 6 and is an American citizen. She enrolled in school, working first as a nursing assistant, and then as a registered nurse in nursing homes.

Edelyne Jean:

I love what I'm doing, and I do it with pride and the compassion. Like, I feel for these people. Like, some of them, they have no family members. We are the family. We are family.

Edelyne Jean:

I tried. Like, I do the right thing. I tried to be one of them, to be part of America. But I don't think we're welcome, I'm welcome, especially with this administration. No.

William Brangham:

In February, even as armed gangs expanded control over parts of Haiti, the Trump administration sought to end TPS for Haitians and send them back.

Donald Trump, President of the United States: They're pouring into our country, pouring in. If I weren't elected president, there'd be nobody in Haiti anymore.

William Brangham:

The move was just one of several efforts to rescind the status of thousands of noncitizens working legally across the United States.

Is this something you're worrying about every single day?

William Brangham:

Haitians on TPS were granted a reprieve last month when a federal district court judge ruled that the deadline for ending TPS must be extended to next February. But that's little comfort for Edelyne and her family.

Edelyne Jean:

If nothing happens, I'm screwed, because, if I can't work to take out the bills, I won't be able to take out my daughter. And I don't know. I can't even think about it.

William Brangham:

The looming end of TPS is not just a crisis for Edelyne and the hundreds of thousands of other Haitians here in the U.S.

It's also putting extraordinary strain on long-term health care facilities, like nursing homes, where a little over 7 percent of the work force are noncitizens.

Dr. David Himmelstein, HUNTER COLLEGE:

There are already huge numbers of vacancies for nursing home workers and for home care workers. And if the immigrants who are now filling those jobs go away, they just won't be filled is almost certainly what's going to happen.

Dr. David Himmelstein:

Hospitals and emergency rooms to panned on nursing homes. They can't discharge patients who are not able to care for themselves unless there's a nursing home to take care of them or home care workers to take care of them. And that's going to mean backups.

William Brangham:

At the Sinai Residences in Boca Raton, Florida, these policy changes could mean dozens of workers might lose their jobs. This facility includes independent and assisted living, a nursing home and a memory care unit.

Job losses would include health care workers, but also support positions like maintenance staff and housekeepers like Vanessa Joseph. She came to the U.S. from Haiti two years ago with a younger sister and her teenage son. She's legally working under TPS.

Vanessa Joseph, TPS Recipient:

I cry every day. But I don't tell my son that because he can have more — more stress than me. So I tell him it's going to be OK. So I just stay positive.

Rachel Blumberg:

There were a lot of questions of, what have I done wrong? And my answer to them was that, you have done absolutely nothing wrong. It's unfortunately just where you were born, which doesn't seem fair at all. It was, I would have to say, the hardest day of my entire 30-year career in senior living.

William Brangham:

Blumberg says losing these workers would not only be hard on their own lives, but on the many residents at Sinai who've developed long and deep relationships with them; 92-year-old Isobel Loring has lived at Sinai for almost a decade, and she's grown very close to Vanessa.

Isobel Loring:

I love you too.

The people I care about are the people that are working with us, that are helping us, that are here for us when we need them under all circumstances. If these people are not being allowed to work, there won't be people to take care of us. These communities that have elderly people, there are no Americans that really want to do those jobs.

Vanessa Joseph:

I like work here. We are family here. But it's so hard, hard, hard to go back in Haiti. I can't. Sometimes, I would like to see my mom, hug her because she's sick, but I can't.

Rachel Blumberg:

We're already looking at, unfortunately, replacing them. It's not what I want to do, but we're a 24/7 operation. We have to have our caregivers and our essential workers there.

William Brangham:

The Trump administration is still determining next steps in the court case that delayed the end of TPS to early next year.

In a recent statement, the Department of Homeland Security said: ""President Trump and Secretary Noem are restoring common sense to our immigration system and returning TPS to its original status, temporary.""

William Brangham:

Back outside Orlando, nurse Edelyne Jean is bracing for the next shoe to drop.

If it comes down to the government saying you have to leave, will you go back to Haiti or will you try to go somewhere else?

Edelyne Jean:

I don't see myself going back to Haiti, because, if I go, they will kill you. Eventually, they will. So I'm not going. And I have my daughter too. She was born here. She belongs here.

William Brangham:

With federal immigration policy changing almost daily, Edelyne is left worried that the life she has built in America could soon come to an end.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

""We're getting them out at record numbers,"" Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. ""We have an obligation to, and we're doing it.""

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it's not just the big bill's fresh infusion of funds fueling the president's agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

""Your agency is out of control,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would ""go broke"" by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an ""indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,"" often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump's long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

""We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,"" the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

""We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department's plan to disburse OBBBA funding,"" they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee ""to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated"" through the new law.

""ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,"" she said. ""This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.""

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it's what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a ""whole of government"" approach.

""They're orienting this huge shift,"" Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves ""inward.""

The flood of cash comes when Americans' views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a ""good thing"" for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump's approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from ""Alligator Alcatraz"" in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new ""Speedway Slammer"" in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador's notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the ""worst of the worst,"" and he dismissed as ""garbage"" the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

""There's no safe haven here,"" Homan said recently outside the White House. ""We're going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he'd do.""

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were ""begging for money.""

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aea4727/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6516x3421+0+462/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F32%2F20959c57412784d0aa53fef3143f%2Fap25209664058034.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 17:57:17.550387

The proposal was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review three weeks ago.

Though details are confidential until publication in the Federal Register, the proposed rule could seek to supplement or replace the annual H-1B cap lottery by giving priority in the selection process to registrants who meet or exceed certain criteria, such as wage or education level.

During the final weeks of the first Trump Administration, an alteration to the cap selection process was finalized by DHS that would have largely replaced the computerized H-1B lottery with a system that allocated H-1B visa numbers according to the Department of Labor’s four-level prevailing wage system. That regulation would have first distributed H-1B cap numbers to registrants offered a wage that equaled or exceeded Level IV, the highest wage tier of the prevailing wage system, then would have selected registrations in descending order from Wage Levels III, II, and I; a computerized lottery would have been used only if the number of registrations for a specific wage level exceeded the number of H-1B cap slots available. The final rule was postponed in the first days of the Biden Administration and ultimately vacated by a federal court without having been implemented.

It is not yet known whether the proposal now under review is the same as the rule finalized in early 2021.

It is expected that the proposed regulation will be released for publication in the Federal Register in the coming days or weeks, with a public comment period of 30 or 60 days. After giving meaningful consideration to the comments, the agency would then publish a final version of the rule with an implementation period.

“There are billions going to immigration facilities,” Linhorst said.","WASHINGTON — Government contracts fueled a financial boom this year for the two private prison companies that dominate the U.S. immigration detention industry.

The industry stands to gain further as the Trump administration expands the network of privately run detention sites nationally, targeting a goal of deporting 1 million immigrants this year.

From the detention facilities that private-prison firm GEO Group owns or leases, revenue for the second quarter this year jumped 12% from last year, driven largely by new contracts at facilities like Delaney Hall in Newark.

“Congrats again on the quarter and the fantastic growth opportunities ahead of us,” Joe Gomes, a financial analyst with Noble Capital Markets, told GEO Group executives on an earnings call last week.

Big rewards

Revenue for CoreCivic, the other major company in the nation’s corporate prison industry, rose about 10% over the same period, the company said. CoreCivic operates the Elizabeth Detention Center.

“Our business is perfectly aligned with the demands of this moment,” said Damon Hininger, CEO of CoreCivic, who praised a recent federal court ruling that cleared a path for new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities in New Jersey. “We strongly believe that this was the right decision,” he said.

Early in the second Trump administration, the private prison industry is riding a lucrative wave of government contracts and eyeing steps to grow further. Those plans include opening mothballed facilities, using GPS tracking devices to monitor undocumented immigrants and expanding air- and ground-based transportation of detainees.

The private operators are also looking to profit by expanding their reach by using military sites to hold detainees. Executives at GEO Group and CoreCivic said they were open to operating on military sites.

George Zoley, executive chairman of the GEO Group, said his company had reached agreements with a military contractor so that GEO could “pursue potential procurements that may be issued for operational support services at military sites.”

NJ military site

The U.S. government plans to use Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst for deportation flights and to hold between 1,000 and 3,000 undocumented immigrants there, according to plans NJ Spotlight News first reported.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has also publicly approved Camp Atterbury in Indiana and the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold undocumented immigrants.

‘The fact that there are new beds opening up today does not mean that they’re going to close when Trump leaves office’ — Molly Linhorst, attorney, ACLU of New Jersey

Lifting this financially lucrative wave for private prison firms is the roughly $170 billion in federal funding Congress allocated for the Trump administration, through a recently enacted law, to use on its hardline immigration agenda.

“I think it is an unprecedented opportunity for them,” Molly Linhorst, a staff attorney at the ACLU of New Jersey, said in an interview with NJ Spotlight News.

“There are billions going to immigration facilities,” Linhorst said. “The private prison companies are by no means strangers to the federal government.”

Billions to be spent

Both companies lobbied Congress on legislation that turned into the law that contained the approximately $170 billion portion of new funding, federal lobbying records show.

Zoley, of GEO Group, said the Delaney Hall site “remains in the process of ramping up,” describing its opening in February as an “important milestone.”

Delaney Hall, which can hold 1,000 detainees, is expected to make the company more than $60 million over its first year running, Zoley said.

The GEO Group has contracts to run 21 detention facilities nationwide, and the number of beds in its control — industry shorthand for how many people can be detained — grew from 15,000 to 20,000 from April through June this year. “This represents more than one-third of the current ICE detention levels, which we estimate to be approximately 57,000 beds nationwide,” Zoley said, adding that the company “stocked up the inventory of our monitoring devices” used to track immigrants who are not detained but after “ICE detention capacity” runs out.

The Trump administration has a goal of reaching 100,000 beds for ICE by the end of the year, an objective that could be met with the use of outdoor tents and military sites, like the joint base in New Jersey.

Whatever immigration detention apparatus is erected during the second Trump term will linger beyond, Linhorst predicted, noting the 15-year contract the U.S. government reached with GEO Group to run Delaney Hall.

“The fact that there are new beds opening up today does not mean that they’re going to close when Trump leaves office,” Linhorst said.

“Right now, it’s a huge moment,” Linhorst added. Yet what decisions the U.S. government reaches with the industry will carry on, she said. “There’s a lot of motive to continue to fill these beds.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/08/ICE-federal-agents-Delaney-Hall-ICE-protest.jpg,N,,2025-08-12 01:56:21.438391

Everett woman and son detained by ICE

Shaw is a New Zealand national who is in the process of applying for lawful permanent residency. Shaw currently holds a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that provides work authorization and advance parole, allowing international travel and re-entry.

Shaw’s work authorization was approved, although the advance parole was not. She immigrated to the U.S. three and a half years ago under sponsorship from her former husband, and qualified to reapply independently as a survivor of domestic abuse.

“I thought we had crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I,’” Besancon said. “Sarah had been waiting on some travel documents to be approved. But once her visa and her children’s visas were cleared, she felt comfortable taking them to Canada. We assumed everything was fine.”

Shaw currently works for the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families at the Echo Glen Children’s Center, a juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie. Shaw is also a member of Union Local 341.

Shaw is currently being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center, which is one of two facilities in the nation that house detained families facing deportation.

(Though immigration is considered a civil legal matter rather than a criminal one, people in immigration court do face charges that indicate why ICE thinks they are deportable.)
“I know you don’t want to be detained,” Grande told the man.
Accompanied by faith: Local faith leaders began showing up to immigration court daily this month to accompany people in response to ICE’s decision to arrest many after their hearings, Alexandra Mendoza reported for The San Diego-Union Tribune.","As Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains more and more people, courtrooms at Otay Mesa Detention Center have filled, leaving many family and friends hoping to see their loved ones’ hearings stuck instead in the facility lobby.

In June when I went to the detention center to watch a bond hearing for a man arrested at the downtown San Diego Immigration Court and detained at Otay Mesa, the line of members of the public trying to get into the court stretched almost to the lobby door. The guards working the front desk warned that we might not get in because of limited seating.

I watched as a family of nine had to choose which members to send up to the courtroom. Several community members were in line behind me to see the same case I was there to watch. I was the only one of us allowed up, and the processing took so long that even though we arrived at the facility well before the afternoon hearings began, I missed most of his hearing by the time I got upstairs to the court.

Guards escorted attorneys and members of the public to the courtrooms through a series of sliding metal doors controlled by badges.

It wasn’t the first time that I’d seen people denied entrance to the courtrooms due to space constraints. Each courtroom has rows of three benches on each side of the door. According to the guards, people in custody are not allowed to sit next to people not in custody, unless they are attorneys. That means if there is a detained person sitting on a bench, no member of the public can sit there.

The guards also don’t allow men in custody to sit on the same bench as women in custody, or men wearing blue, indicating ICE considers them low security level, to sit next to men wearing red, those ICE considers high security. Men in orange, people ICE has labeled medium level security, are usually grouped with those in red.

In July, I sat in the packed courtroom of Immigration Judge Guy Grande at Otay Mesa Detention Center, watching as person after person asked to be deported.

More than a dozen men squeezed into the three benches to the left of the door. The men in the first row wore orange, and those in the second two rows, which had five people crammed into each of them, wore blue. On the right, a row of women wearing either blue or orange filled the front bench. I sat with a couple of family members of one of the men in the second bench, and several more detained men sat in the bench behind us, including a man in red.

The man spoke with his son, a toddler in the row I was sitting in, and a guard moved him further away from the child so they wouldn’t speak.

Grande worked his way through the cases, including a few detained men that were held in San Luis Regional Detention Center in Arizona who appeared on a television screen along with the judge, who was using Webex from his courtroom in downtown San Diego to hear the cases.

As the afternoon stretched past 4 p.m., the time that immigration courts typically close, Grande called forward a man from Mexico who asked for voluntary departure.

The judge swore the man in and began reading through ICE’s allegations and charge. (Though immigration is considered a civil legal matter rather than a criminal one, people in immigration court do face charges that indicate why ICE thinks they are deportable.)

When the judge asked to confirm his nationality, the man said he was from Tijuana.

Grande told the man that ICE said he had overstayed his visa, that he had entered in October 2015 with a tourist visa.

The man corrected the judge. The last time he entered was in June 2025, less than two weeks before, he said.

“In 2025?” the judge said.

Yes, the man said.

He told the judge he’d been in the United States for about three days doing some shopping when ICE arrested him.

The judge turned to the ICE attorney in the courtroom and confirmed that normally someone can stay up to six months on that kind of tourist visa.

The judge looked at the date on the Notice to Appear, the document containing the allegations and charge that the Department of Homeland Security files with the court to start an immigration case. It was just a few days after the man said he’d entered the United States.

The ICE attorney asked for a continuance, saying she needed time to find the man’s arrest documents.

“I know you don’t want to be detained,” Grande told the man. “I wouldn’t want to be detained either.”

“The government doesn’t have the file, and it’s late in the day,” Grande added. “You could be in status. Maybe the government can’t sustain the charge.”

The man asked, with some disbelief in his voice, if the judge was suggesting he wait more time in custody to try to sort out the issue.

After more back and forth, Grande asked the man if he wanted the judge to terminate his case.

The man said he didn’t know what that meant.

The judge said he didn’t think based on the information in the Notice to Appear that he could order the man removed.

“I don’t want to be detained anymore,” the man said. “My family depends on me. I work in Tijuana to provide for my family.”

Over ICE’s objections, Grande terminated the case. When I checked for the man in ICE’s detainee database about a week later, he was no longer in custody.

Around 5:30 p.m., Grande still had several people in his courtroom waiting to ask to be deported.

“I am burned out,” Grande said. “This is beyond my pay grade.”

He told his clerk to set the remaining cases over for the following morning.

,Agencies,2025-08-12 01:31:21+00:00,The Intercept,ICE Agent Caught on Camera Disguised as a Construction Worker - The Intercept,Nick Turse,,,,,https://theintercept.com/2025/08/11/ice-agent-caught-on-camera-disguised-as-a-construction-worker/,"Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept that he spotted a second man who was similarly disguised as a construction worker.
“We started to reach out to all the states that have legislation concerning masked ICE agents and said, ‘Let’s do this jointly.
Soon, Fonseca Tapia said, realized that he was being followed in a vehicle by the man in the construction worker get-up.
After Fonseca Tapia stopped filming, he said that the masked agent issued a warning: “More of my guys are coming and we’re going to take care of you.” To Fonseca Tapia, that sounded like an act of intimidation.
ICE failed to answer The Intercept’s questions about the use of disguises by ICE agents and if the agent who failed to identify himself in Brewster had been reprimanded.","Despite their proclivity for wearing masks, the Department of Homeland Security denies that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents refuse to identify themselves in the field. “I’ve been on a number of these operations,” Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said last month. “They are wearing vests that say ICE or ERO, which is the enforcement arm of ICE or Homeland Security Investigations. They clearly verbally identify themselves.”

But video from a confrontation in a New York state town that was reviewed by The Intercept contradicts her claims.

In the footage, Juan Fonseca Tapia, the co-founder and organizer of the Connecticut-based immigrant advocacy group Greater Danbury Unites for Immigrants, questions a man dressed as a construction worker.

“What agency are you with?” asks Fonseca Tapia, filming through his car window.

“I’m not going to tell you,” responds the man, who is wearing a high-visibility construction vest, an orange helmet, and glasses, with a camouflage mask covering most of his face. “It’s none of your business.”

The construction worker getup was actually a disguise: ICE confirmed to The Intercept that the man in the hard hat is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. “ICE New York City officers were conducting surveillance in Brewster, New York, August 2, when anti-ICE agitators followed them and attempted to disrupt their operation,” an ICE spokesperson told The Intercept by email.

In the video — which was posted last weekend on social media by Greater Danbury Area Unites for Immigrants — the ICE agent said only that he is a member of “federal law enforcement.” Neither “ICE” nor “ERO” is visible on his vest in the footage.

That puts the lie to McLaughlin’s claims that ICE agents identify themselves.

Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept that he spotted a second man who was similarly disguised as a construction worker.

“I find it outrageous. It’s indefensible. This is where we are crossing a dangerous line on immigration enforcement into these paramilitary type tactics with a secret police force,” said New York state Sen. Patricia Fahy who last month introduced the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics, or MELT, Act, which would ban the use of face coverings and plainclothes by ICE and other federal enforcement agents during civilian immigration actions conducted in New York. “The first three words of the provision that we’re adding into law are ‘Masks and disguises prohibited,’ period. And this video is Exhibit A. This is exactly what we are alarmed about.”

On Tuesday, at a National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, Fahy joined colleagues from Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in condemning the use of “paramilitary-type secret police” tactics by ICE agents. “We started to reach out to all the states that have legislation concerning masked ICE agents and said, ‘Let’s do this jointly. Let’s collectively bring attention to this,’” Fahy told The Intercept. “We had a couple of dozen lawmakers all standing up to say ‘This is not who we are’ and calling out these authoritarian-type tactics.”

The interaction with the disguised construction worker began when Fonseca Tapia spotted a group of people he believed to be ICE agents in downtown Brewster. He began alerting day laborers who congregate in the area, while driving in his car. Soon, Fonseca Tapia said, realized that he was being followed in a vehicle by the man in the construction worker get-up. Eventually, he found himself surrounded by several vehicles with dark tinted windows.

Fonseca Tapia said that the man in the construction worker disguise confronted him and repeatedly tried to persuade him to roll down his window or get out of the car. He said he feared that he might be “kidnapped” by ICE.

After Fonseca Tapia stopped filming, he said that the masked agent issued a warning: “More of my guys are coming and we’re going to take care of you.”

To Fonseca Tapia, that sounded like an act of intimidation.

“It’s literally a threat,” said Fonseca Tapia. “You have three vehicles with very tinted windows, so it’s impossible to see inside. People are wearing masks and refuse to identify themselves, and one of them tells you he is going to call more of them to ‘take care of you’?” This is for sure an intimidation tactic to instill fear in people who are working to alert the community when there is an ICE presence.”

An ICE spokesperson cited “increased assaults toward ICE” as the reason that the ICE agent confronted individuals who followed and filmed them in Brewster. “The officer was concerned for the safety of himself and others,” the spokesperson wrote.

“I don’t know what the concern was — because he was following me,” said Fonseca Tapia. “If he thought I posed a threat, I don’t think he would put himself in danger by following me.”

Since Donald Trump’s return to office, masked ICE agents carrying out immigration raids have become increasingly common. Across the country, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies working with ICE launch operations wearing disguises or plainclothes and sometimes arrive in unmarked vehicles and arrest people without warrants. Often ICE agents don masks, balaclavas, neck gaiters, or other facial coverings to conceal their identities.

Lawmakers, veteran law enforcement officials, activists, and citizens have criticized the donning of masks by law enforcement as anti-American — for sowing confusion, chaos, and fear, while reducing accountability and undermining public trust.

“The failure of ICE officers and agents to promptly and clearly identify who they are and the authority under which they are acting has led witnesses of immigration enforcement operations to justifiably question the law enforcement status, authority, and constitutionality of ICE officers and agents and their operations,” wrote U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a May letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem; Tom Homan, the executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations; and top ICE officials. “We remain deeply concerned that ICE’s lack of transparency will lead the public to intercede in enforcement efforts, escalating an already tense interaction, and risking an entirely avoidable violent situation.”

Fahy emphasized that she had a family member who served in law enforcement and that she saw the use of masks and disguises as a threat to law and order. “It’s undermining all of law enforcement because they come across as impersonators. There’s no accountability and there’s no transparency, so it erodes public trust and undermines decades of work and millions of dollars spent,” she told The Intercept. “When they use disguises, these arrests — without presenting an arrest warrant, neither a judicial or even administrative warrant — come across as abductions or kidnapping. These are third-world tactics, and they should shock the collective conscience.”

The International Association of Chiefs of Police warns that “members of the general public may be intimidated or fearful of officers wearing a face covering, which may heighten their defensive reactions.”

An ICE spokesperson said the agency has no policy on masks, aside from pandemic safety requirements. The Department of Homeland Security has endorsed the agents’ right to wear masks, citing attacks on agents or the doxing of law enforcement or their families. In an email, DHS specifically mentioned one Texas man’s threat to shoot ICE agents as a reason to allow masks, although it was unclear how a mask would protect an agent from a bullet. Nonetheless, DHS insisted that because of such fears, ICE would not discourage its agents from wearing masks during anti-immigrant raids.

For almost two months, DHS has failed to respond to The Intercept’s questions about escalating statistics quoted by government officials about supposed assaults of federal agents. In June, DHS told The Intercept that “ICE law enforcement and their families are being targeted and are facing an over 400% increase in assaults.” ICE now claims that figure has jumped to 830 percent.

ICE failed to answer The Intercept’s questions about the use of disguises by ICE agents and if the agent who failed to identify himself in Brewster had been reprimanded. “At no time did the officer attempt to make an arrest or detain anyone without being plainly marked as an ICE officer,” the spokesperson said.

The New York City Bar Association has noted that secret police tactics are a gateway to further lawlessness. “Allowing masked ICE agents to conduct detentions also makes it increasingly likely that third-party actors will impersonate federal agents and use their anonymity to subject vulnerable populations to harassment and violence under the apparent color of law,” the group said in a June statement.

Bad actors have, indeed, masqueraded as ICE agents from coast to coast this year. Various people have reportedly impersonated ICE agents to commit or attempt robbery in Pennsylvania, kidnapping in Florida and South Carolina, scams in California, sexual assault in North Carolina, rape in New York, as well as acts of impersonation, intimidation and other offenses in California, Florida, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Washington state.

In Congress, Democrats have introduced several bills, including the No Secret Police Act, which would bar federal agents from concealing their faces with “home-made, non-tactical masks” and require law enforcement officers and DHS agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting people.

“If you uphold the peace of a democratic society, you should not be anonymous,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-N.Y., the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “DHS and ICE agents wearing masks and hiding identification echoes the tactics of secret police authoritarian regimes — and deviates from the practices of local law enforcement, which contributes to confusion in communities.”

An ICE spokesperson claimed the persons filming the agent in Brewster presented “a safety concern for the officers, the community and even the agitators themselves” and that the “ICE officer contacted the local police.”

The Village of Brewster Police Department, however, told The Intercept that it did not take part in any such interaction. The Putnam County Sheriff’s Office refused to entertain The Intercept’s questions. “We don’t have somebody that would handle even communicating that to the press if it was even for the press’s knowledge,” said a person who replied to a request for her name with “No, thank you,” before hanging up. A message left for the department’s civil affairs division was not returned.

Fonseca Tapia said that personnel from both the Brewster Police Department and the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office were called to the scene and spoke with him.

“This is a call to action for people to understand that this is wrong and this is not normal. Nobody is coming to save us. We are all we got,” Fonseca Tapia told The Intercept. “Now is the time for action. People need to get involved because today it’s immigrants’ rights, but who knows what group it’s going to be tomorrow?”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ICE-agent-disguise-e1754926711311.jpg?fit=1064%2C530&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-08-12 01:57:03.578276

ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility.
Oversight concerns and ICE facilities Cornyn underscored the need for congressional oversight of such locations, alluding to the current lawsuit by a number of democrats against the Trump administration.
Calling them ""humane and safe"" facilities, Cornyn noted some will be detained for as little as two weeks before being repatriated.
For others, they will be sent there to address overcrowding at other ICE facilities.","When Texas Sen. John Cornyn, R-TX, stopped in El Paso to visit the Camp East Montana migrant detention center on Fort Bliss, it was also to double down on national security rhetoric.

Cornyn's visit on Monday, Aug. 11, was only a ""windshield"" tour according to his office, but it also was an opportunity to echo much of the sentiment from the Trump administration on removing ""criminal aliens"" from the country.

""I call it the 'Lonestar Lockup' and it will hold up to 1,000 criminal aliens pending their repatriation to their countries of origin,"" Cornyn said. ""We're not talking about gardeners or housekeepers or people like that. We're talking about as many as 291,000 individuals that are illegal aliens with criminal charges pending or criminal convictions. They are also ones who have exhausted their legal remedies.""

The Trump administration plans to expand the facility by 250 beds each week until it reaches 1,000. Ultimately, Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to hold 5,000 people at the detention facility. That would make it the largest of its kind in the United States.

ICE is responsible for the management and operation of the Fort Bliss detention facility. El Paso's ICE spokesperson Leticia Zamarripa said in a news statement that it will provide detainees with access to legal representation and a law library, access to visitation and medical treatment, among other services, which detainees receive in other facilities.

""There's no due process issue involved here since these are people who didn't show up to their immigration hearing,"" Cornyn said. ""The judge issued an order of deportation, so they simply defied that and remained in the United States. Many people want to come to the United States, and there is a legal way to do that, and we honor and respect people who play by the rules.""

Cornyn aimed at the previous Biden administration for what he called ""open border policies"" that he claims did little to no vetting.

The Republican senator praised Trump's efforts to ""bring rule of law back,"" saying the nation needed a new president. He cited the lower number of immigrants crossing in areas like El Paso, which he attributed to the $175 billion allocated to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE for building facilities like Camp East Montana.

When will the facility be open?

""The facility is not yet open and will open in about a week with about 1,000 individuals detained there. ICE confirmed they will be given a medical exam and categorized by risk levels based on criminal records. They will be repatriated or sent to other facilities from this location,"" Cornyn said.

Cornyn also noted that it will not house families or children. Citing that it meets federal or state standards, he also said it will have adequate food and cooling from the Texas heat.

He also noted it will be a permanent facility, complete with hard walls ""for the foreseeable future,"" he said.

Oversight concerns and ICE facilities

Cornyn underscored the need for congressional oversight of such locations, alluding to the current lawsuit by a number of democrats against the Trump administration.

""I think congressional oversight is important, but that requires members of Congress not to committ acts of violence or disobediance of the laws themselves,"" Cornyn said. ""We've seen some people try to crash these facilities that are secured. They must do their job and not have members of Congress or anyone else to interfere. Once this location is open, it'll be avaiable at scheduled times for oversight and to the media to show the American people what they actually are.""

Calling them ""humane and safe"" facilities, Cornyn noted some will be detained for as little as two weeks before being repatriated. For others, they will be sent there to address overcrowding at other ICE facilities.

The Henrico, Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics LLC company was awarded a $231,878,229 firm-fixed-price contract to establish and operate a detention facility for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The contract comes on the heels of Presidential Executive Order 14159, which outlines using ""national security assets for law and order.""

Among the criticisms of the contract by congressional Democrats was that the company had little experience building expansive projects such as Camp East Montana.

""That's the reason there needs to be appropriate congressional oversight and we'll have a chance to monitor the location once it opens,"" Cornyn said.

He concluded there will be other facilities of this type across the country, but not on the scale of one on Fort Bliss.

Sentencing is scheduled for October 16, 2025, before United States District Judge Angela M. Martinez.

In his plea, Espinoza admitted that for a period of time leading up to March 2024, he recruited human smuggling drivers and coordinated the transportation of illegal aliens from areas near the Mexico border to places further in the interior of the United States. Espinoza’s involvement in the conspiracy was for personal financial gain and led to at least 25 illegal aliens receiving transportation.

Espinoza also admitted that on March 6, 2024, he coordinated an event in which a driver and a front seat passenger picked up two illegal aliens near Lukeville, Arizona. At some point while they were being transported, the aliens were told to get out of the vehicle. The two aliens then jumped, fell, or were pushed from the vehicle while it was still moving. As a result, one of the aliens hit his head on the ground, suffered serious injury, and died at the hospital two days later.

A conviction for Conspiracy to Transport Illegal Aliens for Profit carries a maximum penalty of ten years of imprisonment and a maximum fine of $250,000,000.

The investigation of this case is the result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 405 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 350 U.S. convictions; more than 305 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets

Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation in this case. The United States Attorney’s Office, District of Arizona, Tucson, is handling the prosecution.

After inspection by immigration officials, some were granted parole, which is a temporary permission to live in the U.S. legally.
“This sudden policy shift is the latest in the Trump-Vance administration’s assault on immigrants who have followed the rules.
“Ending parole status in this way is both unlawful and harmful to immigrant families by making them more vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation.
“ The plaintiffs are asking the court to reverse the termination of their parole and work authorization, restore their ability to stay, work, and apply for asylum or other immigration relief, and stop DHS from carrying out future mass arbitrary revocations of parole status.","Boston, MA – The Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts and three individuals from Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti filed suit today against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts by Democracy Forward and Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, challenges the Trump-Vance administration’s sudden and unlawful termination of the plaintiff’s parole status, which allowed them to live and work legally in the United States.

Starting in 2023, non-citizens seeking asylum or other immigration relief in the United States were required to use the CBP One mobile application to schedule appointments at ports of entry. After inspection by immigration officials, some were granted parole, which is a temporary permission to live in the U.S. legally.

However, in April 2025, through a mass email that read, “It is time for you to leave the United States,” DHS notified hundreds of thousands of non-citizens that their parole status was terminated, and, as a result, their work authorizations and eligibility for certain benefits were also revoked. The email, sent to non-citizens with the right to remain legally present in the U.S., and in some cases, the U.S. citizens representing them, threatened penalties to encourage self-deportation.

The filing states that this unlawful policy violates federal law, which requires a case-by-case determination that the purpose of parole was served before it can be ended, ignores non-citizens’ legal rights and disrupts their lives, costing them jobs, homes, access to health care, and placing them at risk of deportation.

“As a community-based organization, we have seen firsthand the direct harm this sudden policy inflicts on people who arrived lawfully, complied with every DHS requirement, including the CBP One process, and worked hard to build stable lives for their families. Stripping them of parole and work authorization without any individualized review is not only unlawful, it destabilizes families, weakens our communities, and undermines the trust immigrants place in the legal system. Our commitment is to stand with them and fight to ensure their rights are protected. At VAM, we believe that protecting migrants is protecting the future of our community,” said Carlina Velázquez and Carlos Martín Medina, Board of Directors, Venezuelan Association of Massachusetts.

“This sudden policy shift is the latest in the Trump-Vance administration’s assault on immigrants who have followed the rules. Let me be clear: none of this is about immigration, it’s about cruelty and the targeting of people in vulnerable circumstances,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “Our clients used the CBP One app because DHS required it. To now strip them of their rights and threaten them with deportation is a gross violation of the law and public trust. We’re honored to represent these individuals and to fight for accountability and justice. We will continue to go to court and use every legal tool available to hold this administration accountable.”

“When the government strips away a person’s status and work permit, it pushes entire families into poverty, destabilizes communities, and forces people to choose between basic survival and compliance with an unjust policy,” said Georgia Katsoulomitis, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. “Ending parole status in this way is both unlawful and harmful to immigrant families by making them more vulnerable to exploitation, detention, and deportation. “

The plaintiffs are asking the court to reverse the termination of their parole and work authorization, restore their ability to stay, work, and apply for asylum or other immigration relief, and stop DHS from carrying out future mass arbitrary revocations of parole status.

The three-day trial kicked off in San Francisco, with attorneys for the state arguing the deployment — which California Gov. Gavin Newsom strenuously objected to — violated a federal law against using military forces for domestic law enforcement.

The protests began June 6 as lawful demonstrations stemming from a series of raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that saw more than 100 illegal immigrants rounded up around the city.

Hundreds took to the streets, chanting in opposition and waving Mexican flags and anti-ICE signs while clashing with cops and federal immigration officers.

But the protests soon escalated into full-blown riots, with cars burned in the streets, public buildings vandalized and local businesses pillaged by looters.

As the violence dragged on, President Trump announced he was deploying some 4,000 Coast Guard members and around 700 active-duty Marines to the City of Angels to put an end to the anarchy.

Newsom condemned the deployments, saying it amounted to using soldiers as “props in the federal government’s propaganda machine.”

The Trump administration fired back, arguing the state’s sanctuary city laws preventing local law enforcement from upholding immigration laws made federal intervention necessary.

Newsom sued the administration, and federal Judge Charles R. Breyer — a former President Clinton appointee who is overseeing the California bench trial — ruled the deployment was illegal.

However, hours later an appeals court rejected Breyer’s ruling which cleared the way for the mobilization to continue.

By July 1, nearly all of the National Guard members and Marines called to Los Angeles had been released, with around 300 still in the city.

Those remaining on duty are “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agencies, William Harrington, former deputy chief of staff for the Army task force in charge of the Guard troops said in court Monday, according to the New York Times.

The trial could set a legal precedent for the extent of a commander-in-chief’s authority over the military on US soil.

Newsom’s lawyers are vehement that sending troops to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 federal law prohibiting the president from using armed forces to engage in civil law enforcement.

Attorneys for the state also argue that by deploying troops over the objections of the governor and other California officials, Trump violated the 10th Amendment of the Constitution, which delineates the balance of power between the federal government and US states.

Also being alleged is that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth violated the Administrative Procedure Act, arguing they “lack authority to federalize members of the California National Guard without issuing such orders through Governor Newsom,” the complaint reads.

Trump’s lawyers have staked their counter-argument on a little-known law — Section 12406(3) of the US Code — which permits the president to federalize the National Guard under certain circumstances.

""All our lives, we are taught to fear masked men in unmarked vehicles. We learn we should run from such men to avoid being kidnapped, sexually assaulted, or killed,"" 33 members of the Democratic Women's Caucus (DWC) wrote in a letter led by Reps. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas), and Nydia Velásquez (D-N.Y.) to Trump administration officials including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, and ""border czar"" Tom Homan.

""Yet, ICE is increasingly conducting raids and arrests in masks [and] plain clothes, without visible identification or badges, using unmarked vehicles—tactics that cause confusion, terror, and mistrust among the public,"" the letter continues. ""These tactics invited perpetrators of violence against women to take advantage of the chaos by impersonating masked ICE agents in order to target and sexually assault women.""

Reports of masked men—and in one case, a woman—impersonating federal officers began emerging shortly after President Donald Trump returned to the White House and ordered a mass deportation campaign that senior adviser Stephen Miller said aims to arrest at least 3,000 people per day. Since then, there have been reports of impostors abducting and subsequently sexually assaulting, robbing, or extorting women in states including Maryland, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

""This cannot continue and must be addressed immediately,"" the DWC letter insists. ""The Democratic Women's Caucus is committed to defending the rights of all women and girls to live in safety. We call on the department to recognize this pervasive issue and to take immediate action.""

""We demand that ICE agents visibly and clearly identify themselves when conducting immigration enforcement activities to stop enabling impersonators who leverage women's uncertainty and fear of immigration consequences to rape, harass, and abuse them,"" the congresswoman wrote.

""Your current practices leave women vulnerable to life-altering violence,"" the letter adds. ""It's past time to act. Just like local police officers, ICE agents must be required to wear visible and clear identification to ensure their safety, better protect women, and deter impersonators. Finally, impersonators must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law and this violence must be denounced by this administration.""

In a bid to unmask federal agents, Velázquez in June introduced the No Masks for ICE Act, which would ban agents from wearing facial coverings during enforcement actions and require them to wear clothing displaying their name and agency affiliation.

House lawmakers led by Reps. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) and Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) in June also introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would require all Department of Homeland Security and other federal law enforcement officers to show their faces and clearly display their badges and identification when detaining or arresting people.

Similar legislation—the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act of 2025—was introduced last month in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Also in July, upper chamber lawmakers led by Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Tim Kain (D-Va.) proposed the similar Immigration Enforcement Identification Act.

In separate incidents on July 3 and July 28, the men were each charged with driving without a valid license and offenses related to driving under the influence of alcohol. The State Attorney’s Office for the 12th Judicial Circuit dismissed the illegal entry charges against them, and requested that the sheriff’s office advice the arresting officer of the court’s order halting enforcement of the law, according to the status report.

A spokesperson for Uthmeier did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Watch the segment in the player above.

In a separate court filing, immigrants’ rights advocates who filed the lawsuit questioned whether state officials are using the blocked law to justify holding detainees at an isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”

Attorneys for the advocates provided the court an email apparently sent by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee to the offices of members of Congress, stating that Florida officials are relying on legal authority granted by the blocked law.

“ICE’s email raises serious concerns about potential violations of the Court’s injunction on a large scale,” attorneys for the immigrants’ rights groups wrote, asking the court to order the state to explain under what legal authority it’s holding people at the Everglades facility.

The Department of Homeland Security has put its Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s recruitment efforts into overdrive. As ICE attempts to boost its numbers to carry out Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the agency is carrying out an ad blitz. According to 404 Media, DHS is looking to run ads on streaming services like HBO Max and Hulu.

The landing page on the Join.ICE.gov website features an image of Uncle Sam with the all-capped headline “America Needs You.” Underneath, it eerily states: “America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.”

The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown.

When it comes to hiring requirements, the immigration agency is lowering the bar. Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that the agency would be eliminating the age cap for new hires, allowing people older than 40 and as young as 18 to join ICE’s ranks.

DHS is not only making it easier to become an ICE agent, but more financially attractive as well. The agency’s website touts that prospective agents could be entitled to signing bonuses of up to $50,000, the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment, and 25% premium pay.

The recruitment push is working. We know that it has brought in at least one new high-profile agent: 59-year-old actor and vocal Trump supporter Dean Cain, who once played Superman on TV. He shared on social media that he plans to become an ICE officer to “save America.”

Superman, literally an undocumented alien — like an actual alien from outer space — is now an ICE agent. You can’t make this stuff up.

Jokes aside, this drive to hire more personnel seems to be ideologically driven. ICE used to require employees to have an undergraduate degree, but not anymore. Apparently, you don’t even need a uniform. So many of the arrests we’re witnessing are being carried out by masked plainclothes officers.

The only real requirements to becoming an ICE agent these days seem to be a beating heart and an alignment with Trump’s deportation crackdown.

It’s almost like the president is building an army of sycophants — and he has the money to do it. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act set aside nearly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE specifically, making ICE the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.

Just to put this into perspective: ICE now receives more funds and resources than most national militaries. It’s rapidly becoming the nation’s largest domestic police force, its size and power doubling that of the FBI.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250811-ali-velshi-ice-split-vl-1242p-600d2f.jpg",N,,2025-08-11 20:56:54.969049

At least one Republican in the Colorado delegation, Rep. Gabe Evans of the 8th district, has also visited the GEO facility.
“We spoke with a detainee, we visited the pods, we visited the healthcare facility, and it led to many, many more questions,” Crow said.
Pettersen said when she walked through the facility, it felt “like a prison” even though it’s technically a civil detention facility.","The Democratic half of Colorado’s U.S. House delegation visited Colorado’s immigrant detention facility Monday and emerged with more questions than answers.

“After my 10th visit, this has been the most difficult visit in terms of getting information, getting answers out of the facility, out of the employees and being obstructed from conducting full oversight that I’ve had in over six years,” said Rep. Jason Crow, whose Congressional district includes the facility in Aurora. “It’s unacceptable.”

For starters, workers at the facility, managed by the private company GEO, declined to tell the representatives how many detainees were inside.

Crow, along with three of his Democratic colleagues representing the Denver metro area, Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen, okayed the tour of the GEO detention facility ahead of time with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

They were unhappy about that too, saying planned visits aren’t always the most honest.

“I've been in a lot of correctional facilities in my life, and if you have to give seven days notice, they clean up pretty good,” said DeGette, who represents Denver. “And we were told that the people in there were told to clean up and to spiff up and to make things look good. I'd like to see what happens normally in that facility.”

In addition to not being given a population count, the representatives said they also could not learn characteristics of the detainees, including how many had pending or prior criminal charges as opposed to those picked up as collateral detentions. All their questions were referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement headquarters in Washington, D.C.

Crow said he knows the office in Denver has this information, they’re just not giving it up.

“Because during intake, they actually assign people a level … a red, orange, green and blue based on the criminal records, so I know the facility knows who has been picked up because they’ve committed a violent crime versus everyone else,” he said. “My guess is if the last eight months have been any indication, we're not going to be getting a lot of great answers out of Washington either.”

The members also said they weren’t given clear guidance about how consistently detainees were able to access legal advice and whether they were given honest information about how to self-deport.

DeGette noted she did see Jeanette Vizguerra, a high-profile detainee inside the facility and a constituent of hers. Vizguerra has been in Colorado since the 1990s and was an outspoken critic of ICE and the country’s immigration policies. She was arrested in March and is fighting her deportation, but remains in custody.

The planning and authorization required for the visit on Monday directly undermines the Congressional role of oversight of the federal government, the members said.

Both Crow and Neguse, in recent months, have been turned away when they’ve tried unannounced visits, they said. At least one Republican in the Colorado delegation, Rep. Gabe Evans of the 8th district, has also visited the GEO facility. In June he said there were about 1,300 detainees being held there, with 57 percent of them having some kind of criminal history or pending charge.

“It is clear that the administration is violating federal law with respect to its unlawful policies regarding unannounced visits to detention facilities, as well as their policies regarding visits to field offices, which is why we're suing the Trump administration,” Neguse said. “There were difficulties getting information. And there’s certainly a lot that we intend to follow up on in the days and weeks ahead.”

Crow’s office has been routinely visiting the ICE facility since 2019, when there was a Mumps outbreak there. Usually, the congressman sent staffers, and those visits were a blend of announced and unannounced, but Crow’s staff says the GEO facility had always been cooperative, allowing staffers to test food temperatures, talk to detainees, evaluate the health facilities and log how many were detained and how many were released on any given week or month.

Then came 2025 and the second Trump term. They say their visit on Monday left all four of them with more questions.

“We spoke with a detainee, we visited the pods, we visited the healthcare facility, and it led to many, many more questions,” Crow said.

Pettersen said when she walked through the facility, it felt “like a prison” even though it’s technically a civil detention facility.

“We care deeply about making sure that the people who are being held there are treated humanely, that they have access to the healthcare that they need, but also that they're able to reach for assistance outside of this facility,” she said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1600-1024x768.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 18:56:34.243388

Generally, USCIS will no longer exempt classes or categories of foreign nationals from potential enforcement except in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. One update describes the circumstances under which USCIS issues Notices to Appear (NTAs). An NTA is a charging document that instructs foreign nationals to appear before an immigration judge and that commences removal (deportation) proceedings and referrals to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The update states that USCIS will now also issue NTAs in the following circumstances:

When required by statute or regulation, such as following termination of conditional permanent resident or refugee status.

In cases involving foreign nationals who have been arrested, charged with or convicted of a criminal offense once a benefit request has been denied or withdrawn, so long as they are not subject to mandatory detention.

In cases involving substantiated fraud or material misrepresentation upon adverse action of the benefit request or other unfavorable determination or action.

When a foreign national has no other lawful immigration status or authorization to remain in the United States upon denial or withdrawal of temporary protected status (TPS) after following procedures in the applicable regulations, where required, unless there is sufficient reason to delay issuance of or not issue the NTA.

When a foreign national has no other lawful immigration status or authorization to remain in the United States, upon issuance of an unfavorable decision of a benefit request.

In other special circumstances, such as following expiration or termination of parole if the foreign national is not lawfully present in the United States.

Upon issuance of an unfavorable decision when the beneficiary of an employment-based petition is not lawfully present or is otherwise removable and was the signatory on the I-129 petition.

The updated policy has led to an increased issuance of NTAs, including to H-1B workers within the 60-day grace period following termination of employment, undermining the regulations at 8 CFR 214.1(l)(2).

USCIS also clarified that beneficiaries of family-based petitions may be issued an NTA if they are otherwise removable, since a family-based immigrant petition accords no immigration status or relief from removal, notwithstanding that, in some cases, such beneficiaries may be eligible to adjust status. For example, a foreign national who has filed for adjustment of status (applied for a green card) based on marriage to a U.S. citizen and has overstayed their status or worked without authorization is deportable and inadmissible (not eligible to seek entry or stay in the United States) for such immigration violations. However, such violations are waived when an applicant seeks to adjust status to permanent resident based on the immediate relative relationship (such as marriage to a U.S. citizen). A similar waiver exists for adjustment of status applicants who are beneficiaries of employment-based petitions and have overstayed status, worked without authorization, or violated the terms and conditions of admission, so long as the aggregate period of violations is 180 days or fewer, among other requirements. As such, the updated USCIS policy undermines such waivers of inadmissibility.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-08/USCIS%20immigration%20websites%20bigstock%20245490841.jpg.webp?itok=E0LB1KV9,N,,2025-08-11 17:57:18.384863

Current Status of DACA

Current DACA recipients nationwide can continue to renew their lawful presence status – including their protection from deportation and work permit – every two years. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is currently not processing new, initial DACA applications. There are 525,210 active DACA recipients in the U.S. as of March 31, 2025.

.

Processing Delays

The number of DACA recipients decreased by an estimated 8,000 individuals between December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025. The reason for the decrease is unclear. While the number of active DACA recipients fluctuates each reporting period, as delayed applications are eventually processed and approved, the most recent drop was steeper than in previous quarters. The decline is potentially tied to processing delays at USCIS. The agency completed 2.7 million cases in the second quarter of fiscal year (FY) 2025 – an 18 percent drop compared to the same period last year. Processing delays risk pushing DACA recipients to fall out of status.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a mixed decision on January 17, 2025 regarding the legality of DACA in Texas v. United States. The Fifth Circuit found that DACA’s protection from deportation is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion and may be granted nationwide. The Fifth Circuit also determined that the work permit component of DACA is potentially unlawful but narrowed the injunction to apply only to the state of Texas. The narrow injunction came about because just one state – Texas – proved “an actual injury caused by the Final Rule” on DACA. The decision was stayed (paused) for multiple months to provide the parties in the case time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Fifth Circuit’s decision moved toward implementation after none of the parties in the case sought an appeal to the Supreme Court by the May 20, 2025 extended deadline. The Fifth Circuit’s decision, if fully implemented, would likely establish the following system:

Fifth Circuit’s Decision

Deferred Action. DACA’s protection from deportation would be allowed nationwide for current and (new) initial DACA recipients.

Employment Authorization Documents (EADs). Access to work permits for DACA recipients would be allowed nationwide for current and (new) initial DACA recipients, with the possible exception of Texas.

Initial DACA Applications. Dreamers who are eligible for DACA but do not currently have DACA could apply and be approved for the program. USCIS has not processed (new) initial DACA applications since October 2017 when litigation blocked new people from entering the program, permitting only renewals.

DACA in Texas. DACA recipients in Texas (current and new) could access the program’s protection from deportation, but potentially not work permits.

The case is now back before U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen of the Southern District of Texas, who must modify his original order to comply with the Fifth Circuit’s decision. Judge Hanen will determine how to implement the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Texas, in particular as it relates to work permits. DACA recipients in Texas could see a winding down of work authorization in the state.

Takeaway

The Fifth Circuit’s decision is in the process of going into effect. USCIS continues to accept, but is not processing, (new) initial DACA applications. Meanwhile, DACA recipients in Texas can continue to renew their status, including work permits, every two years. The next step is for Judge Hanen to issue a decision modifying his original order to comply with the Fifth Circuit’s decision.

Will USCIS process new DACA applications? What are the requirements?

Possibly. The Fifth Circuit decision allows USCIS to process new, initial DACA applications, but the agency may argue it is not required to process those new applications. The decision itself does not include explicit language requiring such an action.

To be eligible for DACA, young undocumented individuals would need to meet the program’s original requirements, which were first established in 2012 and are quite stringent:

Came to the U.S. before age 16;

Have resided continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007;

Were present in the U.S. on June 15, 2012;

Were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012;

Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a GED certificate, or that they have been honorably discharged from the military; and,

Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.

When USCIS was accepting new applicants for DACA, applicants were required to be at least 15 years of age. New applicants have been largely unable to obtain DACA since 2017, when the first Trump administration and subsequent litigation blocked the processing of new applications. Many Dreamers were too young to apply for DACA (due to the requirement to be at least 15 years of age) before USCIS stopped processing new DACA applications in 2017.

What will happen to DACA in Texas?

One possible scenario is that DACA recipients in Texas will be able to apply for protection from deportation, but potentially not work permits. Current DACA recipients in Texas who have work authorization will likely continue to maintain that authorization until it expires, but not be able to renew it.

Presumably, DACA recipients in Texas could renew their work permits if they move out of Texas to another state. There are 87,890 DACA recipients in Texas – the second highest number in the country. Texas could see a mass exodus of DACA recipients from the state.

Judge Hanen has so far not taken any steps to wind down DACA in Texas. MALDEF, an intervenor in the case on behalf of 22 DACA recipients, stated that with respect to employment authorization in Texas they will be, “advocating for an extended period of implementation that is respectful, to the maximum extent possible, of the important reliance interests identified by the Supreme Court in its 2020 decision rejecting the first Trump administration’s rescission of DACA.”

Where do DACA recipients live?

As of March 31, 2025, there are DACA recipients in every U.S. state, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico.

.

Demographics

Most DACA recipients are female (54 percent) and both the average and median age of a DACA recipient is 31, though most (37 percent) are between ages 26 to 30. Most are single (66 percent), but 31 percent are married. A smaller percentage is divorced (3 percent), and 690 DACA recipients are widowed. They have all lived in the U.S. since at least June 15, 2007, more than 18 years ago.

What is the solution?

Congress must pass a bipartisan, legislative solution to protect Dreamers, including DACA recipients, and provide them with permanent legal status.

DACA lacks long-term permanence. DACA recipients in Texas, and perhaps in the future in other states, run the risk of no longer being able to access work permits. This loss would have a deep, significant impact on the personal and economic well-being of DACA recipients, as well as their families, communities, and employers. Without access to work permits, DACA recipients will not be able to work legally in the U.S. and the country will not benefit from their skills and contributions.

The Trump administration may also decide to make another attempt to end DACA. The Trump administration attempted to end DACA in 2017. At the time, the administration did not use proper procedures or provide a well-reasoned explanation for its actions, which led to litigation that ultimately blocked the attempted end of DACA on procedural grounds. The administration may once again try to end DACA, this time through a more proper process.

Congress is the only body that can provide DACA recipients and other Dreamers, including DACA-eligible individuals, with an opportunity to stay in the U.S. Such legislation would cement the contributions of Dreamers in America.

I’ve gone through public schools my entire life.
Fortune: I am in favor of really making sure all of our public schools are quality.
Public Schools first.
All of our public schools should be fully funded so that every child in public school gets a great education.","HARTFORD – Ruth Fortune told CT Examiner Monday that she’s challenging Rep. John Larson for his seat in Congress in an effort to make public her story as an undocumented immigrant for 17 years, saying it’s critical for Democrats to push back against the administration of President Donald Trump on almost every important issue.

“I think there is a real hunger right now and a craving among people to see their elected officials really fight for them and fight for ways to make their lives better and for our democracy and our civil liberties that are under attack,” said Fortune, a 37-year-old member of the Hartford Board of Education and an associate at the Connecticut law firm Wiggin & Dana, where she specializes in trusts and estates.

“I’m not seeing, particularly on our Democratic side, the fight as aggressively as it should be happening. So much is at stake right now that we just have to be more bold. We have to be more audacious with how we not only push back against the Trump administration and fascism, but also advocate for the values we hold dear.”

Fortune is one of three people to announce their intention to primary Larson, a 14-term incumbent Democrat. But she declined to criticize him directly.

Fortune said that – if elected — she’d fight for making “life more affordable for people, assisting families as they support each other, and making our communities safer instead of having masked ICE agents taking people off the streets.”

Fortune moved to the United States when she was 12 years old and spent her high school years in Long Island, New York. Fortune did not become a U.S. citizen until February 2017, 17 years after entering the country with her family from Haiti.

Fortune told CT Examiner that she’d been thinking of running the “past seven or nine months, give or take. I’ve wanted to be in public service through elected office for a really long time because of my [personal] background.”

In addition to Fortune, former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and Southington Councilman Jack Perry have filed papers to challenge Larson in a primary.

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity

CTEx: Your family left Haiti when you were 12 years old and you and your family came to this country as undocumented immigrants. Please tell us how the Trump administration’s plans and policies to crack down on undocumented immigrants affected you personally and what would and could you do – if elected to the U.S. Congress – regarding ICEs efforts throughout the country and in this state related to detaining undocumented immigrants?

Ruth Fortune: The Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration is not only morally wrong, it’s really bad as well for our economy, bad for our country. When I was undocumented with no path to legalization, it wasn’t until a really awful earthquake in Haiti in 2010 that the Obama administration’s response to it was a humanitarian one, a compassionate one. They chose to give Haitians who were living here without documentation, TPS, temporary protected status, that allowed us to work here lawfully and not have to fear deportation. This is the same status that I would have [today]. I would still have TPS. There would have been no path for me to citizenship, but for having fallen in love with a U.S. citizen [husband, former Wall Street Journal reporter David Reynolds] and gotten a Green Card through him and ultimately my citizenship. There are so many immigrants who are here who have some type of temporary status, whether it’s TPS, whether it’s DACA [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals], or a number of other types of temporary status. The Trump administration is cutting those programs, essentially converting these lawful immigrants into undocumented people so that they could meet their quotas of deporting people and getting to name call people illegal aliens.

The way they are approaching immigration enforcement is destabilizing, and it puts all of our constitutional rights at risk. We have to push for a path to citizenship for the hard working immigrants who have been here, who have contributed to our economy, who’ve raised their families here, who’ve made this place their home, who love this country. I could have been one of these people now who would be detained, but for having married a U.S. citizen. There are people who’ve been here for decades, many years, who are such a key part of our fabric. Yes, the only way to protect these people and to not make them vulnerable and expose them to whoever happens to be at the White House is to fight for a path to citizenship

CTEx: What is your biggest qualm and or disagreement with Rep. John Larson –- and please be specific –- and what will you do differently on those policy disagreements?

Fortune: I’m running not because of who represents me in Congress right now, but because of what I know I can do for our district as a mother of young children, a formerly undocumented person who came to this country seeking economic opportunity, seeking the safety of our democracy and the safety that our institutions offer. I’ve had to play offense and defense my whole life, and I want to do that for my country now. I’ve been here [United States] since I was 12. This is the country that I call home. This is where I’m raising my family. I want to give back to this country that has afforded me so many opportunities that I really could not have fathomed back in Haiti. I want to use everything that I have, all that this country has offered me, to fight back, not just to protect our democracy and to protect our civil liberties and expand our constitutional rights, but also to fight to repair the broken systems that have held me down and I’ve that had to overcome because it’s holding other people down in many different ways. Whether it’s not having a living wage; families are struggling more to make ends meet. Housing is becoming less affordable. Health care is more of a privilege. There’s so much that we can do. We need to play defense and play offense to make lives better for so many Americans.

CTEx: By all accounts, your decision to challenge and then defeat a long-time incumbent congressman in a primary is a longshot. Why should people take your candidacy seriously and what is the number one reason the people of the First District should vote for Ruth Fortune over John Larson?

Fortune: I like to say that we don’t only need a new generation of leaders, but we need a new breed of leaders. We need leaders who understand how deeply broken our systems are, and someone like me, who’s been held down by the system and who’ve had to overcome and work my way through the system. I have a deep understanding of how deeply rooted that brokenness is, and what it takes to repair these systems – to allow hard working people to achieve their goals, versus just struggling to get by. And that’s what we need more of in [Washington] D.C. We have so many career politicians with years of experience [and the] same issues that have plagued us for generations – many of them have worsened. And in so, in allowing that to happen, we have someone like Trump who’s exploited these issues and is actually not improving life for anyone. He’s making life harder. He’s terrorizing people in our streets, people are disappearing [because of ICE]. He’s arming ICE as his domestic military force. He’s turning the government against the American people, and we should all be taking that very seriously.

CTEx: As a current Hartford Board of Education member and as someone who was only able to attend the $4,000 annual in-state tuition to Baruch College in New York by waitressing, what – specific – education policies would you like to see implemented in the U.S. Congress that would have a positive impact on children in the state. And, do you support charter schools – seen by some Connecticut Democrats and union leaders as taking away resources from a public school education?

Fortune: We have to start fully funding our public schools. Whether or not you have a quality public education should not be affected by what zip code a child has, whether you live in an urban area, a rural or suburban area. All of our schools are the path right to equalizing our society, to giving every child a fair chance. And the reality is, the children who have the least opportunity are the ones who really, really need this equal opportunity the most in our schools. I probably would not be here, but for having had a really great public education, from middle school through college through law school. I’ve gone through public schools my entire life. My children now are at Hartford Public Schools, and what I see on the [school] board is that because of the lack of funding, we’re faced with very difficult decisions.

CTEx: Do you support charter schools?

Fortune: I am in favor of really making sure all of our public schools are quality. Public Schools first. It should not be that some schools are great, some schools are not so great, and other schools are failing out. All of our public schools should be fully funded so that every child in public school gets a great education. And if other parents choose to do something else for their children, that is absolutely their decision. It is up to those parents, but when it comes to our public dollars, we’re paying federal taxes, paying state taxes, those funds should really be making sure that our public schools are well funded.

CTEx: What political leader – from statewide or national politics and alive or deceased – do you most admire and would like to emulate and please be specific

Fortune: The first person who came to mind is Shirley Chisholm. She was the first woman of color to run for Congress, just such a bold leader, but also someone who had such a strong moral compass. I sometimes would imagine what she would say right now, and how fearless she would be, how strong she has been to advocate for people who have struggled. She just embodies the American spirit. I absolutely admire Shirley Chisholm.

CTEx: President Trump and Russian President Putin are scheduled to meet Friday in Alaska in an effort to come up with a plan to resolve the conflict in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Do you think Ukraine needs to be a part of that conversation and what – specifically – would you want to see in the region that would accelerate peace for both sides?

Fortune: I absolutely think President [Volodymyr] Zelensky should be part of any conversation that includes Ukraine. He’s the leader of that country, and also because of President Putin’s misleading approaches, it’s detrimental to Ukraine to not have their own representative there. To really talk about a country, their leaders should be present. Absolutely.

CTEx: In the last seven months, has there been anything that the Trump administration has gotten right? And, what’s your single biggest concern about what they’ve gotten wrong?

Fortune: It is hard to think of what the Trump administration has gotten right in the last seven months, because what they’ve done is terrorize people on our streets. People are disappearing off of our streets. They have economic policies that are, it’s hard to even really call them policy, they’re just such discombobulated ideas. Tariffs that seem to be driven more by how he feels and who he happens to like at any given moment. It’s just the lack of long-term planning and a strategic approach to all of these policies that are really affecting Americans, affecting our economy and affecting where we stand in the world. We’re alienating our allies. We’re imposing tariffs arbitrarily, it seems, on our partners and it’s detrimental to our long term health as a country.

CTEx: Gov. Ned Lamont declared an emergency to fill a possible $284 million Medicaid shortfall in May. How would you tackle this issue if elected to Congress?

Fortune: We need to have health care as a right in this country, not as a privilege. We should have – instead of quotas that this administration has for how many deportations should happen every day or quotas on how many people need to be arrested and detained today – goals for how many Americans who are uninsured or underinsured will get access to health insurance in this country. Why don’t we have new goals about how many of our public schools that are struggling, because of lack of funding, we will fully fund so that we can educate our children. And Medicaid is a great program. We need to expand Medicaid, but we need federal dollars to do that. The state doesn’t have unlimited funds. It’s great what we’re doing in Connecticut that we have the ability to do that [fill Medicaid shortfall] and within Medicaid as well, we need to be supporting our older Americans who need long term care right now.

How the National Guard deployment in DC will work According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority.
That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation’s capital — though, at the moment, that doesn’t appear to be the plan.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.","President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city’s streets at any given time, the Army said.

Trump’s directive on Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials.

How the National Guard deployment in DC will work

According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation’s capital — though, at the moment, that doesn’t appear to be the plan.

“Their duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,” according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.

Hegseth told reporters that Guard members will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.” He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units — other specialized units,” though he didn’t offer any further details.

The timeline for the troop deployment also is vaguely defined. According to Trump’s directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines “that conditions of law and order have been restored.”

Besides the 800 Guard members, Trump said “we will bring in the military if it’s needed” — seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard — but added that “I don’t think we’ll need it.”

Trump recently sent Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles

The deployment of troops to Washington comes after the Pentagon has pulled out the vast majority of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines that Trump sent to Los Angeles in late June.

Trump argued that the deployment was necessary after his administration’s immigration crackdown led to protests throughout the city. Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids.

Hegseth compared plans to send troops into the nation’s capital to their deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border and to Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

However, California’s governor and city officials argued that the LA deployment was unnecessary and went to court to try to fight it.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard’s primary mission had been to guard two buildings that “frankly didn’t need to be guarded.”

In addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws.

“I just think that’s not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC’s “The Weekend.”

Trump deployed the Guard to Washington in his first term

This is also not the first time Trump unilaterally has chosen to use federal forces in the U.S. capital.

In 2020, during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Trump deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to the city, at one point using them to forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a square near the White House so he could stage a photo op.

It became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley’s presence as the military’s endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens. Milley later apologized.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/news/npr-stories/nx-s1-5495338/ap25021067739810-scaled-e1754672821815-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 20:56:50.438084

In March, Orrick blocked the administration from stripping those cities of any funding, blocking the enforcement of an executive order designed to punish self-proclaimed sanctuary cities.
“The cities and counties have also demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm,” Orrick wrote.
Forcing Chicago and Illinois law enforcement officials to help federal agents conduct deportation operations is unconstitutional, Jenkins ruled.
Chicago expects to receive approximately $3.5 billion in new and existing federal grant dollars in 2025, officials said.","A federal judge allowed Chicago to join a lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from yanking funding from cities and counties across the country because they have laws designed to protect undocumented immigrants by prohibiting state local law enforcement officials from helping federal agents.

U.S. District Judge William Orrick agreed Aug. 5 to allow Chicago and 33 other cities and counties, including Los Angeles, Denver, Boston and Baltimore, to join the lawsuit that claimed the Trump administration was unlawfully trying to force local officials to help federal immigration agents conduct deportation efforts.

Read Orrick’s full order.

“The city is pleased that the court has allowed Chicago and 33 other jurisdictions to join the lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration’s efforts to punish local governments that decline to enforce the administration’s civil immigration policy priorities,” according to a statement from a spokesperson for the Chicago Department of Law.

San Francisco officials filed the original lawsuit on behalf of nine California cities and counties, including Oakland and San Diego, as well as Seattle, Minneapolis, St. Paul and Santa Fe.

In March, Orrick blocked the administration from stripping those cities of any funding, blocking the enforcement of an executive order designed to punish self-proclaimed sanctuary cities.

“The cities and counties have also demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm,” Orrick wrote. “The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the cities and counties and the communities they serve.”

That order does not apply to Chicago but is likely to bolster efforts by city officials to prevent President Donald Trump from blowing a $3 billion hole in Chicago’s budget.

Lawyers representing Chicago will ask Orrick to expand his preliminary injunction to include the 34 new plaintiffs at a hearing set for Wednesday, records show.

A federal judge tossed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that sought to invalidate Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance and the Illinois Trust Act because they are “an intentional effort to obstruct the federal government’s enforcement of federal immigration law and to impede consultation and communication between federal, state, and local law enforcement officials that is necessary for federal officials to carry out federal immigration law and keep Americans safe,” according to the lawsuit.

U.S. District Court Judge Lindsay Jenkins’ decision to grant Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s request to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice without holding a full trial is a major win for officials seeking to prevent federal officials from slashing billions of dollars in federal aid to Chicago and Illinois.

Forcing Chicago and Illinois law enforcement officials to help federal agents conduct deportation operations is unconstitutional, Jenkins ruled.

Johnson and Pritzker have repeatedly said Chicago and Illinois will continue to prohibit local and state law enforcement agents from helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents deport undocumented residents unless they have been convicted of a crime.

Chicago expects to receive approximately $3.5 billion in new and existing federal grant dollars in 2025, officials said. The city’s 2025 budget is $17.1 billion.

In addition, the CTA expects to receive $1.9 billion from the federal government to extend the Red Line south to 130th Street and CPS received $1.3 billion from the federal government during the 2024-25 fiscal year.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-11 17:57:22.586079

The order to restore the database takes effect Friday, though the administration could still attempt to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.
The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was unanimous in its ruling.
Trump has faced bipartisan pressure to restore the tracker, but the administration contends it contains sensitive information that could pose a national security threat.
Circuit came after U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled last month that the administration must restore the database.","A federal appeals court on Saturday ordered the Trump administration to restore a public database showing how federal funding is apportioned.

The administration disabled the database in March as it stared down several lawsuits challenging funding freezes, claiming Congress’s mandate to make the data public infringed on President Trump’s core executive authority.

“To hear the Government tell it, the separation of powers hangs in the balance and only this Court can set things right. But when it comes to appropriations, our Constitution has made plain that congressional power is at its zenith,” U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson wrote.

The order to restore the database takes effect Friday, though the administration could still attempt to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was unanimous in its ruling.

An appointee of former President George H. W. Bush, Henderson was the panel’s sole judge appointed by a Republican president. She was joined by Robert Wilkins, an appointee of former President Obama, and Brad Garcia, an appointee of former President Biden.

Henderson decried the administration in her 25-page statement, which Wilkins joined. It began with a reference to the 17th-century English Civil War between the Stuart monarchs and Parliament.

“By the end of the upheaval, Parliament emerged supreme in matters of taxation and spending. Our Constitution followed suit, granting the Congress plenary control over the public fisc,” Henderson wrote.

“Recently, the Executive has once again locked horns in a struggle for control over the purse strings.”

Two private groups that regularly sue the Trump administration, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Protect Democracy, challenged the takedown in April. They cited two recent congressional spending deals that require the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to make apportionment decisions publicly available within two business days.

“They will be deprived of information that the Founding generation—from Franklin to Jefferson to Madison to Mason—all thought vital to our Republic,” Henderson wrote in her ruling.

Trump has faced bipartisan pressure to restore the tracker, but the administration contends it contains sensitive information that could pose a national security threat. The Justice Department also argued the two groups have no right to sue, and the requirement to post the data is unconstitutional.

The administration’s appeal to the D.C. Circuit came after U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan ruled last month that the administration must restore the database.

The D.C. Circuit halted the ruling as it considered the administration’s request for a longer pause. Saturday’s ruling lasts until the court resolves the appeal, which will now proceed in normal course.

More than 835,000 people have been approved as DACA recipients, also known as ""Dreamers,"" in the time the program has existed. The number of active recipients was as high as 702,000 in 2018, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Now it's about 525,210.

DACA was started by the Obama administration in 2012 to protect young people who were brought to the United States illegally as children. The protections prevent them from being deported and also provide eligibility for work authorization.

""But for the people who have been on DACA for years and are renewing their status, you know, I think the program has felt a little bit like it's on life support for a while,"" said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute, explaining that this is because of the ongoing litigation and court rulings.

Litigation about the legality of DACA has been ongoing since 2017, when the first Trump administration rescinded the program.

The Supreme Court upheld the DACA program in 2020, but under active litigation, the program is only processing renewals and not approving any new applicants. The most USCIS recent report from March shows no new applicants were approved in fiscal years 2025 or 2024, and just two applicants were approved in fiscal years 2023 and 2022.

""So there are tens of thousands – at least – of young people who aged into DACA eligibility since 2017 and haven't had the opportunity to apply for DACA,"" Gelatt said.

As of March 31, 2025, the number of pending applications had grown to more than 101,000, according to USCIS.

The trend also comes as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services removed DACA recipients from being eligible for federal health care options under the Affordable Care Act.

Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security has recently said DACA recipients are not protected from deportation and is promoting self-deportation through the CBP Home App.

The Hearst Television Data Team analyzed data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to see where the half a million active DACA recipients remaining live. Out of 525,210 active DACA recipients as of March 31, more than 28% resided in California.

California also had the highest number of recipients per 100,000 residents at about 374. Behind it were Nevada and Texas.

About three-quarters of adults say they are in favor of granting permanent legal status to children who were brought to the U.S. illegally, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2020.

But even so, the uncertain fate of the program as it goes through courts and the government sends new messaging by encouraging self-deportation.

What is the logic in saying that individuals should be denied asylum because the persecuted group they are a part of is too large?
In a country where any group of people is widely persecuted, it shouldn’t matter whether that group is large or small to decide whether one of its members needs protection.
But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.
Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group.","In a recent decision denying asylum to a Salvadoran woman being stalked by gang members, the Board of Immigration Appeals — the highest administrative body for interpreting US immigration law — found that under US law, her claim that Salvadoran women constitute a group of people at risk of persecution was “overbroad and insufficiently particular to be cognizable.”

The foundation of refugee law — both internationally and in the US — is that asylum should be provided to a person with a well-founded fear of being persecuted on any of five grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or “membership in a particular social group.” This last category is intended to protect people similarly exposed to persecution as the other four groups because of immutable characteristics that cannot be changed or beliefs so fundamental they should not be required to change them.

There are precedents in both US and international law for treating women as a “particular social group.” In Perdomo v. Holder and Mohammed v. Gonzales, the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals recognized that gender is an “innate characteristic” that is “fundamental to [one’s] identity.” In two cases, the European Union Court of Justice found that Afghan women, as women, are subject to persecution.

But in denying this woman’s claim, the Board said, “If we held that groups defined solely by sex were cognizable, we would essentially create another protected ground under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] — that of sex — to add to the grounds of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.” That, it said, would be a job for Congress.

Because “membership in a particular social group” is so open to interpretation — including very narrow interpretations like the Board’s — the challenge to Congress should be raised.

What is the logic in saying that individuals should be denied asylum because the persecuted group they are a part of is too large? In a country where any group of people is widely persecuted, it shouldn’t matter whether that group is large or small to decide whether one of its members needs protection. All that should matter is the likelihood of the risk that person faces and the severity of the threat to them or of the abuse they have experienced.

Of course, being a woman per se is not grounds for asylum, any more than being a member of any race, nationality or religion. But gender should be similarly recognized as a category deserving protection if it is the reason a specific woman is being persecuted.

Some women have advanced successful asylum claims by identifying themselves as members of a small, highly specific group. In the landmark Fauzia Kasinga case, a woman fleeing genital mutilation was granted asylum not based on her right not to be persecuted on the basis of her gender, but rather as a member of a particular social group, defined as “young women who are members of the Tchamba-Kasungu Tribe of northern Togo who have not been subjected to female genital mutilation, as practiced by that tribe, and who oppose the practice.” A more narrowly defined group is hardly conceivable.

Often, though, the compulsion to particularize can distort the reality of persecution. Consider women in Afghanistan under the Taliban. All Afghan girls are barred from education beyond the sixth grade. No woman is allowed to attend university and all face severe restrictions on employment. A woman is not allowed to walk outside her home unless accompanied by a male relative, limiting access to public spaces and services, including access to health care. Violations of the hijab dress code and other draconian rules are met with severe punishment.

In September 2024, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan said the “Taliban’s institutionalized system of…gender persecution…impacts almost the entire population.”

When Congress next looks at US immigration law, it should question why women should have to shoehorn their claims into a narrow understanding of membership of a particular social group and thereby have less consistent or predictable protection than racial, religious, nationality and political groups. In light of the Board of Immigration Appeals’ narrow reading of existing law, Congress should amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to add gender as an unequivocally protected ground of the refugee definition standing alongside race, religion, nationality and political opinion.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-11 15:57:09.448203

,Policy,2025-08-11 19:04:27+00:00,www.nytimes.com,Live Updates: Trump Orders National Guard to Washington and Takeover of Capital's Police,"Katie Rogers, Campbell Robertson, Chris Cameron, Karoun Demirjian, Shawn Hubler, Annie Karni, Michael Gold, Darren Sands, Brent McDonald, Shawn McCreesh",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/11/us/trump-news,"Mr. Trump pardoned hundreds of rioters, many of whom had already been convicted of crimes and were serving sentences before being immediately released in January.
Since July 1, the Pentagon has released most of the roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard who were federalized, along with 700 Marines.
It belongs to the people who live here, and Trump can’t have it.” Mr. Trump has frequently railed against crime in Washington.
That means that what Mr. Trump announced on Monday was essentially a show of force that will expire on Sept. 10.
She said Mr. Trump should focus on addressing the root causes of crime before sending in the National Guard.","Mr. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the federal takeover of the capital’s Metropolitan Police Department and, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side, added that he was prepared to send the military into Washington “if needed.” A White House official said the takeover was intended to last for 30 days.

Mayor Muriel Bowser struck a diplomatic tone, acknowledging the president’s authority to temporarily take over the city police even as she disputed his rationale and his depictions of life in the city. Although his actions were “unsettling and unprecedented,” Ms. Bowser said Mr. Trump’s announcement did not come as much of a surprise, given his previous rhetoric.

Brian Schwalb, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, earlier offered a more forceful response, calling the federal takeover “unlawful” and saying he “will do what’s necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.”

Mr. Trump also threatened to expand his efforts to other cities, including Chicago, if they did not deal with crime rates he claimed were “out of control.” But Mr. Trump’s authority to intervene elsewhere would be more limited: His announcement on Monday invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act that grants him the power to temporarily seize control of the city’s police department.

Here’s what else to know:

D.C. deployment: The Trump administration also plans to temporarily reassign 120 F.B.I. agents in Washington to nighttime patrol duties as part of the crackdown, according to people familiar with the matter. Residents expressed skepticism of the president’s actions, which also prompted protests.

Dystopian claims: Mr. Trump’s most recent threats to take control of Washington came after a prominent member of the Department of Government Efficiency, his federal cost-cutting initiative, reported being beaten in an attempted carjacking. But on Monday he sought to lay out an even darker version of the city, overrun by violent crime and anarchy, that many who live in it are unlikely to recognize.

Familiar targets: In portraying crime as out of control in cities across the country, he listed familiar targets like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago but did not mention cities in Republican-led states with the highest murder rates: Memphis, St. Louis or New Orleans. He also ignored the most violent episode in Washington’s recent history: the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, where his supporters sought to stop the certification of the 2020 election he lost. Mr. Trump pardoned hundreds of rioters, many of whom had already been convicted of crimes and were serving sentences before being immediately released in January.

Earlier deployments: This summer, Mr. Trump deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles with orders to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. A suit brought by California officials challenging the deployment’s legality went to trial on Monday, although most of the troops have since been withdrawn. And in his first term, Mr. Trump called up National Guard soldiers and federal law enforcement personnel to forcibly clear peaceful protests during the Black Lives Matter protests after the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

Since July 1, the Pentagon has released most of the roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard who were federalized, along with 700 Marines. A sprawling tent city that was erected in June to house thousands of soldiers at a military base south of Los Angeles in Los Alamitos is being dismantled. Only about 300 troops remain.

Testifying in federal court on Monday, William Harrington, who until last week was the deputy chief of staff for the Army task force with tactical control over the Guard troops, said that those still on duty in Los Angeles were “supporting the request for assistance” from federal law enforcement agents.

But officials at the California National Guard and the military’s Northern Command, which is overseeing the force, said earlier Monday that the remaining troops were mostly on standby or guarding federal buildings and not being used for immigration enforcement.

The Los Angeles protests lasted several days in early June and were largely confined to a section of downtown. Democratic leaders in the state said the administration had provoked them by sending masked and armed federal agents into workplaces to detain immigrants who otherwise had no criminal records, then used the subsequent public outrage as a pretext to intervene militarily.

Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles compared the mobilization to an “armed occupation.” Mr. Newsom called it political theater, and said the president was using service members as “props in the federal government’s propaganda machine.”

Trump administration officials said the troops were necessary to protect federal agents in a jurisdiction where state sanctuary laws prohibited local authorities from conducting immigration enforcement. They said the protests had overwhelmed local law enforcement agencies.

The state swiftly sued to end the mobilization, which a federal judge ruled to be illegal. But an appeals court blocked that ruling, allowing the deployment to continue. By mid-June, the protests had died down but the troops were accompanying federal agents conducting immigration enforcement.

California officials say those assignments amount to an illegal use of federal troops to conduct domestic law enforcement. The Trump administration has contended the troops were merely escorting federal agents.

In the interim, complaints have mounted from those who have been deployed.

On the base near Los Angeles where the troops have been stationed, soldiers have complained that only a small fraction of them were even given assignments beyond the base. Those who were sent out typically were ordered to guard federal facilities or provide backup to immigration agents delivering warrants or conducting arrests.

In July, for example, one National Guard contingent sat in trucks while immigration agents conducted a show of force in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Another contingent faced protesters in a field outside a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County.

State authorities have complained that the activation has damaged the California National Guard’s ability to handle other critical duties, including drug interdiction and wildfire management. In interviews with The New York Times, several members of the California National Guard said the deployment had threatened retention and severely eroded the morale of the force.

The mission, which federal authorities had initially indicated would end on Aug. 6, has been extended for at least another 90 days. And last week, Mr. Trump said he would chair a task force designed to increase the federal government’s role in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that he would use the National Guard there again, if necessary, “to keep the Olympics safe.”

“They’re usurping the concept of home rule,” said Ken Greene, a longtime Washington resident, referring to the 1973 law that allowed the federal district to elect its own local government, though Congress maintained final say over its laws and budget. Mr. Trump cited a portion of that law on Monday that allows the federal government to temporarily take control of the city’s police department.

As the protesters rallied, Mr. Trump was framing his plans to beef up and militarize the district’s police force as a test for his vision for getting tough on crime, musing that if it worked in the nation’s capital, he could roll out similar efforts in other cities.

But to the protesters, Mr. Trump’s plans were just the latest blow to a city that has been among the hardest hit by his executive orders and policies.

Mr. Trump’s efforts to downsize the federal government, step up immigration raids in urban areas, and reduce funding for food stamps have had a negative effect on city residents, organizers of the protest argued.

“It’s all connected,” said Samuel Epps, the president of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, whose office the protesters gathered outside. “This is just another way to create that chaos in our communities.”

Alex Dodds, one of the co-founders of Free D.C., an advocacy group formed just after the start of Mr. Trump’s second term, said Mr. Trump was following an authoritarian playbook by trying to assert control over the capital city.

“It’s an easy way for them to silence dissent and accelerate their agenda, if they physically control the capital,” said Ms. Dodds, whose group organized the protests. She added: “D.C. is our home. It belongs to the people who live here, and Trump can’t have it.”

Mr. Trump has frequently railed against crime in Washington. He became fixated on the idea of a federal takeover of local law enforcement after Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old software engineer and a prominent early member of the Department of Government Efficiency, was the victim of an attempted carjacking earlier this month.

Though the protest was relatively small, criticism of Mr. Trump in Washington is not rare. The city is staunchly Democratic, and its residents have frequently rallied against the president’s actions. Monday’s protest took place on the same stretch of street that in 2020 became the centerpiece of Black Lives Matter protests — and had those words painted into the pavement until a couple of months ago.

Tierney L. Cross and Shawn McCreesh contributed reporting.

Mr. Jain said the vacancy crisis in the U.S. attorney’s office, which prosecutes all adult crimes, also posed a problem for the city. Mr. Trump recently installed an ally, the former Fox News host Jeannine Pirro, as the U.S. attorney for Washington after he was forced his pull his first choice for the job.

“Pirro’s predecessor fired attorneys who prosecuted violent insurrectionists from Jan. 6,” Mr. Jain said, referring to another Trump appointee, Ed Martin. “Now we’re facing a vacancy crisis in her office, too.”

Mr. Jain said Mr. Trump’s his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation’s capital did not appear to offer any long term solutions to crime. “And I’m incredibly concerned about what he is going to use the police force to do to the people of D.C.,” he added.

The takeover of the city police department was expected to last 30 days. That means that what Mr. Trump announced on Monday was essentially a show of force that will expire on Sept. 10.

Mr. Jain is one of two shadow senators from the District of Columbia who serve as its elected advocates before the body. They hold no voting power but lobby the Senate in favor of D.C. statehood, to prevent congressional interference in its affairs, and pass laws that protect D.C.’s interests.

Mr. Jain said there was only one real way for Washington to protect itself.

“We need D.C. statehood to stop this problem,” he said.

She said she liked that law enforcement officers don’t walk streets with military-style firearms as they do in some countries, and she said she did not support the president’s moves to take over Washington’s police and deploy the National Guard.

“I’m not a particularly pro-police, pro-law enforcement kind of person,” she said. “I would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.”

Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic. She said Mr. Trump should focus on addressing the root causes of crime before sending in the National Guard.

“It’s unfortunate that the new administration has to take this reactionary approach,” said Ms. Rigsby, “instead of local government really focusing on bringing down crime and making residents feel safe.”

Jerry Stenquist, 42, a federal employee who works in Navy Yard, said that some crime is inevitable with big events like baseball games for the Washington Nationals at the stadium in the neighborhood.

“It’s a nice area,” Mr. Stenquist said of the Navy Yard, “but I think anytime you have a broad range of the public that’s going to show up at the stadium, you’re going to have some crime.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/11/multimedia/11trump-400-qwlb/11trump-400-qwlb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 15:56:50.247555

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn.) told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss” in Texas.

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often-masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kan., and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78cc87d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5347x2807+0+379/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F87%2F9c%2F84429df53e3259217c89b84b7006%2F166e16ecd13949d98368c39e5d07f1ad,N,,2025-08-11 15:56:54.395504

His husband pulled over by their home, and Hicks watched on FaceTime as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent smashed his husband’s window.

He rushed to his Meridian apartment, but by then his husband was gone. Hicks, a U.S. citizen, already had started the process to get his husband legal status, he said. He and his husband had talked about the possibility of immigration enforcement, but Hicks said it still didn’t make him ready.

The Statesman is not naming the husband because Hicks said his husband fears repercussions for his case.

“I was not really prepared to watch that or to hear that,” Hicks said by phone. ICE agents screamed and yelled at his husband in the car, he said. “The No. 1 feeling that I had was just a pit in my stomach.”

Being in the United States without authorization is enough grounds to start the deportation process, and some immigrants who are here legally can also be removed. But under President Donald Trump, ICE agents in Idaho have been changing their tactics and using some strategies more often, according to local immigration lawyers. That includes smashing car windows, like with Hicks’ husband.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment sent via its official media email.

ICE agents also have conducted more arrests at ICE check-ins, which are routine meetings for agents to keep tabs on people going through the immigration process. Agents have also focused more on workplace enforcement, lawyers said. ICE isn’t necessarily going out to farms, but agents have been going to businesses to look for people employing undocumented immigrants, according to Neal Dougherty, a Nampa lawyer and partner at Ramirez-Smith Law.

The Owyhee County Sheriff’s Office and the Idaho State Police also have signed cooperation agreements with ICE, known as 287(g) agreements.

Overall, immigration arrests have increased over 900% in Idaho since Trump took office, according to The New York Times.

There aren’t increases in ICE’s resources or agents, said J.J. Despain, managing attorney for Wilner & O’Reilly’s Boise office, but ICE has lowered the bar on who it wants to deport and changed their strategies.

“Some of those are happening by surprise,” Despain told the Statesman.

The criminal justice system

In early April, a man failed to show up for his pretrial conference in Canyon County, perplexing his lawyer.

The lawyer, with the Idaho Public Defender’s Office, had been working with his client, who was charged in December 2024 with driving with a suspended or revoked driver’s license.

“I don’t know why he isn’t here today,” the lawyer told the judge in court audio obtained via a records request.

The next day, Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted a picture of the man being detained in Nampa by federal officers.

When ICE picks up people mid-case, they can face default judgments and parole or probation violations for failing to appear in court. When or if individuals ever return to the United States, there can already be a warrant out for an immigrant’s arrest, said Dougherty.

ICE picked up people while their Idaho criminal cases were ongoing before the new administration took office. But it’s happening more often now, Dougherty and Despain said, with potential consequences for the immigrants and any victims.

These aren’t all minor cases like driving with a suspended license. In one instance, a 27-year-old man from Mexico was arrested in Pocatello for child sexual abuse, child enticement and kidnapping. ICE posted a picture of him the day before his preliminary hearing, at which he failed to appear. He has since been deported, ICE spokesperson Alethea Smock said in an email. The case is listed as inactive and pending after the state asked to keep the case open.

Wood River Valley lawyer Justin McCarthy said immigrants in Idaho’s criminal justice system should finish their sentences in the Gem State.

“They should be held accountable here. … You don’t get to skate on the sentence,” McCarthy said. “What about victims? What about the victims’ families? … That person could come back, and they often do.”

An immigrant from El Salvador

Hicks had been with his husband for about five years by the time he was detained by ICE in late June. The couple married in 2023, according to a petition filed by his husband’s lawyers.

Hicks’s husband is originally from San Salvador, the capital of the Central American country of El Salvador. He came to the United States in 2018 to support his family and has worked in construction, Hicks said. His husband sends money to his mother, sisters and nephews back home, Hicks said. He hasn’t been able to see his family in years.

In 2021, his husband pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and received a withheld judgment. He was required to undergo alcohol education and was placed on unsupervised probation, according to court records. On June 5 of this year, he was found guilty of driving while using a cellphone, according to online court records.

After his arrest, the husband was sent to Elmore County first. Now he is detained in the Nevada Southern Detention Center west of Las Vegas, according to an online ICE detainee locator tool.

Hicks can’t go visit his husband in detention. The couple can conduct phone and video calls through the jail, Hicks said.

Lawyers for Hicks’ husband filed a petition in federal court to get him out of detention, arguing among other things that ICE agents didn’t show a warrant when they broke into his car and that an immigration judge was unfairly keeping him detained.

Hicks filed a petition earlier in 2025 for his husband to get residency, he said. But it will take four to six years, Hicks said.

“You should enter (the U.S.) with permission,” Hicks said. “But also, the whole process is just broken. It shouldn’t take someone five or six years to possibly get residency when they’re married to a U.S. citizen.”

The Trump administration on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to lift a temporary restraining order that blocked “roving” immigration stops in Los Angeles and eight other California counties.

In an emergency appeal, the federal government argued the order poses a significant barrier to enforcing federal immigration laws. The request for a stay is filed on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, so oral arguments are not likely.

An attorney for the plaintiffs in the initial suit — a coalition of civil rights, immigrant rights, and local government agencies — said they look forward to arguing the case before the high court.

“The federal government has now gone running to the Supreme Court asking it to undo a narrow court order—applicable in only one judicial district—that merely compels them to follow the Constitution.” said Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California.

U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong issued the temporary restraining order last month in the Central District of California, citing “a mountain of evidence” that the government’s aggressive enforcement tactics likely violated people’s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Trump’s Solicitor General, D. John Sauer argued in the filing with the high court that Frimpong’s order puts a “straitjacket” on agents and “threatens to upend immigration officials’ ability to enforce the immigration laws … by hanging the prospect of contempt over every investigative stop of suspected illegal aliens.”

Frimpong ruled federal immigration authorities could not rely on four factors for reasonable suspicion: race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment; either solely or in combination.

‘A racial profiling case’

“This is basically a racial profiling case: Can Latinos be shaken down in their communities and where they live because they look Latino?” Kevin R. Johnson, the director of Aoki Center on Critical Race and Nation Studies at UC Davis School of Law, said Thursday in response to the administration filing.

Starting in early June, heavily armed agents, often in masks and plain clothes or military-style uniforms, aggressively detained immigrants and U.S. citizens using heavy wartime equipment at Home Depots, car washes, and Latino markets across Los Angeles. Agents often filmed the arrests and shared the videos on social media, set to hip hop music. The Trump administration vowed to bring similar actions to cities across the nation, especially in blue states.

The federal government’s appeal to the Supreme Court follows a denial from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last week to lift the temporary restraining order.

Multiple legal cases involving Trump’s immigration policies have already reached the Supreme Court, including the government’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members. The Supreme Court lifted a lower court’s temporary restraining order that had blocked those deportations. Many of the high court’s rulings, especially on immigration issues, have sided with the administration in recent months.

“I think it’s not surprising that if you’re having some wins in the courts through appeals, you bring appeals,” said Johnson, who noted both Democrat and Republican administrations have used the appeal strategy.

Prior to the temporary restraining order, Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, the leader of the LA operations, carried out military-style raids across large swaths of Los Angeles. Calmatters and Bellingcat mapped out over 100 locations of raids including 15 separate Home Depots.

After the lower court’s order, he moved operations northward to the state’s capital.

‘No sanctuary anywhere’

“There is no sanctuary anywhere,” Bovino said after a July 17 raid at a Home Depot in Sacramento. “We’re here to stay. We’re not going anywhere. We’re going to affect this mission and secure the homeland.”

Frimpong’s restraining order did not entirely stop immigration enforcement in Los Angeles.

On Wednesday, heavily armed Border Patrol and other federal agents hid inside a Penske truck before jumping out and ambushing people at a Home Depot in an operation dubbed “Trojan Horse.”

In a written statement, the Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents conducted a “targeted raid” at the Home Depot that “resulted in the arrests of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua.”

Johnson of UC Davis said at least the federal government is pursuing a legal avenue to continue its actions, but if the temporary restraining order is lifted, it could cause “real damage” in the LA community.

“These roving patrols are terrifying communities,” Johnson said. “It’s going to have an impact on whether people are going to take their kids to school and whether people can take their kids to the doctor.”",https://kcet.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/494c07e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkcet-brightspot.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fa0%2F2e%2F87216cf24243bbae3f0ed1d00363%2F062025-cbp-ice-raid-la-getty-cm-01.png,N,,2025-08-11 15:57:05.842915

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.",https://www.wabe.org/app/uploads/2025/08/AP25209664058034-1-scaled-e1754933984135-1440x810.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 14:56:54.316689

Civil rights complaints from Israeli and Jewish students.
The case, filed by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco researchers, is being argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, UC Berkeley law school dean and constitutional expert.
Mark Yudof, a former UC president who led the system from 2008 to 2013, believed negotiations were still likely.
He said the settlement UCLA came to with Jewish students in late July is “likely to be the initial framework for those discussions.","Two weeks ago, UCLA was optimistic.

For months, it had successfully avoided clashes with President Trump as university leaders declined to publicly criticize him by name over his battle to remake American higher education, first raging against several Ivy League schools.

The morning of July 29, UCLA announced it had settled a federal lawsuit with students who accused it of discrimination, paying more than $2 million to Jewish civil rights groups and millions more in legal fees. University leaders hailed the action as “real progress” to combat antisemitism. Privately, they pointed the Trump administration to the agreement, eager to convince federal officials they had made good with Jewish communities.

The high lasted just a few hours — and touched off an extraordinary 14 days of rapid-fire accusations, investigative findings and a massive federal freeze of UCLA’s research funding. It culminated Friday afternoon when Gov. Gavin Newsom unleashed furious comments in response to a federal demand that UC pay a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations against UCLA: antisemitism on campus, illegal use of race in admissions and policies that allow transgender athletes to compete according to their gender identity.

“He has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine, unless we do his bidding,” Newsom said, adding that California would sue. “We will not be complicit in this kind of attack on academic freedom on this extraordinary public institution.”

Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not respond Sunday to a question about Newsom’s comments and legal threat.

The escalating events lead up to decisive moments this week, starting with an emergency meeting of the UC Board of Regents on Monday afternoon. On Tuesday, a federal court hearing will unfold in a preexisting case that could result in some — but not all — UC grants being restored.

The developments bring the fight over America’s higher education institutions — which has roiled elite private East Coast universities for months — to the nation’s most powerful and lauded public university system.

“We are in uncharted territory,” said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, which represents more than 1,700 colleges and universities. “We have seen the government come after Columbia, Brown, Harvard and others. But this, now, is a test. Will UCLA be the defender of public universities? Will it strike a deal? And what role will money — taxpayer money — play?”

California is facing off against a president who has been relentless in his aims to rein in what he calls “Marxist” universities that in his view are bastions of liberalism that have done too little to protect Jewish students, have been too soft on pro-Palestinian protests, and rely too heavily on international student dollars.

His administration has accused a host of elite colleges nationwide — Harvard, Columbia, Brown, Stanford and three UC campuses — of illegally considering race in admissions and programming to the detriment of white and Asian American students. In response to pro-Palestinian protests, Trump has said colleges have enabled “jihadists,” saying demonstrators are “pro-Hamas” terrorists.

“UCLA is not a random selection,” Mitchell said. “The administration has had issues with California, with the governor, for some time. This is part of a larger battle between the administration and the state of California.”

What’s at stake

Since July 30, when UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk began receiving notices from the federal government announcing grant suspensions — totaling nearly half a billion dollars — UCLA leaders have scrambled to assess the effect on what they describe as life-saving, groundbreaking research. Deans and departments have been told to be prepared for layoffs if the cuts last.

Science and medical professors, whose research labs would not exist without federal funding, have solicited private donations. Doctoral and postdoctoral students, whose tuition and living expenses are often funded by grants in exchange for lab work, are rushing to speed up their graduation plans before stipends become depleted.

“The federal government claims antisemitism and bias as the reasons. This far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,” Frenk said about the messages from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy.

UC as a system and UCLA in particular have been under multiple federal investigations for months:

Alleged employment discrimination against Jewish employees and job applicants.

Civil rights complaints from Israeli and Jewish students.

The alleged consideration of race in admissions practices.

UCLA is also on a shortlist of 10 campuses, including UC Berkeley and USC — that a federal task force on combating antisemitism singled out in February.

The ongoing investigations were launched by the Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services departments.

UCLA leaders thought they were being cooperative by sharing internal records over the months with government lawyers and making progress in quiet negotiations over the accusations, senior UC officials said.

They hoped the government took notice of efforts that could appease the president: a new campus initiative to combat antisemitism, the banning of Students for Justice in Palestine groups, a UC-wide ban on student government boycotts of Israel, quick shutdowns of pro-Palestinian campus protests, and strict discipline of pro-Palestinian students accused of time, place and manner violations during demonstrations.

But the federal government’s stance is now clear: It believes UCLA is guilty of all allegations.

The NSF letter said that UCLA “engages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women’s sports and private women-only spaces.”

What Trump wants

Federal lawyers want UC to pay the billion-dollar fine against UCLA in installments and contribute $172 million to a fund for Jewish students and other individuals affected by alleged civil rights violations.

The settlement demands include ending scholarships that focus on race or ethnicity, forcing UCLA to share more admissions data than it already publicly releases with the government and changes to campus protest rules such as a ban on overnight encampments.

In addition to the sticker-shock fine, some requests have puzzled UCLA leaders — as the UC system has already significantly overhauled many practices outlined by the federal government.

It has ended the use of “diversity statements” in hiring. Last fall, UCLA declared a “zero-tolerance” policy for encampments. The government wants transgender women off women’s sports teams. But as a member of the National Collegiate Athletics Assn., the university is already required to follow new association rules that bar transgender players from women’s teams.

“It feels like a cut-and-paste job,” said a senior UC official about Trump’s proposal. The official was not authorized to speak publicly about negotiations. “It’s like they took a parts of letters to the Ivy Leagues, cobbled them together and added the words ‘UCLA.’ ”

What comes next

The 24-member UC Board of Regents, which must approve of any settlement or payout to the federal government and would be involved in a suit, has called an emergency, closed-door meeting Monday afternoon. It’s unclear whether Newsom, who is an ex-officio member of the board, will attend.

Another pivotal moment comes Tuesday in San Francisco’s federal district court. There, Judge Rita F. Lin has ordered the Justice Department to explain why the UCLA cuts are not a violation of a June order in which she blocked certain science grant terminations for all of UC.

The case, filed by UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco researchers, is being argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, UC Berkeley law school dean and constitutional expert. If the judge rules in UC’s favor, it could apply to NSF cuts that account for about half of those in limbo at UCLA.

In an interview, Chemerinsky said actions against UCLA were “clearly illegal” because “the president lacks constitutional authority to refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress.”

He outlined what would likely be California’s argument in a suit: The government’s actions violate the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which restricts the president’s ability to halt spending that Congress has authorized.

“The cutoff of funds has been without the due process required by federal laws and the Constitution,” Chemerinsky said. “Agencies cutting off funds, like NIH and NSF, are violating the Administrative Procedures Act in that the actions are ‘arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.’ Many of the cutoffs of funds violate the 1st Amendment for being based on viewpoint.”

Negotiations still possible

But California faces a risk if it files a suit against the administration’s orders.

When Harvard pushed back against billions in similar cuts earlier this year, the Trump administration hit the university with additional costly funding clawbacks and a termination of its ability to host foreign students, an issue it further sued over.

Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said time — and politics — is not on UCLA’s side.

“At some point you have to be ready for fall classes and international students coming in and the campus trying to deal with the uncertainty and losing all your grants,” said Tobias. Litigation can take months, if not years, he said. California “might do well in the district courts and then in the 9th Circuit, but I don’t know what would happen in the Supreme Court.”

After Newsom threatened a suit, UC Regents Chair Janet Reilly told The Times that negotiation is still on the table — but not on the current “unacceptable” terms.

“The university remains willing to engage in a constructive and good-faith dialogue with the federal government but the University of California will always stand firm in protecting the integrity and values of our institution,” Reilly said.

Mark Yudof, a former UC president who led the system from 2008 to 2013, believed negotiations were still likely.

“While litigation is certainly a possibility, my sense is that both sides will first try negotiating a settlement,” Yudof said. He said the settlement UCLA came to with Jewish students in late July is “likely to be the initial framework for those discussions. Hard to say where it goes from there. The fact that UC is a public university system adds to the complexities.”

Mitchell, the American Council on Education president and former top administrator of Occidental College, said a quick resolution would benefit both sides. He said a months-long process — as it’s been between Harvard and Trump — would have the potential for “great harm.”

“These things, the longer they go on, the worse they get,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6371be2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2671+0+360/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F0c%2F1b%2F3b587bfc476cbe7f6ac13127d7f5%2F1517333-me-0807-ucla-campus-gem-007.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 19:56:50.439332

“We want kids in our school and to get them here, they have to feel safe,"" said superintendent Bret Schroeder.","President Donald Trump has cracked down on immigration enforcement. As part of his plan, the administration backed out of a 2011 policy and now allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to make arrests at schools, hospitals and churches.

In light of the arrest guidelines from the Department of Homeland Security, some of Nebraska's schools have instituted new policies, restated former policies and/or contacted legal representation. Nebraska Public Media reached out to some larger school districts and those in cities with large immigrant communities to over this digital resource into what certain districts are doing as far as immigration enforcement on or near school grounds.

Omaha Public Schools

The OPS Board of Education has restated the district's resolution from Trump's first administration regarding practices related to ICE.

This resolution states, unless specifically required by law, no district employee, contractor, volunteer or representative will assist in the detection or apprehension of an individual who may be undocumented.

The district will not ask any student or parent about immigration status nor require documentation. Further, nobody in the district, unless compelled by a valid court order or other legal form, will disclose student or family information to ICE officers. If ICE wants to enter school grounds, the officers must first notify the superintendent and the district's general counsel before entry.

OPS also states all students and their families, regardless of immigration status, have access to all learning and educational services available at the schools.

Lincoln Public Schools

While the district will adhere to legal documentation for ICE's presence, it will also ""endeavor to prevent undue interference in District operations and educational programs."" This includes making sure all students, regardless of immigration statues, are safe and allowed to learn.

Staff will not answer any questions from a visitor until their identity is verified by a building administrator.

If an ICE agent comes to a school, the person will be held at the Security Entrance Monitor location while their identity is verified, which includes their name, name of their agency and the reason for their visit. Any questions from law enforcement are directed to that building administrator.

Grand Island Public Schools

GIPS does not collect any information regarding immigration status for its students nor its families. The district would only release student information to ICE if it provides a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena. That information would not include immigration status, rather the student's name, school email address, enrollment status, grade level, etc.

Any request for an interview with a student from law enforcement must first go through the principal's office, who will then determine if the request should be granted. If a student's parent or legal guardian is not present for the interview, then a building administrator or school designee will attend.

Students are not allowed to be taken from the school without the consent of the principal and without a proper warrant.

Scottsbluff Public Schools

The district and its staff will comply with ICE requests if they have a warrant or subpoena signed by a judge. If the agent does not have one of those, the staff will not comply or give any information. Although employees will not obstruct government operations, they will also ""attempt to prevent undue interference with district operations or educations programming.""

Immigration enforcement is not specifically listed as a non-warrant reason for why a law enforcement officer may remove a student for questioning or detention.

For interviews with students not related to district events, the students' parents or guardians must consent. A school employee does not need to be present. The school will not disclose any student records unless in direct response to a court order or subpoena.

Columbus Public Schools

Although the district does not have a specific policy regarding ICE, the superintendent or principal will only release minors to law enforcement upon presentation of a court order or warrant for that student's arrest. The principal or other school official would then immediately notify the parent or guardian of the child.

South Sioux City Community Schools

Although the district does not have a policy exclusively written on ICE, no schools collect or have information about a student's immigration status and therefore are unable to share that information. If ICE makes a request to speak with a student in the district, it must first go through the superintendent's office and the district's legal counsel before any action is taken.

The district will, however, comply with state and federal laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).

Fremont Public Schools

The district cannot prevent ICE agents from entering school property, but if an employee encounters ICE on school property, that staff member needs to immediately inform the principal, who will then inform the superintendent. Further, the ICE agent will be requested to work with and speak directly with the superintendent.

Although the district cannot legally prevent ICE from entering a school property, the superintendent would remind that agent of the 2011 ICE Memorandum that instruct ICE to avoid ""sensitive locations,"" which includes schools. This is the policy the Trump administration has urged agents to disregard.

Crete Public Schools

While the Board of Education does not have a formal policy specific to ICE, the district is committed to following the law. The district also maintains a ""comprehensive Threat Assessment and Crisis Response Plan that guides our actions in any situation.""

Madison Public Schools

Although the district does not have written policies regarding ICE, the procedure for all staff is to refer any ICE officials or documents, such as a subpoena, to the superintendent. The superintendent will then work with legal counsel to respond ""as appropriate and in a manner that is as protective of our students as possible.""

Schuyler Community Schools

The district does not have a policy specific to ICE, but it would follow law enforcement mandates as required by law. Its main focus is to keep students safe and stay focused on education. If ICE comes to the school grounds, the district would require a warrant signed by judge and only then would comply. That warrant would list specifically who they’re there for, and ICE would not be allowed free reign of the building. A building official would bring the individual listed on the judge-signed warrant to the office. ICE raids would not be tolerated unless there is a building warrant. The district does not gather information on immigration status and it follows the legal guidelines of FERPA. “We want kids in our school and to get them here, they have to feel safe,"" said superintendent Bret Schroeder.",https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/assets/images/chris-robert-A4T1lh6p19k-unsplash.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 16:57:02.541016

Sonny Lasquite was detained after a vacation in the Bahamas by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on July 28 at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to relatives who spoke with GMA News Online.

Why it Matters

Lasquite's arrest was due to a red flag in the federal system linked to a 2012 narcotics case. ICE records reviewed by Newsweek show Lesquite currently being held at the Stewart Detention Center in Stewart County, Georgia.

Lasquite's detention illustrated how lawful permanent residents could face immigration enforcement after arrests at ports of entry, raising questions about the consequences of past criminal convictions for long-term residents and the humanitarian impact on families that rely on detained relatives for financial and caregiving support.

What To Know

Lasquite reportedly lived in the U.S. for 23 years and worked as a banquet server in Las Vegas.

From roughly December 2010 to about August 2012, Lasquite ""intentionally and knowingly"" possessed with the intent to distribute Schedule IV narcotics, including diazepam, alprazolam, zolpidem and carisoprodol, according to court records in the Southern District of New York reviewed by Newsweek.

But records indicate that he promptly took responsibility for his actions and cooperated with the federal government in identifying charged and uncharged co-conspirators. A 2014 sentencing memorandum by former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said that Lasquite helped stop narcotics distribution practices and led to the prosecutions of others.

""You are, as the government points out, the only defendant who cooperated,"" Bharara said on September 9, 2014. ""You did that at some risk to yourself. I think there needs to be recognition of that and proportionate sentencing between you

and the other defendants.

""I feel pretty confident that you're not going to commit any crimes in the future, and I join the government in wishing you well and hopefully being able to put this behind you.""

The court ultimately sentenced Lasquite to time served and no additional prison time, ordering him to pay $200.

Lasquite did put that time of his life behind him, according to family and friends in a GoFundMe created Saturday to raise $30,000 to cover legal representation and filing fees, and ""essential expenses to fight for Sonny's right to remain in the U.S. and reunite with his family.""

As of Monday morning, nearly $11,600 had been raised from 56 donations. The fundraiser was started by Vivian Hirono, of Las Vegas, who writes that Lasquite ""has had no further legal troubles and has been a law-abiding, contributing member of his community"" since his 2012 criminal conviction.

Newsweek reached out to Hirono via the GoFundMe page for comment.

""Sonny Lasquite is more than a name—he is a beloved son, brother, uncle and friend whose kindness has touched countless lives,"" the GoFundMe says. ""For decades, Sonny has lived peacefully in the United States, working hard, caring for his elderly mother, and always putting others before himself. He is the kind of person who never hesitates to help, greet you with a warm smile, or offer comfort when you need it most.""

Aside from Lasquite's detention causing his mother's health to ""decline under the weight of this stress,"" his own health is reportedly taking a toll. Lasquite has purportedly faced medical neglect during detention, including delayed access to his blood pressure medication and proper care for his recent fever, according to Hirono.

What People Are Saying

Vivian Hirono on Sonny Lasquite's GoFundMe page: ""Sonny is the primary breadwinner of his family, providing both financial and emotional support to his loved ones. His income helps cover essential expenses, including his elderly mother's medical needs and daily living costs.""

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Friday in Illinois called allegations of ICE detaining immigrants without criminal convictions ""false,"" according to NewsNation: ""I'm here today because elected leaders in Illinois are ignoring the law. In fact, they're being obstructionists when it comes to getting dangerous criminals off of their streets. They're deciding that dangerous criminals that are murderers, rapists, money launderers, have committed assaults, and that are trafficking children are more important than the families who live in the communities here.""

What Happens Next

Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.
One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba.
Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.
If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.","Inside immigration courts around the country, immigrants who crossed the border illegally and were caught and released are required to appear before a judge for a preliminary hearing.

But in a new twist, the Trump administration has begun using an unexpected legal tactic in its deportation efforts. Rather than pursue a deportation case, it is convincing judges to dismiss immigrants’ cases — thus depriving the immigrants of protection from arrest and detention — then taking them into custody.

The practice, affecting immigrants released at the border and given a “notice to appear” in court under both the Trump and Biden administrations, sometimes leads to people being quickly deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement through a process called expedited removal.

Many of the immigrants had requested asylum, as allowed under U.S. law. Late last month, advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of a dozen immigrants unexpectedly arrested by ICE, often after having their cases dismissed.

When an immigrant crosses the border illegally and is caught, they may be given a “notice to appear,” or NTA, ordering them to appear before an immigration judge. It can sometimes take years, however, before their case comes up.

One of the immigrants in the lawsuit was caught at the border with Mexico and given a court appearance ticket in 2022 after fleeing Cuba. His opposition to forced conscription and the communist government in Cuba led to his arrest there and he was raped in custody, according to the lawsuit.

At his first hearing in U.S. immigration court in May, his case was dismissed with no reason given and his attorney agreed, thinking the relatively new maneuver was a positive development.

But as he left the Miami court, the immigrant was arrested and sent to Washington state for detention, thousands of miles from his family and his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, according to the lawsuit.

“The aftermath of these courthouse arrests and dismissals for placement in expedited removal wreaks further havoc on people’s lives,” according to a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Justice filed in July by a group of immigrant advocates. The group argued the practice is illegal and contrary to the traditional way people are treated when released at the border for court dates.

The lawsuit includes 12 immigrants: three from Cuba, three from Venezuela, two from Ecuador, two from Guinea and others from Liberia and the Chechen Republic. A Department of Justice spokesperson, Natalie Baldassarre, said the department had no comment on the lawsuit.

After a courthouse arrest in New York City in July, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that the new policy “is reversing [President Joe] Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.”

However, the Trump administration has also released immigrants seeking asylum at the border pending court dates, according to a June 27 report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at the University of Syracuse, an organization that tracks federal statistics.

Almost 18,000 people were released at the border in May “even after Trump officials closed the border, vowed not to allow anyone in and to immediately detain anyone not legally in the country caught inside the U.S.,” the report stated.

Other immigration attorneys who spoke with Stateline described uprooted lives caused by the new practice of arresting people after they show up for court hearings, but the attorneys declined to speak on the record for fear of drawing negative attention to their clients’ cases.

Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which represents more than 17,000 immigration attorneys and is not involved in the lawsuit, said the Department of Homeland Security is now arguing in court that anyone caught crossing the border should be arrested and detained, though it’s not happening in every case.

“There is a large number of people going to court and getting arrested, and also people in detention not getting let out,” Dojaquez-Torres said. “This happens to people with no criminal background, no negative immigration history — they might even have a sponsor that says, ‘We will house them and feed them and make sure they show up to their court hearings.’”

There are also cases of people arrested in court even if their case isn’t dismissed, Dojaquez-Torres said.

One of the immigrants in the lawsuit, a Venezuelan who said he faced persecution in his home country as a gay man with HIV, was arrested July 1 after a hearing in New York City even though his case is still active, according to the lawsuit.

One woman born in Venezuela, who fears persecution because of her sexual orientation and opposition to the Venezuelan government, applied for asylum within a year of entering the United States in 2022, but was arrested at her first court hearing May 27. She now faces an expedited removal order, which could mean an immediate deportation if she loses appeals. She is currently in detention in Ohio, according to the lawsuit.

Other cases mentioned in the lawsuit involved arrests at immigration courts in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Nevada.

Most of the immigrants mentioned in the lawsuit were caught crossing illegally. But two presented themselves at the border legally via an appointment set up through a phone app for asylum-seekers, CBP One, designed to limit the number of people who could cross the border asking for asylum. (The Trump administration shut down the app on its first day in office.)

In one of those cases, a gay man from Ecuador, facing government threats over his LGBTQ+ advocacy efforts, used the app in January and appeared in court June 4, according to the lawsuit.

The government moved to dismiss his case, and he was deported back to Ecuador within a month, despite asking for more time to file an asylum case, according to the suit. He is now living in hiding.

The class-action lawsuit has not yet been answered by the government, though the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, James Boasberg, ruled July 18 that the immigrants suing could use pseudonyms without identifying information as long as they provide real names and addresses in documents sealed from public view.

Courthouse arrests may cross a new line legally but they’re not likely to increase deportation significantly the way current large-scale workplace raids and transfers from local jails might, said Muzaffar Chishti, an attorney and policy expert at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank. The administration’s goal of 1 million deportations a year still seems unlikely, he said.

Arrests declined in July over the previous month, but deportations increased, according to an Aug. 2 TRAC report, with 56,945 people in detention. The number of detainees will increase with more federal funding for detention, but is still unlikely to reach the level needed to deport a million people in a year, Chishti said.

The issue of courthouse arrests makes legal representation for immigrants all the more important, Chishti said.

“Even in these horrendous cases, if you have a lawyer, he’ll know how to handle it and say, ‘He can’t be removed, he’ll be subject to torture,’” Chishti said. “The difference between arrest and deportation could be the presence of a lawyer.”

Nevertheless, the prospect of arrest and detention during a case that may last years could make immigrants hesitant to show up for court dates, which in turn could make them subject to immediate deportation.

“If you don’t show up for a court date, they will enter what’s called an in absentia removal order. If you come into any contact with ICE after that, you will be most likely detained and removed,” Dojaquez-Torres said.

Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.","On a recent morning in Lower Manhattan, immigration Judge John Siemietkowski spoke to three people in his courtroom while masked federal officers waited just outside.

“I’m sure you can see with your own eyes what’s going on in our courthouse,” Siemietkowski said.

“You may see someone you know get arrested. You yourself may get arrested,” he warned. “That’s a heavy topic, isn’t it? A lot like the weather today. It’s heavy, and it weighs on us.”

Siemietkowski scheduled the three for court dates in 2026 and dismissed them. As they left the courtroom, two of them, a married couple from Panama, walked by the officers unimpeded. But when the third man, from the Dominican Republic, passed the officers, he was grabbed by the shoulders in plain view of Siemietkowski’s dais and escorted down a stairwell.

Such scenes have played out over and over again in the more than two months since officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies began lurking in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the three Manhattan courthouses where immigrants in deportation proceedings plead their cases.

Half of all immigration court arrests nationwide were in New York City in late May and early June, according to a new analysis of federal immigration court and ICE data by THE CITY and Joseph Gunther, a Brooklyn mathematician who first identified a method to track courthouse arrests.

ICE officers elsewhere have been detaining thousands of people at workplaces, Home Depot parking lots and even sending militarized cavalry units through big city parks. But enforcement in New York City has been focused inside of the very buildings where people show up at civil immigration hearings to petition for the right to legally remain in the United States. It’s an approach that the agency had taken pains to avoid before Trump’s second term because of the deterrent effect it has on noncitizens with immigration court hearings.

That changed dramatically in New York City this late spring. Between May 26 and June 8, court and ICE records show, federal officers arrested 134 people in Lower Manhattan immigration courthouse buildings, accounting for nearly a third of all immigration arrests in New York City in that period.

Overall, immigration courthouse arrests have been nearly 14 times as common in New York City than the country as a whole. They made up 7% of all ICE arrests in the city since President Donal Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 through June, compared to 0.5% nationally over the same period of time.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to THE CITY’s request for comment on the analysis, which cross-references Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) court data with ICE arrest records to identify cases that show a court hearing on the same date as an arrest.

At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency. Those arrests took place at offices like the one across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where THE CITY witnessed 31 arrests over two days, as well as another office inside 26 Federal Plaza itself, where people line up each morning. Some never get to leave of their own accord.

As a result of the courthouse arrests ICE has emphasized in New York City, a large number of arrests here are happening behind closed doors — sparing Mayor Eric Adams the spectacle of roundups on city streets seen elsewhere in the country and the potential for clashes with New Yorkers.

In Los Angeles, immigration arrests in highly visible public settings triggered sustained mass protests, leading President Trump to deploy the National Guard and then the Marines to assist ICE agents in June. Mayor Karen Bass described Los Angeles as “a city under siege, under armed occupation.”

While smaller protests have been common, no such dramatic standoffs have occurred yet in New York City, where Adams has pledged to work with the Trump administration on matters that don’t involve civil immigration enforcement, taking a less adversarial approach to ICE than mayors in other Democratic strongholds.

In April, the Trump Justice Department dropped the criminal corruption case against Adams. Less than a day later, Adams, who was elected in 2021 as a Democrat, announced a longshot independent bid for a second term.

Missing Persons

EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later. A former employee at the New York immigration court said that everyone — including Department of Homeland Security attorneys who serve as prosecutors inside the immigration court system — seemed surprised on the day in May when they first saw ICE agents in the hallways.

“We had no notice this was happening, I don’t think the prosecutors had much notice either,” the former employee recalled, saying the DHS prosecutors had been ordered to come to the building in person instead of appearing virtually as they typically did.

ICE agents had been in or near the courthouse before then — for example, if an immigrant had a serious criminal conviction that made them subject to rules requiring detention while a case proceeded. But that was exceedingly rare, the former EOIR employee said.

“Even that hadn’t happened in years,” the person said. “It’s never been anything like this.”

In New York City, 110 people were arrested on the same day as their immigration court hearing through June under the Trump administration, court data shows, accounting for 24% of the 453 such arrests nationwide.

But ICE likely arrested even more people here in connection with court appearances.

The agency’s own arrest data, when cross-referenced with court data, suggests at least another 71 people in New York City were detained on the same day as their hearing. That brings the number of total immigration court arrests in the city this year to 181 — a dramatic escalation from 11 arrests all of last year, including just three over the same time period.

Taken together, the analysis found 31% of all ICE arrests in the city took place in immigration courts in the two weeks between May 26 and June 8, when courthouse arrests spiked across the country.

Other cities trailed far behind: San Diego was a distant second with 37 arrests, followed by 32 in Annandale, Va., and 29 in Newark, N. J., according to court data.

In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.

New York City’s courthouse arrests have exclusively targeted adults, and mostly men, records show, with the youngest confirmed arrest that of a 19-year-old Venezuelan teen, and the oldest a 63-year-old from Ecuador.

Just three of the people arrested were represented by a lawyer. Many judges allow people with attorneys to appear virtually, leaving many without representation to face a gauntlet of masked ICE agents awaiting their arrival alone.

Even past the 181 arrests THE CITY identified in government records, our reporting found several additional arrests were not reflected in court records — highlighting that these preliminary tallies are undoubtedly an undercount.

The arrest of 20-year-old high schooler Joselyn Chipantiza-Sisalema, who was taken from a court hearing in late June, for example, is not reflected in the current court data.

The court data also omits the detention of a 19-year-old man from Guinea who ICE records indicate was arrested on the same day as his court hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. He has since been transferred to a detention center in Jonesboro, Louisiana, where he was held for 26 days before being transferred to another detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Black Box

The scene at the immigration courthouse on the 12th floor of 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning showed the ICE arrest apparatus now well entrenched.

Judge James Loprest was out for the day, but many people with pending cases had dutifully shown up anyway. They took turns speaking to the clerk, who handed them notices to appear at a later date. But as they tried to leave, masked agents confronted them at the doorway asking for identification.

Agents whisked a 19-year-old girl into a stairwell for questioning before releasing her several minutes later.

A woman who looked to be in her thirties, wearing gold high heels and a sparkly green jumpsuit, was not so lucky. The woman’s hands trembled as the agents towered over her. “But I haven’t done anything,” she said incredulously in Spanish, weeping softly and asking a volunteer stationed nearby to call her husband, who was waiting for her outside.

“It’s not a question,” an agent said in Spanish with a thick American accent. “We said you’re leaving with us.”

Moments later, the men surrounded the woman and rushed her to a back stairwell and out of sight. She — like the many others apprehended inside immigration courthouses at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway and on Varick Street — was detained for processing in the ICE office on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. As the number of arrests has soared in recent weeks, ICE has struggled to move people into actual detention centers, leaving some for days in cramped holding rooms with no beds and limited food.

On Friday, the ACLU sued the Trump Administration over conditions there. People haven’t been able to speak privately with lawyers, the lawsuit alleged, and are only given limited food and left to sleep for days on concrete floors in unsanitary conditions. DHS has flatly denied any mistreatment while repeatedly denying members of Congress access to the site, keeping it entirely out of public view until THE CITY first published videos of it in July.

City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June while accompanying immigrants to their court appearances — was reluctant during his most recent visit on Thursday to speculate about why enforcement had taken such a different shape in New York.

“It’s one of the big questions,” Lander said, pointing to the public scenes of intimidation in Los Angeles.

Lander has called on Adams to enforce potential building and fire code violations on ICE’s detention floor, though Adams said he has no jurisdiction over the federal building.

“It’s certainly possible that there’s some implicit deal between the Trump administration and Eric Adams, which is why these arrests are being concentrated here versus other places around the country,” Lander said when pressed about why enforcement here had been so different.

“If the mayor wants to demonstrate that there isn’t, there’s a lot of ways for him to show he’s objecting to what’s going on here that he’s failed to do.”

Asked about Lander’s comments, Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said that “I can’t tell you why they’re doing this at 26 Federal Plaza.”

She said the mayor has been clear he’s open to working with the Trump administration on criminal matters but draws the line on civil immigration enforcement. She also noted New York City had not seen immigration raids in sensitive locations like churches and schools — something Adams had urged Homan against during their meetings.

“Not having an adversarial-at-all-times relationship can sometimes be beneficial,” said Mamelak.

The Trump administration sued the mayor and City Council in late July, demanding an end to sanctuary city laws that prohibit local government cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The Adams administration is suing in return, including three lawsuits on behalf of students arrested at immigration court appearances.

“What’s going on at 26 Fed, the mayor opposes, and he’s taken action on that,” Mamelak said.

Adams, however, has largely avoided answering questions or speaking on camera about those conditions. He has repeatedly stressed that the city isn’t responsible for what happens inside of the ICE offices, now including a jail, inside its real estate in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.

‘Guiding Star’?

Courthouse arrests have mostly targeted people who entered the country less than two years ago, THE CITY’s analysis shows, confirming what the Trump administration has said is a new focus on attempting to funnel people into “expedited removal” proceedings that can circumvent immigration courts, which are facing historic backlogs and take years to resolve a person’s deportation case.

But while DHS prosecutors regularly asked judges to dismiss a person’s deportation case ahead of their arrest, judges rarely approved those requests.

Government prosecutors had requested that judges dismiss the removal proceedings in 100 of the 181 instances where people were arrested on the day of their court hearing, THE CITY’s analysis shows. But judges denied 69 of those requests and left 23 of them undecided.

That means only eight dismissals were approved — and that the other 173 people were arrested while their cases were still ongoing, forcing them to fight their asylum claims from behind bars in most cases.

“We very quickly saw on the ground that the procedural posture didn’t actually matter,” said Allison Cutler, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group. She is one of a handful of attorneys keeping watch on the courthouse arrests, and attempts to advise people without lawyers of their rights as they’re rushed away.

Over the past two months, Cutler has become friendly with court staff, security guards, judges, and even the federal agents, who’ve all had their status quo upended by the arrests.

Many agents, she pointed out, have been drafted from other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to conduct courthouse arrests on behalf of ICE.

“I’ve had multiple officers tell me that they’re gonna quit,” Cutler said, adding they’ve told her they’ve had to forgo working on prior investigations to arrest people inside courtrooms. “They have asked their supervisors if they can continue to work on their investigations, and they’re being told no, and that they have to go to court and do this.”

Meanwhile, immigration judges and court staff in New York are grappling with a grim new normal, with each of them struggling to work out the rules for their courtrooms.

A former New York immigration judge, who called fairness “the guiding star” of the system, called the shift in tactics deeply troubling and unprecedented.

“Now you’re a tool in someone’s tool box so that a person can be detained,” the judge said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080725_ice_arrests-3.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 15:57:14.138849

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.",https://www.kark.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2025/08/6899d2165dbcc2.39080798.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-11 12:58:26.593833

The San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved a program to train owners and employees of small businesses about their rights in the event of an ICE raid.
“Small businesses shouldn’t have to fear being shut down by government overreach when they have played by the rules,” Lawson-Remer said in a statement.
""Knowledge is key.” According to Lawson-Remer's office, small businesses account for nearly 380,000 businesses in San Diego County.
They said the Small Business Know Your Rights program is intended to protect people from being wrongly arrested at their place of employment.","SAN DIEGO — A new program is being developed in San Diego to train owners and employees of small businesses about their rights in the event of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid.

When Katrina Oprisko started her zero-waste refill shop, Earthwell Refill, her mission was to help her community. When she watched U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid popular South Park restaurant Buona Forchetta in May, she felt powerless to help her neighbors.

“We said, ‘Wow, that’s really close.’ That’s not really far away that it doesn’t impact us, and so everyone said, ‘Oh, my goodness, we have to know what we’re going to do when this happens,'” Oprisko said.

The San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved a program to train owners and employees of small businesses about their rights in the event of an ICE raid.

Board Chair Terra Lawson-Remer said she crafted the proposal after the Buona Forchetta raid became a national story. The program aims to help employers ""know what to do, and what not to do"" if ICE or Department of Homeland Security officials show up, as well as workplace protocols to prevent legal mistakes and reduce business disruption.

“Small businesses shouldn’t have to fear being shut down by government overreach when they have played by the rules,” Lawson-Remer said in a statement. “We’re working to protect constitutional rights, uphold due process, and make sure federal fear-mongering doesn’t threaten lives and livelihoods, or destabilize San Diego’s economy.”

Buona Forchetta was closed for two days after the raid, with other locations closed for the rest of the week. Oprisko says that kind of disruption to a small business can have devastating consequences.

“To be closed for a week, that’s not possible,"" she said. ""You might as well shut down the whole entire restaurant or business.”

Bill Wells is the mayor of El Cajon and said that while he favors people knowing their rights, he does not support the county using its money to get involved.

“People didn’t sign up to have their tax dollars be spent to kind of circumvent the will of the people in this respect,"" Wells said. ""And the County of San Diego is saying, ‘no, we want to even do more to help illegal immigration,’ which I think is the wrong approach.”

He also said he believes California's status as a sanctuary state has not helped matters.

“I don’t think people are employing illegal immigrants because they don’t know the rules; I think they don’t care about the rules,"" Wells said. ""And I think California has really set up a precedent where California says, ‘Well, we’ll follow these laws but we won’t follow those laws.’”

Erica Castillo is the advocacy co-chair of Business For Good, as well as the owner of her own small business, Unita Solutions.

“Business For Good is proud to be a strong supporter of the KYR training program and is actively working with the county to help shape it,"" Castillo said. ""We’ve heard firsthand from business owners and workers about the impacts of ICE raids and other federal immigration enforcement — lost income, reduced staff, and a shaken sense of safety in the community. This training is a vital tool to help businesses and workers rebuild with confidence and resilience.”

Oprisko is excited to help her community in new ways and plans to take part in the program as soon as it’s available. While only she and her husband run their small business, she hopes to pass on what they learn.

“I would feel horrible if I didn’t try to do something; and so, knowing this knowledge, that I can share that with other business owners, I can share that with my neighbors,"" she said. ""Knowledge is key.”

According to Lawson-Remer's office, small businesses account for nearly 380,000 businesses in San Diego County. They said the Small Business Know Your Rights program is intended to protect people from being wrongly arrested at their place of employment.

Supervisor Jim Desmond, who voted no, said while he favors people knowing their rights, he couldn't support Lawson-Remer's measure.

""We wouldn't be in this situation if (Biden) hadn't let millions of people come over our border illegally and unvetted during the Biden administration,"" Desmond said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/ICE-ca-0811,N,,2025-08-11 14:57:01.014842

A rarely-used method is the exception to this rule. Using a procedure called snap removal, defendants can avoid the forum defendant rule by removing before the forum defendant is served.

28 U.S.C. § 1441 allows a defendant to remove a case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction except where “any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought.” A snap removal defendant argues that the forum defendant rule does not apply because a forum defendant is not “served” at the time of removal.

Because snap removal can allow defendants to circumvent the forum defendant rule, it is crucial for state court litigants on both sides of the “v” to keep the practice in mind at the initial stages of litigation, including the mechanics of the practice and courts’ views of it.

Inc., 955 F.3d 482 (5th Cir. 2020). The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits have endorsed that interpretation of section 1441(b), albeit in a footnote and dicta. See McCall v. Scott, 239 F.3d 808, 813 n.2 (6th Cir. 2001); Goodwin v. Reynolds, 757 F.3d 1216, 1220-21 (11th Cir. 2014). Meanwhile, just last year, the Ninth Circuit declined to express a view on snap removal while concluding “super snap removal” – removal before a complaint is even filed – is ineffectual. Casola v. Dexcom, Inc., 98 F.4th 947, 950 (9th Cir. 2024).

Many federal district courts have expressed doubts of the practice, finding that it promotes gamesmanship, is counter to the purpose of section 1441(b), and creates absurd results. See, e.g., Carazo Reyes v. Harbor Freight Tools USA, Inc., 2025 WL 1683163 (C.D. Cal. 2025); Rising Phoenix Holding Corp. v. Ross, 2023 WL 3032095 (S.D. Fla. 2023); Kirst v. Erck, 2022 WL 2869742 (D. Md. 2022); In re Abbott Lab’ys, 2022 WL 2257182 (N.D. Ill. 2022); In re Lipitor (Atorvstatin Calcium) Mktg., Sales Pratices & Prod. Liab. Litig., 2016 WL 7338594 (D.S.C. 2016). While others note that “policy appeals regarding the technological advantages of electronic dockets and resulting overuse of snap removal by defendants are unavailing [and that] it is for Congress, not this Court, to revise the statute.” Higgins v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., 2025 WL 1397045, at *2 (D. Del. 2025).

Where the maneuver is accepted, leveraging snap removal to one’s benefit – by either utilizing it or avoiding it – can be a powerful tool.

Practice Tips

For Plaintiffs:

Understand applicable legal authority. When filing a state court action where diversity jurisdiction exists, plaintiffs should check whether snap removal is available in the jurisdiction.

Speed is your friend. Snap removal requires a defendant to remove to federal court before the citizen of the forum state is served. Plaintiffs should serve the complaint as soon as practicable, limiting the snap removal window, and if possible, avoid giving defendants a heads-up, even if courtesy might otherwise countenance it. A defendant cannot snap remove if it does not know a lawsuit is coming.

Defeat complete diversity. Including a party that defeats complete diversity prevents a plaintiff from utilizing diversity jurisdiction as grounds for removal under 28 U.S.C. § 1441 in the first place. Courts will disregard fraudulently joined parties for diversity jurisdiction analysis, but to the extent a plaintiff can identify another properly joined party that eliminates diversity jurisdiction, they can protect against snap removal.

Trump sent the troops to Los Angeles to address protests against immigration arrests in the city.
Trump deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops, ordering them to the streets under federal control, over Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections.
“It doesn’t seem like we’re on the threshold of mass violence and chaos,” said Jon Michaels, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles law school.
“With President Trump increasingly talking about using troops for law enforcement purposes, this trial has great significance,” Chemerinsky said.","The Trump administration and California will face off in court Monday, over President Donald Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard and Marines in Los Angeles.

Trump sent the troops to Los Angeles to address protests against immigration arrests in the city. Most of the troops have been recalled but a ruling in favor of California could hamstring the president’s ability to respond to domestic emergencies, the government argues.

California sued Trump in June, after clashing with the president over how best to respond to protests in downtown Los Angeles over the president’s immigration raids. Trump deployed about 4,000 National Guard troops, ordering them to the streets under federal control, over Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections. Trump also sent about 700 active-duty Marines to the city.

Over a three-day trial in San Francisco, US District Judge Charles Breyer will hear testimony and legal arguments to determine whether the deployment violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that sharply limits members of the military from enforcing civilian laws.

“It doesn’t seem like we’re on the threshold of mass violence and chaos,” said Jon Michaels, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles law school. “The city didn’t feel dangerous. But is that a decision for me to make? Is that a decision for Gavin Newsom to make? Is that a decision for Judge Breyer to make? Or is it up to federal officials? Whoever ultimately gets to make that decision dictates how this case comes out.”

Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats, said troops weren’t needed and their presence inflamed tensions. Newsom said the troops were diverted from more important duties, including wildfire suppression and helping battle drug smuggling at the Mexican border.

The trial starts days after Trump told reporters he was considering deploying the National Guard to address crime in the city of Washington. That came in response to a late-night assault on a DOGE staffer during a carjacking attempt.

Earlier this year, Breyer ordered Trump to return the National Guard to Newsom’s control, but a federal appeals court in San Francisco put a hold on the order, ruling that Trump had likely acted within the law.

‘Great Significance’

This week’s proceedings are about whether federal troops were illegally used for traditional law enforcement activities, according to Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.

“With President Trump increasingly talking about using troops for law enforcement purposes, this trial has great significance,” Chemerinsky said.

A win for Trump could be seen as a green-light for presidents to unilaterally employ the military to police citizens inside the US.

The Trump administration has argued that the president has broad, unilateral power to federalize the National Guard when he determines there is a “rebellion” or “invasion” or when “regular forces” are unable to enforce the law. A lawyer for the state called the prospect that a president can order troops into US cities without court review “terrifying.”

The case may ultimately be decided by the US Supreme Court, long after the troops have left Los Angeles. Nearly all have now been recalled, with just a small contingent left to stand guard at some federal facilities.

The case is Newsom v. Trump, 25-cv-04870, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

Under an expansion of the Deport Now, Appeal Later policy, the number of countries whose nationals can be removed before their appeals are heard will rise from 8 to 23. Individuals from these countries who have had human rights claims refused will be deported before they can appeal and will be allowed to participate in appeal hearings remotely via video link.

In a Home Office press release, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was quoted as saying: ""For far too long, foreign criminals have been exploiting our immigration system, remaining in the UK for months or even years while their appeals drag on. That has to end. Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced.""

According to Sky News, the fifteen new countries added to the Deport Now, Appeal Later scheme will be Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia. They will join the existing eight countries of Albania, Belize, Estonia, Finland, Kosovo, Mauritius, Nigeria, and Tanzania, which were added when the policy was restarted in 2023.

The Home Office says the measure will avoid offenders from the 15 countries in question remaining in the UK for months or years while their cases are worked through the appeals system.

In last month's notable case of Kapikanya v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWCA Civ 987, the Court of Appeal dismissed a Zambian national's challenge to a deportation order that had been pursued, in various forms, for more than 25 years. Lord Justice Bean noted that the appellant had been the subject of five separate deportation decisions since 1998, but a combination of appeals and reconsiderations had allowed him to remain in the UK throughout that period.

Separately, the Ministry of Justice announced plans yesterday for legislation enabling the immediate deportation of certain foreign national offenders after sentencing. This would apply to prisoners serving determinate sentences, but it will exclude offenders serving life sentences and cases where national security concerns apply.

If follows changes expected to take effect next month under the draft Criminal Justice Act 2003 (Removal of Prisoners for Deportation) Order 2025 that will allow deportations after 30% of a sentence is served, down from the current 50%. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood spoke to The Sun on Sunday to announce the plan to reduce this further to 0%, with the article reporting that it is set to come into force in the New Year. The change will require primary legislation, which ministers say will be brought before Parliament in due course.

According to The Times, those deported will be permanently barred from returning to the UK, though the Government's press release did not mention this. The Times also noted that the measure would mean criminals returning to their home country will often serve no prison time.

United States | Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/fernandez-v-united-states/,"This disquiet contributed to his belief that there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce Fernandez’s sentence.
In August 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that this position is at odds with both the text and history of the compassionate release statute.
In 1984, the phrase “extraordinary and compelling reasons” connoted determinations that were broad, individualized, and fact-dependent.
In seeking compassionate release, prisoners do not argue that they are imprisoned without sufficient cause.
As congressional debates make clear, the lawmakers who enacted § 3582(C)(1)(A) understood that compassionate release and § 2255 performed completely different functions.","Drawing on a centuries-long tradition of granting wide discretion to judges when imposing sentences, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 allows federal judges to reduce a previously imposed sentence when they conclude that there are “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to do so.

In 2021, exercising that discretionary authority, the district court judge in this case reduced the mandatory life sentence that Joe Fernandez is currently serving for a crime that he maintains he did not commit. Though the sentencing judge who agreed to reduce the sentence had been the one to preside over Fernandez’s trial, he explained that he still harbored a “certain disquiet” about the verdict. This disquiet contributed to his belief that there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce Fernandez’s sentence.

The Second Circuit reversed the district court judge’s decision to grant the motion, holding that the sentencing judge could not consider his disquiet about the verdict in a motion for compassionate release because, in its view, concerns about the validity of a verdict can only be considered in response to a petition under 25 U.S.C. § 2255. In August 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that this position is at odds with both the text and history of the compassionate release statute.

The text of Section 3582(c)(1)(A) of the Sentencing Reform Act gives judges broad discretion to determine the existence of “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for a sentence reduction. The statute contains only one instruction about the scope of judges’ authority to assess the “extraordinary and compelling reasons” for compassionate release: courts must abide by the Sentencing Commission’s policy statements. And in tasking the Sentencing Commission with providing guidance on what should be considered “extraordinary and compelling reasons,” it provides only one stipulation: “[r]ehabilitation of the defendant alone shall not be considered an extraordinary and compelling reason.” The clear inference is that other reasons are permissible within a judge’s discretion.

Congress’s use of the phrase “extraordinary and compelling” bears this out. In 1984, the phrase “extraordinary and compelling reasons” connoted determinations that were broad, individualized, and fact-dependent. The plain language of the statute indicates that the sentencing judge should make an individualized assessment of the case, considering all relevant factors, to decide whether there were “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to reduce the individual’s sentence, and no factors other than rehabilitation alone should be categorically excluded. Legal dictionaries and case law at the time reinforce this definition.

Section 3582(c)(1)(A)’s history confirms the broad discretion it grants to sentencing judges. Before the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, courts imposed the sentence, but parole officers exercised absolute discretion over the actual duration of imprisonment. Congress felt that the system of indeterminate sentencing had unjustified consequences, like creating uncertainty as to the time an offender would actually spend in prison, producing serious disparities between sentences imposed for similar offenses, and letting parole boards usurp the function of the judiciary. In response to these concerns, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 revolutionized the federal sentencing scheme, creating a more structured system with a compassionate release provision acting as a “safety valve” in unusual cases. Lawmakers described this safety valve authority as a response to judges’ requests for the power to deal with what one congressman described as “the very exceptional situation where someone obviously slips through the cracks and gets a much longer sentence.” In granting judges this “safety valve” authority, Congress ensured that they would have the same broad discretion to consider a wide variety of different factors that parole officials had enjoyed under the previous regime.

The lower court incorrectly held that the sentencing judge could not consider Mr. Fernandez’s arguments about his “potential innocence” in a motion under § 3582(C)(1)(A) because, in its view, those claims were only “cognizable under section 2255,” which delineates how federal prisoners may file habeas petitions. But the statutes are completely different. Section 2255 provides federal prisoners with a means to “attack” or “test the legality” of their detention, and ultimately results in a sentence being completely vacated. In seeking compassionate release, prisoners do not argue that they are imprisoned without sufficient cause. Rather, they argue that they should be released from prison without invalidating the underlying conviction. As congressional debates make clear, the lawmakers who enacted § 3582(C)(1)(A) understood that compassionate release and § 2255 performed completely different functions.

The court below was wrong to prohibit the sentencing judge from considering his “disquiet” about the verdict when reducing Mr. Fernandez’s life sentence, and the Supreme Court should reverse.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-08-11 11:57:22.405540

Al Jazeera decried the targeted killing as a “desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza.” Funerals were held today for Anas al-Sharif, his fellow colleague Mohammed Qreiqeh, cameramen Ibrahim Zaher and Moamen Aliwa, and their assistant Mohammed Noufal.

The attack came just weeks after Al Jazeera, the Committee to Protect Journalists and a top U.N. official all warned al-Sharif’s life was in danger after Israel accused him of being a member of Hamas.

Ibrahim Abu Moussa: “The occupation says that by killing the journalists, the truth will be stopped and that its crimes will not be exposed. But I tell the occupation that your bombardment on us increases our determination and resolve in conveying the voice and the suffering of our people in Gaza, and we show your crimes against our Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.”

Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced Australia will recognize a Palestinian state next month, following similar calls by Britain, France and Canada.

This comes as health officials in Gaza say at least five more Palestinians, including a child, have starved to death over the past day, bringing the total to at least 222, including over 100 children.

On Sunday, Russia and Ukraine traded drone attacks, with Ukraine hitting the southern Russian region of Saratov, killing one person and damaging several apartments and an industrial facility. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for more pressure on Russia to end the war.

President Volodymyr Zelensky: “We clearly understand the threats. All our partners understand the threats just as clearly. Everyone sees that there has been no real step from Russia toward peace, no action on the ground nor in the air that could save lives. That is why sanctions are needed, pressure is needed, strength is needed — the strength, first and foremost, of the United States, the strength of Europe, the strength of all nations in the world that want peace and stability in international relations. If Russia does not want to stop the war, then its economy must be stopped.”

On Friday, President Trump removed the head of the IRS shortly after a conflict over tax data used to help locate undocumented immigrants, according to a Washington Post report. IRS Commissioner Billy Long was a former Republican congressmember nominated by Trump to lead the agency and was only in the job for two months before he was removed.

Two weeks after our conversation Lelo agreed to “voluntary departure”—the term used by immigration authorities for self-deportation.
“Geo does this on purpose to make it hard for folks, while maximizing their profit by not having more employees,” Lelo said.
Bad conditions serve to coerce people detained at the Northwest Detention Center into self-deportation.
Within hours he was in the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, and in line for a flight back to Mexico.","When I spoke with Alfredo Juarez Zeferino, known as “Lelo,” while he was imprisoned in the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington, he had to be very careful about what he said. Calls to detainees are monitored. “My freedom of speech here is very limited,” he warned me. Lelo had been held there since his detention in March, and I interviewed him in July.

Two weeks after our conversation Lelo agreed to “voluntary departure”—the term used by immigration authorities for self-deportation. In early August, by telephone from Santa Cruz Yucucani, his hometown in the southern Mexican state of Guerrero, he was able to describe the conditions in this enormous immigrant detention center, which today holds more than 1,500 people awaiting deportation.

“It’s a really terrible place,” Lelo told me. He said bad food was probably the worst problem: The Geo Group, a private corporation that runs the detention center, is supposed to provide three meals a day, but often the last meal would come at one or two in the morning. “The rice was hard, like it never touched hot water, and the beans were never cooked all the way,” Lelo said. “That was the main food they gave us. Chicken was so undercooked that sometimes it dripped blood, and people got sick during the night. One time everybody turned in their trays and we wouldn’t take the food.”

The second week he was there, Lelo started having vision problems because the lights were always on at night, making it hard to sleep. He signed up for the “sick call” list to get eye drops. “I waited a long time to see a doctor,” he recalled, “and finally an officer told us to go back to our unit. They only had one doctor, and we weren’t going to be seen. After that I didn’t sign up again, but other folks in my unit would wait hours and hours and still not get seen. I’d share an apple or something sweet for people who were diabetic. But day after day it was the same thing. Sign up and maybe tomorrow somebody will see you.”

The Tacoma immigrant detention center is run by the Geo Group, founded as a division of the Wackenhut Corporation, with ties to U.S. intelligence agencies going back to the Cold War. Since discovering in the 1980s the huge profits to be made in federal contracts, the company has become one of the two largest corporations running immigrant detention centers in the United States. Much of those profits are earned by keeping operating costs at a minimum; as a result Geo has been repeatedly charged with short staffing at the prisons it runs. “Geo does this on purpose to make it hard for folks, while maximizing their profit by not having more employees,” Lelo said. Bad conditions serve to coerce people detained at the Northwest Detention Center into self-deportation.

Self-deportation is an important arm of the Trump Administration’s immigration policy. According to Mark Krikorian, executive director of the anti-immigrant Center for Immigration Studies, “Any successful strategy to cut the illegal population significantly will have to combine two things: ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] arresting and removing illegal aliens, and other illegal aliens leaving on their own . . . . Preliminary data suggest nearly one million illegal aliens have departed the country since President Donald Trump’s Inauguration.”

That number is highly questionable, and the center provides no data to support it. It is undeniable, however, that the government is pressuring people to self-deport. Fear of deportation and family separation, as well as hopelessness about any prospect for legal status, has led many people to leave the United States.

In a highly-publicized immigration raid at Glass House Farms on California’s central coast, chaos and fear were deliberately used as weapons to terrorize workers and their families. One man, Jaime Alaniz Garcia, fell to his death desperately fleeing ICE agents. The terror produced by the raids is also a weapon to get people to leave on their own. Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol official in charge of the Southern California region, responded to criticism of the Glass House raid. “Illegal aliens had the opportunity to self deport,” he said. “Now we’ll help things along a bit.”

“They are trying all they can to get folks out of the country,” Lelo said, “whether through deportation or asking folks to self deport.” Inside the Tacoma detention center, ICE agents took another tactic. “They went to my unit three times, saying that if people gave up their right to fight their case and self-deported, they’d send them $1,000 after sixty days. People got really mad because a lot have lived here for many years. We have families and we’re part of the community. What is $1,000 compared to twenty years of your life?”

Nevertheless, the constant pressure took its toll on his family, and eventually on Lelo himself. In early March his family decided to return to their hometown, Santa Cruz Yucucani. At that point, Lelo had not yet been detained. Later, as he languished inside, he described their reasons.

“It was a hard decision because my parents had lived in Washington for eighteen years,” he explained. “My siblings were born in the United States. They were going to school there. All their friends are there. But as we saw ICE begin to round up more and more folks, we did not want to put my family through the trauma of separation. So we decided they would leave, which they did on March 16 from Santa Maria, [California, a town from which many people leave to go back to Mexico] on the bus. It’s hard to describe the feeling. We always had this plan for my siblings to go to school and have a better life, more opportunity than my parents had. It was like we had to start all over again.”

Then, on March 25, as he was driving his compañera to work in the tulip fields of the Washington Bulb Company, in the Skagit Valley north of Seattle, he was stopped by immigration agents. When he asked for a warrant, they broke the car window and dragged him out. Within hours he was in the Tacoma Northwest Detention Center, and in line for a flight back to Mexico. Only a wave of public outrage, including calls from U.S. Representative Rick Larson, Democrat of Washington, and Washington Governor Bob Ferguson, also a Democrat, kept him from being loaded onto a deportation plane.

Those protests acknowledged that Lelo’s arrest was not random. ICE later said he had been detained because of an earlier deportation order, but Lelo called the charge a pretext. “Before my detention, I had no idea that there was a removal order for me from 2017, under the first Trump Administration. If they’d really wanted to remove me, they could have, but they didn’t. They waited until Trump was President again to go after me. I was never given the opportunity to respond or fully defend myself. There was never any due process.”

Lelo was targeted because of his history as a farmworker organizer. He was a cofounder of Washington’s new union, Familias Unidas por la Justicia, and helped organize many of the campaigns by Community to Community, the state’s advocate for agricultural workers. One of these was for a cap on rents, and another for the Keep Washington Working Act to protect the rights of farmworkers.

But it was his public criticism of the H-2A contract labor program that earned Lelo the greatest hostility among growers. That program allows growers to recruit workers in Mexico for a season’s work, after which they must return. Workers are very vulnerable, and can be fired and blacklisted for organizing, or simply for failing to meet production quotas. Almost one-third of farmworkers in Washington state have now been replaced by contractors using the H-2A program.

“Growers like WAFLA [the Washington Farm Labor Association—a large labor contractor] know me very well,” he recalled, “and were very upset at our opposition to the H-2A program. I would talk to local workers about losing jobs because of it, and to the H-2A workers themselves when they called to report abuses. That made me a big target. But I don’t regret anything I’ve done. It was all supporting workers.”

In the end, however, months in detention took their toll. In mid-July Lelo decided to leave the country voluntarily. He and many others faced the same situation, worn down by the impact of dehumanizing conditions and hopelessness for any solution to their cases. “It’s very hard to bring legal cases from within this place,” he explained during our conversation while he was still in Tacoma. “There are many people here and they’re all losing [their cases] and getting deported. Two people even won their cases, and they’re going to be deported anyway. A lot of people here have legal status. They have good jobs. They’ve been paying taxes for many years. But at the end of their last hearing, they get removed from the country anyway.”

In that sense, Lelo’s case was no different. “Winning from within just doesn’t seem possible,” he said. “Even if I went through all the legal steps and had a decision in my favor, there is no guarantee I will be released after that. Signing the voluntary departure is the only option I have.”

At the end of the ordeal, however, Lelo found himself in Santa Cruz Yucucani, an Indigenous Mixtec community that he only remembered as a child, but which still remembered him. “I went to town a couple of days ago and people recognized me and invited me to eat,” he told me. “I’ve had a lot of really good food here. There are other families in Santa Cruz that have come back as well, and folks are excited that we’re back.”

Lelo’s family are farmers, and on his return he began going out to the fields with his father and grandfather, where they plant corn, green beans, pumpkins, and bananas. “My grandpa sells a little bit of it, but it’s mostly just for the family. We clean the fields and take care of the crops.”

As a union organizer of farmworkers in the United States who labor for wages in industrial agriculture, it has been a revelatory experience. “The big difference is that here we don’t work for anybody, because the fields belong to the family,” he says. “We can take a break whenever we want, and when it gets hot we just go find shade. It’s a huge change from being a farmworker working for a boss.”

But he doesn’t forget the union and the community from which he was taken by force. “I haven’t stopped feeling part of an immigrant community that’s trying to defend itself. As a farmworker it’s heartbreaking to see pictures of the military chasing us in the fields. We’ve never been able to legalize, and now we have to leave. It’s not right. People have to pay attention to what's happening and speak up. Don’t look the other way.”

In the meantime, though, Lelo simply has to live. “Tomorrow I’m going to the banana field. It’s going to be the first time in eighteen years,” he says.",https://progressive.org/downloads/22046/download/dnblelo01.jpg?cb=76b716b358ab76bf209f7b46abdb5b64&w=1200,N,,2025-08-11 10:56:47.386434

Kraft Heinz countered that Finley was terminated for dishonesty during an investigation into the botched firing of another employee, Yolanda Gaines.
The events of Kraft Heinz’s investigation should have been “considered not in isolation, but in conjunction with Finley’s evidence of contributing-factor causation,” the judge said.
“The district court believed that sorting through this dispute would require it to ‘speculate’ about what really happened,” the judge said.
Concluding that the District Court erred in awarding summary judgment to Kraft Heinz, the panel vacated that ruling and remanded the case.","A district court erroneously analyzed a whistleblower’s wrongful termination complaint using a but-for causation framework, rather than the more generous contributing factor standard under the Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has held.

Rather than consider all the evidence to determine whether a reasonable jury could side with the claimant, the district court granted summary judgment to the employer based on its explanation that the claimant was fired for dishonesty, not his protected activity.

Judge Pamela A. Harris said the District Court erred because the claimant’s conduct during the investigation “should be considered not in isolation, but in conjunction with [the claimant’s] evidence of contributing factor causation.”

“We hold only that a reasonable jury could infer from the record, considered as a whole, that something more than Finley’s alleged ‘dishonesty’ on March 24 contributed to his firing by Kraft Heinz, and that Finley’s increasingly urgent food safety complaints — culminating immediately before his termination — ‘affect[ed] his termination in at least some way,’” Harris wrote.

Judge Stephanie D. Thacker, as well as Judge Thomas T. Cullen, sitting by designation from the Western District of Virginia, joined Harris in vacating and remanding Finley v. Kraft Heinz Inc. (VLW 025-2-284).

Rare case

Stephani L. Ayers of T.M. Guyer and Ayers & Friends in Miami said this was “one of those rare cases” where co-workers were not afraid to support a whistleblower. “We had three co-workers who offered testimony about our client’s complaints, including a food safety manager,” she said.

When her client was fired, Ayers said the employer was in the process of installing X-rays to detect bone fragments. “But if you’re not using the machines correctly, then it’s just a signoff without proper validation,” she noted. “These issues occurred about every six months.”

In her practice representing whistleblowers, Ayers said that “from time-to-time, federal judges have tried to invoke the Title VII framework, maybe because they are more familiar with it. We have even seen it in litigation with the Department of Labor.”

“Whistleblower statutes are first administered by the Department of Labor, where you can have a hearing or remove the case to federal court, as we did here,” Ayers said. “This issue seemed appropriate for a federal court and compelling for a jury.”

“The district court adopted and muddled the magistrate judge’s causation language,” Ayers said, adding that “they don’t specialize in this type of law, so sometimes they get the standards a little fuzzy, and here the court said it was ‘a distinction with almost no difference.’”

The district court must now determine whether protected activity occurred. “I can’t imagine that the judge will say that our client did not raise a food safety issue,” Ayers said. “I think it’s a foregone conclusion that he’ll find protected activity and we’ll move to trial.”

Attorneys for Kraft Heinz did not respond to a request for comment.

The termination

As a production manager at a Kraft Heinz plant in South Carolina, Wilbert Finley was responsible for product quality and food safety of bacon and deli meat products. Finley began complaining about improperly sealed packages and the presence of large bone fragments.

Finley’s complaints increased in early 2020 and he stopped production to show managers the issues. According to Finley, Kraft Heinz disregarded his complaints and managers criticized him. Kraft Heinz suspended Finley 12 days after his last complaint and fired him two days later.

Finley sued Kraft Heinz for violating the FSMA by firing him after he raised food safety concerns. Kraft Heinz countered that Finley was terminated for dishonesty during an investigation into the botched firing of another employee, Yolanda Gaines.

Kraft Heinz argued that one of Finley’s subordinates, Bobby Clark, had been instructed to terminate Gaines. Although both Finley and Clark signed the termination form, nobody fired Gaines, who continued working until March 24, 2020. A human resources investigation ensued.

The events of that investigation were disputed. Kraft Heinz maintained that Finley’s inconsistent explanations led to his termination for dishonesty and lack of integrity, regardless of any prior protected activity.

Despite the “undoubtedly close temporal proximity” between Finley’s complaints and firing, a magistrate judge said the causal inference that his protected activity was a contributing factor to his termination was severed by the legitimate intervening event of his firing for dishonesty.

The district court agreed that Finley could not show that his complaints were a contributing factor to his termination. Further, the court disregarded Finley’s comparator and retaliation evidence because Kraft Heinz would have fired him for other reasons.

Finley appealed the court’s grant of summary judgment to Kraft Heinz.

‘Broad and forgiving’

The FSMA instructs courts “to review retaliation claims under a ‘contributing factor’ standard commonly used in whistleblower statutes,” Harris clarified, adding that the district court erroneously used the but-for causation framework from statutes like Title VII and the ADEA.

“This is a meaningful difference; as the Supreme Court has explained [in Murray v. UBS Sec., LLC], the contributing factor standard is more generous to employees and ‘not as protective of employers’ than causations standards under other statutes,” Harris pointed out.

Congress designed the contributing-factor for “‘contexts where the health, safety, or well-being of the public may well depend on whistleblowers feeling empowered to come forward,’” she explained.

Here, Finley needed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case that his protected activities tended to have any effect on Kraft Heinz’s decision to terminate him.

“‘This element is broad and forgiving,’ Harris wrote, looking to Feldman v. Law Enf’t Assocs. Corp. Finley “‘need not show that the activities were a primary or even a significant cause of his termination,’” she added.

“So long as his complaints ‘affect[ed] his termination in at least some way,’ he has made the necessary showing,” the judge said.

“At that point, the burden shifts to Kraft Heinz, which may nevertheless prevail if it can establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action and fired Finley even ‘in the absence of [his] protected activity,’” Harris noted.

Intervening event

Like any intervening event, Kraft Heinz’s investigation of the Gaines incident must be considered in the district court’s causation analysis.

“But an ‘intervening event’ is not a talisman that makes all other evidence of causation disappear, establishing conclusively that there can be no connection between protected activity and an adverse action,” Harris wrote.

The events of Kraft Heinz’s investigation should have been “considered not in isolation, but in conjunction with Finley’s evidence of contributing-factor causation,” the judge said.

Harris compared this case to Feldman, which held that “a ‘legitimate intervening event, coupled with the passage of a significant amount of time after [the] alleged protected activities, sever[ed] the causal connection.’”

“An intervening event may ‘undermin[e]’ the strength of an inference that otherwise would arise from temporal proximity,” the judge said. “But the question at summary judgment remains the same: In light of all the evidence, including the intervening event, could a reasonable jury conclude that Finley’s protected activity tended to affect his termination?”

Because Finley correctly objected that evidence supporting Kraft Heinz’s position did not negate his own evidence, the district court erred by not considering all the evidence to determine whether a reasonable jury could side with Finley.

Subtle distinction

Whether Clark was a valid comparator to Finley was genuinely disputed. Finley argued that he was disciplined more severely than others involved in the Gaines incident, leading to an inference that Kraft Heinz singled him out because of his prior safety complaints.

“The district court believed that sorting through this dispute would require it to ‘speculate’ about what really happened,” the judge said. “That is correct — and precisely why whether Clark is a valid comparator cannot be determined, on this record, as a matter of law.”

Harris also found genuine questions regarding the reason for Finley’s termination, as well as Finley’s role — if any — in the Gaines incident because evidence was in conflict about whether he intentionally lied or was merely inconsistent during the investigation.

The judge opined that the issue was not a matter of semantics, but rather a “subtle distinction.”

“[F]or a jury charged with determining the credibility of Kraft Heinz’s position that it would have fired Finley for his March 24 conduct — the difference between an intentional lie and an alleged inconsistency over the course of a day of meetings — could very well make a difference,” she pointed out.

A reasonable jury could infer that something more than Finley’s alleged dishonesty contributed to his firing, and that his increasingly urgent food safety complaints before his termination affected his termination in at least some way, the panel held.

“And for much the same reason, a jury could also doubt Kraft Heinz’s position that it would have taken the ‘same action’ – firing Finley, while leaving Clark undisciplined — even if Finley had never voiced a concern about food safety,” Harris wrote.

The large police presence had made many of them nervous, even if the authorities were not in town to pick up undocumented residents, she said.
In December of 1984, Ms. Salas and her daughter, Gloria Peña, 53, were living in the Hill Country, without legal authorization, when another flash flood hit.
Ms. Salas and Ms. Peña became legal residents under an immigration amnesty program by President Ronald Reagan.
“I understand their fear, because I was in their shoes,” Ms. Salas said.","Leo, a 14-year-old undocumented immigrant, had joined volunteers searching the banks of the Guadalupe River four days after the deadly Central Texas floods of July 4 when he slipped and fell into treacherous waters contaminated with corpses and debris. He emerged with flesh and finger bones exposed on a left hand that had been nearly severed.

For an excruciating hour, his parents were gripped by fear. What if the hospital staff asked for immigration documents? Finally, they broke down and brought him for care, the family said.

“They are going to take him away,” Gabriela, Leo’s 42-year-old mother, recalled thinking, as doctors wheeled her son away. Both asked to be identified only by their first names because of their immigration statuses.

Local, state and federal officials have said repeatedly that aid and medical assistance are flowing into Texas Hill Country in the wake of floods that killed at least 135 people and injured scores more.

But immigrant rights groups and religious volunteers in the region worry that undocumented residents in Central Texas, such as Leo and his family, are not getting what they need amid immigration crackdowns that have pressed a large migrant community underground. “A lot of people are afraid,” said Sonya De La Garza-Walker, a member of the League of United Latin American Citizens in San Antonio, a Latino civil rights organization that has assisted in the devastated areas. “They think that asking for help may call attention to themselves.”

Officials in Kerr County did not respond to requests for comment about the area’s undocumented community. The county, at the heart of the Texas Hill Country, suffered 108 known deaths, including at least 27 counselors and campers from Camp Mystic.

During a recent Texas legislative committee hearing that took place in Kerrville, the county seat, Auburne Gallagher, a witness, pleaded with legislators, “Did you account for the illegal population in our area?”

When the legislators failed to answer, she did. “No,” she said, “you did not.”

Ms. Gallagher, who lives in Leander, Texas, said in an interview on Thursday that, despite the criticism she received on social media about her views on illegal immigration, she believed that everyone deserved aid after a natural disaster.

“We’re all human beings. We’re all God’s children, whether we’re here legally or illegally,” Ms. Gallagher said. “Everybody should be treated humanely. If you need something, ask.”

It is difficult to measure the size of the undocumented population, much less the number of people who may be injured and unaided. The region, known for its rugged and wide-open spaces, is home to summer camps for children, vacation homes for the wealthy, and inns, camp sites and R.V. parks for the working class. It has grown more diverse in the last decade as the service economy has expanded.

Latinos, totaling 13,598 in the 2020 census, make up about 30 percent of the population of Kerr County, where they work in the camps, construction and agriculture.

“A lot of people would rather not leave their homes unless they have to,” he said.

In the aftermath of the Fourth of July floods, Teresa Salas, 70, said she rushed to a church for Spanish-speaking faithful in Comfort, Texas, to offer help to migrants, many of them undocumented, who were seeking a safe space. The large police presence had made many of them nervous, even if the authorities were not in town to pick up undocumented residents, she said.

In December of 1984, Ms. Salas and her daughter, Gloria Peña, 53, were living in the Hill Country, without legal authorization, when another flash flood hit. Ms. Salas and Ms. Peña escaped with their lives, but Juan Manuel Barraza, Ms. Salas’s husband and Ms. Peña’s father, was found dead, along with two of Ms. Salas’s daughters and Ms. Peña’s sisters, Beatriz and Erica, then just 3 and 2 years old.

Ms. Salas and Ms. Peña became legal residents under an immigration amnesty program by President Ronald Reagan. But they remember the trauma that others are reliving now.

“I understand their fear, because I was in their shoes,” Ms. Salas said. “All we can do is offer a lending hand. They don’t have a lot of places where they feel safe, and just like everybody else here they need help.”

The morning of July 8, she said her son was moved by the tragedy at Camp Mystic, where most of the deaths were concentrated in two cabins that housed the youngest campers, and joined a group of search-and-rescue volunteers along the Guadalupe River.

The once placid river where he and his two brothers liked to go swimming had been ravaged. Torn trees, appliances, debris and even corpses littered the banks. Then the boy tripped. Blood was dripping down his leg. He could see finger bones protruding through the skin of his mangled left hand.

“Maybe I was in shock, but at the time I did not feel pain,” he said.

At first, his parents thought they could treat him at home. Family members were aware that Gov. Greg Abbott signed an executive order last year requiring some hospitals to collect data on undocumented patients, part of a broader effort to curtail tax money going to residents living in the state illegally.

Patients are not required to answer the citizenship question, and hospital officials have said they cannot turn away patients if they can’t present legal documents.

“Yes, I was afraid,” Gabriela said. “But I was more afraid that he may get sicker here at home and even something worse, a bad infection and even death.”

At a local clinic, medical staff told them that they could not do much for him other than to clean his hand and wrap it with bandages. They loaded into the family truck and drove an hour east to an emergency room in San Antonio where they were told that the teenager needed emergency surgery.

Leo, seeing his parent’s worried expressions, pulled on his mother’s sleeve and told her they could go home. “No,” she said. “We are saving your hand.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/07/multimedia/00NAT-TEXASFLOODS-UNDOCUMENTED-2-tlbv/00NAT-TEXASFLOODS-UNDOCUMENTED-2-tlbv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 10:56:50.172297

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.","WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan visited Capitol Hill just weeks after Inauguration Day, with other administration officials and a singular message: They needed money for the White House's border security and mass deportation agenda.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what's arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation's sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump's promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president's agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,"" they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated"" through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves ""inward.""

The flood of cash comes when Americans' views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump's approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul's proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1fd79992-6f9a-4731-91bb-c590d104b962/wirestory_a2c6a2f726629e62bd0199aee68294f6_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-11 11:56:47.163081

ABA House will tackle issues, including law firm intimidation, immigration at Toronto session

The American Bar Association’s policy making body, the House of Delegates, will consider almost 60 policy matters, including one on law firm intimidation, several on immigration enforcement and detention and resolutions on academic freedom and open, civil debate at universities when it meets today and Tuesday during the 2025 ABA Annual Meeting in Toronto.

Resolutions are not ABA policy until they are voted on and passed by the House of Delegates.

Resolution 509 opposes government action punishing or threatening lawyers, law firms or other organizations for representation of clients or causes disfavored by the government.

Other proposals addressing democracy in America include Resolution 512 which reaffirms the ABA’s commitment to upholding the rule of law and protecting civil rights and urges all levels of government to ensure that laws are enacted and enforced consistently with constitutional principles; preserve judicial independence; safeguard the rights of vulnerable communities; and promote civic education. Another resolution, 511, opposes the dismantling or defunding, in whole or in part, of any federal agency or independent agency created by legislation or halting any of such an agency’s statutory functions, in the absence of legislation expressly authorizing such measures.

Follow along with the ABA Journal’s coverage of the 2025 ABA Annual Meeting here.

Immigration enforcement and detention policies also will be debated. Resolution 510 urges the executive branch and Congress to adopt policies and enact legislation that ensures due process protections, including meaningful notice, opportunity to be heard and access to legal counsel, in all proceedings involving denial of entry, visa revocation, rescission of lawful permanent residency or removal from the United States, including those based upon alleged security or criminal concerns.

Resolution 602 urges Congress and the Department of Homeland Security to prohibit immigration enforcement operations in or around sensitive locations (e.g., such as hospitals, schools, houses of worship, demonstrations and public safety agencies) except for where exigent circumstances exist. Another resolution, 603, urges the executive branch to adopt policies and Congress to enact laws that prohibit detention of immigrants in Department of Defense facilities, such as the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, and implement procedures for immigrant detention that give full consideration to the protection of immigrant detainee rights pursuant to the U.S. Constitution and the Immigration and Nationality Act.

Resolutions related to education also will be considered. Resolution 504 urges law schools to actively promote environments where civil discourse can thrive, particularly through student debate unions and forums that serve as essential spaces for free expression, reasoned discussion and the exchange of diverse perspectives on contentious issues.

Resolution 513 supports the academic freedom of American universities, colleges and law schools and opposes governmental efforts to impose the government’s viewpoint with respect to the academic qualifications of students or faculty or the content of curricula or specific courses. Another resolution, 505, urges law schools to adopt clear, specific and transparent policies governing the use of generative artificial intelligence tools by students.

Other resolutions of note to be debated at the meeting include:

• Resolution 518: Opposing the adoption of civil or criminal laws that impose criminal and civil penalties or rights deprivations based on an individual’s conduct during pregnancy or its outcome.

• Resolution 522: Urging Congress to pass H.R. 154, or similar legislation, to establish a federal Election Day in every even-numbered year as a federal public holiday.

• Resolution 605: Urging states and courts to study community justice worker programs successfully implemented in several U.S. jurisdictions and to adopt such programs appropriate for their jurisdiction to expand the accessibility, affordability and quality of civil legal services provided to those who cannot afford an attorney, while continuing to protect clients and the public.

• Resolution 607: Opposing the enactment and enforcement of, and supporting the repeal of, laws, policies and practices by authorities that punish persons experiencing homelessness and/or poverty.

ABA President Bill Bay, ABA President-elect Michelle Behnke and ABA Executive Director Alpha Brady are scheduled to deliver remarks. Behnke will become ABA president at the close of the HOD meeting on Tuesday. Jonathan Cole, chair of the House of Delegates, will preside over the two-day meeting.

The presentation of colors at the meeting Monday will feature members of the Fort York Guard as a testament to the bonds between the United States and Canada. Fort York, founded in 1793, played an important role in the development of Toronto into the world-class city it is today.

The yearly meeting opened in Toronto on Wednesday. The policymaking House encompasses nearly 600 delegates from ABA entities and state, local and specialty bar associations.

HOD proposals do not become ABA policy until approved by the House, which meets twice annually. The next HOD meeting will be held during the ABA Midyear Meeting, Feb. 3-9, 2026, in San Antonio, Texas.

Editor: Immigration reform. Two words that have been a long time coming and something I believe our country needs. However, this administration hides behind — as they do every policy — lies and deceit.

What this administration is doing is not immigration reform nor are they rounding up criminal and violent offenders. Just exactly what did the 4-year-old and her grandmother do that ICE had to pick them up?

Reports coming out of the prison camp in Florida describe unthinkable human rights violations such as lack of food, maggots in meals, prisoners made to kneel on the floor and eat like dogs. And even worse conditions in the prison in El Salvador.

This Is not what our country is about. I am all for immigration reform but instead of locking up someone who is here illegally maybe we should show them a path to citizenship. Many of the people picked up by ICE are hardworking, taxpaying immigrants who just want a better life. Isn’t that how we all got here? (exception for Native Americans and American Indians who were here first). So really aren’t we all immigrants or descended from immigrants?

Our ancestors wanted better for their families than they had. And so do the many people coming here. Why not put policies in place that will do just that instead of rounding up people who don’t look like they belong.

It’s a shame what this country has become.

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streetsand from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

Nor is the military the main force acting on the Trump administration’s interpretation of immigration law.","Did the U.S. military illegally engage in civilian law enforcement when they were deployed to Los Angeles in June under the orders of President Donald Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth?

California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta say yes. Trump’s Department of Justice says no. The three-day trial to answer this question is scheduled to commence today at 10 a.m. in a California federal district court, with implications for the country as Trump continues to signal a desire to deploy troops to patrol domestic city streets.

The president has appointed himself chair of a task force on the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that “we’ll do anything necessary to keep the Olympics safe, including using our National Guard or military, OK?”

Relatedly, the Department of Defense issued a new activation order to deploy troops in California for another 90 days on Aug. 5, California lawyers told the court in a filing. That came two weeks after the Marines deployed to Los Angeles left and a week after the Trump administration demobilized most of the National Guard.

California’s lawyers assert evidence in their briefs, often redacted because of a court order, that the military took part in law enforcement in violation of 19th Century law called the Posse Comitatus Act. They want a judge to order the Trump administration to permanently halt those actions. The Trump Department of Justice counters that those engagements don’t count as law enforcement, but rather fall under the category of supporting immigration law enforcement agents or protecting federal buildings.

Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, a law that would allow the military to engage in law enforcement activity.

How did we get here?

This trial is an extension of the June lawsuit that Newsom filed against Trump after the president took over California’s National Guard. Trump did that in response to protests that broke out in the Los Angeles area after immigration law enforcement agents began workforce raids to apprehend individuals allegedly in the U.S. without proper authorization.

Ultimately, about 4,000 troops from the California National Guard and 700 U.S. Marines were deployed to Los Angeles.

That month marked a new nadir in the relations between Newsom and Trump. The governor likened the president to failed dictators. Trump endorsed the idea of arresting Newsom.

Charles Breyer, the judge in Monday’s case and oversaw the June hearings, initially sided with Newsom, ordering that Trump return the National Guard to the governor. A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked that move. They found that the Trump administration legitimately called up troops to protect federal buildings and federal employees from some protesters who tossed chunks of concrete and used trash dumpsters as battering rams. California lawyers said the troops’ presence inflamed the protests.

The June protests lasted about a week and were largely isolated to a handful of city blocks in the downtown area; Los Angeles is roughly 500 square miles.

Breyer then allowed California’s lawyers to depose Trump officials and gather documents to argue California’s case that the Trump administration was violating the law barring the military from acting as a police force. Trump’s Department of Justice lawyers tried to cancel the trial but failed.

What is California’s latest allegation?

That Los Angeles residents were “subjected to a form of military occupation” as federal troops worked alongside federal immigration agents, “often indistinguishable from each other.”

The lawyers say that “never before, in the history of the Nation, has the federal government utilized the military for domestic law enforcement in this manner.”

The Trump administration’s “insistence that perimeters, blockades, and other security functions are permissible makes clear they will continue to engage in these activities,” California lawyers with the state attorney general’s office wrote to Breyer.

The lawyers argued that if military forces can accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their raids and arrests, as had been unfolding in Los Angeles, “there would be no logical basis to preclude members of the Armed Forces from accompanying other law enforcement agents when performing their duties,” the California lawyers wrote. Military personnel could accompany federal food safety inspectors, medical fraud investigators or accompany federal voting rights officials to “monitor” election polling places, they wrote.

What are California’s examples of the military acting as police?

Attorneys representing the state pointed to several instances in which they allege troops went too far and violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act, which limits the use of the military in civilian settings:

California attorneys deposed an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field director who said National Guard soldiers accompanied immigration officers on as many as 75% of their missions.

Troops accompanied a federal agency during a “law enforcement operation” at a cannabis facility in Riverside County and formed a security perimeter that prevented people from leaving the site.

Troops allegedly formed security perimeters on July 7 during a demonstration at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles during raids at cannabis farms in Ventura County.

In two incidents, military service members detained civilians, the California lawyers wrote. One took place in Carpinteria in Santa Barbara County, where National Guard troops allegedly “apprehended” a protester. In the other, a Marine on June 13 allegedly detained someone at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles.

California attorneys collected testimony from the deputy chief of staff of the military unit in Los Angeles who said the National Guard is subject to Posse Comitatus and cannot engage in civilian law enforcement.

The attorneys point to military-issued guidance that “directly providing ‘security functions’ for civilian law enforcement agents is a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,” per their summary. But, the lawyers note, the military unit in L.A. was ordered to “actively provide security during civil law enforcement operations on a near-continuous basis since the deployment began,” the California lawyers wrote.

How does the federal government respond?

The federal government says California is wrong for four reasons. Some are disputes over technical court procedure and some disputing the facts California’s legal team is presenting.

Federal lawyers wrote that Posse Comitatus is a criminal statute, which cannot be used in a civil case, and the lawsuit is civil, not criminal.

They dispute that the president or the Department of Defense exceeded its authority in ordering the troops to assist federal immigration law enforcement in apprehensions. “As Supreme Court precedent makes clear, the (Posse Comitatus Act) does not prohibit the President from using troops to protect federal personnel and property,” the Trump administration lawyers wrote.

The federal lawyers also say California has no standing to sue. (California’s attorneys dispute this.)

Fourth, the lawyers say that the National Guard can act as a police force because the law Trump cited to federalize them permits the National Guard to “execute the laws of the United States” if the president is unable to do that with “regular forces,” which at minimum means enforcing “federal immigration laws as well as laws forbidding interference with federal functions or assaults on federal officers and property,” the federal lawyers wrote.

The lawyers also dispute that the military’s role counts as law enforcement. California’s lawyers say the Marines “briefly detained” a protester. But the federal lawyers wrote that action “was in protection of federal property (the individual had attempted to enter a restricted area on federal property multiple times) and the Marines turned that individual over to the LAPD minutes later.”

And providing a perimeter for federal immigration law enforcement also doesn’t violate Posse Comitatus, because, as a previous federal court found, “Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to federal troops playing ‘a passive role in civilian enforcement activities,’” the federal lawyers wrote.

What is likely to happen after this trial?

How Breyer will rule is impossible to forecast. He sided with California already only to have a three-judge panel in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals block his orders.

Nor is the military the main force acting on the Trump administration’s interpretation of immigration law. The Department of Homeland Security has that role through its various agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.

Those agencies were temporarily blocked by a lower district court judge from making apprehensions in Southern California based on race, ethnicity, language, and location or employment.

San Quentin hosts first-ever Fiesta de San Salvador.

Event celebrates Centro-American and Salvadoran heritage.

San Quentin’s rehabilitation efforts face challenges from harsh immigration policies.

SAN QUENTIN, Calif. — On Friday, the San Quentin Rehabilitation Center hosted its first-ever Fiesta de San Salvador, a celebration of Centro-American and Salvadoran heritage that blended music, indigenous dance and traditional food with a sobering dialogue about rehabilitation, immigration policy and the threat of deportation for many in the prison’s immigrant population.

The event, organized by the San Quentin News, honored El Rey del Mundo, or the Transfiguration of Jesus Christ — a date of deep cultural and religious significance in El Salvador. For the incarcerated Salvadoran community, it was an important opportunity to publicly share their traditions with the broader San Quentin population and visiting guests.

Warden Chance Andes opened the day with a message about inclusion. “I’m honored to share your holiday with you today,” he said.

“We share a day of culture in rehabilitation for all, and that’s really what it’s about. I don’t think anybody does it better than San Quentin. I look in the room and I see the diversity in the room. I see the support from other cultures and it’s truly amazing.”

Andes contrasted San Quentin with other prisons where cultural programming is scarce.

“We believe equal opportunity for all cultures to have the experience of rehabilitation. Our goal is when you go back to your society, regardless of what country you go to, you can truly be rehabilitated and be a contributing member of society.”

Julio Escobar, who works for the Archdiocese of San Francisco, told the audience that restorative justice is something you have to live, not just read about. His ministry began in 1995 with direct outreach to gang members on the streets of San Francisco. By 1999, his team was meeting Norteño members at parks in the Mission District, bringing backpacks of burritos and sodas to build connections.

The work was about “transformational of the heart,” he said, because while they could not offer housing or jobs, they could offer relationships, compassion and consistency. That meant meeting the same people later in juvenile hall, accompanying their families in court, and standing with them at vigils and funerals.

“That’s what it took to do restorative justice practices, not from a book,” Escobar said.

He introduced Esperanza Navas, whose only son was shot and killed in 1999. Through a translator, Navas recounted how her son had joined a gang for protection after arriving in the United States, but later sought help to leave that life.

She said he began advising friends to choose a better path, and his humility and sincerity inspired others — including her — to change. After his death, she committed herself to preventing other young men from going down the same road.

She told the crowd she had replaced hatred with love, “not because of my grace, but the grace of God.” Escobar praised her as a “true example of restorative justice” for returning to work inside jails to encourage transformation, despite the personal pain she carried.

The day’s panel discussion, moderated by journalist and San Quentin resident Juan Moreno Haines, moved quickly to a central concern: what happens to rehabilitated residents who, upon being found suitable for parole, are turned over to federal immigration authorities and deported to countries where they face indefinite detention or worse.

San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whose father is Salvadoran, has spent the last two years visiting San Quentin for regular symposiums with residents. She described how those visits have reshaped her thinking.

“During the prosecution process, what we see is a case file. We don’t get to know the individual behind the case,” she said. “This gives us the ability to come in and try to understand the failures in the system that led to your incarceration… What can we do to be more proactive to prevent crime rather than be reactive once somebody has committed the crime?”

On the immigration issue, Jenkins was unequivocal about her discomfort with adding punitive measures after a sentence is complete.

“When somebody has done their time, they have paid for the crime that they committed, the fact that tacking on then another collateral consequence and what that means for their lives… we have to be able to have those conversations with our elected officials and demand that government look at the fairness in the equation,” she said.

“It is unfair that somebody has to make a choice between saying, I will skip my parole hearing so that I stay here versus be judged in a system that right now has removed due process and be re-incarcerated for something I’ve already been determined to have served my time for.”

Edwin Chavez, a San Quentin resident, who organized the event, provided one of the day’s most personal and harrowing accounts. Chavez explained that his brother, Gabriel V. Chavez, came to the United States from El Salvador at age 9, lived as an undocumented immigrant and was incarcerated at 16 for a gang-related murder.

He served 32 years in a California prison before being transferred to an ICE detention facility for two more years. Upon deportation to El Salvador — a country he had not seen in more than four decades — Gabriel was immediately arrested and imprisoned solely for having tattoos.

“My brother was able to rehabilitate himself in an environment that is not conducive to change — a Level 4 prison,” Chavez said. “To hear your own mother say, ‘They just killed my son’ was one of the hardest things to process. I didn’t have the right words to console her. She can’t hear his voice over the phone, see him or even correspond with him, so she doesn’t know if he’s alive.”

Chavez, who has also committed himself to personal reform at San Quentin, said the situation makes him question his own future. “Yes, we committed crimes, but in the course of that comes the journey of rehabilitation and reform,” he said. “I believe in change. My crime does not define who I am. But I think it is wrong that, just because of the way I look, I should be sent into a black hole. If I take my shirt off right now, maybe some guys might be scared because of my tattoos. But you don’t know what I’ve done as far as rehabilitation and transformation.”

He added that Salvadoran policy under President Nayib Bukele makes deportation a near-certain path to imprisonment for those with any past gang affiliation or visible tattoos, regardless of current conduct.

“Foreign countries should be looking into what we do at San Quentin,” Chavez said. “San Quentin is a unique place. Here, we have the opportunity to transform and give back. Why send us to a place where none of that matters?”

Arturo Menendez, who works in San Quentin’s Catholic Chapel, told the panel that even after years of personal transformation, his future could still end in a Salvadoran prison. “Here, not only was change possible for me, they allow me to do things within the community to help others change. But if the board finds me suitable, I have to worry about being deported to El Salvador and locked up again for old affiliations. That’s my concern.”

Jenkins said the choice faced by people like Menendez and Chavez — between remaining incarcerated in a rehabilitative environment or facing near-certain re-imprisonment abroad — is one California must address.

“We as a state have to figure out what is our answer to this particular problem, particularly for people from El Salvador who are facing what they’re facing right now,” she said. “That might require some extreme level of work on our parts or decisions on our parts that we wouldn’t ordinarily make, but it’s something that needs to be discussed. What are all the mechanisms that we have to protect against this particular issue?”

The conversation drew in community voices.

Alex Sanchez, executive director of Homies Unidos, said he had been deported to El Salvador and later returned after winning political asylum.

“There are ways in which people are fighting those cases of immigration through what’s called a convention against torture,” Sanchez said. “But we have an administration right now that’s coming after all of us. I have a green card. I’m not a U.S. citizen, and I’m afraid to apply now for citizenship.”

Chief Deputy Warden Rosa Rosalez, the first Latina to hold the role at San Quentin, said she would welcome proposals aimed at preventing deportations that undo the work of rehabilitation.

“As an individual, I can wholeheartedly say that I would support it,” she said. “As an employee of the department, you can present me any proposal and I will do my very best to make sure that the highest levels of this department review it for consideration.”

By the end of the day, the Fiesta de San Salvador had accomplished more than cultural celebration.

It had created a forum where a prison warden, a big-city district attorney, community advocates and incarcerated residents spoke openly about the human cost of current immigration policy.

Other highlights included a performance by El Unico Elemento as well as the SQRC Aztec Dancers.

For Jenkins, the message was clear: completing a sentence should mean just that. “If somebody has done their time, it has paid their penance for what they have done, we respect that and allow them to continue on to live their lives accordingly,” she said. “We cannot support a system that piles on consequences that strip away any chance at rebuilding a life.”

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are planning a meeting this Friday in Alaska to discuss the future of the war in Ukraine. The news follows U.S. Vice President Vance meeting with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Saturday in England, at the request of the United States, with the pair joined by Ukrainian officials and European national security advisers. Later Saturday, several European leaders issued a joint statement reaffirming support for Ukraine and insisting Kyiv must be involved in any peace negotiations. Jonathan Beale, Cachella Smith, and Amy Walker report for BBC News.

Ukraine and Europe have countered Russia’s ceasefire plan by offering their own blueprint for ending the war. Moscow’s proposal was put forward in a meeting with senior U.S. officials in England on Saturday, and included the trade of Ukrainian-held parts of the Donetsk region for a ceasefire. A European participant in the talks said Washington reacted positively to the European plan, which includes demands that a ceasefire take place before any other steps are taken and that any territorial concessions must be reciprocal. Bojan Pancevski and Yaroslav Trofimov report for the Wall Street Journal.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday defended his government’s plan to take control of Gaza City, despite widespread opposition and criticism from both longtime allies and domestic opponents. At a news conference in Jerusalem, Netanyahu announced that the Israeli military would expand its campaign to include central Gaza in addition to Gaza City. Netanyahu told reporters, “Dismantling the two remaining Hamas strongholds in Gaza City and the central camps — this is the best way to end the war.” Isabel Kershner and Aaron Boxerman report for the New York Times.

Five Al Jazeera journalists were killed in a targeted Israeli strike near Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital yesterday. The IDF confirmed the strike had targeted prominent reporter Anas al-Sharif, who they said had “served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas.” The IDF also said he had “advanced rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and IDF troops” and claimed to have Hamas documents that showed he had been a member of one of the group’s units in 2019. The Committee to Protect Journalists said Israel has not provided evidence to support its allegations and called the attack “a targeted assassination.” Amy Walker and Tiffany Wertheimer report for BBC News; CNN reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Friday, U.N. ambassadors criticized Israel’s plan to “take control” of Gaza City, with the UK, France, and others warning the plan risked “violating international humanitarian law.” China called it “collective punishment” of people in Gaza, while Russia warned against a “reckless intensification of hostilities.” In response, U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea accused fellow Security Council members of “actively prolonging the war by spreading lies about Israel” and “handing propaganda victories to terrorists.” Amy Walker reports for BBC News; Tal Shalev, Dana Karni, Abeer Salman, Catherine Nicholls, Mohammed Tawfeeq, and Helen Regan report for CNN.

Australia will recognize a Palestinian state at next month’s U.N. General Assembly, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said today. Separately, New Zealand is considering recognizing a Palestinian state, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said today, adding that the cabinet would make a formal decision by next month. Kirsty Needham, Lucy Craymer and Christine Chen report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

Trump spoke with Netanyahu yesterday, where both leaders discussed Israel’s plans for taking control of Gaza and efforts to secure a hostage release. Tyler Pager reports for the New York Times.

White House special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Qatar’s prime minister in Spain on Saturday. The meeting focused on a plan to end the war in Gaza and release all remaining hostages held by Hamas, sources told Axios. The meeting followed Israel’s minister for strategic affairs informing an Israeli Security Cabinet meeting on Thursday that Washington will present an “End Game” proposal for the war in Gaza in the coming weeks, according to a cabinet minister. Barak Ravid reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

A senior official from the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), will travel to Iran for talks today, although no visits to the nuclear site are planned, Iran’s foreign minister announced yesterday. Inspectors from the IAEA have been unable to access Iran’s nuclear facilities since Israel launched its first military strikes on the sites during a 12-day war in June. Iran has accused the agency of effectively facilitating the bombings by releasing a critical report in May, which led to the IAEA’s 35-nation board of governors declaring Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations. Reuters reports.

British police arrested 466 people in Central London on Saturday for protesting against the government’s decision to ban the pro-Palestinian activist group, Palestine Action. The UK-based group was proscribed under anti-terrorism laws last month, making it illegal to be a member or support it. Caitlin Danaher reports for CNN.

The Taliban are investigating explicit death threats against dozens of Afghan women working for the U.N., according to a report released yesterday. The report, by the U.N. mission to the country, said the threats came from unidentified individuals and related to their work with the U.N. The Taliban told the U.N. mission that its personnel were not responsible for the threats, the report added. AP News reports.

North Korea has removed some of its loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, South Korea’s military said Saturday, days after Seoul dismantled its own front-line speakers used for propaganda broadcasts in a bid to diffuse tensions with Pyongyang. Kim Yong-Hyung reports for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

President Trump has signed a secret directive instructing the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels that his administration has designated as terrorist organizations, sources say. In response to the report, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said, “The United States is not going to come to Mexico with the military … We cooperate, we collaborate, but there is not going to be an invasion. That is ruled out, absolutely ruled out.” Helen Cooper, Maggie Haberman, Charlie Savage, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times; Nadine Yousif reports.

Jordan will host a meeting with U.S. and Syrian officials tomorrow to discuss support for rebuilding Damascus, following more than a decade of conflict and December’s removal of former leader Bashar al-Assad by an Islamist-led rebellion. Reuters reports.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The battle over Texas’s congressional map “could literally last years,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said yesterday, while defending his call to arrest the Texas Democrats who left the state in a bid to stall the Republican redistricting efforts. His comments follow the Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton (R) asking the state’s high court Friday to expel 13 of the over 50 Democrats from office who left the state, arguing that they had made “incriminating public statements regarding their refusal to return” to the Texas Capitol. Meanwhile, Rep. Gene Wu, the leader of the Texas Democratic caucus, argued in court papers filed on Friday that Abbott’s proposal to oust the legislators would violate the Texas constitution. Mariana Alfaro and Hannah Knowles report for the Washington Post; Patrick Marley; Yvonne Wingett Sanchez, and Molly Hennessy-Fiske report for the Washington Post; Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

The $1 billion settlement offer by the Trump administration for UCLA is “political extortion,” California Governor Gavin Newsom said yesterday. The university says it is reviewing the offer after the government froze $584 million in funding over alleged antisemitism during campus pro-Palestinian protests. Kanishka Singh reports for Reuters.

Far-right political activist Laura Loomer has launched a striking new criticism of the Pentagon, targeting Army Secretary Dan Discroll for permitting the Army to honor Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg. Groberg, who suffered severe injuries while saving fellow soldiers from a suicide bomber in Afghanistan, was undeserving of such recognition because he delivered private remarks at the 2016 Democratic National Convention and was not “US born,” Loomer implied in her remarks on social media. Dan Lamothe and Tara Copp report for the Washington Post.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

CEO Lip-Bu Tan is slated to visit the White House today, days after Trump called for his removal over alleged ties to Chinese businesses, sources say. Tan is reportedly planning a wide-ranging discussion with Trump to outline his personal and professional background, including emphasizing his commitment to the United States, framing Intel’s manufacturing capabilities as a national security matter, and possibly proposing ways to collaborate with the U.S. government. Lauren Thomas reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are expected to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from selling AI chips to China as part of an unusual financial agreement with the Trump administration. Tripp Mickle reports for the New York Times.

IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Federal immigration authorities detained a woman seeking treatment at the National Institutes of Health’s main research hospital, according to an internal document and an NIH official briefed on the incident. The patient, who previously received care at an NIH center in Maryland, was stopped at a security checkpoint when her state-issued driver’s license failed to comply with new federal security ID requirements. A subsequent warrant check revealed an active order for her removal, prompting NIH officials to notify ICE. Carolyn Y. Johnson, David Ovalle, and Sabrina Malhi report for the Washington Post.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The FBI has started sending agents on overnight shifts to assist local law enforcement in preventing carjackings and violent crime in Washington, as Trump continues his threats of a federal takeover of the city and weighs deploying the National Guard. A decision on the Guard deployment could come as soon as today, when Trump is scheduled to hold a White House news conference on D.C. crime, according to a U.S. official. Yesterday, Trump compared his planned crackdown on crime in D.C. to his aggressive immigration enforcement at the southern border, promising to “immediately clear out the city’s homeless population and take swift action against crime.” Perry Stein, Olivia George, Ellen Nakashima, and Dan Lamothe report for the Washington Post.

FBI Director Kash Patel removed another group of agents who had been involved in investigations against the president and his allies. Patel and his deputy have also recently required agents to undergo polygraph tests to determine whether they had leaked negative information about FBI leadership, sources say. Patel has also recently fired, demoted, or reassigned dozens of employees tied to work criticized by Republicans. Sadie Gurman reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Hours before IRS Commissioner Billy Long was forced out by Trump administration officials on Friday, the Internal Revenue Service clashed with the White House over using tax data to track and locate suspected undocumented migrants, sources say. Following Long’s departure, Treasury Security Scott Bessent will step in as the agency’s acting head. Jacob Bogage and Kadia Goba report for the Washington Post; Avery Lotz reports for Axios.

Less than two weeks after being removed at the White House’s direction, a senior Food and Drug Administration official is being reinstated, a health agency spokesperson said Saturday. Vinay Prasad will return as head of the senior regulator overseeing vaccines and complex treatments for disease, a role he lost following a right-wing pressure campaign. Lauren Weber and Rachel Rouebein report for the Washington Post.

Trump is preparing to tap David Rosner to be chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a decision that would put a Democrat at the head of an agency central to Trump’s agenda on pushing U.S. oil, gas, and coal, according to a White House official. Jennifer A. Dlouhy and Nuareen S. Malik report for Bloomberg Law.

Trump on Saturday said he was nominating Tammy Bruce, spokesperson for the State Department and longtime political commentator at Fox News, as the next deputy representative of the United States to the U.N. Ashley Ahn reports for the New York Times.

The Trump administration on Friday threatened to seize hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of patents from Harvard University, accusing the college of failing to comply with the law on federal research grants. Liam Knox and Hadriana Lowenkron report for Bloomberg Law.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

In a 2-1 decision Friday, a federal appeals court quashed Judge Boasberg’s effort to pursue criminal contempt proceedings for administration officials who he says defied his orders in March by deporting 130 Venezuelan men to an El Salvador prison. Referencing Trump-appointed Judges Gregory G. Katsas and Neomi Rao, Obama-appointed Judge Cornelia T.L. Pillard wrote in dissent, “The majority does an exemplary judge a grave disservice by overstepping its bounds to upend his efforts to vindicate the judicial authority that is our shared trust.” Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO; Mark Berman reports for the Washington Post.

A federal appeals court on Saturday unanimously rejected the Trump administration’s attempt to conceal a public database of federal spending, a resource that researchers say is key to holding the administration accountable to Congress’s control over the budget. Two of the three appeals judges said the effort was an affront to Congress’s authority over spending, with the court granting a Friday deadline for the administration to put the data back online. Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

The trial will begin today on whether the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles violated federal law. California is asking Judge Charles Breyer to order the Trump administration to restore control of the remaining Guard troops to the state and to stop the federal government’s deployment of military forces in California. Janie Har and Olga R. Rodriguez report for AP News.

The Democracy Forward Foundation filed a lawsuit on Friday, asking a federal judge to expedite its Freedom of Information Act requests, which seek records the Justice Department and FBI have produced on Epstein in recent months. The group is also requesting documents prepared for Attorney General Pam Bondi, including briefing materials she used ahead of a May meeting with Trump, during which Bondi reportedly told the president his name appeared in the Epstein files. Zach Schonfeld reports for The Hill.

Although the memo does not contain any revelations on its surface, when taken together with recent research on the use of AI in immigration systems and the White House’s recent announcement encouraging AI adoption across the government, the memo does serve as a starting point for what is sure to be a long and controversial debate over how AI might be weaponized against immigrants facing deportation—especially those seeking asylum.

In this post, I discuss the contents of the memo and connect it to recent research on the use of AI in immigration enforcement systems around the world. Special thanks to Dan Kowalski for bringing this memo to my attention.

I Believe in This Work

The Memo: “Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in EOIR Proceedings”

Acting EOIR Director Sirce Owen takes a surprisingly procedural and balanced approach in the memo titled ""Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in EOIR Proceedings""—at least compared to her more sensationalistic memos. The memo echoes Chief Justice John Roberts' observation that ""AI has great potential to dramatically increase access to key information for lawyers and non-lawyers alike.”

This development is consistent with my previous research on artificial intelligence versus authentic insight, which found considerable uncertainty and anxiety in the legal field about the role AI might play. The rush toward technological solutions often conflicts with the careful, nuanced thinking that complex legal problems require—especially in immigration cases where lives hang in the balance.

Owen establishes that the EOIR has ""neither a blanket prohibition on the use of generative AI in its proceedings nor a mandatory disclosure requirement regarding its use""—meaning there's no formal rule stopping anyone from using AI tools in immigration court filings or decisions. Instead, the memo points to existing guidance on professional ethics, thereby subsuming questions of generative AI under existing frameworks. This follows a fairly predictable teleology of how law and policy typically address new technologies: ignore (which they’ve done for a few years), subsume (use existing law to cover novel technology), then, hopefully, adapt (create new laws to handle new technology).

Mirroring concerns from most professors returning to the classroom for the fall, the EOIR memo spends considerable time warning about the risks of hallucinated legal citations and false information generated by AI tools—an entirely reasonable concern, in my view. It makes clear that attorneys who submit AI-generated content with fake case citations or erroneous information will face professional discipline, potentially including sanctions for ""knowingly or with reckless disregard offering false evidence."" The memo also admonishes that “EOIR adjudicators should also be vigilant to ensure that decisions are not based on hallucinated or inaccurate case citations and information and that attorneys are not submitting pleadings with false information or non-existent legal citations.”

All well and good. But we should not allow the otherwise perfunctory memo to lull us into complacency about how AI is already being leveraged in immigration systems around the world and will likely be increasingly incorporated into institutions here in the United States.

The memo cites the White House’s announcement in April that calls on all parts of government to accelerate the adoption of AI. That memo states: “Agencies are encouraged to harness solutions that bring the best value to taxpayers, increase quality of public services, and enhance government efficiency.” While I am not principally opposed to the government adopting AI or other technologies, we know what this language means when applied to immigration: use AI to reject, deny, and deport faster.

Thus, while the memo does appropriately encourage cautious adoption, we should be clear-eyed about the real implications of AI adoption on due process and substantive outcomes for immigrants facing deportation in court.

Foreshadowing Bigger Changes

As I said, while this memo appears procedural on its surface, it foreshadows significant policy changes down the line and possibly new systems of automated exclusion that we have seen elsewhere in the world.

I have written a lot about the use of smartphone apps like CBP One (and now CBP Home) and SmartLINK, which represent forms of digital capture of migrants’ smartphones. Others, like David Hausman, have written about ICE’s use of risk assessment algorithms to shape decisions about whether immigrants should be detained or released.

These developments reflect a broader trend documented by researchers and policy analysts. A recent report by the American Immigration Council revealed that DHS already operates 105 active AI use cases across major immigration agencies, with 27 classified as ""rights-impacting."" Legal analysis shows how AI is transforming immigration enforcement and creating new compliance challenges for immigration law practice.

The EOIR memo comes at a time when AI and automated systems are already being integrated into immigration systems across multiple countries. The United States is behind other countries in the adoption of AI. International research paints an even broader picture:

A landmark 2020 study by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto found extensive use of automated decision-making tools in Canada's refugee system, raising concerns about fairness and transparency.

A recent report from the Council of Europe calls for prohibiting AI tools like automated credibility assessments in asylum cases, while policy research warns that asylum seekers' interactions with AI will serve as a ""test case"" for emerging AI governance.

Studies of asylum systems have raised particular concerns about AI systems perpetuating bias and creating ""black-box"" decision-making processes that lack transparency and accountability.

A recent study by Iazzolino (2025) explores how AI-driven migrant screening systems create fundamental trade-offs between efficiency and human rights protections.

Taken together, these studies consistently highlight the tension between efficiency gains and fundamental rights protections that the EOIR memo signals could be coming to US immigration courts.

The Power Dynamics Problem

What we learn from this research—and what concerns me most—is what the memo doesn't say about how power relations within the legal field might shape AI adoption. While the memo doesn't suggest this explicitly, it's not hard to imagine scenarios where immigration judges and asylum adjudicators use AI tools to speed up case rejections—potentially avoiding consequences for irresponsible AI use—while immigration attorneys who use AI face harsher professional consequences or future prohibitions.

Immigration judges are already under enormous pressure to move cases quickly through a system with 3.5 million pending cases. The average judge handles hundreds of cases, often with minimal support staff. As I discussed recently, asylum cases are being denied at record rates and likely at record speeds, too. Adding AI tools that can quickly generate legal research or draft portions of decisions could dramatically accelerate and automate key parts of the adjudication process.

An Early Warning

AI in immigration courts isn't a question of if—it's a question of how and when. This memo represents an early attempt to establish professional norms before the technology becomes ubiquitous, but it also serves as an early warning that the immigration system we know today may look very different in the near future.

The challenge ahead is ensuring that any integration of AI tools serves the cause of equality and justice rather than simply the goal of efficiency. Given the life-or-death stakes of many immigration cases, getting this balance right isn't just a matter of professional best practices—it's also a matter of fundamental fairness. Immigration attorneys, advocates, and anyone who cares about due process should be paying close attention to how this unfolds.

They sought assurances about how those agencies would interact with federal immigration authorities, said Rep. Lorena Garcia and Sen. Julie Gonzales, Democrats who’ve sponsored legislation limiting immigration cooperation.","When federal immigration officers arrested Rigoberto Carranza-Mendez in Colorado last month, they trumpeted his detention and subsequent deportation to Mexico on social media — and used the opportunity to take a shot at the state’s capital city.

The convicted murderer had found nearly “perfect sanctuary” in Denver, Immigration and Customs Enforcement claimed, “until ICE officers found him.”

But Carranza-Mendez wasn’t arrested on the streets of Denver, and ICE officers didn’t exactly find him. On July 16, Carranza-Mendez was due to be released from a state prison. The week before that, state corrections officials had emailed ICE, informing the agency of his release date and setting up a custody transfer at a facility in Cañon City.

Carranza-Mendez was one of two men arrested by ICE last month directly from a state prison during a large-scale roundup in Colorado of immigrants without proper legal status. They are among 77 arrested that way this year, according to the state Department of Corrections, under a prior policy of notifying the agency of a certain offender’s imminent release.

But earlier this month, Colorado’s top prison official directed DOC staff members to stop proactively responding to detainer requests from immigration authorities. Under the department’s new policy, ICE must file public records requests to obtain information about inmates. The new directive was signed Aug. 1, shortly after The Denver Post asked about the two men’s arrests.

Carranza-Mendez and Nicolas Diaz-Hernandez were each arrested on their release dates more than three weeks ago. They were part of a broader ICE operation that, the agency said, was conducted in the Denver area and resulted in at least 243 arrests.

ICE had previously sent detainer forms — effectively a request to hold someone until ICE can arrest them — for both men.

The agency’s Denver-based spokesman, Steve Kotecki, did not return an email seeking comment.

The Department of Corrections’ new limitations on ICE cooperation come amid heightened scrutiny of state and local officials’ relationships with federal immigration authorities as President Donald Trump pushes for mass deportations.

A state employee sued Gov. Jared Polis in June over the state’s intent to comply with an ICE subpoena in violation of a state law limiting such collaboration. More recently, Attorney General Phil Weiser filed suit against a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy for tipping off ICE about a University of Utah student from Brazil who was driving through the state.

Among other limitations, Colorado law generally prohibits state and local officials from delaying a person’s release from jail or prison to comply with an ICE detainer.

State Corrections spokeswoman Alondra Gonzalez-Garcia said the men recently arrested by ICE did not have their release dates changed to accommodate the agency. An immigration lawyer told The Post that the department’s prior policy didn’t appear to violate state law.

New limit on information sharing

When The Post first asked about the department’s interactions with ICE last month, following ICE’s announcement of the large arrest operation, Gonzalez-Garcia said that the agency hadn’t shared any information with immigration authorities, who acted “independently.”

On Aug. 1, a week later, the department reversed course and said it had informed ICE about the men’s release dates and coordinated their transfers to ICE custody, under an agency policy.

That same day, Andre Stancil, the Department of Corrections’ executive director, issued a directive to all department staff, blocking employees from proactively sharing information with ICE unless its agents submit a public records request.

Gonzalez-Garcia declined The Post’s request to interview DOC leaders.

“The executive directive from Executive Director Stancil clarifies and standardizes how DOC responds to ICE requests,” she said in an email. “This directive ensures that ICE may obtain information regarding releases by submitting open records requests, to which appropriate responses are promptly provided.”

The department’s earlier policy of notifying ICE in response to a detainer doesn’t appear to have violated state law, said Violeta Chapin, an immigration lawyer and University of Colorado Law School professor.

But immigration activists accused the agency of sidestepping those restrictions. The Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition accused the department of “creating an active deportation pipeline.”

“These are not isolated incidents but part of a troubling pattern of state and local officials bypassing Colorado’s laws,” Karen Orona, a spokeswoman for the coalition, said in a statement.

In response to the state employee’s June lawsuit against the governor, a Denver judge told Polis that complying with one ICE subpoena would violate state law. Polis’ administration also acknowledged last month that it had complied with four other ICE subpoenas this year — including one that a spokeswoman said it shouldn’t have, prompting changes to state processes.

The incidents have had ripple effects. After Weiser went after the deputy for his actions before the Utah student’s arrest, Mesa County’s commissioners last week signaled their intent to counter-sue Weiser.

Weiser’s office is now investigating other agencies that were participants in a shared group chat with the sheriff’s deputy and federal immigration agents. His office declined to identify the other agencies, other than to point The Post to legal filings that list the Colorado State Patrol, the Vail Police Department and the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office as other participants in the chat.

Sgt. Ivan Alvarado, a State Patrol spokesman, said in a statement that the agency reevaluated its presence in the group chat after the student’s arrest and stopped sharing information in the thread on June 18. He said the patrol respects Weiser’s “ongoing administrative review.”

Vail Police Chief Ryan Kenney wrote in an email to The Post that he couldn’t comment on the AG’s investigation. But he said he was confident that, at the investigation’s conclusion, “no wrongdoing will be found on the part of any Vail police officers.” Ashley LaFleur, an Eagle County spokeswoman, said Weiser’s review was a “matter of administrative due diligence” and that, like Kenney, the county’s officials were confident that its personnel would be cleared of any wrongdoing.

Pressure to protect ‘from federal overreach’

As for Polis, 19 of the state Senate’s 23 Democrats — including Senate President James Coleman and the caucus’ leadership — sent the governor a letter last month about ICE cooperation.

The lawmakers asked Polis to “provide clarity to our state and our constituents about how you will protect them from federal overreach,” like the “fishing expedition” subpoena that Polis had sought to comply with until directed otherwise by a judge.

Polis’ office, which is still contesting the lawsuit, had not responded to the letter as of Friday afternoon. In a statement to The Post, Polis spokeswoman Shelby Wieman said the governor “agrees that Coloradans’ personal information should be protected from unwarranted violations by the federal government,” but he supports “apprehending criminals regardless of immigration status.”

“He is open to further dialogue with the General Assembly on what he views as the shared objectives of keeping communities safe and not supporting the targeting of innocent law-abiding individuals, separating families, or diverting local and state law enforcement from fighting crime to instead pursue federal priorities,” Wieman wrote.

The subpoena at the center of the lawsuit was sent to the state in April as part of what Polis’ office claimed was a criminal investigation, which would’ve qualified for information-sharing with ICE under state law. But Denver Judge A. Bruce Jones said the subpoena wasn’t part of a criminal matter and that Polis’ office had done little to confirm that such an investigation existed.

As part of the fallout from that suit, legislators sent letters to Weiser, Secretary of State Jena Griswold, Treasurer Dave Young and the State Board of Education. They sought assurances about how those agencies would interact with federal immigration authorities, said Rep. Lorena Garcia and Sen. Julie Gonzales, Democrats who’ve sponsored legislation limiting immigration cooperation.

In its response, Weiser’s office wrote that it would take steps to ensure that any subpoena purporting to be part of a criminal investigation was actually part of such an inquiry — “as opposed to a veiled or mis-labeled enforcement action for which the true purpose is immigration enforcement.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tdp-z-opcolumn-01_b7a2e1.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-08-11 10:57:09.755068

By summer, Congress delivered.

The Republican Party’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law July 4 included what’s arguably the biggest boost of funds yet to the Department of Homeland Security — nearly $170 billion, almost double its annual budget.

The staggering sum is powering the nation’s sweeping new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, delivering gripping scenes of people being pulled off city streets and from job sites across the nation — the cornerstone of Trump’s promise for the largest domestic deportation operation in American history. Homeland Security confirmed over the weekend ICE is working to set up detention sites at certain military bases.

“We’re getting them out at record numbers,” Trump said at the White House bill signing ceremony. “We have an obligation to, and we’re doing it.”

Money flows, and so do questions

The crush of new money is setting off alarms in Congress and beyond, raising questions from lawmakers in both major political parties who are expected to provide oversight. The bill text provided general funding categories — almost $30 billion for ICE officers, $45 billion for detention facilities, $10 billion for the office of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — but few policy details or directives. Homeland Security recently announced $50,000 ICE hiring bonuses.

And it’s not just the big bill’s fresh infusion of funds fueling the president’s agenda of 1 million deportations a year.

In the months since Trump took office, his administration has been shifting as much as $1 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other accounts to pay for immigration enforcement and deportation operations, lawmakers said.

“Your agency is out of control,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Noem during a Senate committee hearing in the spring.

The senator warned that Homeland Security would “go broke” by July.

Noem quickly responded that she always lives within her budget.

But Murphy said later in a letter to Homeland Security, objecting to its repurposing funds, that ICE was being directed to spend at an “indefensible and unsustainable rate to build a mass deportation army,” often without approval from Congress.

This past week, the new Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York, along with a subcommittee chairman, Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi, requested a briefing from Noem on the border security components of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which included $46 billion over the next four years for Trump’s long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.

“We write today to understand how the Department plans to outlay this funding to deliver a strong and secure homeland for years to come,” the GOP lawmakers said in a letter to the homeland security secretary, noting border apprehensions are at record lows.

“We respectfully request that you provide Committee staff with a briefing on the Department’s plan to disburse OBBBA funding,” they wrote, seeking a response by Aug. 22.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Associated Press the department is in daily discussions with the committee “to honor all briefing requests including the spend plan for the funds allocated” through the new law.

“ICE is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace capacity,” she said. “This process does include housing detainees at certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.”

Deportations move deep into communities

All together, it’s what observers on and off Capitol Hill see as a fundamental shift in immigration policy — enabling DHS to reach far beyond the U.S. southern border and deep into communities to conduct raids and stand up detention facilities as holding camps for immigrants.

The Defense Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies are being enlisted in what Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, calls a “whole of government” approach.

“They’re orienting this huge shift,” Bush-Joseph said, as deportation enforcement moves “inward.”

The flood of cash comes when Americans’ views on immigration are shifting. Polling showed 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is a “good thing” for the country, having jumped substantially from 64% a year ago, according to Gallup. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults say immigration is a bad thing right now.

At the same time, Trump’s approval rating on immigration has slipped. According to a July AP-NORC poll, 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from 49% in March.

Americans are watching images of often masked officers arresting college students, people at Home Depot lots, parents, workers and a Tunisian musician. Stories abound of people being whisked off to detention facilities, often without allegations of wrongdoing beyond being unauthorized to remain in the U.S.

A new era of detention centers

Detention centers are being stood up, from “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida to the repurposed federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and the proposed new “Speedway Slammer” in Indiana. Flights are ferrying migrants not just home or to El Salvador’s notorious mega-prison but far away to Africa and beyond.

Homan has insisted in recent interviews those being detained and deported are the “worst of the worst,” and he dismissed as “garbage” the reports showing many of those being removed have not committed violations beyond their irregular immigration status.

“There’s no safe haven here,” Homan said recently outside the White House. “We’re going to do exactly what President Trump has promised the American people he’d do.”

Back in February, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Budget Committee, emerged from their private meeting saying Trump administration officials were “begging for money.”

As Graham got to work, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a leading deficit hawk, proposed an alternative border package, at $39 billion, a fraction of the size.

But Paul’s proposal was quickly dismissed. He was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who joined all Democrats in voting against the final tax and spending cuts bill.

JBS said in a statement it was replacing the workers and hadn’t lost production capacity.

Iowa union leaders said some of the immigrants losing their jobs had been designated essential workers during Trump’s first term.

Meatpacking giant JBS' July firing of 200 workers in Ottumwa because the Trump administration was revoking their work visas could be just the start of a wave of job losses, with thousands more workers across the state and nation also caught in the crackdown on immigrants, experts say.

Dramatic roundups of undocumented immigrants at meat plants, like one that U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement staged in Omaha in June, have been isolated so far.

But the Meat Institute, the industry’s lobbying group, estimates that 20% of the nation’s meat processing workforce — about 102,000 of 510,000 workers — have lost or will lose their jobs as President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security moves to shut down programs like the humanitarian parole under which the Ottumwa workers were employed. The parole program for immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela began in early 2023 during the Biden administration and allowed them to receive the work visas.

In Iowa, one of the largest U.S. meat suppliers, the program's end could mean the dismissal of as many as 7,000 of the state’s estimated 35,000 workers who each year slaughter and process millions of pigs, cattle, turkeys and other livestock.

Dermot Hayes, an Iowa State University agricultural economist, said the loss of foreign workers could push meat prices higher for consumers and revenues lower for livestock producers.

“It’s hard to lose 200 people on a production line and not have it impact productivity. These people are well trained,"" Hayes said, adding that packing plants ""can’t go to McDonalds to get more"" workers.

Meatpackers so far are downpedaling the effects. JBS said in a statement it was replacing the workers and hadn’t lost production capacity. The Meat Institute, asked if the lost labor was impacting production, said ""that portion of the workforce has been phased out of the system.""

Smithfield Foods, another large meatpacker with facilities in Denison, Mason City and Carroll, acknowledged it’s also cutting immigrant workers who’ve lost their legal work status, calling it ""a relatively small number.” The company expects “no impact to our operations,” Ray Atkinson, a Smithfield spokesman, said in an email.

Tyson Foods and Cargill Inc., all with large Iowa processing operations, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Seaboard Triumph Foods, another large meatpacker, declined to comment.

The federal government began canceling immigration programs in March, but, amid legal challenges, it was June before it started notifying many workers. The Meat Institute said many employers began notifying and replacing workers earlier, not waiting for resolution of the legal challenges.

Trump's administration has blamed former President Joe Biden for the ""disastrous"" parole program that allowed the immigrants into the country, saying they were ""poorly vetted"" and created chaos and committed crimes.

Union and advocacy groups say the immigrants are hard workers, who support their families and contribute to their communities and local economies.

In addition to the humanitarian parole, legal experts say, immigrants in meatpacking, construction and other industries are working in the U.S. through a number of other programs including temporary protected status, which U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has moved to end. Some have lived and worked in the U.S. for decades.

""Immigrants who had legal status in the country are now being pushed into an undocumented status and potentially targeted by ICE and deportation,"" said Elena Castillas-Hoffman, an Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice spokesperson.

Iowa union leaders said some of the immigrants losing their jobs had been designated essential workers during Trump’s first term, when he invoked the emergency powers of the Defense Production Act to force meatpacking plants to remain open during the early days of COVID-19 pandemic.

Most workers ""proudly and voluntarily went in there to keep the food supply going. They were on the front line during an uncertain time,” said Brian Ulin, vice president of United Food & Commercial Workers Local 230, which represents JBS workers in Ottumwa.

“They were considered heroes,” said Mike Sunken, a UFCW collective bargaining representative in Fort Dodge.

Now, he said, Trump “wants to get rid of them. That’s the part that doesn’t make sense to me.”

'It’s not just a production issue. It’s a community issue'

Ottumwa is struggling with the impact of the worker losses and potential deportation, said Paulina Ocegueda, a member of the city’s chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens. Many of the workers and their families are trying to decide their next step.

“We have to remember these people came to the United States the right way,” Ocegueda said. “They’re working and providing for themselves and their families. And they’re paying taxes and contributing to society.”

Homeland Security is urging immigrants to self-deport, offering them $1,000 apiece to be paid when they arrive in their home countries. But Ocegueda said many will again face the problems that they sought to escape when fleeing to the U.S., including violence, poverty and political turmoil.

Sonia Parras, a Des Moines immigration attorney, said some people find themselves stripped of jobs overnight, with little money to pay rent or purchase groceries and gas, let alone buy tickets for flights to their home countries.

Many are at risk of imminent removal, she said, adding that they may be forced to leave spouses and children who are U.S. citizens. ""That's inhumane,"" she said.

Trump has trumpeted the immigration crackdown, saying his administration is going after the “worst of the worst” — gang members, rapists, human traffickers and other criminals. ""Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, ICE is taking the worst of the worst off the streets and making America safe again,"" a Homeland Security spokeswoman said in a statement Aug. 1, announcing the agency's most recent arrests.

But 71% of those, though facing charges, haven't been convicted of crimes, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data through July.

Farm groups have been concerned about how the immigration crackdown would impact ag operations. Of the 2.6 million people working on U.S. farms, about 42% lack legal status, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture and other estimates.

The administration has sent conflicting messages. In a July 3 trip to Iowa, Trump said he and Noem were going to ""put the farmers in charge"" when it comes to agricultural workers who are in the country illegally. ""If a farmer’s willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristi, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?"" he said.

""You know, we’re going to be good with it. Because we don’t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. We want the farms to do great like they’re doing right now,"" Trump said.

But at a July 8 news conference, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said ""no amnesty"" would be given to migrants working in agriculture. ""The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way,"" Rollins said when asked about farm labor.

U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement July 30 that the rescinded programs were meant to be temporary.

""I understand the impact the department's decision can have on the local community and farm economy,"" Grassley said, adding that Trump ""wants farmers to succeed and Congress is working with the administration to provide farmers with as much certainty as possible.""

Union leaders: Meatpackers may have to increase wages to find new workers

UFCW’s Ulin and Sunken said JBS workers are stressed as they train new employees while trying to maintain production. “There’s massive hiring going on now,” Ulin said.

“But it’s not just a production issue. It’s a community issue,” said Sunken, noting that one company he represents in northwest Iowa has lost nearly 10% of its workforce due to the administration's immigration actions.

Ulin said workers came to Ottumwa and other Iowa communities with spouses, children, parents and other extended family. The impact is multiplied as families decide to leave.

“It’s going to put a strain on businesses that are losing customers,” Ulin said, adding that schools will lose students, and churches and other community groups will lose members.

“It’s sad,” he said. “We’re all trying to make a better life and support our families. And none of us expect to have the rug pulled out from under us.”

While he doesn’t anticipate the disruption will be as severe, Hayes, the ISU economics professor, points to the price shock U.S. consumers experienced when meatpacking plant workers became ill — and dozens died — during the global COVID-19 pandemic, forcing temporary plant closures.

The U.S. lost about 30% of its slaughter capacity during the pandemic, leaving producers in Iowa and elsewhere to destroy hogs and other livestock as processing lines backed up.

Azzeddine Azzam, a University of Nebraska-Lincoln agricultural economist, said a tighter labor market may force meatpackers to pay higher wages to attract U.S.-born workers.

""Plants may need to make it more attractive for people who have not traditionally been willing to work for you,"" he said.

But Azzam pointed out that increased processing costs also could lower prices for producers and push consumer costs higher. The threat of higher consumer prices comes as Americans have struggled with inflation. Food prices climbed about 24% from 2020 to 2024, U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows.

Price spikes continue, with consumers paying record-high prices for beef in June, given supply constraints and strong demand.

Experts say JBS, Smithfield and other meatpackers are following the law in firing immigrant workers and could face fines if they retained them. The Meat Institute in June urged the Trump administration to include meatpackers in a discussion of changes that will create a ""stable and legal agriculture workforce.""

Casillas-Hoffman said Iowa's economy depends on finding a solution.

""The reality is that Iowa needs immigrant workers,"" she said, adding, ""We know our communities depend on the vitality of immigrants and refugees.""","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/04/PDEM/84467069007-trump-in-iowa-cs-028.jpg?crop=2910,1637,x0,y0&width=2910&height=1637&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-11 08:57:26.967040

At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency.
Missing Persons EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later.
In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.
Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.","On a recent morning in Lower Manhattan, immigration Judge John Siemietkowski spoke to three people in his courtroom while masked federal officers waited just outside.

“I’m sure you can see with your own eyes what’s going on in our courthouse,” Siemietkowski said.

“You may see someone you know get arrested. You yourself may get arrested,” he warned. “That’s a heavy topic, isn’t it? A lot like the weather today. It’s heavy, and it weighs on us.”

Siemietkowski scheduled the three for court dates in 2026 and dismissed them. As they left the courtroom, two of them, a married couple from Panama, walked by the officers unimpeded. But when the third man, from the Dominican Republic, passed the officers, he was grabbed by the shoulders in plain view of Siemietkowski’s dais and escorted down a stairwell.

Such scenes have played out over and over again in the more than two months since officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement agencies began lurking in the fluorescent-lit corridors of the three Manhattan courthouses where immigrants in deportation proceedings plead their cases.

Half of all immigration court arrests nationwide were in New York City in late May and early June, according to a new analysis of federal immigration court and ICE data by THE CITY and Joseph Gunther, a Brooklyn mathematician who first identified a method to track courthouse arrests.

ICE officers elsewhere have been detaining thousands of people at workplaces, Home Depot parking lots and even sending militarized cavalry units through big city parks. But enforcement in New York City has been focused inside of the very buildings where people show up at civil immigration hearings to petition for the right to legally remain in the United States. It’s an approach that the agency had taken pains to avoid before Trump’s second term because of the deterrent effect it has on noncitizens with immigration court hearings.

That changed dramatically in New York City this late spring. Between May 26 and June 8, court and ICE records show, federal officers arrested 134 people in Lower Manhattan immigration courthouse buildings, accounting for nearly a third of all immigration arrests in New York City in that period.

Overall, immigration courthouse arrests have been nearly 14 times as common in New York City than the country as a whole. They made up 7% of all ICE arrests in the city since President Donal Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 through June, compared to 0.5% nationally over the same period of time.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to THE CITY’s request for comment on the analysis, which cross-references Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) court data with ICE arrest records to identify cases that show a court hearing on the same date as an arrest.

At the same time that courthouse arrests began ramping up, ICE also ratcheted up arrests at mandatory check-ins with the agency. Those arrests took place at offices like the one across the street from 26 Federal Plaza, where THE CITY witnessed 31 arrests over two days, as well as another office inside 26 Federal Plaza itself, where people line up each morning. Some never get to leave of their own accord.

As a result of the courthouse arrests ICE has emphasized in New York City, a large number of arrests here are happening behind closed doors — sparing Mayor Eric Adams the spectacle of roundups on city streets seen elsewhere in the country and the potential for clashes with New Yorkers.

In Los Angeles, immigration arrests in highly visible public settings triggered sustained mass protests, leading President Trump to deploy the National Guard and then the Marines to assist ICE agents in June. Mayor Karen Bass described Los Angeles as “a city under siege, under armed occupation.”

While smaller protests have been common, no such dramatic standoffs have occurred yet in New York City, where Adams has pledged to work with the Trump administration on matters that don’t involve civil immigration enforcement, taking a less adversarial approach to ICE than mayors in other Democratic strongholds.

In April, the Trump Justice Department dropped the criminal corruption case against Adams. Less than a day later, Adams, who was elected in 2021 as a Democrat, announced a longshot independent bid for a second term.

Missing Persons

EOIR data shows the surge in courthouse arrests kicked off nationally on May 19 and ramped up in New York City several days later. A former employee at the New York immigration court said that everyone — including Department of Homeland Security attorneys who serve as prosecutors inside the immigration court system — seemed surprised on the day in May when they first saw ICE agents in the hallways.

“We had no notice this was happening, I don’t think the prosecutors had much notice either,” the former employee recalled, saying the DHS prosecutors had been ordered to come to the building in person instead of appearing virtually as they typically did.

ICE agents had been in or near the courthouse before then — for example, if an immigrant had a serious criminal conviction that made them subject to rules requiring detention while a case proceeded. But that was exceedingly rare, the former EOIR employee said.

“Even that hadn’t happened in years,” the person said. “It’s never been anything like this.”

In New York City, 110 people were arrested on the same day as their immigration court hearing through June under the Trump administration, court data shows, accounting for 24% of the 453 such arrests nationwide.

But ICE likely arrested even more people here in connection with court appearances.

The agency’s own arrest data, when cross-referenced with court data, suggests at least another 71 people in New York City were detained on the same day as their hearing. That brings the number of total immigration court arrests in the city this year to 181 — a dramatic escalation from 11 arrests all of last year, including just three over the same time period.

Taken together, the analysis found 31% of all ICE arrests in the city took place in immigration courts in the two weeks between May 26 and June 8, when courthouse arrests spiked across the country.

Other cities trailed far behind: San Diego was a distant second with 37 arrests, followed by 32 in Annandale, Va., and 29 in Newark, N. J., according to court data.

In Los Angeles, where ICE arrests have also surged, EOIR records show only six arrests within its three immigration courts.

New York City’s courthouse arrests have exclusively targeted adults, and mostly men, records show, with the youngest confirmed arrest that of a 19-year-old Venezuelan teen, and the oldest a 63-year-old from Ecuador.

Just three of the people arrested were represented by a lawyer. Many judges allow people with attorneys to appear virtually, leaving many without representation to face a gauntlet of masked ICE agents awaiting their arrival alone.

Even past the 181 arrests THE CITY identified in government records, our reporting found several additional arrests were not reflected in court records — highlighting that these preliminary tallies are undoubtedly an undercount.

The arrest of 20-year-old high schooler Joselyn Chipantiza-Sisalema, who was taken from a court hearing in late June, for example, is not reflected in the current court data.

The court data also omits the detention of a 19-year-old man from Guinea who ICE records indicate was arrested on the same day as his court hearing at 26 Federal Plaza. He has since been transferred to a detention center in Jonesboro, Louisiana, where he was held for 26 days before being transferred to another detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey.

Black Box

The scene at the immigration courthouse on the 12th floor of 26 Federal Plaza on a recent morning showed the ICE arrest apparatus now well entrenched.

Judge James Loprest was out for the day, but many people with pending cases had dutifully shown up anyway. They took turns speaking to the clerk, who handed them notices to appear at a later date. But as they tried to leave, masked agents confronted them at the doorway asking for identification.

Agents whisked a 19-year-old girl into a stairwell for questioning before releasing her several minutes later.

A woman who looked to be in her thirties, wearing gold high heels and a sparkly green jumpsuit, was not so lucky. The woman’s hands trembled as the agents towered over her. “But I haven’t done anything,” she said incredulously in Spanish, weeping softly and asking a volunteer stationed nearby to call her husband, who was waiting for her outside.

“It’s not a question,” an agent said in Spanish with a thick American accent. “We said you’re leaving with us.”

Moments later, the men surrounded the woman and rushed her to a back stairwell and out of sight. She — like the many others apprehended inside immigration courthouses at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway and on Varick Street — was detained for processing in the ICE office on the 10th floor of 26 Federal Plaza. As the number of arrests has soared in recent weeks, ICE has struggled to move people into actual detention centers, leaving some for days in cramped holding rooms with no beds and limited food.

On Friday, the ACLU sued the Trump Administration over conditions there. People haven’t been able to speak privately with lawyers, the lawsuit alleged, and are only given limited food and left to sleep for days on concrete floors in unsanitary conditions. DHS has flatly denied any mistreatment while repeatedly denying members of Congress access to the site, keeping it entirely out of public view until THE CITY first published videos of it in July.

City Comptroller Brad Lander — who was arrested at 26 Federal Plaza in June while accompanying immigrants to their court appearances — was reluctant during his most recent visit on Thursday to speculate about why enforcement had taken such a different shape in New York.

“It’s one of the big questions,” Lander said, pointing to the public scenes of intimidation in Los Angeles.

Lander has called on Adams to enforce potential building and fire code violations on ICE’s detention floor, though Adams said he has no jurisdiction over the federal building.

“It’s certainly possible that there’s some implicit deal between the Trump administration and Eric Adams, which is why these arrests are being concentrated here versus other places around the country,” Lander said when pressed about why enforcement here had been so different.

“If the mayor wants to demonstrate that there isn’t, there’s a lot of ways for him to show he’s objecting to what’s going on here that he’s failed to do.”

Asked about Lander’s comments, Kayla Mamelak, a spokesperson for Adams, said that “I can’t tell you why they’re doing this at 26 Federal Plaza.”

She said the mayor has been clear he’s open to working with the Trump administration on criminal matters but draws the line on civil immigration enforcement. She also noted New York City had not seen immigration raids in sensitive locations like churches and schools — something Adams had urged Homan against during their meetings.

“Not having an adversarial-at-all-times relationship can sometimes be beneficial,” said Mamelak.

The Trump administration sued the mayor and City Council in late July, demanding an end to sanctuary city laws that prohibit local government cooperation with civil immigration enforcement. The Adams administration is suing in return, including three lawsuits on behalf of students arrested at immigration court appearances.

“What’s going on at 26 Fed, the mayor opposes, and he’s taken action on that,” Mamelak said.

Adams, however, has largely avoided answering questions or speaking on camera about those conditions. He’srepeatedly stressed that the city isn’t responsible for what happens inside of the ICE offices, now including a jail, inside its real estate in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, ICE immigration court arrests continue day after day for people who continue to show up at their court appearances.

‘Guiding Star’?

Courthouse arrests have mostly targeted people who entered the country less than two years ago, THE CITY’s analysis shows, confirming what the Trump administration has said is a new focus on attempting to funnel people into “expedited removal” proceedings that can circumvent immigration courts, which are facing historic backlogs and take years to resolve a person’s deportation case.

But while DHS prosecutors regularly asked judges to dismiss a person’s deportation case ahead of their arrest, judges rarely approved those requests.

Government prosecutors had requested that judges dismiss the removal proceedings in 100 of the 181 instances where people were arrested on the day of their court hearing, THE CITY’s analysis shows. But judges denied 69 of those requests and left 23 of them undecided.

That means only eight dismissals were approved — and that the other 173 people were arrested while their cases were still ongoing, forcing them to fight their asylum claims from behind bars in most cases.

“We very quickly saw on the ground that the procedural posture didn’t actually matter,” said Allison Cutler, supervising attorney at the New York Legal Assistance Group. She is one of a handful of attorneys keeping watch on the courthouse arrests, and attempts to advise people without lawyers of their rights as they’re rushed away.

Over the past two months, Cutler has become friendly with court staff, security guards, judges, and even the federal agents, who’ve all had their status quo upended by the arrests.

Many agents, she pointed out, have been drafted from other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to conduct courthouse arrests on behalf of ICE.

“I’ve had multiple officers tell me that they’re gonna quit,” Cutler said, adding they’ve told her they’ve had to forgo working on prior investigations to arrest people inside courtrooms. “They have asked their supervisors if they can continue to work on their investigations, and they’re being told no, and that they have to go to court and do this.”

Meanwhile, immigration judges and court staff in New York are grappling with a grim new normal, with each of them struggling to work out the rules for their courtrooms.

A former New York immigration judge, who called fairness “the guiding star” of the system, called the shift in tactics deeply troubling and unprecedented.

“Now you’re a tool in someone’s tool box so that a person can be detained,” the judge said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.thecity.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080725_ice_arrests-3.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 07:56:29.780228

Excluding immigrants in the U.S. illegally could also be tricky.
Projections of how a census that doesn’t count immigrants in the U.S. illegally would affect the political landscape have produced varying results.","In a week when highly partisan redistricting dominated the news, President Donald Trump took a step further Aug. 7 when he said he had ordered the Commerce Department to start working on a new census.

“I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” he wrote Aug. 7 on Truth Social. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

It wasn’t clear from Trump’s social media post when he wants the next census to be held. Under current law, the next census is set for 2030.

A new census would be a sharp break with decades of precedent. Excluding immigrants in the country illegally will need to be tested in the courts, and other issues, including the timing of the census, would require consent from Congress, experts said.

A census with the changes Trump seeks likely would have a far-reaching impact on politics, especially amid Trump’s push to have Republican-led states undertake unusual mid-decade redistricting efforts to maximize congressional GOP seats. It would also affect the distribution of federal dollars to states, communities and residents.

The White House referred PolitiFact to the Commerce Department, which provided a statement: “The Census Bureau will immediately adopt modern technology tools for use in the census to better understand our robust census data. We will accurately analyze the data to reflect the number of legal residents in the United States.”

Can Trump change the timing of the census?

Trump’s words could be read to mean he’s seeking a census more quickly than 2030. Determining whether this would be legal would come down to Article 1 of the Constitution.

Article 1, which establishes the legislative branch, says that to determine the number of seats per state in the U.S. House of Representatives, a census “shall be made … within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they (Congress) shall by Law direct.”

Under current federal law, Congress has used this power to direct the commerce secretary to undertake and publish a census every decade, in years ending in zero.

Undertaking a census more frequently than every 10 years might pass constitutional muster, because Article 1 uses the word “within” in relation to the 10-year period, said Frank O. Bowman III, a University of Missouri emeritus law professor. However, doing so would run afoul of the existing law that sets the once-a-decade timetable.

To conduct a census sooner than 2030, Congress would have to pass a law allowing an accelerated schedule.

Can Trump order that immigrants in the U.S. illegally be excluded from the census count?

During his first term, Trump sought to add a citizenship question to the Census. This question hadn’t been included since 1950.

At that time, the Trump administration argued that the president has “virtually unfettered discretion” on what data is included in the census. It said immigrants in the U.S. illegally would not have been considered inhabitants by the framers.

In lawsuits challenging this effort, a different part of the Constitution played a key role. The 14th Amendment says, “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.”

This amendment’s language — “the whole number of persons in each state” — is the linchpin of legal efforts to fight efforts like Trump’s. This wording means “it would be unconstitutional to exclude undocumented migrants,” said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Opponents of Trump’s efforts say many people are counted in the census who cannot vote, including children, lawful noncitizens, incarcerated people and people convicted of felonies.

Lower courts rejected Trump’s first-term arguments, and the Supreme Court in 2020 decided on procedural grounds not to weigh in on the case’s merits, letting the lower court ruling stand.

With the current Supreme Court’s conservative majority often siding with Trump, the lack of a ruling on the substance gives the justices some room to rule that Trump’s vision of a citizen-only census conforms to the Constitution.

“The current Supreme Court has a record of ignoring or reversing precedent, staying lower court decisions, and setting aside lower court decisions,” said Steven Smith, an Arizona State University political scientist. “All bets are off.”

Beyond the law, what are some of the practical challenges Trump would face?

Conducting a census isn’t something that can be planned or done quickly. It involves collecting data on more than 340 million people and hiring and training thousands of new workers.

The Census Bureau has started preparing for the 2030 count, including the recruitment of workers for an upcoming, large-scale field test in 2026.

Current law also requires that Congress be notified of the census questions two years before it’s undertaken. But Trump could urge the Republican majorities in Congress to change that law.

Any action to make census changes would almost certainly be challenged in court, adding further delays.

Experts said the likelihood of a new, national census being completed from a standing start today in time for the next elections in 2026 is all but impossible, experts said. In addition to having to conduct an entire census in record time, states would need time to approve new district lines, establish candidate filing dates and hold primaries by the November 2026 midterms.

Another potential obstacle for Trump would emerge if he demands that states draw new congressional lines using a mid-decade census. “The president has no authority to order a state to redistrict mid-decade,” Smith said. Congress could, however, change that.

Excluding immigrants in the U.S. illegally could also be tricky. On a technical level, it would require writing and testing a citizenship question. And some critics worry what such a question would mean for the census data’s overall reliability. Critics say response rates will decrease, especially amid fears that answering the census amid the administration’s mass deportation efforts could get someone mistakenly deported.

How could changing who’s counted affect the partisan balance of power?

Projections of how a census that doesn’t count immigrants in the U.S. illegally would affect the political landscape have produced varying results. But what Trump proposes might not necessarily bolster the Republican Party, analyses show.

A 2020 Pew Research Center study found that blue California and red Texas and Florida would have had one seat less, while red Alabama and Ohio and blue Minnesota would each have had one seat more.

A 2024 report by the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels, found that California and New York gained eight and three seats, respectively, from including immigrants — legal and illegal — in the 2020 census. Florida gained two additional seats. Texas and Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island gained one each.

A 2024 report by the libertarian Cato Institute concluded that 95% of noncitizen population growth has gone to red states since 2019.

A January study by University of Minnesota researcher Rob Warren and Robert E. Warren, a former demographer for the U.S. Census who’s now a senior visiting fellow at the Center for Migration Studies of New York, found that including immigrants in the U.S. illegally in census data has had “minimal” impact on party representation in the House. Excluding illegal immigrants from the 2020 Census would have meant that California and Texas would have each lost one seat and Ohio and New York would have gained a seat each, they found.

“The evidence is that both red and blue places would be harmed,” said Beth Jarosz, senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau, a think tank.",https://www.poynter.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25219423967640.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 08:57:32.557938

And he has claimed that the vaccine court punishes and intimidates expert witnesses and petitioners’ attorneys.

Mr. Kennedy has said, falsely, that the vaccine court is the “exclusive remedy” for families seeking compensation.
“These are incredibly difficult cases.” She believes her clients are better off in the vaccine court.","For nearly 40 years, a special federal court system has compensated Americans who prove they were harmed by vaccines while also protecting the manufacturers from litigation.

Even the staunchest defenders of the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program agree it needs reform. It is slow, understaffed and can feel adversarial to families legitimately in need.

Now Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the program, saying he will make it more efficient and speedier for Americans seeking payment.

He said in a social media post last month that the vaccine court had “devolved into a morass of inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.” Parents who believe their children were injured by vaccines are “facing the monumental power and bottomless pockets of the U.S. government,” he said.

Mr. Kennedy has also claimed, falsely, that the compensation program prevents families from suing vaccine makers in traditional courts. And he has claimed that the vaccine court punishes and intimidates expert witnesses and petitioners’ attorneys.

Experts fear that some of the changes Mr. Kennedy has hinted at could lead to an onslaught of lawsuits, jeopardizing the manufacture of vaccines and undermining their use.

“Kennedy can fix this system without burning it down,” said Tony Yang, a health policy expert at George Washington University. But Mr. Kennedy sounds “more like a frustrated lawyer who lost cases than an eager secretary trying to fix things.”

Indeed, allies of the secretary have fared poorly in the vaccine court. Their litigation in traditional courts — including a 2022 lawsuit in which Mr. Kennedy delivered closing arguments — also has fallen short.

The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Public health officials in the United States have been tracking vaccine safety for decades and have long said that shots routinely given to children are safe. But all vaccines have at least occasional side effects, and there are rare instances of serious injury.

The program covers most routine immunizations given to children and pregnant women, and is funded by a small tax on each shot. The vaccine court has paid $5.4 billion in claims since its inception, awarding compensation in about 42 percent of the roughly 28,000 claims filed.

But in accordance with a great body of scientific evidence, the court’s special masters have denied thousands of claims that childhood vaccines are linked to autism. Mr. Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, believes that there is such a link and has long accused government officials of hiding the risks.

Some reforms widely seen as necessary would require Congress to intervene. Among them: more of the special masters who preside as judges over cases.

The legislation establishing the program allowed for three; five more were added later. But at least double that number are needed to adjudicate the roughly 1,200 applications each year, according to some experts.

The program also needs more staff to review medical records, and an online system for families to track the status of their claims. The compensation fund has a $4 billion surplus, some of which could be applied to remedy these problems.

Mr. Kennedy said in an interview last month that he wanted to ensure families seeking compensation “get it very quickly, and they get it without the kind of adversarial impediments that have now been erected over the past 40 years.”

A new fast-track system for rare injuries that studies have definitively linked to certain vaccines could speed up the process. In the current system, government lawyers sometimes fight families over settled links, said Altom Maglio, an attorney who has represented people in the vaccine court for 25 years.

“Fighting tooth and nail is just not appropriate, and doesn’t meet the goals,” he said.

At the same time, special masters sometimes make awards even when the connection between a side effect and vaccine is tenuous, said Dr. Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

“There are a lot of things that are being compensated where there’s inadequate evidence,” Dr. Salmon said. “We need more science.”

Mr. Kennedy has also suggested that injury claims regarding Covid-19 shots should be moved to the vaccine court. At present, those claims are piling up in a parallel federal system called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program.

Of more than 14,000 injury claims filed regarding Covid vaccines, only 69 have been paid out. More than 9,400 are pending, and about 4,800 have been dismissed.

Congress would need to act to move those claims to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. But adding the large Covid backlog to the vaccine court’s own poses huge challenges, Dr. Yang said: “You’re complaining about your kitchen sink, it’s clogged, and then you try to wash your bike in it.”

There are some aspects of the program that Mr. Kennedy can change without Congress. That includes altering the official table detailing the injuries presumed to be linked to certain vaccines.

Changing the table to say that certain vaccines cause autism or asthma, months or years after shots, for example, could hobble the system, opening the doors to tens of thousands of new claims that would previously have been dismissed.

“He’s talking about opening a can of worms that could result in Americans losing access to some vaccines and huge expenditures in court fees,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mr. Kennedy has said, falsely, that the vaccine court is the “exclusive remedy” for families seeking compensation. In fact, claimants can sue vaccine makers in traditional courts if the government does not respond to them within 240 days, or if they are dissatisfied with its offer of compensation.

But the traditional courts have not been any more generous to Americans who believe they were injured, said Renee Gentry, director of the Vaccine Injury Litigation Clinic at George Washington University.

“The idea that going to straight to civil litigation means you’re going to win is absurd,” Ms. Gentry said. “These are incredibly difficult cases.” She believes her clients are better off in the vaccine court.

Mr. Kennedy has been deeply involved in litigation over vaccines for years. For example, he worked on lawsuits against Merck over claims related to the Gardasil vaccine, which protects against the human papilloma virus.

As health secretary, Mr. Kennedy initially planned to keep his financial stake in the litigation. But he relinquished those earnings to an adult son following controversy at his confirmation hearing.

Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, also pressed him to pledge to refrain from suing pharmaceutical companies after he leaves government. “I’m not going to agree to that,” Mr. Kennedy said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/06/multimedia/06hs-vaccine-court-zmqc/06hs-vaccine-court-zmqc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 07:56:34.035445

Community organizations in the Philadelphia suburbs and New Jersey are fundraising to support family members of people detained by immigration enforcement officials.

“Están sufriendo las familias en diferentes aspectos”, dijo Mari, una residente del condado de Montgomery quien no quería compartir su apellido por miedo a represalias. “Emocional, económico, son familias rotas”.

“Families are suffering in different ways,” said Mari, a Montgomery County resident who did not wish to share her last name for fear of retaliation. “Emotionally, economically, they’re broken families.”

Mari, a volunteer, worked with Norristown nonprofit organization Centro de Cultura Arte Trabajo y Educación, or CCATE, to fundraise for several families of the 14 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a supermarket on July 18.

Obed Arango, executive director of CCATE, said he and fellow organizers have seen “the necessity for humanitarian relief.”

“When we see children or people left behind with tremendous needs, it’s important to understand it from the humanitarian perspective and at the same time to understand those that are in need of representation, to have the legal aid,” he said.

To date, the fundraiser has collected more than $5,000 of its $26,000 goal. Mari said the resources have been distributed to the families to support with legal aid and other daily needs.

Similar efforts are ongoing in Princeton, New Jersey, where 16 people were detained in two separate ICE raids in Princeton, New Jersey on July 23 and 24, according to Paulo Almirón, media coordinator of Resistencia en Acción NJ, a migrant justice grassroots organization focused on Mercer County.

The organization has launched a fundraiser to support its rapid response network to ICE sightings in the area, and benefit families of detainees. So far, the fund has collected nearly $3,000 of its goal of $30,000.

Almirón said the organization is currently working with the families of 13 of the 16 people detained in the July Princeton raids. Resistencia en Acción is helping families with deposits for phone calls with loved ones in detention, supporting people in finding where their loved ones are being held and referring them to trustworthy legal services.

Almirón said his organization also sees family members struggling to cope financially after a family member is detained.

“In most cases, the person … detained is the breadwinner of the family,” he said. “Because it is so hard for immigrants to find jobs, it is often the father in a family that has to put hours, and people work six, seven days a week, and they cannot stop doing that because the cost of living, and it forces them to do all this. So when that person is gone, the family is left financially unstable, and it’s even worse when the person is transferred to an out of state detention center, because that adds to the expenses of whether people can visit.”

ICE raids have left communities ‘fractured,’ families ‘inconsolable’

Organizers say the increasing raids in the last few months are taking a psychological toll on families and entire communities.

“In terms of emotional distress, these families are inconsolable,” Almirón said. “They’re really devastated to see basically their relatives or loved ones being abducted.”

In one of the Princeton raids, he said, the little brother of one of the people being detained watched it happen.

“That’s a traumatizing experience that a lot of our community has to deal with, and even for families that are not directly affected, that spreads fear among the community people at this moment,” Almirón said. “They are afraid of even going to work or getting groceries. It’s a really terrible situation, emotionally and psychologically for the families in the community.”

Mari said in Norristown, the community is “fractured.”

“Han sido personas conocidas por nuestra comunidad”, dijo ella de las personas detenidas en las redadas. “Personas conocidas y queridas por nuestra comunidad que prestaban un servicio a nuestra comunidad. Y son apreciados y valorados por nosotros. Entonces eso nos motiva a apoyarlos aún más”.

“They’ve been people known by our community,” she said of the people detained in the raids. “People who are known and loved by our community, that provided a service to our community. They’re appreciated and valued, and so that motivates us to support them even more.”

To help with people’s mental health and legal needs, Arango said that CATE is inviting therapists and attorneys to provide pro bono services to impacted community members. Those willing to lend their aid can contact the organization at contact@ccate.org.

Rapid response network, podcast share accurate information on ICE sightings, elected officials’ responses

Arango, referencing a phrase used by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said he and other organizers are working to “create a beloved community.”

To that end, Arango, who is also a journalist and a lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, worked with community members at CCATE to start a podcast, “Diálogos de la Villa Inmigrante,” or “Dialogues of the Immigrant Village,” in November 2024.

“We think that good dialogue, positive dialogue with the authorities, to hear the community, to know the community firsthand, can provide a better understanding of who we are as a community,” he said. “That deep conversation, no, at every level of government is key … because that can help to actually build changes in the coming future.”

The podcast garners thousands of listeners for each episode. Recent guests included U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean and U.S. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon.

Arango said the podcast also serves as a way to communicate verified, accurate information to community members.

“We are very always careful that the information that we present is proven, that it has a source, no, that it has a direct understanding of things,” he said. “We are very careful on that.”

For Resistencia en Acción NJ, the priority of providing accurate information to the community is also paramount, and carried out by volunteers in its rapid response network.

“We’ve been recruiting more people, fundraising for our rapid response team,” he said. “We have increased our patrols. We have people patrolling every morning, operators on the phone to attend to the rapid response line, people who confirm ICE presence in the area that’s reported. So that requires a lot of coordination and resources that we are covering through this fund.”

Almirón said those who are interested in contacting the organization to learn more about volunteering or resources can call 609-436-0207, or email at info@resistenciaenaccionnj.org. For the rapid response network, they can call 640-446-2386.",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/resistencia-nj-ice-2025-08-08-4.jpg,N,,2025-08-11 07:56:25.272457

… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America.","In late July, officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided access to three detention centers they operate in Louisiana to a group of about 20 civil rights advocates.

Their tour included the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, located on the former England Air Force Base in Alexandria. It’s become a conduit for individuals apprehended around the country to the nine ICE detention centers in Louisiana, where immigration court watchers say judges are more likely to be aligned to the Trump administration’s enforcement policy.

The other ICE facilities on the tour were the South Louisiana Processing Center in Basile, which holds only women, and the Pine Prairie Processing Center in Evangeline Parish.

The Illuminator conducted two separate interviews with attorneys who went on the tour, and excerpts from these transcripts are shared below. They have been edited for length and clarity.

One interview featured Kerry Kennedy and Anthony Enriquez with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization, who are in Episode 17 of “The Light Switch,” our weekly podcast.

The other interview is with Alanah Odoms, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, and Nora Ahmed, the organization’s legal director.

RFK Human Rights and the ACLU of Louisiana have collaborated in the past, most notably as of late on a 2024 report – “Inside the Black Hole” – that detailed “abused and disappeared” immigrants in the state. It was compiled based on interviews with more than 6,000 interviews and seven tours with officials from the New Orleans ICE office.

Last month’s tour was just the latest trip to the state’s ICE facilities for Ahmed and Enriquez, both of whom have clients in custody.

The interviews included claims of unsanitary living conditions, inadequate medical care and abuse. Questions about these allegations were sent to the ICE media relations office, and its representatives have yet to respond.

Q: You’ve visited these facilities before. Did you get the sense that preparations were made in advance to have each facility put its best foot forward, or was it much as you’ve seen on past visits?

Odoms: This was actually my first time inside immigrant detention. … I was really surprised that it did not seem like much preparation went into making things appear, at least visually, better than what they normally are. I think where the real dog and pony show took place was in their presentation to us about their operations and their standards and their protocols. That was like night and day, hearing from ICE about how they care for people and what their standards are, versus hearing directly from the residents.

Q: The first stop on the tour was the ICE Processing Center in Alexandria. Take us through your first impressions.

Odoms: First of all, every single one of these places has many layers of barbed wire around it, so they depict prison immediately. Then you’re brought through metal detectors and security. You’re you have to surrender everything, even a smart watch. You’re not allowed to have any recording devices, anything like that. Then you’re brought through these metal sally port doors, which are these huge metal doors that slam shut behind you, and you are very, very aware that you are in a prison.

Then you walk in and you see there are two main areas in the staging facility where people are either held in prison, like cells, like a cell block, very traditional prison … and it opens up into what they call airport-style seating area, where people are actually sitting, chained at their hands, chained at their feet, and chained at their bellies, waiting for their planes to take off.

That is what you see as soon as you walk in, and they did not try to hide the people who were waiting. There were about maybe a handful, if not maybe 10 to 12 people who were waiting for a flight, who were sitting clearly chained … at every single appendage of their body.

The second room is more of a gymnasium style room where there are between 70 to 90 people being housed in bunk beds. … This aging facility is where the male population is held inside these either cell blocks or bunk-style barracks.

In the open room, there’s a large Plexiglas or glass partition where you can very clearly see who’s inside, and they can very clearly see you. As soon as folks saw us, they immediately came to that window. And honestly, the looks on all of their faces were like, “Help.”

Q: Kerry, your organization has a global focus on human rights concerns. What’s happening in Louisiana’s ICE facilities that has made this situation one of your priorities?

Kennedy: When we were in Louisiana, in the detention centers, we met with a woman who is also one of our clients, who her doctor told her that she might have colon cancer, and she was picked up [to see a doctor] a couple of days later. She’s been asking for four and a half months to see a doctor to see whether or not she has colon cancer, and her ability to see that doctor has been denied for four and a half months.

We met another woman, an elderly woman, who begged and pleaded to see a doctor because she came into the facility walking perfectly, and now she’s forced to use a wheelchair, and she doesn’t know why. She’s begged and pleaded to see a doctor. They finally said, ”We’ll send you to health care,” and she was sexually assaulted when she did that.

I met another young woman who’s 26 years old. She is gay. She’s from Russia. She fled Russia because of the oppression against gay people, because her life was in danger. She’s got a master’s in chemical engineering, and she was working for a pharmaceutical company, making medicines for us, for our country, and now instead, she’s in this detention center.

This makes no sense. These are people who are in our communities, who are creating change, who are paying taxes, who are making our country stronger and better. And instead, now you and I … [are] paying through our tax dollars for their breakfast, lunch and dinner every single day, and for them to be in a prison situation instead about the world creating change. So that’s why we’re attacking this.

Q: How do you mount a legal strategy for your clients against an administration that is willing to subvert due process when it comes to immigration law?

Enriquez: This is a question that actually has two answers. One is we work hand in hand with people who are living and working in the communities where detention centers exist. So for those of you who are in Louisiana, one thing that’s been interesting is when we have discussions with the workers who are guards in some of these private prisons, these detention centers. They tell us, “I really didn’t have another choice. It was either work here or in a casino, and this was the only thing around for me. This was a way that I could feed my own family.”

So a core element of what we’re doing is to try and extend the notion of human rights, not just to the people who are suffering the types of physical sexual abuse that that you just heard Kerry speak of the detained immigrants, but actually the workers who are being exploited in these detention centers as well by private prison.

CEOs … are pocketing these taxpayer dollars for their own bonuses. People might not be aware that the head of the corporate leadership of the GEO Group, which is one of the owners of many of the detention centers in Louisiana, they just gave themselves big fat raises after the passage of this last domestic policy bill. That’s money that they’re actually taking out of the hands of pockets of Louisiana workers as well. So that’s one of the ways that we really try and broaden the conception of what human rights is, and we let people know this is a big fight that’s affecting all of us.

Q: Statistics show that roughly half of the people being detained in Louisiana ICE facilities do not have a prior criminal background, and many have not been formally charged with a crime.

Odoms: The only designation that they have that separates people who they believe have criminal histories is this high- [or] low-designation, and whether you get put in a cell block or whether you get put in the barrack style living conditions.

When we asked about classification for how people were classified as either high or low, we didn’t get a very clear answer on that at all. Sometimes they were saying, “Well, they come to us that way from other facilities, so someone else is making the classification, and we’re just kind of rubber stamping that and either putting somebody in a cell block or putting someone in a barracks.” Or, “We have a point system,” and they said, “Oh, you’re going to have to request that in writing.”

So anytime we kind of brushed up against a question that would really illuminate what was happening in terms of constitutional violations and real problems, all of those questions were met with: “That would have to be something that you submit in writing.”

Q: What explanations have you been given as to why your clients are being warehoused indefinitely in ICE detention without any opportunity for bond, and what level of proof is the federal government providing to justify this?

Ahmed: We have two clients [and] we’ll be filing habeas petitions* in short order that illustrate this.

One of our clients, they’ve attempted to remove her to six different countries. All have said no, but she’s still there because apparently they’re just going to run through the list, which is … wildly preposterous.

In terms of bond, we’re going to bring another habeas challenge. Because right now you’ve probably heard the administration is [taking into custody] people who appear at their immigration proceedings. We have a client who appeared for her asylum proceeding, and then she was whisked away. The reason she was whisked away is because of a newfound interpretation of the United States Code, Section 1225, which no longer is interpreting mandatory detention as applicable to people appearing at the border, and is now just applying to anybody who entered the country without inspection.

So you’re now starting to see people like our client, who’ve been in the United States for two decades, showing up as they’re supposed to to an immigration court hearing. Are you really a flight risk if you’re showing up to your court hearing? Probably not. And in her particular case, there’s no criminal record. So you’re also talking about somebody who there is no conceivable way that you could possibly say that she’s a danger.

I still want to say that people who do have criminal records are also not dangerous, let’s be clear, because in this country, a criminal record could include not paying a fine or having to pick up your child and not making a court date. So I don’t like to pitch people with criminal records as people who are dangerous because the vast majority are not.

Q: Recently in Louisiana, two powerful members of our congressional delegation intervened to secure the release of two detainees. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise stepped in to have an Iranian woman who’s lived in New Orleans for nearly 50 years released, and Sen. John Kennedy was instrumental in the release of a Mexican woman who’s married to a U.S. Marine. Does this give you any glimmer of hope that other powerful Republicans will call for the Trump administration to pause its sweeping immigration enforcement efforts?

Kennedy: I think it’s important that people at the highest levels are beginning to understand the impact of these terrible laws. You know, one of the problems with GEO Group is that it runs prisons. So this is a detention facility that is run as a prison.

But before this, we were not always putting people in detention, and a lot of these people have been in the communities, have been in the Marines, have served our country. They are our teachers. They are giving us the food that we eat every day. They’re making our medicines.

They can be in the community, and they’re great programs – proven again and again and again – where 100% of the people who are released into the community return for their detention here, for their immigration hearings and also to be deported, if that’s ultimately what’s supposed to happen to them.

So why in the world are we taking people? Why are we kidnapping people off the street and treating them with such inhumanity and harming our country at the same time? This makes no sense, unless you think about it as a way to enrich a cruel corporation, which is what’s happened.

Q: The sheer number of people being detained makes it close to impossible that everyone is represented by an attorney. Is there any solution within sight that, at the very least, would ensure every detainee receives legal representation?

Kennedy: Yeah, well, there’s a clear solution – open up the doors and let people be in the community, which was the solution under the Bush administration, the Obama administration, many of the other administrations. That’s what would happen to people, and there are proven programs where 100% of them come back to their [immigration court] hearing. So that’s the least expensive, most effective and best way to assure that people’s rights are not being compromised by the United States government.

Q: We’re seeing increasing incidents of people showing up for immigration court hearings at the appointed time and date, following official instructions only to be taken into ICE custody and placed into detention. How are you advising clients who might want to adhere to the rules but face a good chance they will be apprehended and then fast-tracked toward deportation or imprisoned indefinitely?

Odoms: We have very direct guidance for people who are able to obtain counsel. They absolutely need to do so, and they need to presume that they are going to be apprehended. Like, it’s not if they’re going to be taken. It’s when they’re going to be taken.

But here’s the thing, I really want this to come across: Everyone is still having faith in this system, that if they actually present themselves and continue to do what’s right, being compliant, being adherent, that they will actually be given some kind of consideration. And that is not true

Ahmed: … What preparations people need to do? They need to prepare in two to three very distinct ways, I think, and we can tell them, talk to an immigration attorney about a motion to reopen your immigration proceedings very quickly. Also try to ensure that you have access to a federal practitioner who will be able to file a habeas petition for you when you’re incarcerated.

… We’ve seen a lot of congressional folks start stepping up, have a privacy waiver signed and make sure that everyone important in your life, including your congressional representatives, is able to communicate on your behalf with ICE. You can download the document off of the [ICE] website. … You get to fill in the information of whoever is allowed to have access, and then they can start advocating for you with ICE. You should know your congressional representatives, who can do that, your local friends and family.

Q: Alana, your organization has always had as its bedrock the belief that our Constitution, our laws and judicial system ultimately would not let us down. Do you feel that certainty still exists?

Odoms: Yeah, it does feel like the safety net of our Constitution has started to fray in some really fundamental ways.

… Myself and every other lawyer that’s been trained in this country, we’re trained in the Constitution, both of Louisiana and of the United States of America. We’re not trained to actually respond to an authoritarian regime – that is the true issue that we’re all facing. What do you do when the Constitution doesn’t apply anymore? What do we do when we actually have laws and those laws are being completely thrown out, how do we respond?

There’s a lot for us to learn from organizers and folks who have been doing work outside of the power structure, because I don’t think we’re going to find our answers in the traditional way that we have in the past.

… That’s the outside strategy that we have to work on. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with filing a lawsuit, but it does have to do with strategizing around people power. How do we do that? Because these systems are only going to buckle under the the pressure of people saying, “Oh, hell no, that looks like an authoritarian regime. That’s not what we want. We want a process. We want due process. We want people to have access to lawyers. We want people to have access to all the things that our constitution says.”

That’s a people power movement.

Then ask yourself: Whose priorities, interests and concerns have they supported, fought for and voted for?

Certainly not those of most Missourians.

Missourians voted for candidates in various elective offices to represent and fight for their interests in Jefferson City and Washington, D.C.

Instead, many of the Republican elected officials seem to have forgotten and folded to the pressure of supporting and carrying out the agenda of the Trump administration, whether it is in the best interest and well-being of Missouri citizens or not.

Look at the behavior of Missouri senators and representatives in Congress. While some bothered to proclaim that Medicaid should not be cut, at the end of the posturing they all went along with approving the Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Bill.”

Essentially voting for the cuts in Medicaid funding that will deny tens of thousands of Missourians life-saving services. How many rural hospitals will be affected or forced to close in the coming months and years because of these cuts?

Their actions, or failures to act, are disturbing and disconcerting.

How is it that members of the Missouri congressional delegation can get away with the abdication of carrying out their governance and oversight responsibilities?

When it comes to allowing the Trump administration to usurp Congress’s power and arbitrarily disrupt, disband and defund departments that will negatively impact Missourians. First it was the department of education that was the target, cutting needed funding for school districts.

The most recent is the proposal to decentralize the department of agriculture. Will these changes hurt Missouri farmers, causing them to lose necessary funding and programmatic support? What are the positions of members of the Missouri Congressional delegation?

Our representatives in Congress have been silent and given tacit support to other actions of the Trump administration.

When it comes to the impact of increased tariffs on farmers being able to export their soybeans and other produce, and the higher cost of consumer goods across the board for families already struggling to make ends meet.

When it comes to immigration tactics that disrupt business operations, the workforce in agricultural industries and the lives of innocent family members.

When it comes to the short and long-term effects of taxation policies and the national debt, the burden of which Missourians like all Americans must bear.

When there is no oversight, no checks and balanced guardrails, how can we be confident that the policies and decisions being made will be in our best interest?

The actions of our Republican governor, Republican-controlled state legislature and other government offices are in lock-step with the Trump administration as well.

An executive order adopted and ensured the implementation of dismantling DEI programs throughout governmental departments and agencies, colleges and universities, and wherever the state had authority to issue a mandate. Businesses have been sued by the state attorney general for apparent noncompliance.

What measures are being implemented to ensure that all Missourians are treated equal and have equal access and equal opportunity? A state with a diverse population base, who is helped or hurt?

Republican state legislators in the Senate and House wrote letters urging the Missouri U.S. Senators to pass the “Big Beautiful Bill” irrespective of the negative impacts on their constituents.

The latest influence of President Trump on what goes on in Missouri is his request for the legislature to draw a new mapto eliminate one of the two Democratic congressional districts to help ensure that the Republicans maintain the majority in the House after the 2026 midterm elections.

Such a move, if successful, would eliminate the congressional district that represents Kansas City and some adjacent counties, thereby diminishing or negating the impact the representation and vote of a large number of constituents, including large minority groups.

The Republican governor and Republican-dominated legislature are seriously considering calling a special legislative session to make President Trump’s wishes happen.

Congressional districts are usually revisited or redrawn following the U.S. Census taken every 10 years that tracks population shifts and other changes. Redrawing districts mid-cycle or in an off year is solely to provide a political advantage for one party or the other.

Missouri has six Republican and two Democratic Congressional districts.

Every Missourians should think about the meaning of the political move to change that to 7 to 1.

Fundamentally, elected officials, irrespective of their party affiliations, should represent all constituents living within their electoral boundaries despite the racial and ethnic make-up or how they may have voted.

Likewise, representative government means just that. It should represent, as best as possible, all the people it governs.

As there is growing disapproval of President Trump and many of his policies by most recent polls, why are Republican state leaders continuing to bow to the pressure of jumping on an increasingly unpopular Trump agenda?

It worked on Matthew Morrison. In mid-July, the 69-year-old former psychiatric nurse supervisor quietly fled the United States.

Morrison had been threatened by an aggressive government before. When he was a teenager, he fought against what he and others in the Irish Republican Army saw as an occupying British government that discriminated against marginalized Catholics in Northern Ireland.

For his efforts then, Morrison said he was beaten by interrogators and wound up in prison, where some of his comrades died in a hunger strike protesting the revocation of their political status.

Upon his release in 1985, he feared for his safety. He came to St. Louis, married his American pen pal and had two children. Eventually, he overstayed his tourist visa, divorced his pen pal and remarried. He's had the spectre of deportation hanging over him for decades. His family has endured the highs and lows of his battle along the way.

Now, Morrison leans on a cane. He's had several strokes. He said that the fear and uncertainty that he might be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was more than he could bear.

""I would bite the dust in an ICE holding cell,"" Morrison told The Marshall Project - St. Louis before he left the U.S. ""There is nothing to stop them from deporting me to Ecuador, South Sudan or whatever. It's really gotten insane here. It's crazy what they are doing now, the Trump administration. You know what I mean?""

Many noncitizens have faced similar unknowns in hiding. Morrison has been in the public eye for a long time. He's been in and out of the news since the 1990s. He was even the grand marshal of a parade. But the U.S. government denied his petition for an adjustment in immigration status because of crimes he was convicted of during ""The Troubles"" conflict in Northern Ireland. Morrison had omitted those from his original tourist visa application.

In 2000, the Clinton administration terminated the deportation process against Morrison and five other named ""deportees,"" as the group of former Irish Republican Army prisoners was called, after the American spouses of the Irish men testified before Congress. The president himself weighed in on the issue.

""While in no way approving or condoning their past criminal acts,"" Bill Clinton said then, according to a Washington Post story at the time, ""I believe that removing the threat of deportation for these individuals will contribute to the peace process in Northern Ireland.""

The deportees were momentarily relieved. But because they weren't on a path to citizenship, the six men still had to live with restrictions and regularly check in with the government.

In May, Noel Gaynor, who had a heart condition, died at home in Olean, New York. Waiting months without annual work authorization approval, his Medicare and Social Security benefits were cut off, according to a video of statements made at his wake. In June, Gabriel Megahey received a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that The Marshall Project - St. Louis reviewed. It began: ""It's time for you to leave the United States.""

Morrison expected a similar letter. Though his work authorization expires in October, he didn't want to sit around waiting and worrying.

On July 21, he limped onto a one-way flight from Cleveland to Dublin, Ireland, with his wife, leaving behind a life that he'd built in the St. Louis area, including grown children, grandchildren and many friends.

""I've come full circle,"" Morrison said while still in the United States. ""I came here as an immigrant and I am leaving as an immigrant, despite everything in between. The whole thing is a crazy, stressful situation.""

There's a city in Northern Ireland with two names. Protestants call it Londonderry. Catholics, like Morrison, call it Derry.

Catholics felt discriminated against there. Without better options, Morrison said his childhood home didn't have an indoor bathroom or hot water. He said the cramped home was raided by British soldiers stationed there to keep the peace between Protestants and Catholics and to ensure Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.

To resist, he helped build barricades around his neighborhood. On Jan. 30, 1972, 16-year-old Morrison and his father joined thousands of others in the streets of their city. The march for Catholic civil rights became known as Bloody Sunday after British troops fatally shot 14 unarmed people and injured others.

To fight back, Morrison said he joined the Irish Republican Army.

""There was no way to be indifferent,"" he said.

Three years later, while in college, he said he was arrested with two others for trying to gun down a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer. Again, there were two ways to look at it. To Morrison, it was an act of war. Others saw it as terrorism.

Later, he'd claim he was choked and beaten during police interrogations, which left him deaf in one ear. Convicted of attempted murder, he was sent to a prison outside Belfast that became widely known for a hunger strike where 10 people died.

Released in 1985, Morrison fled to St. Louis, where he soon married Francie Broderick, an American pen pal who'd protested in Northern Ireland. They had a son, Matt, then a daughter, Katie. For years, the family and their supporters rallied to bring awareness to their own troubles with immigration authorities.

In 1998, CBS featured the Morrison family in a documentary titled ""Before Your Eyes: Don't Take My Daddy.""

""I always felt that our campaign was an extension of the hunger strike,"" said Broderick, now 77.

They had a major breakthrough in 2000 when then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in a prepared statement that she had been advised by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to drop deportation proceedings against the deportees to ""support and promote the process of reconciliation that has begun in Northern Ireland.""

The men could stay, but they still couldn't apply for a green card, let alone U.S. citizenship, because of their deferred immigration status.

""People don't realize how much of a minefield U.S. immigration law is,"" Morrison said.

Over the years, delayed work authorizations sidelined him from his job for months at a time, he said. He worked about 20 years as a nurse in Missouri, including stints at a children’s hospital and several state mental health facilities. He said he presented at the St. Louis County Police Academy on topics including mental health and deescalation tactics.

""It doesn’t matter what I did, Immigration gave me no credit for it,"" Morrison said.

Homeland Security and ICE officials didn't respond to requests for comment.

—

In June, before Morrison self-deported, a scheduled check-in with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in St. Louis put him and his family on edge. Their fears were heightened by stories about immigrants being detained at routine appointments, regardless of legal status. At the appointment, authorities took a photo of Morrison and he was free to go.

""We were terrified that they were just going to take him right there,"" said his son, Matt, 37.

He said the uncertainty weighed on his father more than he'd ever seen.

""He has to live under that fear of somebody knocking on the door and dragging him out of the house, just like they did in Derry when he was young,"" Matt said. ""I hate it. I am just worried about him. Until recently, I hadn't heard him cry about it.""

He has mixed feelings about his father's departure.

""He's got brothers and sisters over there, but we are all here — and his grandkids,"" Matt said. ""He spends a lot of time with his grandkids.""

Morrison's daughter, Katie Bradley, 34, said a recent farewell gathering, held in a backyard, felt like a funeral. She panicked because her U.S. passport had expired.

""Even though he's still alive, I feel like I am grieving,"" she said. ""It’s a huge loss for me and my children.""

Morrison's wife, Sandra Riley Swift, has a house in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as her mother and many grandchildren. After helping Morrison transition into an apartment in the town where he grew up, she said in a social media post that she's going to straddle both countries for a while.

The square is lined with buildings that house institutions linked to government or municipal services: several courts, the statistics bureau, the Department of Homeland Security and the city's Department of Health.

At 26 Federal Plaza stands a towering 41-story gray skyscraper, called the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building. It houses the New York immigration service, including an administrative court, and the offices that handle the hundreds of routine check-ins that are required of New Yorkers with immigrant status. This represents about 18.5% of the city's population, 37.5% of which is comprised of foreign-born residents, just over half of whom have been naturalized.

Ever since the Trump administration implemented its anti-immigration measures, people coming to routine appointments to update their administrative files have risked being arrested by federal immigration police (ICE) agents, who are stationed inside the building. Most ICE agents wear masks and sport no visible identifying signs. They wait in the corridors, with lists of names in hand.

The criteria by which individuals are included on the lists are unknown and unrelated to the decisions made by the administration in the building, as migrants reporting to this office are, by definition, not illegally living in the country. Once apprehended, they are directly taken to the building's 10th floor, which has been turned into a provisional detention center.

That fact drew several Butler County residents to the July 15 Butler County Commission meeting to voice their displeasure at the contract.","Ibou Tine says he's scared to be deported to his native Senegal, which he fled years ago to escape political violence. But now he's asking to be sent back soon so he can leave the Butler County Jail, where he's been for more than two months.

He's speaking to a WVXU reporter through a teleconference at the Jail during a visit on a recent Sunday. He describes the searing stomach pain he says he's been suffering lately. He claims he hasn't gotten medical treatment and is having trouble eating.

""If you have health problems, this isn't a place you should be,"" Tine said. ""If they need to send me back to Senegal, that's a big risk — but I'd rather risk it than stay in here.""

WVXU reached out to the Butler County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail, about Tine's condition and any medical treatment he's received. The office declined to provide records specific to Tine's treatment, citing medical privacy laws. The office did provide details about its 24-hour infirmary and some data about how people held on ICE detainers are given medical treatment in the jail.

Tine's attorney, as well as a friend who talks to him most days, say they're worried about his condition, noting he's seemed to have lost weight.

They aren't the only ones worried about how ICE detainees are being treated.

A letter from faith leaders

Groups raising concerns about the jail's treatment of those federal prisoners include immigration attorneys and a coalition of 19 Butler County faith leaders and 16 other clergy from outside the region who signed a July 28 letter expressing deep reservations about the county's contract with U.S. Marshals to hold people detained by ICE.

Some Butler County residents and two Republican Butler County commissioners also have expressed a level of discomfort about the jail's status as an ICE detention site.

Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones has said his deputies treat all inmates in the jail properly and that the contract is about supporting the Trump administration's efforts to remove immigrants without authorization in the United States.

But that hasn't been enough to prevent growing questions about the jail.

""Having the ICE facility in our county links us to what we’ve come to see as an unfair and unduly harsh administration of new immigration laws,"" the faith leaders' letter reads. ""We are also concerned about reports of abuse suffered by some detainees in ICE facilities. And as those who are ministering to the local immigrant population, and often the Latino community as well, we can testify that law-abiding residents are now afraid to report crimes for fear of being arrested instead of aided.""

The sheriff's office said in a statement it offered a tour of jail facilities to the faith leaders who wrote the July 28 letter. Members of that group WVXU talked to confirmed that tour will take place Aug. 13.

'Doing the right thing' with 'an open mind'

Rev. John Wagner of the Seven Mile United Methodist Church helped write the letter. He says he has deep respect for law enforcement. And he applauded the sheriff's offer of a tour and the transparency it implied. But he also said he felt a responsibility to ask ""hard questions"" about what is going on inside the jail.

""I'll be going in with an open mind, but I also want to do the right thing and see that people are being treated fairly and humanely,"" he said.

The Butler County Sheriff's Office entered into its contract with the federal government Feb. 1. That contract pays the county $68 a day per person to house ICE detainees. The sheriff's office also gets $36 an hour to help guard and transport detainees. According to the contract, the office bills ICE's Enforcement and Operations Field Office in Detroit for these expenses.

Since signing the contract, the jail has held between 300 and more than 400 ICE detainees at a given time, according to BCSO.

The sheriff's office had entered into a previous contract to house federal detainees in 2003. It ended that contract in 2021. At the time, Jones said it was no longer financially feasible to uphold the agreement. BCSO signed the new contract shortly after President Donald Trump took office for his second term.

Allegations of mistreatment

Tine, the Senegalese immigrant with a stomach ailment, was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and detained in the Butler County Jail May 22 after missing a routine immigration appointment in Cleveland regarding his asylum claim. His attorney says he missed that appointment because the person who was driving him had car troubles.

Like most people held in ICE detention, Tine has no serious criminal record in local courts — the only charge in local court systems is a 2023 dismissed misdemeanor for driving without a license in Hamilton County.

Tine says he has gastrointestinal issues that he has struggled with for a few years. He's gone to the hospital on multiple occasions, where he says he was told he has a tear in his stomach and needs a specialist.

That condition has worsened during his time in the jail, Tine and his advocates say.

""Every time I try to eat, I throw up,"" he said during a recent phone call. ""I'm not getting medical attention. They give me a medication I used to get a long time ago. It's not helping me at all.""

WVXU is working to secure a signed release form to access Tine's jail medical records. A reporter also submitted questions to the county about how medical care works for ICE detainees in the jail more generally.

According to a detailed response from BCSO's Jonathan Davidson, the jail bills ICE for prescription medication and necessary medical procedures for detainees.

They get care at the jail's infirmary, which is open 24 hours a day. If an emergency the certified doctors and nurses on staff at the infirmary can't handle arises, detainees can be transported to nearby hospitals.

That's happened 11 times over the duration of the current contract with ICE, records show. Davidson said records of current expenditures on medical care for ICE detainees were not available at this time.

Other concerns

Several high-profile cases, including the detention and eventual deportation of Cincinnati Public high school grad and Honduran immigrant Emerson Colindres, have drawn attention to the jail's ICE contract. The July 28 letter from faith leaders mentions the case of another Honduran asylum seeker, Armando Reyes, who was arrested by ICE this summer and is detained in Butler County Jail.

Another case centering on the jail is that of former Children's Hospital Chaplain Imam Ayman Soliman.

Soliman was detained by ICE July 9 after his asylum status was revoked. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has made claims in court filings that Soliman has ties to terrorist groups and was wanted for murder in Iraq, though it has yet to provide evidence of this. His legal team has denied these claims.

Soliman's attorneys filed a motion in early August seeking his release from the Butler County Jail on the grounds he's being mistreated there. They allege Soliman was put in solitary confinement earlier this month without a compelling reason and was cut off from his attorneys and spiritual advisors.

Attorney Nazly Mamedova says Soliman has been serving as a Muslim chaplain at the jail. She acknowledges that many of the guards at the jail have been willing to let Soliman do this. But she says when he asked one guard for clarification about a prayer session, he was declared to be insubordinate and put in segregated custody. Mamedova says the extended time he spent in solitary confinement was very difficult for him.

""He was heavily depressed,"" she said. ""Part of him is talking to people as chaplain. So putting him in isolation without the ability to talk to anyone, that definitely brought his spirits down.""

Controversy over previous ICE contract

The treatment of ICE detainees under the BCSO's previous contract with the federal government is the subject of at least one federal lawsuit. In it, attorneys for Bayong Brown Bayong and Ahmed Adem allege the two immigrants detained by ICE in Butler County experienced physical abuse at the hands of guards there in 2020, including beatings and being pushed down a set of stairs.

Filings by attorneys for the county dispute this, saying no one was pushed down stairs and that force used against the two was proper because they were being disobedient.

Details from the filing shed light on how discipline in the jail works.

""In a correctional facility, a detainee who questions the lawful orders of a corrections officer or who demands to speak with a higher-ranking officer is effectively disobeying, which is a form of resistance,"" the county's answer to allegations reads, noting that such detainees are considered ""a real threat to institutional security"" subject to use-of-force, detainment in solitary confinement, or other discipline.

Later in the filing, the county describes one metric used to determine if use-of-force is appropriate.

""If a corrections officer’s assessment of a situation reasonably leads them to believe that they may be assaulted by an inmate who is in close proximity to them, the corrections officer does not have to wait to actually be assaulted before reacting with reasonable force,"" it reads.

The lawsuit is still working its way through federal court.

Growing concern

Data revealing most ICE detainees in the jail who don't have other criminal charges against them has led to some pushback around the BCSO contract with the federal government.

Records show that only about 30% of people held on ICE detainers in the Butler County Jail have other, non-immigration related offenses.

That fact drew several Butler County residents to the July 15 Butler County Commission meeting to voice their displeasure at the contract.

Hamilton resident John K. Roberts said he's uneasy about what is happening with ICE detentions of otherwise-law abiding people just because they're undocumented.

""These people are being rounded up by individuals in military uniforms with face masks. No ID, no warrants,"" he said. ""I just wonder what the hell happened. Why have people come to the conclusion that this is a good thing?""

County Commissioners Don Dixon and TC Rogers promised they would ask Sheriff Jones questions about the treatment of detainees in the jail.

""When I hear that our sheriff is just going after what I deem normal people who have come here illegally but are working, that is different than what I'm told was the plan that started after January 20,"" Rogers said. ""That was to get rid of the criminals... there are a lot of those criminals to go first before you start thinking about the people who just came here and have not had a criminal infraction. I will discuss that with the sheriff, but what you're saying is contrary to what I've been told.""

In the first six months of the Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Houston arrested 356 illegal foreign nationals who are confirmed gang members.

Combined, they illegally entered the U.S. 1,434 times and were convicted of 1,685 criminal offenses, ICE said.

“Despite attempts by some to undermine the courageous work being done by our officers, the brave men and women of ICE continue to put their lives on the line every day to arrest violent transnational gang members, foreign fugitives and dangerous criminal aliens,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations-Houston acting Field Office Director Gabriel Martinez said. “In just the past couple of years in Houston, transnational gang members were responsible for brutally raping and murdering an innocent 12-year-old girl on her way to the store. Our officers know their efforts can help prevent atrocities like that from ever occurring again and they won’t rest until they’re all gone.”

Overall, ICE ERO-Houston officers arrested confirmed members of more than 40 gangs. The greatest number of gang arrests was 159 from the Paisas gang. The next greatest number was 39 confirmed MS-13 members and 25 Tren de Aragua members, which the Trump administration designated as foreign terrorist organizations. Other arrests were of confirmed Tango Blast, 15th Street Gang, Latin Kings and Surenos-13 gang members.

Of their combined 1,685 criminal convictions, offenses include abduction, homicide, sexual assault, sexual assault of a child, promotion of child pornography, aggravated assault, domestic violence, burglary, alien smuggling, sex trafficking, organized crime, drug trafficking, drug possession, arson, trespassing, unlawful possession of a firearm, illegal entry, illegal reentry, fraud, escape and evading arrest, ICE said.

Of the worst offenders arrested that ICE highlighted, all are men and citizens of El Salvador and Mexico.

One Mexican national and confirmed Surenos-13 gang member, Jonathan Morales-Abundis, 30, was arrested after illegally entering the U.S. 29 times, ICE said. His illegal entries total nearly his age. Despite that, he was only convicted three times for illegal reentry and once for alien smuggling and illegal entry.

Another arrested Surenos-13 gang member was Juan Manuel Cayetano-Vasquez, 48, who illegally entered the U.S. 13 times, ICE said. His convictions include six for drug possession and three for resisting arrest; twice each for domestic violence, assault and identity theft; and once each for false imprisonment, illegal entry, illegal reentry, battery and destroying evidence, ICE said.

An arrested Latin Kings member and Mexican national, Luis Alberto Hernandez, 46, illegally entered the U.S. three times. His rap sheet, according to ICE, includes four convictions for domestic violence, three for illegal reentry, twice for aggravated assault, and once each for drug trafficking, unlawful possession of a firearm, obstructing police, disorderly conduct, drug possession, interfering with a 911 emergency call and child abuse.

Salvadoran nationals arrested include Milton Alexander Magana Fuentes, 31, a child predator and Paisas gang member who illegally entered the U.S. four times, ICE said. His convictions include sexual indecency with a child, failure to register as a sex offender, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Salvadoran MS-13 gang member arrests include Ronald Alberto Rivas-Aguilar, 28, who illegally entered twice and was convicted of homicide, and Jonathan Josue Valle-Moralez, 31, who was previously deported, ICE said. He was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm and in March was transferred into U.S. Marshals’ custody to be prosecuted for homicide.

ICE highlighted arrests of Mexican nationals and confirmed Paisas gang members including Luis Fernando Nava-Garcia, 20, who ICE said illegally entered the U.S. 40 times, more than twice the number of years he’s been alive. Yet, he was only convicted twice for illegal reentry.

Other confirmed Paisas gang members arrested include Javier Ivan Montoya-Avila, 34, who illegally entered 26 times. His convictions include burglary, tampering with government records, criminal trespass, illegal reentry and illegal entry, ICE said; Humberto Romero Avila, 45, who illegally entered 10 times. He was deported to Mexico where he was wanted for homicide, ICE said. His convictions include four DWIs, larceny, illegal reentry and illegal entry.

Others Paisas gang member arrests include Jose Angel Martinez, 39, who illegally entered five times. His convictions include sexual indecency with a minor, aggravated assault of a family member, resisting arrest, burglary, drug possession and obstructing police, ICE said; Samuel Valenzuela Martinez, 55, who illegally entered the U.S. five times. His convictions include six DWIs, three convictions each for assault and illegal entry, and once each for hit-and-run, larceny, cruelty toward a child, evading arrest, fraud and illegal reentry, ICE said; Juan Pablo Hernandez Ramos, 35, a child predator who was deported three times. His convictions include possession with intent to promote child pornography, sexual assault, aggravated assault, illegal entry and illegal reentry, ICE said.

The visit comes less than a week after Crow announced he is suing the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Homeland Security unlawfully blocked him from entering the center in violation of a federal law allowing members of Congress to make unannounced inspections.

After Crow’s July 20 inspection attempt, spokespersons for Homeland Security’s ICE division said that the congressperson did not give a required seven-days notice before his visit, and so he was not admitted as a matter of department policy.

“In this case, the congressman’s request did not comply with the mandatory seven-day advance notice requirement,’ ICE officials said in a statement to the Sentinel. “DHS policy clearly requires requests to tour ICE detention facilities be submitted at least seven calendar days in advance for scheduling. This longstanding policy allows for the appropriate coordination necessary to protect facility operations.”

Crow, who represents Aurora and the 6th Congressional District, which includes the Aurora ICE jail, said in his July 30 lawsuit, that the ICE policy violates federal law.

“The Trump Administration attempting to require advance notice for Members of Congress to do their jobs is against the law,” Crow told the Sentinel. “Congress has the authority to make laws — and the law is clear: Members of Congress have the right to immediately access federal facilities to conduct oversight. Try as they might, the Administration cannot ignore the law.”

Crow said the obstanance shown by the Trump administration in Aurora and across the country is especially worrisome giving the troubling past at many of these immigrant holding facilities, especially the GEO facility in Aurora.

Crow’s congressional staff said he will be joined by Reps. Diana DeGette, Joe Neguse and Brittany Pettersen. The time of the inspection was not made public.

“It’s pretty clear this administration is erecting barriers to obstruct congressional oversight, which raises the very obvious question of, why and what are they hiding? What don’t they want people to know? What questions don’t want people to ask?” Crow said Wednesday. “It should worry everybody pretty deeply. It worries me, and it actually makes it even more important that we double down on our job and we get answers.”

Crow is joined in the lawsuit, filed in a DC federal court, by other congressional representatives who said they, too, were denied access to federal detention facilities. Others joining the lawsuit include representatives Joe Neguse, D-CO, Jamie Raskin, D-MD, Bennie Thompson D-MS, Veronica Escobar D-TX, Dan Goldman, D-NY, Adriano Espaillat, D-NY, Jimmy Gomez, D-CA, Norma Torres D-CA, Raul Ruiz, D-CA, Robert Garcia , D-CA, and Lou Correa, D-CA.

Since taking office in 2019, Crow has made oversight of immigration detention centers a signature issue, introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure members of Congress can make unannounced, in-person visits to such facilities.

He has inspected the Aurora center nine times, while his staff has conducted more than 70 additional inspections. Crow also publishes public reports on facility conditions, including health and treatment concerns.

The Aurora facility, operated by the private prison company GEO Group, has faced years of scrutiny from immigrant advocates who have been critical of alleged overcrowding, poor medical care and improper detainee treatment.

“Since President Trump was elected, this administration has denied Members of Congress access to immigration detention facilities and tried to intimidate us from doing our jobs,” Crow said previously “I will not be deterred from conducting lawful oversight, and I’ll continue fighting to hold the administration accountable, including in Congress and the courts.”",https://i0.wp.com/sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/AP17172779779224.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-11 02:56:49.127931

The governor’s authorization activates up to 14 Idaho National Guard personnel to support ICE, beginning immediately and continuing through Nov. 15 according to a news release.

“As Commander in Chief, I am proud that the Idaho National Guard always stands ready to support our federal partners in any capacity that strengthens public safety and national security,” Little said in a statement issued Friday. “Our guardsmen are trained, disciplined and committed to serving the people of Idaho and the nation.”

The authorization is the latest in Little’s efforts to support ICE activity in Idaho.

In June, Little announced that Idaho State Police will partner with ICE to help transport unauthorized immigrants who’ve been convicted of crimes to detention centers for deportation. The first ICE transports under the new partnership occurred Thursday, according to the governor’s office.

Immigration arrests and detentions in Idaho have risen steeply in 2025, the Idaho Capital Sun reported this week, increasing from 41 reported arrests by ICE agents in Idaho between January and June 2024 to 368 reported arrests during the same period this year.

In the Kootenai County jail, the number of border patrol holds has soared this year, though public records indicate that many individuals who have been booked into the county jail have not been convicted of any crime.

In years past, as few as two or three people a month were jailed in Kootenai County due to their immigration status. Local arrest numbers have increased as ICE has expanded its enforcement priorities in response to the Trump administration’s orders.

A total of 135 people were booked into the Kootenai County jail on a border patrol or immigration hold between Jan. 1 and May 20, according to public records, with more arrests occurring each week.

While 44 of those 135 people were contacted by law enforcement and arrested in North Idaho, mostly in Kootenai and Shoshone counties, the remaining two-thirds were arrested in Washington or Montana and transported to Kootenai County for holding.

People arrested on border patrol or immigration holds are typically held in the Kootenai County jail for a day or so before they’re transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, a privately run immigration prison operated on behalf of ICE.",https://hagadone.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/03/13/Little_Brad_r1200x630.jpg?b7d505e466ff31ef2a911eceee85296b69915698,N,,2025-08-11 03:56:43.747502

(KGO) -- In the North Bay, immigration activists have staged a hunger strike. They're camping outside the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors offices, demanding leaders pass a sanctuary ordinance protecting the immigrant community from ICE raids.

Ten hunger strikers wearing red wristbands were being entertained Sunday by supporters to keep their spirits up. There was no food here, but lots of hydration.

""We started Tuesday morning. Today, we're on day six,"" said immigration advocate Renee Saucedo.

Saucedo is taking part in the hunger strike, camping outside the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors offices. The group is urging supervisors to pass a sanctuary ordinance to protect local immigrant communities from federal ICE raids, which are happening in the North Bay and across the state.

""We're asking for an ordinance that requires county employees not to share information or collaborate with ICE. It's very straight forward,"" Saucedo said.

""I'm so terrified. I carry my passport, because we've had people who are U.S. citizens being detained,"" said Naomi Lossy.

Lossy says conditions for the hunger strike haven't been ideal.

""Coconut water has been a lifesaver. We've been trying to stay cool in the shade as much as possible,"" Lossy said.

Several cities in North Bay have sanctuary policies, along with San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose.

Some Sonoma County supervisors support the hunger strikers right to free speech but say a sanctuary ordinance would have little legal effect against federal immigration policies and could bring unwanted scrutiny to the county.

Supervisor Lynda Hopkins tells ABC7 News, ""Adopting a sanctuary ordinance could cause harm, it risks creating a false sense of security and contributes to misinformation. Worse, it may put a target on the backs of local immigrants and refugees -- particularly under a federal administration that has demonstrated a willingness to pursue retribution.""

""Sadly, it has to do with fear of lawsuits and losing funding,"" Saucedo said.

The hunger strike is ahead of Tuesday's board of supervisors meeting, although the sanctuary topic is not on the agenda, the group plans to protest to force a discussion. It's unclear how long the protest outside will continue.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17496213_081025-kgo-sanctuary-hunger-strike-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-08-11 03:56:52.358898

She brought her youngest son, 6-year-old Isaac, along for the drive.
When Shaw and Isaac attempted to re-enter the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained them at the border.
Although Shaw lacked a travel document, her son Isaac had one, according to Thorward.
Shaw asked Border Patrol agents to allow Besancon, the family friend, to pick up her son, but they refused.","SEATTLE — Sarah Shaw, a New Zealand national and mother of three, believed she had done everything right.

She had checked her documents, confirmed her visa status, and felt confident she could make a quick trip across the Canadian border to drop off her two older children at Vancouver International Airport for a flight to New Zealand, where they would visit their grandparents.

She brought her youngest son, 6-year-old Isaac, along for the drive. The crossing into Canada went smoothly. The return to Everett did not.

“I thought we had crossed every ‘T’ and dotted every ‘I,’” said Victoria Besancon, a close friend of Shaw. “Sarah had been waiting on some travel documents to be approved. But once her visa and her children’s visas were cleared, she felt comfortable taking them to Canada. We assumed everything was fine.”

That assumption proved wrong.

When Shaw and Isaac attempted to re-enter the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained them at the border.

“This was a simple administrative error,” said Shaw’s attorney, Minda Thorward. “Anyone could have made it.”

Shaw is in the process of applying for lawful permanent residency and holds what is known as a “combo card,” a temporary immigration document that provides both work authorization and advance parole, which allows international travel and re-entry.

While her work authorization had been approved, her advance parole had not.

“Border Patrol had the discretion to parole her into the U.S.,” Thorward said. “I told her, yes, you don’t have a travel document, but you’ve only been gone about a day. Just explain what happened to the immigration officials.”

Shaw immigrated to the United States three and a half years ago under sponsorship from her then-husband. While divorce often jeopardizes a green card application, she qualified to reapply independently under provisions for survivors of domestic abuse.

She is now being held at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, one of only two facilities in the country that detain families facing deportation.

“Being treated like a criminal has been very embarrassing,” Besancon said. “One of the hardest parts for her has been her job finding out what was going on.”

Shaw works for the Washington State Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) and is a member of union Local 341. She serves at Echo Glen Children’s Center, a juvenile rehabilitation facility in Snoqualmie.

“She’s a civil servant who works with some of the most at-risk youth in our community,” Besancon said. “She handles some of the hardest cases you can imagine.”

Thorward said Shaw remains eligible for a green card and believes that, in previous years, she likely would have been released quickly. But under the current presidential administration, she added, “anything’s possible.”

“With everything this administration has done, they’ve chosen cruelty intentionally — over and over,” she said.

Although Shaw lacked a travel document, her son Isaac had one, according to Thorward.

“There was absolutely no reason for him to be detained. It’s unconscionable,” she said.

Shaw asked Border Patrol agents to allow Besancon, the family friend, to pick up her son, but they refused.

“You never think it’s going to happen to you,” Besancon said. “The main thing Sarah has expressed throughout this ordeal is just absolute shock and devastation. She truly believed she had done everything that was required of her.”

Besancon created a GoFundMe to raise funds to pay her rent and legal representation in both Washington and Texas. According to the campaign, Shaw has depleted her savings while in detainment.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/cbb721a4-aa0c-48f4-be6e-e16506c0aaa9/20250811T014633/cbb721a4-aa0c-48f4-be6e-e16506c0aaa9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-10 22:57:04.793565

Joe Neguse joined a dozen House Democrats on Wednesday in filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over a new policy that limits congressional lawmakers’ access to federal immigration detention centers.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security recently implemented a rule requiring members of Congress to give seven days’ notice before visiting detention centers while limiting access to certain Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices.

The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates a federal law that allows for unannounced inspections of detention centers by Congress. While the Department of Homeland Security can issue guidance on how much notice lawmakers should give, federal law allows for immediate entry.

“Such blatant disregard for both the law and the constitutional order by the Trump administration warrants a serious and decisive response, which is why I’m proud to lead the lawsuit we proceeded with earlier today,” Neguse said in a statement.

Neguse’s office raised concerns about reports of “mistreatment, overcrowding,” and “unsanitary conditions” in detention centers.

Detentions of immigrants have risen sharply since the beginning of Trump’s second term, particularly over the past few months. Data released by ICE in late July shows the agency currently holding nearly 57,000 people, a record.

Data shows that nearly half of detainees — 26,474 people — do not have a criminal conviction or pending criminal charges, but are instead listed as an “other immigration violator.” Nearly 30% of detainees were listed as having a criminal conviction, while the remainder, less than 25%, had a pending criminal charge.

ICE’s most recent report, as of June 26, also shows that 13 people have died in immigration detention this year.

Lawmakers’ lawsuit comes after several Democrats in Congress reported being denied entry to detention facilities.

Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, whose 6th Congressional District includes a detention center in Aurora, said he was denied entry to the facility in July, despite bringing a printout of the law that allows members of Congress to show up unannounced. Crow is among the dozen House Democrats who joined Wednesday’s lawsuit.
