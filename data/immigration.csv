obj - sustained R: anything stopping DHS/ICE from asking Costa Rica whether they'd take Abrego prior to ... /107 ... criminal trial?","Liveblog

At 11am I will try to live-blog, for @lawfaremedia.org , the hearing in Abrego Garcia’s civil (habeas corpus) case in federal court in Greenbelt MD. Abrego is seeking release from detention under a SCOTUS precedent called Zadvydas v Davis (2001). ... /1 tile.loc.gov

Meanwhile, in Abrego’s criminal case, a status conference is due to start at 9am CT/10am ET in Nashville TN over what sort of discovery to provide Abrego in pursuing his motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution. Unfortunately, we can't get someone there today. ... /2

Here in Greenbelt, we do not yet know if we'll hear live testimony or just oral argument. To keep Abrego detained, govt must show that Abrego faces a “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Here’s Judge Xinis’ order convening the hearing: /3

The Zadvydas issue involves these statutes, plus due process principles. Immigration laws (8 USC 1231a1 & a2) say an alien shall be detained for 90 days after his order of removal (“removal period”), & 1236a6 says that period can be extended in some cases. But ... /4

... in Zadvydas, SCOTUS held that there was a rebuttable presumption that the alien should be detained no more than 6 mos. The key is whether govt can show “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future. ... /5

... Abrego’s situation is a bit different. His order of removal was back in 2019 but he was released because he won “withholding of removal.” He was only re-arrested in March 2025. His attys say his 6-mos Zadvydas period” expired in early 2020. ... /6

... They argue basically (1) govt can’t show its really taking steps to remove him in the “reasonably foreseeable future” (in part because they’re keeping him for criminal trial) & (2) it could’ve taken steps to remove him during the 5 years he was free. ... /7

Though Abrego's attys were notified that govt planned to remove him to Eswatini (after 1st saying Uganda), at the last hearing govt attys could not even say whether Eswatini had yet been contacted. Today govt can present evidence of concrete steps its taken or is about to take. ... /8

There have also been recent reports that DHS notified his attys that now he'd be sent to Ghana, but that notice seems to have been rescinded. Doubtless we'll get the most up-to-date info shortly. ... /9 abcnews.go.com abcnews.go.com

DHS says notice about deporting Abrego Garcia to Ghana was 'premature' Looks like DOJ has brought at least one witness today, so we'll likely get testimony. /10

Plaintiffs attorneys at counsel table are Andrew Rossman, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Sascha Rand, Jonathan Cooper, & Olivia Horton. All are from the Quinn Emanuel firm excerpt Sandoval-Moshenberg, who's an immigration specialist who was Abrego's first lawyer after his 2025 arrest. /11

For DOJ I see Bridget O'Hickey (counsel to the Asst AG), Ernesto Molina, Jr. (deputy director of office of immigration litigation), and, I think, 2 others, but I can't yet ID them. /12

I suspect one of the other DOJ attys is Jonathan Guynn, who was here last time and whose name I misspelled then. (Regret the error.) He's a deputy assistant AG. (Molina is a career guy.) /13

Now getting warnings about electronic devices. (I'm in the media room.) /14

All rise. US District Judge Paula Xinis is on the bench. Attys giving appearances. Lead Abrego atty today: Andrew Rossman Lead DOJ: Jonathan Guynn. The DOJ atty I couldn't ID is Drew Ensign. /15

objection--foundation G: do you have experience finding alternate 3d countries to remove aliens? S: [didn't underestand answer] haven't been involved where first 3d country fell through. ICE asks State for assistance. If country A says no, they pivot to B, i don't have visibility on country A /40

G: if court dissolved injunction, how confidetn arew you ICE could remove him to a 3d country in next 2 or 3 weeiks. S: confident we could remove him quickly. within 72 hours. Judge asks counsel to bench again. /41

[Sorry, I dont know what happened with a fairly crucial frame above. But Guynn seemed a little surprised that Schultz could not say that Eswatini would accept Abrego if the injunction was lifted. At Judge had taken over the questioning at that point. Guynn tried to interrupt, but in vain.] /42

An ICE spokesperson sent a statement to FOX 26 denying the claim.

Houston: Missing teen in immigration custody

The backstory:

The teen was reported missing after he was last seen Saturday afternoon near the intersection of Clay Road and Hempstead Road in Spring Branch.

FIEL, an immigrant-led civil rights organization, helped the boy's family put out a call for help during a press conference on Friday.

According to the organization, the teen was selling fruit with his mother and sister on Saturday when he asked to go to the restroom. His mom was reportedly busy tending to a customer at the time, and when she turned back around, he was gone.

After trying to find her son, his mom called Houston police and filed a missing person report.

Hours after the press conference on Friday, Houston Police confirmed with FOX 26 that the teen had been found safe and his family had been contacted.

FOX 26 later learned from FIEL that a law enforcement agency found the teen, and he had been in ICE custody at a Houston-area detention center since Monday. He is reportedly OK.

The family is undocumented. They are working to get him out of custody.

Here's what's changed","Alexandra Villarreal, www.theguardian.com, alexandra-villarreal",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/11/trump-immigration-dreamers-daca,"The Trump administration has once again put Dreamers on a rollercoaster ride.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program.
There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.
Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its mass deportation campaign.","The Trump administration has once again put Dreamers on a rollercoaster ride.

The federal government is sending mixed signals about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a popular program devised under Barack Obama that had until recently allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children to live and work legally without serious risk of deportation.

On one hand, in a new court filing, the federal government suggested it may eventually resume official consideration of initial Daca applications for the first time in years, which could let tens of thousands of people finally have their petitions processed.

On the other, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that immigrants who say they are under the Daca umbrella “are not automatically protected from deportations”, as the program “does not confer any form of legal status in this country”.

Such an approach has been used by Trump officials to justify detaining about 20 known Daca recipients during the new administration so far – despite no White House or DHS memo, regulation or executive order revealing a policy change.

“We started hearing from those detained that when they tell Ice [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents that they have Daca, the Ice agents say: ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter any more’,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant youth organization United We Dream.

Here’s what to know about Daca, the “Dreamers” it protects, and how Donald Trump’s hardline immigrant agenda is upending that protection.

Who are dreamers?

“Dreamers” is a nickname for immigrants brought stateside as children, who do not have legal status. One estimate counts almost 2.5 million Dreamers in the US.

The moniker refers to the Dream Act, proposed legislation that has been deliberated for decades in an attempt to offer Dreamers a pathway to legal immigration status. Lawmakers have introduced at least 20 iterations of the bill, but despite bipartisan support, no version has cleared both chambers of Congress.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program. There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.

Daca recipients’ average age is 31 years old. California and Texas host the largest Daca populations by far, with 147,440 and 87,890 respectively.

In 2023, more than nine out of 10 Daca recipients who were surveyed by national immigrant-focused organizations were either employed or in school. They reported that having Daca protections had made it possible for them to find jobs that paid better, work in fields that reflected their education and long-term career goals, get professional licenses and reach economic independence. The program had also opened the door for some beneficiaries to buy homes and cars.

What is Daca?

The Daca policy debuted on 15 June 2012 to address Dreamers’ need to work legally and be “lawfully present” in the US rather than hide from immigration enforcement and work under the table. To qualify, an applicant must have come to the country before they were 15 years old, have been aged 30 or younger on the date the Obama administration announced the program and have resided in the US since June 2007, among other requirements.

Daca access is barred for anyone convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors.

Although the program has been a lifeline for many undocumented youth, it’s not a legal status or pathway to citizenship, and the antiquated cutoff dates for eligibility have made it so that Dreamers in high school now are less likely to qualify. At the same time, protracted litigation has long paused the processing of initial Daca applications.

“I think it’s really important to understand how tragic it is that young people who are Americans in every sense but lack one piece of paper here not only aren’t getting a pathway to citizenship, but aren’t even getting these very basic and temporary deportation protections and work authorizations,” said Todd Schulte, president of the advocacy group FWD.us.

Why Congress hasn’t done anything to provide more stability for Dreamers is the “billion-dollar question”, said Diana Pliego, senior strategist for campaigns at the National Immigration Law Center – especially, she added, when more than 80% of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for them, and when it’s estimated that providing that would add about $800bn in US gross domestic product growth over a 10-year period.

Where does the program stand now?

Earlier this year, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in practice that Daca and work permit adjudications should restart as normal everywhere except Texas, where officials successfully argued the state was negatively affected by Daca recipients because of education and healthcare costs.

The window has closed for appeals to the US supreme court, at least for the time being. Now, a district court will eventually decide how to implement the fifth circuit’s ruling, and in a recent court filing, the Trump administration outlined its vision for complying, in part through restarting initial adjudications of Daca petitions.

Yet, simultaneously, the Trump administration said those proposals would “not limit DHS from undertaking any future lawful changes to Daca”, and for now, the status quo prevails.

“This administration can do many things. So we’re just worried about creating an expectation or false hope for people with initial applications,” said Macedo do Nascimento.

Trump tried to phase out Daca during his first administration but was ultimately stopped by the supreme court.

What about Dreamers in Texas?

Though they are likely to still receive deportation protections, there’s a risk that Texas Dreamers may lose both their work permits and their “lawful presence” designation, which would affect their economic prospects and could have larger immigration consequences.

Who is being detained?

Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its mass deportation campaign.

Evenezer Cortez Martínez – who came to the US when he was four years old and had a valid Daca permit through October 2026 – was deported to Mexico in March. He was eventually allowed to return to his wife and children in Kansas City, though he said: “I still have that doubt about whether it’s really true that I’m [back] here.”

Similarly, in August, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira was targeted in El Paso, Texas, in front of his children, his arm being dislocated during the chaos, before he was detained in New Mexico. DHS called him a “criminal illegal alien” because of a decade-old charge for marijuana possession as a teenager that was later reduced to disorderly conduct, and that had never stopped the agency from renewing his Daca protections.

Cortez Martínez and Gamez Lira are two of 20 or so known Daca recipients who have been arrested, detained or deported this year.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, has encouraged Daca recipients to consider voluntary deportation.

To Pliego, that would be a loss for the US.

“These are people who have built their lives here, who, you know, have been here since they were young kids,” she said. “This is their home. And so we’re losing longstanding community members who are contributing to the country, who are giving back in a lot of ways.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fbac16aee1df1683a89d7b938ea41016bd34ce/539_0_3708_2967/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dbf1abcf46db58aa4a63e88fa1f5ba4",N,,2025-10-11 12:57:56.023080

We run five of the seven city-contracted day labor centers in Los Angeles, including the Van Nuys Community Job Center.
Our day labor centers are overseen and paid for by the city, and several of our sites are on city-owned or state-owned property.
Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.
Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.","In September, the United States Supreme Court paused a temporary restraining order intended to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from terrorizing Los Angeles with roving patrols, giving ICE the green light to target people because of the color of their skin or the language they speak.

But even while the restraining order was in effect starting in July, ICE never stopped targeting day labor centers in Los Angeles. On August 8, masked men in tactical gear surrounded the Van Nuys Community Job Center, and pointed weapons at my coworkers and me. When I asked to see a warrant, I was met with cold stares and a Border Patrol agent wielding a teargas canister.

I am the executive director of the Instituto de Educación Popular del Sur de California (the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California or IDEPSCA), the largest operator of day labor (jornalero) centers in California. We run five of the seven city-contracted day labor centers in Los Angeles, including the Van Nuys Community Job Center. The City of Los Angeles funds these official day labor centers to provide direct services to day laborers, including know-your-rights trainings, health and immunization clinics, housing support, and language classes, and contracts with nonprofit organizations like IDEPSCA to operate the centers. Our day labor centers are overseen and paid for by the city, and several of our sites are on city-owned or state-owned property.

ICE has raided our day labor sites at least 14 times since June.

Just days before the raid, Mayor Karen Bass hailed a 9th circuit ruling upholding the temporary restraining order against ICE as “a great day for Los Angeles” and said that she hoped fear among immigrant communities in our city would subside.

It didn’t feel like a great day for Los Angeles when we looked down the barrels of guns pointed at us by federal agents in our workplace.

While my coworkers and I were held at gunpoint, I felt fear and rage, but not surprise. This was the 6th time ICE raided the Van Nuys Community Job Center in under three months. Just three hours earlier, my staff witnessed the same Border Patrol agents kidnap seven day laborers from the parking lot in front of the center. Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.

Without the restraining order, things will only get worse. Our entire city is on edge now that ICE is receiving billions more in funding to kidnap and disappear our immigrant neighbors, thanks to congress. ICE’s budget for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1st, is a whopping $18.7 billion.

ICE’s campaign of terror in Los Angeles escalated in June when federal agents in unmarked vehicles stormed the parking lot of the Hollywood Home Depot and surrounding sidewalks, and violently kidnapped 30 day laborers. When people rose up in response to demand ICE vacate the city, they were met with National Guard deployments, ordered by President Donald Trump.

That morning, I started receiving frantic calls from families on the ground, and later, others looking for their loved ones. Many of the people disappeared by ICE were our members. We were able to track down nearly all of those kidnapped — now being held in San Diego detention centers. ICE’s operation was indiscriminate in regard to immigration status: among those kidnapped was a U.S. citizen, later released, and a person with an active asylum case.

These kidnappings were not a one-off horror, but a terrifying new normal driven by the federal government’s white supremacist strategy to erase communities of color. ICE is racially profiling and hunting down people in our streets, making immigrants across our city afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or take their kids to school.

We need political leaders across the nation to act boldly and use the full power of their offices to throw sand in ICE’s gears — introduce legislation, continue to file lawsuits, and call these actions what they are: kidnappings driven by racial profiling. Our city and state leadership must put state resources behind protecting immigrant communities.

Mayor Bass has not been a model of solidarity. In January, she proposed cutting day labor centers completely out of the city’s budget, despite knowing that President Trump specifically named jornaleros as targets and that day laborers were doing dangerous cleanup work during the widely reported on fires that devastated our city. Our funding was only restored because we mobilized and fought back.

The city still isn’t doing enough to protect day labor centers. We call on Mayor Bass and LA elected officials to speak out against ICE’s targeting of day laborers and the worker centers that serve them, and to stand by their promise to protect all Angelenos. It’s time for city and state officials to get creative and use every legal avenue at their disposal.

In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed laws banning ICE from entering schools or hospitals without a warrant.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order banning ICE from operating on any property owned or controlled by the city.

Mayor Bass should follow Governor Newsom and Mayor Johnson’s lead and ban ICE from all city-contracted facilities like our day labor centers.

While we hold our elected leaders to account, we’re not waiting on them to protect and defend our communities. For over 30 years, we’ve built a network of worker and community centers across Los Angeles that builds power and functions as a safety net for our people. Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.

Over the decades, the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California has fought for the dignity and rights of day laborers and domestic workers by providing direct services and mobilizing for campaigns, such as improved minimum wage standards and enforcement, worker safety, and immigrant rights. We’ve raised awareness about the health hazards that day laborers and domestic workers face from wildfires and the frontline role they’ve played in wildfire recovery, and we provide wildfire safety resources as we fight for better protections.

The Institute of Popular Education of Southern California continues to track down workers detained by ICE, bring people their medications, reconnect families, and deliver groceries and other essential aid to impacted communities.

Across Los Angeles, many community members are responding in creative ways — building community defense centers, protesting outside hotels where ICE agents are staying so they can’t sleep, and growing mutual aid networks. But we need more people to be involved.

These raids are not just a threat to undocumented people. Everyone is at risk as this racist and fascist regime uses its power to sow chaos and terrorize our families, friends, and neighbors.

The way we stop them is by growing our community power. If you see unmarked vans or suspect ICE presence, report it to a trusted immigrant rights group. Join or support a local rapid response network. Donate to mutual aid efforts and funds for those in detention. Check in and share resources with your neighbors. Refuse to let kidnapping become normal.

From what we see unfolding in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, it’s clear that Los Angeles was a test site for a larger project of racial terror and ultimately ethnic cleansing. This will continue until we all rise, in all the ways we can, to stop it.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2232619972-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:30.042028

Steve said Friday morning, he talked briefly by phone with his dad, who told him they were being held in the basement of the federal building that houses ICE and immigration court, but they were told they will be moved to the Otay Mesa Detention Center.

When asked why the couple was detained, a spokesperson for ICE said in a statement, “As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

“All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,” the statement continued.

“It's just hard because you just want to hear, like, your parents voice, that everything will be OK,” Ashley said, adding that she was nervous, especially thinking about her pregnancy. “I'd always want, like, my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it's just hard to not think about your parents there.”

Steve and Ashley said they weren’t told why their parents were detained and aren’t sure what will happen next, but they both have faith.

“They might get sent back. They might not,” Steve said. “The only person that knows is up there.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/10/marine-parents-detained.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:57.891042

I’m Al Letson. Tchelly Moise was expecting this call. Ted Genoways:Hey, Tchelly, it’s Ted Genoways. Tchelly Moise:Hey, man, how’s it going? Al Letson:Ted is a reporter with the Food and Environment Reporting Network and he’s been trying to reach Tchelly for almost 24 hours, ever since he heard the news out of the Trump administration. Tchelly Moise:I can tell you honestly this is the first time I feel like this is really happening for real. Al Letson:Tchelly is Haitian and has what’s called temporary protected status or TPS. It gives Tchelly the right to live and work in the US legally because Haiti is considered too dangerous to go back to. But on February 20th, all of that changed. Speaker 4:Now, despite the ongoing violence in their home country, the Trump administration is canceling an extension of temporary protected status for half-a-million Haitians. Al Letson:Haiti has been in turmoil for centuries. It suffered through colonialism, harsh dictators, natural disasters, including a devastating earthquake in 2010 that it never fully recovered from. Food and water is still scarce, and over the last several years more than 15,000 people have been killed in gang violence. It’s led many Haitians to flee the country. Tchelly was one of them. He nearly died after being shot in the chest during a robbery. The situation in Haiti felt dire. Tchelly Moise:I was thinking, “Maybe because they know what is going on in Haiti, it’s logically possible to just cancel TPS for the Haitians.” Al Letson:Tchelly says he doesn’t know anyone who is planning to leave the country, at least not willingly. Tchelly Moise:I don’t think no one is going to get on a plane and say, “Hey, I’m going back home.” I don’t think this is going to happen. I think people are going to try everything but leaving this country unless they get arrested by ICE. Al Letson:Tchelly knows a lot of Haitians. That’s because he’s a union representative for workers at one of the largest meat packing plants in the country. It’s owned by JBS, the largest meat producer in the world. At one point not so long ago, the union says the plant in Greeley employed more than 1200 Haitian migrants, just over a third of the workforce. The company has been accused of trafficking these workers, luring them in with the promise of good jobs and a place to live. Instead, the work was dangerous and the living conditions harsh. Speaker 4:Immigrants at a meat packing plant in Greeley say they were victims of a bait-and-switch scheme. Al Letson:Tchelly says he saw firsthand how people were being treated. It’s why he left JBS and started working at the union that represents the workers, to try and fight back and improve conditions. And they had made some gains, bringing national attention to the situation and forcing the company to respond. But now, after going through all of that, the workers are among the more than 300,000 Haitians who could be forced out of the US. Tchelly Moise:We’re talking about Haitians that have had TPS since 2010. Al Letson:We first told you about these Haitian workers back in February when President Trump had just taken office for his second term. And so much has changed since then that we decided to revisit that episode and update you about what’s happened since. To start, Ted Genoways of the Food and Environment Reporting Network reminds us how these people ended up working at a meat packing plant in the first place. Ted Genoways:It all started with a TikTok video. Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:03:32]. I said good news for good news because I had assurance when you’re coming, you’re going to have a job. Ted Genoways:The man in the video is Mackenson Remy. Mackenson is originally from Haiti. He’s in his 30s with braided hair and a thin beard. He’s been living in the US for almost a decade now and moved to Colorado in 2023. At that time, he began making TikTok videos about job openings in the area for his few followers, mostly other Haitians. None of them got that much attention until this one. The video opens with Mackenson driving through the parking lot of a huge meat packing plant, speaking in his native Creole. There are industrial truck beds, people wearing hard hats and reflective vests, and a giant red and white logo on the side of the building reads “JBS.” Mackenson Remy:That job, they pay good. [foreign language 00:04:28]. They pay like $22 and $23 an hour. Ted Genoways:Meat packing work is hard and Mackenson makes it clear in the video. He tells his followers, “This isn’t a job for lazy people or people who don’t like the cold.” Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:04:50]. Ted Genoways:He adds, “Speaking English is not a job requirement.” If his followers come, Mackenson says he even knows a place for them to stay. So if you’re interested. Mackenson Remy:I say, you can text me, tell me when you want to come because I already know if you came, you can have a job. Ted Genoways:Mackenson posted the video that night and when he woke up the next morning … Mackenson Remy:The video has been viral. Ted Genoways:It had gone viral. Less than a year after posting that video, Tchelly’s union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7, would issue a formal complaint to the government, accusing Mackenson and JBS of human trafficking. I’ve found that to keep its profits high, JBS has a track record of recruiting new immigrants who are desperate for work in the United States. And over the last 20 years, the company has been the subject of more than 100 lawsuits, EEOC complaints, and government investigations over its working conditions. Mackenson says he didn’t know very much about JBS when he made the TikTok video. Everything he shared with his followers, he says he learned from Edmond Ebah. Edmond Ebah:My name is Edmond Ebah. I’m from Benin, West Africa. I work at JBS Plant in Greeley in Colorado. Ted Genoways:This is a promo video of Edmond posted to the JBS Facebook page. Edmond Ebah:There is nothing I can say make my world hard because I’m happy to do what I’m doing. Ted Genoways:Lots of soft focus and slow motion, it cuts from scene to scene. Edmond driving a van, Edmond walking through the plant, Edmond making coffee. Then it ends with Edmond sitting in an office. Edmond Ebah:I applied to HR because I speak seven language and I can help people come to work for JBS. Ted Genoways:The video fades to white, text appears saying, quote, “Edmond has helped more than 30 people find a new life path with JBS USA.” Now, speaking seven languages is never not an asset for any job, but it’s especially useful at JBS because nearly all the people Edmond has hired are immigrants. There are over 3000 employees working at the plant in Greeley and the union representing those employees says between 80 and 90 percent are immigrants. JBS is hardly unique. Nationally, the meat packing industry is overwhelmingly dependent on immigrant labor. But Mackenson didn’t know this. He says he was even a little surprised when he first met Edmond. Mackenson Remy:When I meet him, it’s like I think he’s a white guy. He’s like, “Oh, you look like my people.” He say, “Yeah, I’m from Benin.” I say, “Oh, nice, I’m from Haiti.” Ted Genoways:Mackenson met Edmond the same day he made the video, and Edmond told him they had 60 jobs on the line available. Jobs slaughtering, butchering, and packaging the meat. He’s also the one who told Mackenson about the pay, the benefits, and the fact that workers didn’t need to speak English. Mackenson’s other videos on TikTok got maybe a few dozen views at most. The one he posted about the JBS job had 35,000 views the next day. And the messages started pouring in. This was way more people than expected and there are only 60 positions available. So he texts Edmond. Mackenson Remy:I sent the screenshot for him to show him how many people watched the video. Ted Genoways:But he says Edmond didn’t seem at all phased. He just gave Mackenson a new number of available positions. Mackenson Remy:He said even 100 or 200 people, he can help them out. Ted Genoways:This surprised Mackenson, but it doesn’t surprise me. Turnover in the meat packing industry is incredibly high, an estimated 40% each year. That’s because the work is grueling and extremely dangerous. That’s been the case since the earliest days of industrial meat packing at the turn of the 20th Century. People burn out and are injured all the time. But the Haitians who responded to Mackenson needed work and were enticed by the high pay. Plus, Mackenson had said he could help them find a place to stay, but he’d never expected this kind of response. Mackenson Remy:I just scared because when I see a lot of people text me and I didn’t know where they going to live. Ted Genoways:Soon, he gets a text from Edmond, promising that the new hires will be staying at a motel near the plant for two weeks free of charge. Mackenson Remy:So then after I remember, he called me. He say, “Hey, listen, we got a place for them. Don’t worry, let them come. Let them come.” Ted Genoways:And so they came. Mackenson Remy:Hey, my boss, I’m with the guy. I’m waiting for the other one, I’m at the airport right now. Ted Genoways:This is a voice memo Mackenson sent to Edmond from the Denver airport. It was December 2023, and he was picking up some of the first Haitians to arrive. Mackenson Remy:Boss, you see the last guy I sent it to, this is him ticket, he’s already booked the ticket. Ted Genoways:Edmond directed him to bring everyone to a place called the Rainbow Motel. It sits right off a highway about a mile from the JBS plant. Much like other budget motels, there’s not much to it. Tiny rooms, mismatched furniture, some plastic chairs out front. No pool, but there is a fenced-off square of AstroTurf. And yes, there is a neon rainbow on the roof. There were dozens of Haitians who came to Greeley that first month and Mackenson quickly became their point person for almost everything. Mackenson says he would sometimes stick around Greeley for a few days to drive people, to get anything they needed. Food from Walmart, coats from Goodwill. It was becoming a lot. Mackenson Remy:Boss, this work is hard for me, boss, it’s hard. I have to explain everything with them. Ted Genoways:Here’s another one of those voice memos to Edmond. Mackenson Remy:A lot of people want to come on this job, man. I got people, boy. I told you, I’m an influencer, bro. That’s why they trust me, bro. They really trust me, bro. Ted Genoways:Mackenson says he would charge each person he picked up at the Denver airport $120 to make the two-and-a-half hour trip from Greeley and back. He also charged for the rides to Walmart and Goodwill. But Mackenson said what he really wanted was to be hired by JBS and he asked Edmond to connect him with his boss. Mackenson Remy:He said, “Okay, no problem. Be patient.” When the second group came, I talked to him about the same thing. He told me the same thing, “You have to be patient.” Ted Genoways:Were you being paid by JBS? Mackenson Remy:Nothing. JBS never paid me for anything. Ted Genoways:And still, people kept coming. 100, 200, more. Even though Mackenson was frustrated with Edmond and JBS, he kept telling himself that, at the end of the day, he was doing something good, helping his fellow Haitians find a better life. People like Auguste. That’s not his real name. We’ve given him an alias because he’s worried about retaliation from JBS. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:25] Ted Genoways:Auguste came to the US from Haiti in 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:34]. Ted Genoways:He calls it an epic experience. And by all accounts, it was. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:40]. Ted Genoways:He first flew to Brazil in March 2023 and set off north, traveling across 10 different countries. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:50]. Ted Genoways:The journey included crossing the Darien Gap, a 60-mile expanse of thick rainforest at the Columbia-Panama border. Auguste walked thousands of miles. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:02]. Ted Genoways:He says he slept on the jungle floor, woken up by the sounds of wild animals in the night. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:13]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me he was always on guard because people warned him of armed thieves along the way, who would rob people or worse. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:25]. Ted Genoways:And then of course, there were the dead. Auguste says he saw bodies along the way, of people who would never finish the journey. It took a month, but he finally made it to Mexico, where Auguste immediately applied to enter the US legally via temporary protected status, TPS for short. It’s a rigorous process. He was fingerprinted as part of a background check, his cheek was swabbed for medical screening. Finally, his application was approved. Auguste entered the US in the spring of 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:10]. Ted Genoways:Today, there are more than 200,000 Haitians in the US under TPS, making them one of the largest groups with that status. Auguste spent six months waiting for work authorization, often going hungry. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:28]. Ted Genoways:But Auguste tells me it’s easier to live without food than it is without hope. Then he heard about Mackenson’s video. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:41]. Ted Genoways:He was living in Baltimore and struggling to find work. A friend of his already moved to Greeley and got hired by JBS. He told Auguste the job was legit, so Auguste decided to go, too. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:55]. Ted Genoways:When he arrived in Colorado, he was taken straight to the Rainbow Motel. The room was pretty small, just big enough to walk around a full sized bed, one bathroom, no closet, a mini fridge. And to his surprise, Auguste learned he would be sharing this room. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:17]. Ted Genoways:He tells me there were five, six, seven, sometimes eight people in one room. Auguste was sleeping on the floor. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:29]. Ted Genoways:He tells me it was hard to live this way. When was that? Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:39]. Tchelly Moise:December 2023. Ted Genoways:That’s Tchelly, translating for Auguste. We’re sitting together in an office at the union. Tchelly never lived at the Rainbow Motel, but he saw what was happening there. Tchelly Moise:Well, me, I was I would say not a victim of the process, but I was a direct witness to the process. Ted Genoways:It’s part of the reason he left his job at JBS and went to work for the union instead. Tchelly Moise:This is extremely bad. When you go to the Rainbow Motel and you have eight people inside of one little motel room with one bed, one bathroom, women and men at the same time, so no privacy. When people have to use the bathroom, it was a very bad situation. Ted Genoways:There was also nowhere to make food. The motel was off a busy highway with no grocery stores, no restaurants, nothing around for miles. Tchelly Moise:We’ve had people saying, “I was starving for two to three days because I don’t know where to go get food.” Ted Genoways:The people brought to live in the Rainbow Motel were in a strange place with little to no money, many didn’t speak English. Plus, it was December and freezing outside. Tchelly says people felt stranded. The motel has 17 rooms, and at the peak Mackenson counted over 100 Haitians staying there at once. It got so packed at one point, that Tchelly says Edmond was forced to rent a house nearby. The conditions there weren’t any better. Tchelly Moise:There were around 40 people living inside of the house. I’m saying people sleeping on the floor, on the blankets, people everywhere. And at some point, they didn’t have electricity in the house and it was winter. Ted Genoways:Auguste was one of the people living there. After a week-and-a-half in the motel, he spent five months in this unfurnished house. The people living there were charged $60 to $70 a week. Auguste:[foreign language 00:17:42]. Ted Genoways:But he says at least in the house, they had a kitchen. There may be a line of people waiting to use it, but at least it was there. Meanwhile, Auguste and his housemates were still expected to go to work. These jobs are essentially like working on a disassembly line, like a standard factory run in reverse. The whole cow walks off the back of a cattle trailer and is slaughtered, then broken down into steaks, and roasts, and ribs, and hamburger meat. This work is done with things like power knives and bone saws, tools meant to cut flesh and bone. It’s no surprise that this can lead to injuries. I’ve talked to dozens of people over my career who have lost fingers or had hands crushed by grinders. I remember one man who was a gut snatcher, which is exactly what it sounds like. The gut snatcher pulls all the guts out of the animal, while the spine splitter cuts through the vertebrae with a bone saw. But this time, they got out of sync. The spine splitter went too soon and the gut snatcher lost four of his fingers. Stories like these are common across the industry. According to data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, jobs at meat packing and poultry companies are consistently among the most dangerous. Workers at JBS and their union say the speed of the line makes serious injuries like amputation more commonplace. But the profits that companies like JBS make depend on how much meat they remove and how fast. Around the same time this new crop of Haitian workers was hired, JBS had introduced its aptly named White Bone Program. Kim Cordova:This is a program where what the company is trying to do is get as much of the meat and product off of a bone it’s literally like white bone. Ted Genoways:This is Kim Cordova, president of UFCW 7, the Greeley plant union. She says the white bone program meant more cutting, more repetition, more exertion, and all at a dizzying speed. Kim Cordova:The line speeds were really increasing to line speeds we had never seen before. Ted Genoways:Almost all of the Haitian workers were put on the same evening shift from about 2:00 to 11:00 PM, B shift. Tchelly says B shift had faster speeds than the day shift. Tchelly Moise:Way faster. We have people that have been working at the plant for 10, 15 years and they can tell us they have never seen any chain speed going over 390. Ted Genoways:That’s 390 head of cattle per hour. Typically, workers on the day shift rarely saw speeds above 300 per hour. Tchelly Moise:But right now, you’re having 420. At some point, we had 430. Ted Genoways:That’s roughly 35,000 cows a week. Kim Cordova:Workers are really put at risk for their safety because it is so fast. Ted Genoways:Kim says people were getting injured. Union members were going to JBS management almost every day, telling them to slow things down because this wasn’t safe. Tchelly Moise:Sometimes, we went from 420 to 410, which is still unacceptable. Ted Genoways:And it wasn’t just the chain speed. Kim Cordova:This new group of workers were being forced to sign documents in languages that they don’t speak, in English actually, that waived their rights or abandoned their injury claims. Ted Genoways:Workers’ medical cards were being kept from them. Kim Cordova:Medical bills not being paid. Ted Genoways:Workers’ mail was being withheld. Kim Cordova:The supervisor had total control of their US mail. Ted Genoways:Haitians were being treated differently than other workers. Tchelly Moise:If I asked for a break to go to the bathroom, I would not get it. Ted Genoways:Meanwhile, Auguste and his fellow Haitians would go back to a so-called home with little to no food, a line for the bathroom, and only the floor to sleep on. Auguste:[foreign language 00:21:53]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me every day at work, he couldn’t help but notice … Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:01]. Ted Genoways:… that each cow had its own little cage. Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:08]. Ted Genoways:But he was expected to share a tiny space with five, six, seven, eight of his coworkers. It was darkly ironic, but he found himself thinking the cows had it better. What does that make you think as you see that the cows are treated better than the workers? Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:42]. Tchelly Moise:He say, “It even make think about the past. I feel like I was being treated as a slave.” If we need to take a break, we can. Al Letson:Coming up, JBS is forced to respond. Ted Genoways:They told the union that they had never heard the name Mackenson, that they didn’t believe that there was such a person. Mackenson Remy:They lie. They lie. Al Letson:That’s up next on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. In September 2024, JBS made national news. The Wall Street Journal published a story about a new wave of Haitian workers at JBS and the terrible living conditions they found in Greeley, Colorado. The headline read, “Life for Haitian immigrants, jobs nobody wants and sleeping on the floor.” Mackenson Remy was featured heavily throughout, alongside allegations of exploitation from the very Haitians he thought he was helping. Mackenson Remy:Those Haitian, most of them, they hate me. They think I made money from them. Al Letson:Some workers alleged that Mackenson was working for JBS and getting paid for how many people he brought to Greeley. Mackenson Remy:Some of them, they said JBS give me $3,000 for each of them, each of them. Al Letson:Mackenson denies all of this. Mackenson Remy:I charge people to take them at the airport and I charge people if they need services. I didn’t charge anyone for job. No, I’m not a criminal. Al Letson:Mackenson says he was following directions from Edmond Ebah, the HR supervisor with JBS. Edmond was the one who told him to bring people to the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson doesn’t deny knowing how many people were packed in each room, but he says he never heard anyone complain, at least not to him. But dozens of complaints were made to the UFCW 7, the union representing the JBS plant in Greeley. And now, Mackenson’s name was in the news, alongside all those allegations. Mackenson Remy:I just like doing that for my people. I didn’t get money from anyone. When they see me, they talk very badly about me. It’s very stressful for me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, has been covering the meatpacking industry for over a decade. In that time, he’s watched JBS get sued again and again for allegations of workplace discrimination, wage suppression, and unfair hiring practices. All the while, JBS continues to grow dramatically. The company made $77 billion in 2024. Here’s Ted again. Ted Genoways:The union had raised concerns to JBS about the squalid living conditions long before the Wall Street Journal article came out. JBS had told the UFCW 7 that it was investigating, but the union didn’t hear anything for months. But now, with these allegations made public, JBS was forced to respond. So I’m sure you know, JBS claims that they had no knowledge of this system. TChelly Moise:Well, I’ve seen- Ted Genoways:This is TChelly Moise again, the union rep with UFCW 7. TChelly Moise:… the spokesperson from JBS that said, “Any allegations are completely unacceptable.” This is the exact word that I think I’ve seen online. Ted Genoways:Here are the exact words that a spokeswoman for JBS sent in an email to the Wall Street Journal. She said the company found, “Reports about living conditions, unacceptable and alarming.” TChelly Moise:What exactly is unacceptable? Is it the allegations or the actual situation that was going on? Ted Genoways:In that same email to the Wall Street Journal, JBS says it wants all of its employees to have access to safe housing. The company fired the two HR managers above Edmond. And Edmond was moved to a different facility. The company says it also put in new training programs to teach employees about proper recruitment. JBS maintains that their leadership didn’t know what was happening at the Rainbow Motel, something TChelly finds really hard to believe. TChelly Moise:It is really hard for anyone from JBS to deny what was happening when they had someone from that plant supervising those people every day, assigning them room and filling an application for them. It’s really hard for you to deny when you’re directly involved like that. Ted Genoways:I’ve seen the texts to Mackenson that prove at least Edmond knew. Mackenson Remy:If JBS said they didn’t know anything about the motel, they lie. I got the text message from Edmond. Ted Genoways:Edmond asked Mackenson, who was being checked into the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson replied with five, six names to a room. At one point in January 2024, Mackenson sent a list of nearly 50 people staying in nine rooms. But after the Wall Street Journal article came out, Edmond abruptly cut ties with Mackenson. I tried to reach Edmond many times, even dropping by his house. Marianne:Edmond? Ted Genoways:I’m Ted Genovese. This is my wife, Marianne. We were just hoping to talk to you for a few minutes if you’ve got time. Edmon Ebah:I get your text message. I’m going to respond to you. Trust me, we will have a conversation. Ted Genoways:He never got back to me, and instead, directed me to a company spokesperson. JBS did eventually send me a short email, in response to the many questions I sent them from my reporting. Their statement repeats much of what they sent the journal. They want all employees to have access to safe housing. They’ve hired new HR leaders and put in place new recruitment training programs. The company says they’ve taken the situation very seriously, but ultimately, deny any involvement. JBS says it conducted two separate investigations and, “No substantiated evidence was provided that tied Edmond Ebah or company leadership to the claims outlined by the union.” They did not respond to the fact that I’ve seen the text messages and phone calls between Edmond and Mackenson. JBS just underscored that Mackenson never worked for the company. And after the “alarming allegations came out,” they say they banned him from the plant. In response to the reports of dangerously fast line speeds, JBS simply said it follows the law. The email ends with, “At JBS, we have best in class workforce eligibility, safety and compliance standards.” But the union is still demanding answers. Here’s Kim Cordova again, president of the UFCW 7. Kim Cordova:We have been dealing with what we believe is human trafficking and exploitation of these workers. Ted Genoways:In 2024, the union filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, and the National Labor Relations Board alleging exactly that. Kim says, “These Haitian migrants at JBS were brought here under false pretenses. They were promised a job and a place to stay, but the job wasn’t just hard, it was unsafe. And this wasn’t proper housing. They were sleeping on the floor of a tiny motel room with a bunch of strangers sharing one bathroom and little to no food.” The complaint calls this abuse of workers and it says that JBS’s investigations into this treatment were, “a whitewash.” And Kim believes she knows how we got here. Kim Cordova:I mean, the one thing COVID did was shed the light on what I call the dark secret of the packing industry. It exposed everything. Ted Genoways:Back during the pandemic, US meat workers were considered essential. After meatpacking plants across the country were forced to close, then President Trump, ordered them to reopen. And so even though the JBS plant in Greeley didn’t have COVID safety protocols in place, it brought workers back to the line. OSHA fined JBS for, “Failing to protect employees from exposure to the coronavirus.” If you watched Last Week Tonight, you probably heard John Oliver talk about it back then. John Oliver:After six workers from a JBS plant in Colorado died from COVID, the company’s total fine was just $15,000. Ted Genoways:But $15,000 was just .00003% of the company’s revenue at the time. John Oliver:And if you find a company, a fraction of a percent of their profits, don’t be surprised when they carry on only giving a fraction of a (beep) about the welfare of their workers. Ted Genoways:Kim says this started a huge fight between the company and its workers. Kim Cordova:We started to see workers mobilize, stand up, fight back. There were walk-offs not just here, but around the country. Workers were not going to die for their job. Ted Genoways:This not only led to more personal protective equipment, it also led to a new contract. The union had pressed the CEO for higher wages and better benefits and won. Kim Cordova:And workers got stronger, in my opinion, and I think that that’s what has sparked some of the change. Ted Genoways:Kim says shortly after they renegotiated that contract with the CEO, he retired and was replaced. Then came a wave of firings among union workers. Then came the white bone program and hundreds of brand new Haitian workers. The UFCW 7 complaint to the Department of Labor says, “The plant increased chain speeds to dangerously unsafe levels when these workers occupied the line.” Kim Cordova:In our opinion, they needed a new group of workers to come in, so that they had more control over them, especially to work at this high speed. Ted Genoways:TChelly says, he thinks the company just saw an opportunity and took it. TChelly Moise:Big companies like that, one of the first goal is to make money. And unfortunately, most of the time, it doesn’t matter how this money is made, it doesn’t matter what cost. Ted Genoways:August still works at JBS. After about six months, he was able to save enough money to move into his own place with his own bed and bathroom, but it all comes with a cost. As far as we know, the white bone program is still going on. August:[foreign language 00:10:30] Ted Genoways:And August told me he can no longer fully close his left hand, an injury he believes as a result of his work being too fast and too repetitive. Despite everything though, August says he is still glad to be here. August:Yeah. [foreign language 00:10:51] Ted Genoways:Because his life is stable now and he just hopes things continue to get better. Then came the second Trump administration. Donald Trump:We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger than- Ted Genoways:On the campaign trail, Trump promised to deport an unprecedented 15 to 20 million people and said, he would direct federal agencies to go after undocumented immigrants. But he also promised to go after immigrants here legally by ending programs like temporary protected status. Reporter:So you would revoke the temporary protected status? Donald Trump:Absolutely, I’d revoke it, and I’d bring them back to their country. TChelly Moise:Going back to Haiti is a death sentence really. Ted Genoways:TChelly Moise again. TChelly Moise:The biggest issue is not the deportation itself. The biggest issue is what is going to happen after the deportation. Because most of us, not to say all of us, we left the country obviously, because it was very bad in… You’re talking to some members at the plant, and they’re telling you, “Man, my cousin just got killed today and my family members, they just burned some house.” So it’s getting worse every day. You really don’t know where it’s going to get. It’s really bad. Ted Genoways:The New York Times has been tracking deportations and it’s found that the Trump administration is on pace to deport more than 400,000 people this year. While that’s far less than Trump’s campaign trail promise, the government’s tactics are disrupting communities across the country and a lot of what’s happening is unprecedented. There have been aggressive immigration raids in the recent past, but they usually focused on workplaces like meatpacking plants. Newscaster:Federal officials said today, that yesterday’s immigration raids at six meatpacking plants were the largest workplace crackdown ever. Ted Genoways:In May of 2006, then President George W. Bush, addressed the nation with promises of a new immigration policy. Part of that policy was to find and deport undocumented workers. And on December 12th of that year, he made good on that promise. Immigration and customs enforcement carried out a coordinated raid of meatpacking plants across the middle of the country. They were all run by Swift & Company, the world’s second largest beef producer at the time. Armed ICE officers arrested and deported nearly 1,300 undocumented workers at these plants. Here’s Mark Lauritsen, then vice president of the UFCW, speaking with PBS at the time. Mark Lauritsen:That one small community, the school district still held 25 children, some as young as six years old, because their parents were not around to pick them up. They were in a bus some place to points unknown. Ted Genoways:The Swift plants were located all across the country, places like Cactus, Texas, Grand Island, Nebraska, Marshalltown, Iowa, and Greeley, Colorado. In the Greeley plant alone, 220 undocumented workers were detained. After the raid, production came to a screeching halt. And though they were able to get things moving again, it was never back at the level it was before the raids. Within a year, Swift was forced to shut down and sell the plant. The buyer, JBS. And now you have to wonder, will JBS and the thousands of immigrants it employs meet a similar fate? Kim Cordova:This workforce is an immigrant workforce. Ted Genoways:Union president, Kim Cordova again. She says at one point, there were 57 languages spoken at the Greeley plant alone. Kim Cordova:JBS is the largest food producer in the world. The industry would collapse without these type of workers. Ted Genoways:The Trump campaign promised it would lower grocery prices, but deporting the workforce that meatpackers depend on would halt processing at every stage of the supply chain, from feed lots, to the packing house floor. This would drive up prices for Big Macs and Outback steaks, but also for chicken breasts and pork chops at grocery stores. TChelly says, “That’s why deporting all these people doesn’t make any sense.” TChelly Moise:I feel like us, the immigrants, we are a good part of the economy. Like I said, most of the jobs that we’re doing, people who are born in this country are not in line to do those jobs. They’re not actively looking to do those jobs. Ted Genoways:This is why TChelly says he’s confused. If mass deportations hurt not only JBS, but the economy as a whole, why do it? He says he’s left with only one answer. TChelly Moise:I think it’s just hatred against people with different skin color, because that’s the only logical thing that I can actually see. Deporting everyone, I don’t see how it can benefits honestly. I don’t see. Al Letson:Up next, we fast-forward to the present day to see how ending TPS is impacting TChelly and the other workers. TChelly Moise:I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:That’s coming up on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today, we’re returning to a story we first brought you in February, back when President Trump was weeks away from fulfilling a promise to not just go after undocumented immigrants, but to also target people living in the country legally. Speaker 2:A really scary time for the Haitian community as the federal government has set a deadline for deportation. The pressure is now on find answers and do them fast. Al Letson:Haitians with temporary protected status were told to leave the U.S. by August 3rd. But a federal judge intervened and extended that deadline to February 2026. This is the second time the Trump administration has attempted to end TPS for Haitians. During Trump’s first term, the White House claimed Haiti was once again safe and people could return. Several groups sued, arguing that Haitians were being racially targeted, and TPS remained in place. This time around, the administration says it’s ending TPS because Haitian gangs could be using the program to enter the US and threaten our national security. Only, the Department of Homeland Security has offered no proof this is happening. And once again, several groups are suing the government to keep TPS in place. Shelly says all of this is frustrating because not only are people like him not in gangs, they came here to get away from the gangs. Shelly:We are not really criminals. I mean, a lot of us in this country, we’ve never really had not even a speeding ticket. I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways of the Food & Environment Reporting Network has been keeping up with the Haitian workers at JBS, and he’s joining me now to update us on where things stand. Welcome back, Ted. Ted Genoways:Thanks, Al. Al Letson:Okay. So, first things first. What’s happening with the workers at the plant in Greeley, Colorado? Do they still have their jobs? Ted Genoways:So, Shelly was telling us that since February JBS has fired somewhere between 300 and 400 workers at the plant in Greeley. The Union says that’s about a third of the Haitians hired in the last year or so. Shelly:The company called them in, and they let them know that unfortunately we have to stop working. Ted Genoways:The Union says the workers were given 30 days to give the company documentation that proves they could continue to legally work in the U.S. Al Letson:But wait. If TPS doesn’t expire until February, how is the company able to fire all these people already? Ted Genoways:Well, when you’re working on TPS or other immigration programs, you’re given the right to apply for a work permit. Then once you get the permit, you have to keep renewing it. And some of these workers had let their permits expire. In the past, the company probably wouldn’t have been as aggressive about enforcing that paperwork, but because the Trump administration has put Haitian workers under scrutiny, companies like JBS are being more vigilant and asking more questions. It usually goes something like this. Bryce Downer:HR reaches out to me to say, “Hey, listen, we’re covering our [inaudible 00:03:32] here.” Ted Genoways:This is Bryce Downer. Bryce Downer:“You’re going to have to provide us with evidence of your authorization to be able to be employed, otherwise, you’ll have to be terminated.” Ted Genoways:Bryce is an immigration lawyer with Novo Legal, and has been working on cases for these workers. In theory, he says, an employer could allow time for these employees to figure out their work status, but the company risks being hit with penalties. And Bryce says companies like JBS simply aren’t willing to do that. Bryce Downer:It is a very difficult time right now for immigration attorneys that are counseling these employers, because generally speaking they’re incredibly conservative. Zero liability, zero risk. Al Letson:But I mean, losing 400 workers in just a few months, still seems like a big problem, right? I mean, isn’t that impacting production? Ted Genoways:Yeah. I actually asked JBS about the number of Haitian workers that were fired. And they said they don’t track workers based on national origin. But in a written statement, a spokesperson said that the company is focused on hiring people legally authorized to work in the United States and would continue to follow the guidance provided by the government. As for the workers that were fired, JBS said that if people can prove their status has changed, they would be eligible to be hired. And the company said, “At this point in time, our facilities are operating normally and our production levels remain unchanged.” When I read that last line to Shelly, he didn’t argue with it. Shelly:I would say that this is exactly right, because before they let someone go, there’s already someone there to replace them. So production is not really affected. Ted Genoways:According to the Union, JBS has mostly been replacing Haitian workers with Somali workers, another immigrant population whose TPS is still active, at least for now. Bryce says The industry has always turned immigrant populations because, for the most part, Americans are just not willing to take these jobs. Bryce Downer:And so who’s the next most vulnerable community in line? Ted Genoways:Basically, JBS has been jumping from one immigrant group to another for years. And as we heard in our original story, the way the company treats these workers has been under a lot of scrutiny and complaints over unsafe working conditions that the plant continue. Al Letson:Well, yeah, let’s talk about that. What happened with the complaint Shelly’s Union filed, the one accusing JBS and McKesson of human trafficking? Ted Genoways:Right. So the National Labor Relations Board is the government body that was supposed to be investigating this complaint. But in January, right after taking office, Trump fired two members of the board, leaving them without a working quorum, effectively killing any investigations. He finally announced new appointees just recently, but they haven’t been confirmed yet. So, even if the nominees are appointed, it’s possible that the Haitians in Greeley could be scheduled for deportation before any investigation can even be completed. For its part, JBS has continued to insist that it thoroughly investigated and found no evidence that showed its employees were involved in trafficking Haitian workers. Al Letson:So Ted, oftentimes these companies justify using immigrant labor like this as a way to keep grocery prices low. It’s something that President Trump even promised to do when he was on the campaign trail. So, I can’t help but to wonder what this all means for the price of meat. Ted Genoways:Right. So, the price of beef has increased 14% since August of last year. It’s such a steep increase the consumers are actually starting to cut back on buying beef, which historically just never happens. At the same time, JBS, along with three other companies, are being sued for allegedly manipulating the market. The claim is that big beef packers like JBS have a monopoly on beef and are artificially inflating prices. I think this underscores just how big and powerful JBS really is. Al Letson:And I guess when you’re this big, it’s pretty easy to fire a few hundred Haitians just like that. Ted Genoways:Yeah, just like that. But Al, that hasn’t been the story for everyone. August and Shelly are both still working in Greeley, and it looks like they will be able to continue for the foreseeable future. Al Letson:How so? Ted Genoways:U.S. immigration law is confusing, always. And it’s especially confusing right now. But when your livelihood depends on it, you get pretty savvy pretty fast. August and Shelly got new work permits, but those will expire in February, when TPS is supposed to end for Haitians. So they also did something else. They applied for asylum, which means that even if TPS gets rescinded, they may still be able to stay in the U.S. as they wait for their asylum cases to be decided. It’s a bit of a gamble, because the Trump administration has been trying to limit the rights of asylum seekers. But in theory, it’s another shot at a green card, and even citizenship. Now, there are so many Haitians who don’t have that kind of second chance. Shelly has spoken to many of them. And he says some tell him they will try to go to Canada, but most of them plan to just lay low and wait for another job, another court ruling, or even another president. Shelly:I can only wait, and I can only hope things get better. We hope something better comes. Al Letson:It’s such a tough situation.

“Right-leaning parties tend to talk tough on immigration so that they keep the nationalist factions within their parties happy, but then quietly they act open towards migration,” Professor Gamlen said.

“They need to keep businesses happy by keeping labour flowing. So that’s kind of the classic right-leaning party’s strategy on migration for the last several decades.

“And then conversely on the left-wing side, we see the opposite kind of doublespeak in many places where left-leaning parties speak very positively about migration-driven diversity, and sort of claim to be the representatives of diversity to satisfy the liberal intelligentsia who favour human rights and migration.“But then at the same time, what left-leaning parties do is keep unions happy with strong labour market regulations which tend to cut migration levels, tend to make it harder to migrate.”

Looking at the figures

ANU has broken down the data finding the Coalition has generally expanded temporary migration.

The Liberal and National Governments tied universities to international student fees, created the 457 visa, expanded post-study work rights, and signed nearly 70 per cent of Australia’s working holiday migration agreements.

Labor has often tightened immigration policy. They raised financial, compliance, and labour standards on students and skilled workers, and introduced stricter integrity measures on colleges, savings, English language tests, and visa hopping.

Pressure to cut immigration rate

Annual net overseas migration peaked at 555,000 when borders reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic under the Albanese Government.

But have since dropped by 40 per cent.

However, there is political and public pressure on Labor to cut further.

Guardian Essential polling shows 53 percent of Australians think the current permanent migration cap for 2025-2026 of 185,000 is too high.

Populist parties are rising around the globe including the Republicans under Donald Trump and Reform UK under Nigel Farage.

The latest Newspoll has Pauline Hanson’s One Nation on an 11 per cent primary vote.

But Gamlen doesn’t believe a populist anti-immigration party will takeover in Australia.

“Although we often compare ourselves with them, the US and the UK are really very different from Australia,” Gamlen said.

“One of the big differences is that they have functionally open borders in a way that Australia does not and never has had.

“It’s partly about being an island nation, but it’s partly just about the fact that we’ve got this actually finely tuned and well-oiled machine in government and across many of our democratic institutions that is geared towards managing immigration because it’s such an important part of Australia’s modern story.”

‘Establish an immigration department’

Gamlen’s key advice to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is to re-establish an independent Immigration Department that handles visa compliance, and an independent research bureau on migration.

“There should be a restoration of the concentrated policy expertise in migration in one part of government in one properly empowered agency,” Gamlen said.

“You know if they do those two things and get the facts, set a basis for you know a common set of facts that we can all discuss a debate, that are reliable that will improve the quality of the debate, then that will lead into a better deliberation in our parliament.”",https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-20315336/33d617b45c8fc6d05b0b67c258a7f354de469b1b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.png?imwidth=1200,N,,2025-10-11 08:56:33.918075

Community members lined the sidewalks outside neighborhood schools Friday afternoon in Lincoln Square, part of a rapid response mobilization following word of ICE activity in the area.

Federal agents reportedly detained two people, including an employee of WGN-TV, Friday morning at the busy intersection of Lincoln and Foster avenues.

The TV station said in a statement that it is “actively gathering the facts” related to the “evolving situation.” The employee involved is not a member of the news department, WGN added.

Ald. Matt Martin (47th Ward) notified his constituents via social media that ICE agents were in the area and encouraged them to help their neighbors: “Many of the locations ICE agents have been spotted at are schools — both public and private. If you’re able, please consider supporting safe pick ups at the school closest to you.”

Erin Tobes and Audra Wunder had already formed a mutual aid team for Chappell Elementary — located just blocks from where the incident occurred in the morning — and were able to muster a sizable group by the time students were dismissed from classes Friday. Adults were posted all along the school’s perimeter.

“People are dropping everything,” said Tobes. “We’re hoping ICE will see all these bodies, us showing up as a community.”

Similar groups have popped up at other schools, including nearby McPherson and Ravenswood elementary schools, and organizers are sharing resources and tactics, Wunder said.

“We’re all starting this out of necessity,” she said.

The response teams are equipped with whistles to warn of the presence of ICE agents, and groups like the one at Chappell are also helping families within the school’s community who might need rides to work or other assistance out of fear of detainment.

Though neighborhoods such as Pilsen and Little Village may have larger Latino populations, schools in Lincoln Square enroll anywhere from 25% to 42% Latino students.

In addition to providing safe passage for students and parents at pick-up and drop-off, Tobes said she hoped the community’s presence would deter any action by agents that could traumatize children.

“We want to maintain the safety and innocence of all the kids,” she said.

Silvia Hernandez, who was among the parents safeguarding Chappell and adjacent Amundsen High School, said her 8-year-old daughter isn’t so much scared as she is upset, and even spent last night making a video calling on people to just get along.

All the women agreed that while it was heartwarming to see the community sticking together and standing up for neighbors, the need to do so in the first place was heartbreaking.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.","More than three dozen federal judges have told The New York Times that the Supreme Court’s flurry of brief, opaque emergency orders in cases related to the Trump administration have left them confused about how to proceed in those matters and are hurting the judiciary’s image with the public.

At issue are the quick-turn orders the Supreme Court has issued dictating whether Trump administration policies should be left in place while they are litigated through the lower courts. That emergency docket, a growing part of the Supreme Court’s work in recent years, has taken on greater importance amid the flood of litigation challenging President Trump’s efforts to expand executive power.

While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical affects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending.

The striking and highly unusual critique of the nation’s highest court from lower court judges reveals the degree to which litigation over Mr. Trump’s agenda has created strains in the federal judicial system.

Sixty-five judges responded to a Times questionnaire sent to hundreds of federal judges across the country. Of those, 47 said the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Mr. Trump returned to office.

The judges responded to the questionnaire and spoke in interviews on the condition of anonymity so they could share their views candidly, as lower court judges are governed by a complex set of rules that include limitations on their public statements.

Of the judges who responded, 28 were nominated by Republican presidents, including 10 by Mr. Trump; 37 were nominated by Democrats. While those nominated by Democrats were more critical of the Supreme Court, judges nominated by presidents of both parties expressed concerns.

In interviews, federal judges called the Supreme Court’s emergency orders “mystical,” “overly blunt,” “incredibly demoralizing and troubling” and “a slap in the face to the district courts.” One judge compared their district’s current relationship with the Supreme Court to “a war zone.” Another said the courts were in the midst of a “judicial crisis.”

The responses to The Times serve as the most comprehensive picture to date about the extraordinary tensions within the judiciary, hints of which have begun to spill out publicly.

At a hearing in September, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said his court was “out here flailing” as it tried to apply vague emergency rulings from the Supreme Court that left judges “in limbo.” Ruling on a different case, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts noted that the emergency orders “have not been models of clarity.”

The Supreme Court has so far issued emergency orders in about 20 cases involving the Trump administration’s policies. In at least seven of those orders, the majority offered no reasoning for its decision.

At public events, some Supreme Court justices have defended their use of the emergency docket as a legitimate response to the increase in swift presidential policy-making by executive order, as opposed to legislation passed through Congress. Offering extensive reasoning or explanation, they argued, would risk locking the court into a position that might not turn out to be its final view.

A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment.

The Times reached out to more than 400 judges, including every judge in districts that have handled at least one legal challenge to a major piece of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Most of those who declined to participate did not give a reason. Others said they did not think it was their place to judge the work of the Supreme Court.

The judges who responded may not represent the views of the entire judiciary, but to have even several dozen judges out of the nation’s more than 1,000 district, appellate and senior judges express such concern about the Supreme Court’s behavior is highly unusual.

Forty-two judges went so far as to say that the Supreme Court’s emergency orders had caused “some” or “major” harm to the public’s perception of the judiciary. Among those who responded to the question, nearly half of the Republican-nominated judges said they believed the orders had harmed the judiciary’s standing in the public eye.

Twelve judges who responded to the questionnaire said they believed the Supreme Court had handled its emergency docket appropriately. But only two said public perception of judges had improved as a result of how the Supreme Court had handled its recent work.

The code of conduct for federal judges requires them to act in ways that promote “public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” They seldom comment on public controversies and almost never share their views of Supreme Court jurisprudence, outside of the carefully chosen words of their written opinions.

Judge Luttig is a critic of the Trump administration’s interpretation of the Constitution who is in frequent contact with sitting judges from across the political spectrum. He said he believed the views expressed to The Times were broadly representative of the lower courts as a whole.

“I can’t think of words to capture the significance that federal judges themselves have to speak out,” he said, “because the Supreme Court has given them no choice but to speak out.”

‘An Atmosphere of Disrespect’

The emergency docket is known to its critics as the shadow docket, and its rise as a flashpoint for tensions in the judiciary coincides with the Supreme Court’s increasing use of it in ways that have benefited Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Time and time again, district court judges have imposed blocks on expansive policies issued by Mr. Trump’s administration, rulings that have been upheld by the appeals courts, only to have the Supreme Court remove them with an emergency order. Mr. Trump has benefited from nearly all of the Supreme Court’s rulings on emergency applications since his return to office.

For now, his administration can withhold some forms of congressionally appropriated funds, send undocumented immigrants to dangerous places such as South Sudan and use race as a criterion in making immigration stops, all because of emergency orders.

Some of the judges who responded to the Times questionnaire expressed concerns with the substance of the Supreme Court’s orders, fearing critics would see partisanship in the justices’ consistent siding with the president over lower court judges. Similar views have been aired in dissents from the Supreme Court’s liberal wing, which have called pro-Trump rulings by the majority “misguided,” “dangerous” and an “existential threat to the rule of law.”

For Mr. Trump’s allies, lower court judges are the ones who exceeded their authority in blocking presidential actions, interfering with what they claim is a popular mandate. That view was shared by one judge, a Trump appointee, who praised the Supreme Court for “flushing out anti-democratic rulings” with its emergency orders.

The main complaint voiced by a majority of the judges was not where the Supreme Court was coming down, but how it was doing so. By presenting its emergency orders in just a few sentences, with little or no reasoning, judges said the Supreme Court was leaving them without a clear path to assess what the justices were thinking.

The result, one judge said, was that the court was expecting their district court colleagues “to read their minds about what their view of the law is.”

Despite the justices’ brevity and lack of reasoning, the Supreme Court has become more insistent that its emergency orders are supposed to serve as guideposts for the lower courts. In an unsigned emergency order from July, the Supreme Court noted that while emergency orders were “not conclusive,” district court judges should still consider them in “like cases.”

Some justices have gone further, using their opinions to publicly admonish judges who, in their view, are failing to correctly apply the court’s emergency orders. In August, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh took to task Judge William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for what they saw as a failure to apply an emergency ruling in one spending case to another. “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” the justices wrote.

In response, Judge Young issued a rare apology from the bench, though he expressed some bewilderment with the court’s opacity.

“Never, before this admonition, has any judge in any higher court ever thought to suggest that this court had defied the precedent of a higher court — that was never my intention,” he said.

Several judges singled out the justices’ criticism of Judge Young, an 85-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan and an Army veteran who has sat for more than 40 years, as a particularly demoralizing breach of decorum.

That view resonated with one of their retired colleagues, Jeremy Fogel, who was a federal judge for 20 years. Judge Young, he said, “has been at it for so long. He’s done the toughest cases, and he’s done them well. For a guy like that to get bench-slapped for not reading the tea leaves properly? That’s just not fair.”

Justice Gorsuch’s opinion could be read as “promoting a disrespect for the judiciary,” one that echoed Mr. Trump’s rhetorical attacks on judges, said Nancy Gertner, a retired judge who teaches at Harvard Law School. Both, she said, “undermine the bench and promote an atmosphere of disrespect.”

The Lower Courts Speak Out

Responses to the questionnaire were overwhelmingly critical of the Supreme Court, but they were not unanimous. Twenty-one judges either declined to answer the question about the effect of emergency orders on the public’s perception of the judiciary or said they believed they have had little or no effect.

A few judges were more equivocal about emergency orders, views that were echoed by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a widely respected jurist and Reagan nominee who wrote a robust defense of the role that district courts play in the constitutional scheme. In an interview, Judge Wilkinson noted that the Supreme Court was largely at the mercy of circumstances beyond its control: a high volume of emergency challenges to a presidency that “would put its foot on the pedal, because it has an agenda, and it’s sensitive to the fact that electoral mandates are perishable.”

While noting that the emergency docket had its advantages in terms of quickly and uniformly managing a mushrooming caseload from the executive branch, Judge Wilkinson said there were good arguments for the Supreme Court to be careful about using it too much.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days.","National Review, September 11, 2025

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a district-court injunction that blocked federal agents from making immigration stops based on certain demographic characteristics. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that location, occupation, language, and ethnicity – taken individually or in combination — are not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that someone is an illegal alien. But as Justice Kavanaugh explained in staying Judge Frimpong’s order, circumstances on the ground make reliance on such factors entirely reasonable:

Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.

Having recently published a report on the illegal immigrant share of workers in each Census-identified occupation, I can bolster Kavanaugh’s point with some numbers. Let’s take the example of landscaping mentioned above. As of the 2019-2023 period that the data set covers, about 17 percent of all “landscaping and groundskeeping workers” in the U.S. were illegal immigrants. Put another way, a randomly-selected landscaping worker has a 17 percent chance of being illegal. That’s already a fairly high percentage without adding any additional information.

But of course, we can add more. This case focused on enforcement operations in Los Angeles. A landscaping worker in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a 30 percent chance of being illegal. Furthermore, a i>Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles has a 33 percent chance. Finally, a Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles who speaks English less than very well has a remarkable 42 percent chance of being illegal.

This exercise can be repeated for other immigrant-heavy occupations. For example, about 21 percent of all construction laborers in the U.S. were illegal in the 2019–2023 period. Adding the factors of Los Angeles, Hispanic ethnicity, and low English ability increases that percentage all the way to 52 percent.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days. However, if a law enforcement officer encounters a suspect who has about a 50–50 chance of having committed the violation that the officer is investigating, then common sense suggests that a stop is justified.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/logo-facebook.png,N,,2025-10-11 07:57:18.046610

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.","A federal judge expressed frustration with Justice Department lawyers at a marathon hearing Friday as she weighed the Trump administration’s efforts to send to Africa Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man previously deported to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia is back in the United States in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, but he remains protected from deportation to his home country.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis is weighing arguments from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers that the administration is illegally punishing their client by floating various African countries that won’t accept him rather than oblige his demand to be removed to Costa Rica instead.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argue the judge should release their client. The judge will issue a ruling in writing later.

“They have spun the globe and picked various places they can identify, whether it’s to troll him for political purposes, essentially to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego Garcia,” attorney Andrew Rossman said.

In August, the government signaled it would remove Abrego Garcia to Uganda. After he expressed claims of fear, he was notified last month the government was looking to send him to the small, landlocked African country of Eswatini.

It led Xinis to demand the Trump administration bring to her Greenbelt, Md., courtroom Friday a witness with personal knowledge of the steps being taken so she can better assess the situation.

The government chose John Schultz, who has worked at Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more than two decades and oversees removal operations in Africa and other regions.

During roughly four hours of testimony, Schultz revealed that the ask for Eswatini to accept Abrego Garcia did not take place until this past Wednesday evening. Schultz said the country declined, but “discussions are ongoing.”

“The final decision is made when the manifest is sent over, and no cases have been denied after a manifest has been sent over,” Schultz said.

After Uganda and Eswatini, Abrego Garcia recently received notice the government was intending to deport him to Ghana, but Ghana’s foreign minister hours before the hearing made clear on social media the country “is not accepting Abrego Garcia.”

Schultz testified the notice was “prematurely sent.”

His testimony left Xinis frustrated. She told Justice Department lawyers afterward they had “ignored” her order by choosing a witness who knew “less than nothing” about Abrego Garcia’s request to be sent to Costa Rica.

“If the government has not done anything to effectuate the one place he says he’ll go and the one place they say will take him, how can I find you’re really pursuing this?” Xinis quipped.

The Justice Department points to Abrego Garcia’s previous suggestion he feared persecution in more than 20 countries, which included Costa Rica.

“That is still potentially a live issue, although I’ll acknowledge the clarity given in court today could change the analysis,” Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign told the judge.

Xinis, an appointee of former President Obama, has temporarily blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation until she figures out next steps.

Schultz expressed confidence Abrego Garcia would be deported in as soon as 72 hours if the judge lifts her ruling and Eswatini agrees to take him.

“We could remove him very quickly,” Schultz testified.

Abrego Garcia’s case has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown. His administration accuses Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, an allegation he denies.

A Salvadoran national, Abrego Garcia entered the United States illegally and lived in Maryland for years. He garnered national attention after the Trump administration in March deported him to a megaprison in El Salvador, despite an immigration order protecting him from being removed there over fears he’d face persecution.

In June, the government flew Abrego Garcia from El Salvador to Tennessee to face felony human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.

Now, Abrego Garcia is back in the custody of immigration authorities, who are detaining him in Pennsylvania as the administration looks to potentially remove him again.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/abrego-garcia_kilmar_08252025_GettyImages-2231358090-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-11 09:56:57.152557

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report.
They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""
The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities.
""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios.","A new joint report from Harvard University and Physicians for Human Rights says U.S. immigration detention facilities are ""systematically torturing"" detainees through the prolonged use of solitary confinement — often for weeks at a time — in what the United Nations defines as psychological torture.

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report. Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" including individuals with mental health conditions, spent an average of 38 days in isolation during the first quarter of 2025 — nearly triple the 14-day average recorded in 2021.

Researchers say the findings, based on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, point to a worsening trend since late 2024, with the practice now used routinely and without clear oversight. ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" said Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, to Axios. ""This violates both U.S. and international law.""

ICE guidelines limit solitary confinement for people with mental health issues to exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, but the report found the policy is routinely violated. In many cases, isolation was used for minor infractions, such as refusing medical procedures or protesting detention conditions.

The report's authors concluded that solitary confinement in immigration detention ""has no place in a civil system,"" arguing that ICE's growing use of the practice transforms administrative custody into a punitive system operating without due process. They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""

The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities. It also urges states and local governments to ban or restrict the practice in facilities that contract with ICE, conduct unannounced inspections, and ensure detainees have access to legal representation and interpreters.

""ICE cannot be presently trusted to account accurately, let alone implement humane policies in its existing facilities,"" the report said. ""Although transparency, accountability, and oversight are essential first steps, ICE must focus its attention on abolishing the inhumane practice of solitary confinement and immediately releasing vulnerable populations from immigration detention.""

The new report builds on earlier investigations showing that solitary placements in ICE custody rose 41% between December 2024 and August 2025, peaking at more than 1,100 individuals. Some detainees reported being held in windowless cells for weeks, denied medical care, or isolated after filing abuse complaints — despite DHS policy prohibiting segregation as retaliation.

""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios. ""And these are not criminals — they are asylum seekers and immigrants.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583579/solitary-confinement.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 05:59:19.218263

The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.

Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.

""I'm feeling energized, honestly,"" says Gorman. ""It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.""

Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.

Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.

Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.

Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.

""To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,"" she says.

""I'm done being afraid""

Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.

Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?

""I'm done being afraid of them,"" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. ""They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.""

NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: ""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""

Connecting with others for support and information

Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.

""They have made us much, much stronger,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.

Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.

""I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,"" she says.

Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.

""I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,"" she says. ""It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.""

With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.

Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.

Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.

""This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.

""I believe very strongly that my job as a civil servant is to carry out the lawful instructions of the sitting administration, regardless of whether I think it's a good policy,"" she says. ""That's my job, and I did it under the first Trump administration.""

“These ICE raids are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act, when the U.S. Marshals would hunt down and kidnap Black Americans,” Bynum said in a statement. “That was a dark and shameful time in our nation’s history—we must not allow that to repeat. Masked federal agents aren’t welcome in our state and they can’t keep kidnapping Americans.”

Frank Miranda, 46, filmed ICE agents confronting him(link is external) before work on Oct. 2, demanding that he answer questions about where he was born. When he refused, agents threatened him with a dog and took him to the ICE facility on South Macadam Avenue.

Bynum demanded a “thorough investigation” into Miranda’s abduction.

WW was first to report the incident on Tuesday and asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment. An ICE spokesperson returned the message today, impugning the paper’s motives and journalistic standards.

“ICE officers do not abduct people. Full Stop,” an unnamed spokesperson said in an email. “To suggest they do is what is leading to the 100% increase in assaults on our officers. A responsible journalist would not advocate for violence and instead would seek truth over clicks so it’s clear the Willamette Week is only interested in fueling the fire rather than seeking to tone down the rhetoric.""

Miranda “was handed to ICE Oct. 2 to determine his alienage and removability,” the spokesperson said. “He was eventually released the same day as arrest.”

Portland lawyer Michael Fuller described Miranda’s ordeal in a letter(link is external) to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday, flagging his client’s intention to seek damages.

Asked about ICE’s response today, Fuller wrote in an email: “As Trump himself said, anonymous sources are bullshit. The fact that ICE won’t attribute its comment to an actual person speaks to the baseless nature of its statement. The abduction video speaks for itself.”

Noem visited Portland on Tuesday, where she joined officials on the roof of the ICE building and watched a small group of protesters(link is external), including a man in a chicken suit, stand along the road. She called them “uneducated and ill-informed.”

“Not only do these raids undermine the principles that our country was founded on, but they’re against the law and downright racist,” Bynum wrote. “I’m demanding an end to ICE’s reign of terror, a thorough investigation into the kidnapping of Mr. Miranda, and fundamental change to this administration’s approach to immigration.”",http://bynum.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bynum.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/bynum_bc_045_020525.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 08:57:04.909691

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged arrest detainers against two criminal illegal aliens from Honduras for their involvement in a highway shooting in Virginia along I-295 on October 5, 2025.

Police were alerted of shots fired around 5 p.m. when a 911 caller reported possible gunfire along Interstate 295 northbound near the Creighton Road exit at mile marker 34.

A Hanover County Sheriff's deputy who was conducting a nearby traffic stop on the interstate observed a silver BMW matching the suspect description traveling northbound on I-295. When the deputy pulled onto the interstate, the BMW sped off, prompting a police pursuit. The Virginia State Police were called to assist with the investigation.

The two 17-year-olds were arrested. According to public records, the criminal illegal aliens have been charged with shooting from a vehicle, possession of a firearm under age 18, possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, and reckless handling of a firearm.

ICE officers lodged arrest detainers with the Merrimac Juvenile Detention Center in Williamsburg, where the pair is currently being held in custody.

“These criminal illegal alien thugs whipped around in their BMW with complete neglect for the safety of Virginians when they decided to open fire on an interstate highway,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These illegal aliens were released unvetted by the Biden Administration into our country. ICE lodged an arrest detainer to ensure these public safety threats are not released back onto Virginia’s roads. We are not going to allow criminal illegal aliens to terrorize American citizens.”

""Yesterday, the Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government,"" Markey said in a Friday statement.

""In 2024, the NDAA became the vehicle for one of the most consequential betrayals of transgender Americans by national Democrats in recent memory, after Democrats allowed provisions targeting trans military family members and dependents to stand when they had control of the Senate and White House,"" Reed noted.

""This year, history is repeating itself,"" she said. ""Senate Democrats dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of US troops.""

Early Thursday afternoon, Duckworth, a veteran herself, said that she was blocking the NDAA until she secured a hearing to investigate the president's ""gross abuse of our military"" by sending soldiers into American cities. A few hours later—shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in her state, Illinois—Duckworth announced that a hearing is planned.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), one of the Democrats who voted for the NDAA, secured sufficient bipartisan support for his amendment to end the authorizations for use of military force related to the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Washington Post reported that ""the House bill also includes a similar measure, bringing Congress to the precipice of repealing the laws.""

Some other Democrat-proposed amendments weren't successful. According to The Hill:

Amendments that failed to pass included one from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who had hoped to block money for President Trump to retrofit a luxury Qatari jet he accepted as an intended replacement for Air Force One.

""Retrofitting this foreign-owned luxury jet to make it fully operational will cost hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. That's money that shouldn't be wasted,"" Schumer said.

Still, Schumer ultimately voted for the NDAA—unlike Van Hollen, who proposed blocking Trump and governors from sending National Guard troops to another state if its governor or local leaders don't agree.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61737806&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C497%2C0%2C498,N,,2025-10-10 23:56:48.186191

TOP TALKER

IN A SLAP to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a federal judge in Chicago has temporarily halted plans to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois. The move stalls a key part of the president’s effort to boost federal presence in so-called sanctuary states.

U.S. District Judge April Perry issued the restraining order Thursday, casting doubt on the administration’s claims of unrest in Chicago. She described the narrative of violence as exaggerated and pointed to the use of tear gas and military-style tactics against “mostly peaceful demonstrators” — a group she noted was never more than a few hundred strong.

It’s a legal blow for Trump, who’s leaned hard into law-and-order messaging, especially in cities that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Chicago and nearby Broadview — home to a major ICE facility — have been front and center in the administration’s push.

Within hours of the TRO, the Trump administration filed notice of appeal in the Seventh Circuit.

In Oregon, meanwhile, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — which covers Oregon and other western states — signaled it was likely to rule in Trump’s favor on his deployment of the guard in Portland. Our story is here.

From the bench in Chicago: Perry, a Biden appointee, warned that National Guard troops lack the law-enforcement training to handle civil protests and could make things worse. “They’re not trained in de-escalation,” she said.

At the center of the case is Trump’s claim that Illinois is in “rebellion” — a legal basis to justify the deployment. Perry didn’t buy it and pressed the administration’s attorney repeatedly on that point.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, who led the legal challenge, called the ruling a “victory for the rule of law,” saying the court recognized the administration’s lack of “credibility.”

The Illinois ruling drew praise from Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have accused Trump of using public safety as cover to go after political opponents.

Pritzker said the ruling shows “Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law,” according to a post.

And Johnson made clear: “The Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger.”

For the administration: Attorney Eric Hamilton defended the National Guard plans, citing the “urgent need” to protect federal agents and property tied to immigration enforcement.

After the ruling, he asked Perry to confirm that the order only blocks deployments in Illinois — she agreed.

The drama isn’t over. The TRO is for 14 days, and the Trump appeal will be on a fast track. Perry’s full written opinion will be released today.

THE BUZZ

SPRINGFIELD MOVES: Thursday’s court ruling addressed the National Guard, but Illinois Senate President Don Harmon says state lawmakers are examining how to address the federal immigration enforcement actions that are continuing in Illinois communities.

“People are on edge,” Harmon said in an interview ahead of next week’s legislative session. He cited masked individuals with no identification and driving unmarked cars as they detain people.

“I don’t know what tools we have to try to prevent that, but I’m damn well willing to try because that’s wrong,” Harmon said.

Although no specific bill has been filed yet, Harmon said the caucus is exploring options that could set legal boundaries for how and when federal immigration authorities can operate in Illinois, particularly in coordination with local or state agencies.

The challenge: “The system was not designed for the state to police a federal government. And a federal government assaulting an American state or an American city is just beyond the pale, so we are clearly in uncharted waters,” Harmon said.

Any ICE-related legislation could face legal scrutiny and political opposition, but Harmon said that’s not a reason to shy away.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country.
Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica.
“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said.
Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts.","Abrego is originally from El Salvador. He entered the U.S. illegally and lived in Maryland for more than a decade before he was arrested in March and deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison. Courts declared that deportation illegal because it violated a 2019 order from an immigration judge who barred the U.S. from sending him there due to potential persecution by a local gang.

The Trump administration returned Abrego to the U.S. in June under court order. Federal prosecutors simultaneously charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee — charges Abrego denies.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country. But Abrego’s lawyers argued during Friday’s hearing that the administration is dragging its feet in those deportation efforts in order to keep Abrego in immigration jail and pressure him to plead guilty.

The meager and unsuccessful deportation efforts could lead to Abrego being released from immigration detention within days, if U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis concludes the government hasn’t shown it’s making a sincere and substantial effort to find a destination for Abrego.

Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica. One of his lawyers, Andrew Rossman, said Friday that the administration’s scattershot attempts to identify African countries instead show that the administration is intent on refusing the Costa Rica offer.

“We now know they are 0 for 3. Three strikes and you’re out. They have spun the globe and picked various places … to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego,” Rossman told Xinis. “What we’ve been getting in this courtroom is a lot of run-around.”

The appearance that arrangements for Abrego’s deportation were being intentionally or unintentionally fumbled by the administration was underscored by the testimony of Immigration and Customs Enforcement official John Schultz, who said lower-level personnel at his agency erred by formally notifying Abrego Thursday that the U.S. government intended to send him to Ghana.

“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said. “I believe the field office was just trying to get ahead of things so that, if Ghana did say yes, removal would be quicker.”

Xinis held the daylong hearing in connection with a lawsuit Abrego filed seeking his release from immigration detention. She ordered the government to produce one or more witnesses Friday with “first-hand knowledge” about the administration’s efforts to find a country to send Abrego to.

Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts. He said the State Department reported that officials in Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, “said no initially” when they were asked just this week to accept Abrego. But, he said, discussions are ongoing.

“I don’t know if there’s a rank structure on the next country if Eswatini doesn’t work,” Schultz said.

Schultz also appeared to confirm the White House’s involvement in selecting countries Abrego might be sent to. He said an official at the Homeland Security Council, Matt Ochoa, told him that Uganda was a place the administration wanted to send Abrego to, but that eventually fell through. Justice Department attorneys cut short that questioning with an executive privilege claim.

However, Schultz acknowledged he’d had no significant involvement in the Abrego matter before this week and said he was entirely unaware of discussions about sending Abrego to Costa Rica. That irritated the judge, who complained that aspects of her order were “ignored” by the government.

“You come today with a witness who knows nothing about Costa Rica — I mean, less than nothing,” said Xinis, an Obama appointee. “That seems to be in contravention of this order.”

Under a 2001 Supreme Court case, immigrants can’t typically be detained for more than six months unless their deportation is reasonably foreseeable.

Abrego’s lawyers and the government disagree about when that six-month clock started. His attorneys say it was back in 2019 when Abrego was ordered deported by an immigration judge, albeit with the caveat he could not be sent to El Salvador. The Justice Department contends the clock didn’t begin running until August.

Rossman argued that the time Abrego spent in prison in El Salvador from March to June should count as immigration detention, but regardless of the calculation the government failed to show it was making sincere efforts to find a country to take Abrego. The attorney said the administration is holding him “for political purposes” and to avoid going back on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s vow that Abrego will never walk the streets of America again.

During a separate court session Friday in Nashville, the judge presiding over Abrego’s criminal case set a hearing for Nov. 3 to take evidence and possibly testimony about whether the charges should be dismissed on the grounds that the Trump administration instituted them to lash back at Abrego for defeating the government in court over his illegal deportation.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F77%2Fad%2Fb8f009754aa090f4357389826bc1%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2231303351,N,,2025-10-10 21:57:15.263226

Drawing on a well of constitutional provisions and court precedents, government lawyers have sought to justify deploying the National Guard in Portland and Chicago. Some legal experts say the president has the law on his side, while others worry Trump is threatening state sovereignty.

Democratic leaders have responded with outrage and indignation to Trump's attempts to send federal troops to their jurisdictions. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson established ""ICE-free zones"" across Chicago to prevent federal agents from using any city-owned property in their ongoing operations. Conservative critics have compared this action and similar opposition to the Trump administration from Democratic leaders to attempts to nullify federal law, hearkening back to the 19th century.

""Illinois's own Abraham Lincoln had some ideas about how to deal with this John C. Calhoun-esque ‘nullification,’"" attorney and conservative commentator Josh Hammer wrote on X.

PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS

Joshua Blackman, South Texas College of Law professor, said the federal government does not need permission from states to defend federal facilities. The Trump administration's position is that it needs to deploy the National Guard to protect federal personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings.

""This is a principle that goes back to the beginning of the Republic,"" Blackman told Fox News Digital, pointing to the landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland, which found that Maryland could not tax a national bank created by Congress.

The high court said in that case that allowing a state to impose such a burden on a federal institution would violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal law trumps state law.

The need for the National Guard

During one set of oral arguments this week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a Trump administration lawyer argued that unrest in Portland, prompted by ICE activity, justified the deployment of about 200 National Guard soldiers.

""For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,"" said Eric McArthur, arguing for the Justice Department.

The rebellion statute that Trump is using to federalize the National Guard, which governors have shared authority over, can be invoked in those situations, McArthur argued.

He also said it was the government's position that the courts had no say over Trump's assessment of the need for the military. Blackman made a similar point.

""The statute lets the president make the judgment over the need. It's not clear to me that a court can second-guess it,"" Blackman said.

States are ‘frustrating’ immigration enforcement

In court papers, the Trump administration has also cited a case from 1890, Neagle v. Cunningham, which established that the president has authority under the Constitution’s take care clause to ""take care"" that federal laws be carried out, including by doing what is necessary to protect those executing immigration laws.

In Neagle, a U.S. marshal shot and killed a person who attacked a Supreme Court justice, and the Supreme Court found that the State of California could not prosecute the marshal for murder since the marshal was protecting a federal officer.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE

Blackman said that states have for years been ""frustrating"" federal immigration enforcement and that these blue-state lawsuits trying to challenge the National Guard’s presence were an instance of that.

He said the states' resistance did not ""quite rise to the level of nullification,"" like when states in the South tried to block integration of segregated schools, but that it was ""in the ballpark."" If states were to defy court orders, that could escalate matters, Blackman said.

The lawsuits, which could rise to the Supreme Court, especially if the circuit courts were to rule against Trump in the coming days, could help to sharpen the dividing line between state and federal authority over law enforcement.

Policing falls under ‘state's responsibilities'

Like Oregon and Illinois, Matt Cavedon, a director at the CATO Institute, said the 10th Amendment is also in play in these cases and that it implies that the Trump administration cannot typically take over a state's law enforcement responsibilities.

Cavedon also said it was unusual, in his view, that a Republican government would adopt a more expanded view of federal power.

""It's not usually conservatives who are arguing that there are just vast unenumerated federal powers belonging to the president, certainly in the domestic context,"" Cavedon told Fox News Digital.

Cavedon said the events in the two states are ""really core issues of public security and safety, which are at the heart of what a state's responsibilities are."" Oregon and Illinois leaders have made similar claims that nothing extraordinary was playing out crime-wise to warrant National Guard intervention.

""I think the 10th Amendment answers a question: Any powers that are not conferred on the federal government are reserved to the states, respectively,"" Cavedon added.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/f158c403-trump-national-guard-portland.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 20:58:17.923952

After a more than six-hour hearing, District Judge Paula Xinis said a witness provided by the Justice Department showed little evidence that the Trump administration made an effort to remove Abrego Garcia to the southern African nation of Eswatini, and knew nothing about Abrego Garcia agreeing to be removed to Costa Rica.

The witness tapped by the Department of Justice was John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.

After hearing from him, Xinis said keeping Abrego Garcia detained indefinitely would likely be unconstitutional. She said she would issue an order soon.

Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whose wrongful deportation from Maryland put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is currently detained in Pennsylvania.

His attorneys have argued the Trump administration is using detention to punish Abrego Garcia because officials are not trying to remove him, even after Abrego Garcia agreed to be deported to Costa Rica.

‘Three strikes, you’re out’

Xinis expressed her frustration with Department of Justice attorneys for not providing a witness who would give clear answers on how immigration officials were handling the removal of Abrego Garcia.

“We're getting to the three strikes, you’re out,” Xinis said.

Andrew J. Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention.

He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.

“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.

Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.

Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there.

Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.

“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.

Supreme Court ruling

A 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.

After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis.

Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August.

Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.

Protesters rally outside the courthouse

Ahead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.”

Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!”

Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.

Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.

“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”

White House involvement

Schultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia.

The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.

Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House.

While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini.

Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway.

“The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said.

Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.

Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.

Ghana another potential destination

Schultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.

However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia.

“This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”

Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.

The Costa Rica alternative

One of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.

Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.

Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses.

Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.

Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there.

Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”

“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”

They went to work early that day; they headed home late in the afternoon. Hector, an undocumented immigrant who requested anonymity for this story when he and his son met with Mississippi Youth Media Project student journalists in Jackson in July 2025, was leaving Home Depot on Interstate 20 when he looked in his rearview mirror and saw a K-9 police SUV, its windows blacked out.

“At first I didn’t notice them,” David said in an in-person interview with the Mississippi Youth Media Project. “But then my dad said, ‘Look, there’s an SUV behind us.’”

A mile later, it was still trailing them.

The SUV continued to stay close behind Hector and his family before turning its lights on. Hector pulled the car over and waited patiently. The police officer got out, tapped the tailgate and continued walking up to the driver’s side window. David’s mind raced and jumped to what could possibly be happening. However, one thought stayed consistent: “I wish I was driving.”

Immediately, David asked why they were pulled over. The officer claimed the driver was driving recklessly. David, sitting in the passenger seat, saw nothing out of the ordinary in his father’s driving; both had, after all, been keenly aware of the vehicle following them closely.

The officer asked for Hector’s ID. David sat still, on edge, not knowing what could happen next because his father was undocumented. The officer assured Hector and his family that the stop was just going to be a warning. He then ordered Hector to step out of the vehicle for a search. After patting Hector down, the officer walked to his car and made a few calls, telling the family to sit on the curb and wait.

Within minutes, eight more law-enforcement vehicles arrived on the side of I-20 where the original officer’s vehicle had pulled them over. Brandon Police Department officers arrived, then the Pearl Police Department joined them. (Neither commented for this story.) The last cars to arrive belonged to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The main officer from Brandon began reading Hector his Miranda rights while simultaneously slapping the handcuffs around his wrists, the men told the Mississippi Free Press student journalists. Hector was charged with reckless driving.

The arrest was accomplished in a flash. The immigration sweep that ensnared Hector that day parted 27 men and women from their families. Some have been deported. Others languish. Most were caught somewhere in the tangle of immigrants, side-by-side with Hector, in the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, trapped in an American limbo.

‘He’s My Role Model’

The 17-year-old son watched as ICE ripped his father from him. “It all felt like a lot to bear,” David told the Youth Media Project. “He’s my role model, my biggest supporter. I rely on him a lot.”

The officer took all of Hector’s belongings, including $200 in cash he was carrying. They did, however, forget to confiscate his phone, which Hector kept on him during his detainment.

David watched his dad step into the backseat of the blacked-out SUV. As it sped off, his mind spun. He began running in the scorching sun after the car and watched as it disappeared from sight. The son was able to track his dad’s location through a tracking app called Life360. Once he got into Madison, David walked to the sheriff’s office.

Upon arrival, David saw a pastor who had been known to help immigrants, but this time the religious leader explained apologetically to the teenager that, due to the presidential administration’s restrictions, he couldn’t help Hector’s family.

‘“(The pastor) tried talking to some of the agents,” David said. “But they said they couldn’t help us with anything.”

The teenager, feeling defeated, finally called his mom from the station. He tried to cover his pain and panic with a simple “Hey, mom,” then told her what happened. She immediately picked him up and drove home, cautious of any further police presence.

Call in the Middle of the Night

At home, the family began calling all the local jails—and Hector’s phone—to find him. There was no response. It was almost as if he was a ghost. It was getting late when David’s mom suggested it was time to call it a night and try again in the morning. Everyone agreed.

The phone rang around midnight. David immediately woke and looked at the phone. It was his dad. The phone had awakened David’s brother as well, so they answered the call together. Hector explained that he had snuck out his phone to call them. He informed them that ICE was still holding him at the Madison County Detention Center.

“I’m OK, don’t worry. Everything will be OK soon,” Hector said as he hung up.

The boys sprinted out of the room and down the hall to wake up their mom.

“We just talked to Dad!” David told her. “He’s in Madison County!”

For their mother, it was a bittersweet moment. Her husband was healthy and in communication with the family, however briefly. But as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone. And this was only the beginning for Hector. He was up against a system that meant to keep him captive, a system set in place by years of consecutive administrations—but massively expanded under President Donald Trump.

His dad’s words that night were the last David would hear from him for the next few weeks.

Immigrant Health Care At Risk

The Trump administration has dramatically tightened immigration enforcement, with the U.S. Department of Justice aiming to enact a mass-deportation regime by framing immigrants as a “national security threat.” President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” provided tens of billions to ICE’s budget for hiring and the construction of new detention facilities, like the beleaguered but still open “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida, making it a larger law-enforcement agency than the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is engaging in expedited removal, which allows the government to quickly deport someone whom they believe is undocumented without the opportunity to see a judge.

President Trump signed the executive order on Jan. 21, 2025, to begin expedited removal anywhere in the country of any undocumented person who cannot prove they had been in the U.S. for two years before the arrest. These changes, which closely follow Project 2025 campaign promises and plans, were set into effect on Jan. 21, 2025—just one day after Trump took office.

The new governmental changes not only affect the detainee process but also the community’s access to health care. The Immigration Forum reports that 45% to 71% of undocumented immigrants do not have access to health care.

President Trump included plans to ensure that American taxpayer resources are not used to support immigrants in the United States in his “Big Beautiful Bill”—including access to health care. Parts of the bill, which he signed into law on July 4, 2025, are aimed at stopping immigrants from obtaining Social Security Act benefits, which include Medicare and Medicaid.

‘Are You Legal Here?’

Isaura Camacho, a community health organizer at Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, says new anti-immigration policies hurt the Hispanic community’s access to medical services. Camacho took her own parents and community members to discount clinics that were once federally funded but are not now.

“The first thing that was affected was the discounted clinics,” Camacho said. “The prices have gone up on appointments and medicine.”

These clinics were once available to undocumented immigrants who needed affordable health care, but new policies have created a barrier to services for immigrants.

Camacho described her experience assisting a young Colombian woman. “She couldn’t afford routine check-ups while being eight to nine months pregnant,” Camacho said. “The first thing they asked her while she was in serious pain was, ‘Are you legal here?’”

These new policy changes were not just hurting people who were detained but were destroying the entire community around her, Camacho soon realized.

“This immigration system was created for the U.S. to benefit; yet, the very people who are contributing to this system get no access to health care,” Camacho said.

‘Madison County Still Has Your Money’

The Madison County Sheriff’s Department processed Hector into the detention center in Madison County. They took all his belongings, along with the $200 cash he had worked hard to earn. When they took his money, they gave Hector a receipt and told him to keep up with it for the rest of his stay. He thought of this as a little strange, but he held on to that receipt for dear life.

As weeks went by, Hector began to get more comfortable in the system. He started talking to more people who shared similar experiences and, through this, he uncovered a dark secret: People who lost their receipts lost that money forever. The money was very important to detainees because that’s what they planned to use when they returned to the outside world. The receipt was their lifeline.

When Hector was transferred to Jena, Louisiana, he was instructed to give officials the receipt for his money, and he did. Instead of giving Hector the money, though, the family said Madison County, which declined comment to YMP student reporters, still had his money. It would take Hector over a month of calling with David’s help after his eventual release on bond to locate those funds.

But Hector couldn’t dwell too much on this money problem. From the time he walked into the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, commonly referred to as Jena or LaSalle Detention Center, he had larger problems to worry about.

‘I Couldn’t Even Eat’

On June 17, 2025, Hector walked into the Jena facility along with 20 to 30 detained immigrants. White brick walls loomed over him, and when he walked in, he was stunned by how crowded it was. Hector is not the only Mississippi immigrant who has been held at Jena. Others, such as Kerlin Moreno-Orellana and Kasper Eriksen, were also imprisoned there.

“There were around 90 to 100 people crowded into one cell with me,” Hector said.

The overcrowding was overwhelming. He was a long way from home. Problems in the facility began unfolding in front of his eyes.

The LaSalle Detention Center has faced several allegations and complaints from detainees saying their basic needs, such as food and water, were not met. Several alleged denials of—or restricted access to—medical treatment.

“We would have to ask two to three times before we were ever able to receive medical attention,” Hector said.

Hector said that, while detained, he and other inmates were exposed to bad drinking water, sickening him and many others. “They gathered us all together and announced to us that the water was contaminated,” Hector said. “But I was already experiencing stomach aches and problems prior to them announcing it.”

Mistreatment of immigrants, including the lack of safe drinking water, is a known problem in detention centers in Louisiana, both before Trump’s second term began and since his anti-immigration efforts this year.

The Jena processing center’s response to the issue was to give inmates one small 16-ounce bottle of water a day, Hector said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been notified multiple times of contamination issues at the processing center, as well as complaints of medical, verbal, sexual and physical abuse. Yale Law School students and civil-rights advocates filed a complaint about its drinking water and food within the past several years. The Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights filed another recent complaint for a detainee who has experienced abuse at these facilities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has conducted several internal investigations on the Jena facility and others in Louisiana.

“I couldn’t even eat because of how filthy everything was,” Hector said.

The GEO Group, a private prison company, operates the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, or CLIPC, and has been managing the facility. The GEO Group runs 28 immigrant facilities across the U.S.

In response to an interview request, GEO Group spokesman Christopher V. Ferreira issued a statement on the water contamination at the processing center: “We can confirm that during the middle of June, water at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center was impacted for two days by scheduled maintenance to the City’s water main by the City of Jena. In the interim, all individuals at the Center were provided with bottled water. Water services at the facility have been functioning properly following the completion of the maintenance by the City.”

The Youth Media Project contacted the GEO group with further questions, but Ferreira did not respond to inquiries about detainees reporting being sickened during the water outage, neither how many reported symptoms of illness, nor what the facility did to treat their condition.

ICE Response: ‘At Times Things Happen’

Jena is one of many detention centers that the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses to detain immigrants. ICE’s stated goal at these detention centers is to “arrest and remove aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”

The Youth Media Project spoke with Lindsay Williams, a spokesperson for ICE for southern states, including Mississippi. Williams stated that ICE has no record of water issues in Jena and does not handle any financial issues within the detention center.

“Our mission is to identify, arrest, detain and remove aliens from the country,” Williams said. “We do that every day.”

Williams says that facilities holding immigrants across the U.S. may have problems but have been or are currently being repaired. “I can tell you (that) just like any jail or any facility if there are plumbing issues or some sort of infrastructure issues, that has happened,” Williams said. “Just like in your own personal homes, at times things happen. You work around that.”

The ICE spokesman said he does not know the specifics of the water issues at Jena. However, he told YMP that ICE performs several inspections through a third-party inspector. July 26-28, 2022, inspection report, the Jena facility received a superior rating on the care of the facility.

Williams had no clear answer on ICE’s part in monies taken at arrests.

“I don’t know exactly how it all works, because it’s not something I do. There is a record of somebody being in a detention facility,” Williams said. “I’d imagine that there’s a record of what their property was or is.”

Williams said ICE’s main goal is to protect the states and to have an honest system. “One of the major things that we want to do is to get everything right,” he added.

‘We Couldn’t Give Up’

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office released Hector on bond to go home with his family at the end of June. Although he was finally home with his sons and their mother, it was not the end for them. The family now has to figure out how to navigate life after the ordeal.

“We were trying to figure all sorts of things out and figuring out what is going to come next,” David said.

Hector now awaits his master hearing, which is a public proceeding where the judge explains the charges against the respondent and shares the next steps. The hearing has been pushed back to sometime next summer. Hector’s family must also continue paying the legal fees that come with the process of deportation.

“The bond alone was $7,500,” David said. “Not only that, but we have to pay for legal fees and for his attorney to represent him at the master hearing.”

David graduated top of his high school class with high honors this past May. He planned on entering the National Guard to serve as a combat medic; however, he expressed second thoughts now that he has seen the actions of the new administration.

“I honestly feel betrayed,” David said. “To get my father taken away like that months after I made this decision is heartbreaking.”

He still wants to serve to save his family.

“At times, yes, I still want to serve, and even though I didn’t join the military because I wanted to save my parents’ citizenship, I’m going to use that in hopes that it can carve them a path to citizenship,” David said.

Hector’s story is one of hundreds that haven’t been told. Similar incidents are happening throughout the entire state.

Isaura Camacho, the community health organizer at Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, said the system has had flaws for a while. Her family had a similar experience with ICE. “I remember even experiencing the same thing during Katrina. In 2005, my parents were wrongfully accused of human trafficking,” Camacho said.

She added that the problems create mistrust for organizations that are trying to support the Hispanic population of the state. “I want to help the community, and I want them to come to us for help.”

For now, Hector remains with his family in the Jackson area, awaiting what will come next. “We just had to keep going. We couldn’t give up,” David told the Youth Media Project.

Federal agents were present twice in the ""Alpha"" lot, a designated spot for rideshare drivers, with the most recent time being around 2:15 p.m. Agents were asking drivers if they were U.S. citizens and to show proof. One agent came up to NBC Chicago reporter Regina Waldroup and asked if she was a U.S. citizen.

As of the late afternoon, about 50 rideshare vehicles were in the parking lot. But NBC Chicago was told there are usually several hundred. Several people were handcuffed and taken into custody.

Agents showed up in nondescript white mini vans; they were at the lot for about 15 to 20 minutes.

The sweep marked the second time ICE went to the lot on Friday.

One driver described what happened around 10 a.m.

""It was pretty surprising to see them up here, though, honestly,"" said rideshare driver Donald Cooper. ""I didn't even see them. I was sitting in the lot for a nice little minute, and I pulled out, and they were all around.""

The union that represents rideshare drivers issued a statement that, in part, read:

""We are deeply concerned that the drivers’ due process rights were violated at O'Hare today. This is part of a broader pattern of attacks on immigrant families by an administration that continues to weaponize fear and division instead of investing in solutions that strengthen our communities…we are working diligently to gather more information.""

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area, DHS previously said.

DHS released the following statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Friday evening:

“U.S. Border Patrol conducted a targeted immigration enforcement operation at O’Hare International Airport that arrested of 12 illegal aliens, all in violation of our nation’s immigration laws. Among those arrested was Elvis Rodriguez-Colmenares, a criminal illegal alien from Venezuela, who was previously arrested for domestic battery causing great bodily harm. These criminals will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

Mr. Trump fired Ms. Cook in August because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage.
The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began.
Many Democrats condemned the Trump administration for targeting federal workers while many were out of work or serving without pay.
Analysts had speculated that China’s move could be Beijing’s effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi.","Ms. James has called the charges “baseless” and said the indictment was “nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

Mortgage fraud accusations have become one of the main tools the Trump administration has used to harass its political enemies.

William J. Pulte, who was tapped by Mr. Trump to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has threatened a crackdown on mortgage fraud. In addition to initiating the investigation into Ms. James, who prosecuted the president and his companies, Mr. Pulte started an inquiry into the finances of Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the effort to impeach the president during his first term.

The type of mortgage fraud that the president and his allies have used to bring charges against adversaries involves a false claim that a second home or rental property is a principal residence in hopes of obtaining more favorable financial terms.

That sort of allegation somewhat echoes a New York civil case that Ms. James won against Mr. Trump in 2024, which found Mr. Trump liable for fraudulently inflating his net worth to obtain loans or tax benefits. A New York appeals court panel later rejected the $500 million penalty the judge in the case imposed, but let the judgment stand so Mr. Trump could continue appealing it.

A mortgage fraud accusation was also used to ensnare Lisa Cook, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Cook in August because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage.

Mr. Pulte posted images of her signatures on social media that appeared to show that she improperly designated both a condominium in Atlanta and a home in Ann Arbor, Mich., as her primary residence when taking out loans.

“When someone commits mortgage fraud, they undermine the faith and integrity of our System,” Mr. Pulte said on social media. “No one is above the law.”

The move came as Mr. Trump railed against the nation’s central bank for being slow to cut interest rates and looked to staff the Federal Reserve Board with loyalists.

The Supreme Court said Ms. Cook, who denied any wrongdoing, could remain a governor on the Federal Reserve Board while her lawsuit against Mr. Trump proceeded.

“Another vindictive prosecution of someone on the president’s enemies list,” Mr. Schiff said on social media of Ms. James’ indictment on Thursday. “Another terrible abuse of the Justice Department as an instrument of Trump’s retribution campaign.”

The ruling is the third over the past week against the Trump administration in Chicago. On Wednesday, a federal judge imposed new limits on ICE agents, restricting their ability to make arrests without warrants. On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard, which the Trump administration hoped to send to protect federal property from protesters who were angered over immigration enforcement.

In all three rulings, the judges said ICE’s tactics were informing their decisions.

“The Court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the Federal Defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon,” Judge Hunt wrote.

She said she reached that conclusion after Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told the court that there would “be no change in our operational posture” until the protests stopped at the agency’s facility in Broadview, just west of Chicago.

Katrina Thompson, the mayor of Broadview, praised the decision as “a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety.” She said that the fence would have to be dismantled by Friday.

“Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance,” she said.

Federal authorities had the fence installed last month in response to the protests, which sometimes turned violent. But in recent days, demonstrations at the facility have been peaceful and small in numbers. To quell the activists, Ms. Thompson on Monday issued a curfew near the facility.

On Friday morning, a few hundred protesters gathered at the facility in Broadview. Many carried signs, sang songs and prayed with religious groups. Some arrived during the curfew and were given citations, and a handful were arrested because they refused to get off the street.

Whenever ICE vehicles arrived, the crowd chanted “shame, shame.” By 10 a.m., many began to leave and the crowd decreased to about 100 people.

At the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago, it was even quieter. Michael Boyte, a 41-year-old bartender from Chicago, was one of about eight gathered to protest the arrests of two activists. One of the arrested, Marimar Martinez, had been shot by a federal agent.

“We thought it was important to come out and let the people who were arrested know that we got their backs,” Mr. Boyte said.

Meantime, immigration operations continued to make waves in the city. On Friday morning, a producer at one of Chicago’s largest television news outlets was detained by two Border Patrol agents in the morning rush hour.

These deals are the result of pressure from Mr. Trump, who has threatened tariffs, demanding that drug companies lower prices and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Pfizer said last week that its drug-pricing deal with the administration had helped secure a three-year grace period from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

In July, AstraZeneca said it planned to spend $50 billion over the next five years building and expanding factories and research facilities in the United States.

On Thursday, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for one of those manufacturing investments, at a site in Virginia that it said would help manufacture drugs for cancer, weight loss and blood pressure.

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, was expected to attend a scheduled event about drug prices at the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. AstraZeneca declined to comment.

In July, Mr. Trump sent letters to 17 of the largest drugmakers, including AstraZeneca, asking them to lower some of their prices. Officials said they were in talks with other major drugmakers about reaching similar agreements.

Under the terms of the Pfizer deal, the company agreed to sell nearly all of its drugs to Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, at about the same prices that it offers to European countries. Some of Pfizer’s best-selling drugs include the blood thinner Eliquis; the cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi; and the Covid treatment Paxlovid.

Officials also announced plans to create a website, TrumpRx.gov, which would send American patients to direct-sales websites offered by various drugmakers like Pfizer. Officials said Mr. Trump’s online drugstore would be up and running next year.

Whether the deals will yield significant savings for taxpayers under Medicaid is unknown. In many cases, the prices Medicaid programs pay for drugs are already similar to those in Europe, experts said.

Under Pfizer’s agreement, the company made no commitment to lower prices for drugs it currently sells for employers, insurers and other government programs like Medicare, which shoulder most of the costs of drugs in the United States.

Brand-name drug prices in the United States are three times as high, on average, as those in peer nations. But the disparities vary across types of insurance. Drugmakers already give Medicaid lower prices than other payers in the United States.

AstraZeneca’s best-selling products include Farxiga, for diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure; Tagrisso and Imfinzi, for cancer; and the inhaler Symbicort, for respiratory problems.

Like other large multinational drugmakers, AstraZeneca has long had a presence in the United States, its most important market. The company has moved recently to strengthen those ties.

AstraZeneca said last week that it planned to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange next year, though it will remain headquartered in Britain and listed in London and Stockholm.

Drugmakers that are building factories in the United States are expected to be at least partly exempt from Mr. Trump’s threatened tariffs on imported medicines. His administration has said the tariffs will be up to 15 percent on drugs from the European Union and 100 percent from other parts of the world. His administration has delayed imposing drug tariffs he had said would begin on Oct. 1.

In an event on Monday at the Aspen Institute, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he expected a series of similar announcements from drug companies in the coming weeks. He praised the voluntary nature of these deals over policymaking that would have most likely prompted legal challenges from the industry.

“All these are opportunities for us to re-envision the way the government normally works, not based on litigation, slowing everything down, but by leapfrogging litigation, if possible, to get people to do what they probably want to do,” he said.

The project, known as Esmeralda 7, would have comprised a sprawling network of solar panels and batteries across 118,000 acres of federally owned land in the Nevada desert northwest of Las Vegas. It was expected to produce up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly two million homes.

The developers of the project included NextEra Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, and Invenergy, a company that builds solar and wind farms as well as natural gas plants and battery storage systems.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly updated its webpage on the project’s permitting process late Thursday to reflect the cancellation. The webpage did not provide additional information.

Alyse Sharpe, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in a Friday email that Esmeralda 7 consisted of seven separate solar projects and that the developers could still seek permits for each individual project.

But restarting the permitting process, which was already in its late stages, could lead to significant delays.

Neil Nissan, a spokesman for NextEra, said in an email that the utility was “committed” to its portion of the project and would work with the Interior Department.

The cancellation caused concern on Capitol Hill, where Nevada lawmakers and clean energy lobbyists said they were scrambling to find out details.

“The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement, adding that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum should “clarify the administration’s actions soon.”

The move comes as the Trump administration has taken a rapid-fire series of steps to slow or stop the construction of renewable energy projects on public and private lands across the country.

The Interior Department is now requiring dozens of formerly routine approvals for wind and solar projects to undergo new layers of political review by the interior secretary’s office, a policy that is causing significant permitting delays. The agency is also opening investigations into bird deaths caused by wind farms and withdrawing millions of acres of federal waters previously available for leasing by offshore wind companies.

In addition, the Interior Department has ordered work to stop on several wind farms off the coast of New England. Last month, however, a federal judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could restart work on one of these projects, a $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80 percent complete.

At the same time, the Trump administration has continued to approve permits for new oil and gas drilling and to encourage coal mining. The burning of fossil fuels is a main driver of climate change.

During the ongoing government shutdown, the Interior Department has designated employees who process oil drilling permits as essential, enabling them to keep working while other workers are furloughed.

Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada, a Republican, sent a letter to Mr. Burgum in August expressing concern about the new layers of political review for solar and wind projects. He wrote that the additional scrutiny could “prevent or unnecessarily delay energy development in the state that is poised to help meet the growing energy demands of the mining industry and data centers.”

Representatives for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Esmeralda 7 had advanced through the permitting process under the Biden administration, which prioritized clean energy development as part of its ambitious climate agenda. But after President Trump took office, the Bureau of Land Management declined to release a final environmental impact statement, the next step in the process to approve the project.

NextEra was among the companies that donated at least $5 million to fund the construction of Mr. Trump’s $200 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, CBS News reported. Another one of the utility’s large solar projects in Nevada, known as Dodge Flat II, was still listed as “in progress” on the Bureau of Land Management website on Friday.

Rebecca F. Elliott contributed reporting.

Early indications suggested that the layoffs could be significant, affecting a wide range of agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Treasury, according to officials there and congressional aides who later learned of the plans.

Unions representing federal workers quickly denounced the attempted firings as illegal, as they blasted the Trump administration for trying to use the government’s work force as a bargaining chip in a political feud. Even before the White House had announced that it would proceed with cuts, labor officials had sued to block them, and on Friday they urged a federal judge considering the case to intervene swiftly.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing the administration.

Many Democrats and even one Republican — Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chamber’s lead appropriator — also condemned the administration for the timing and scope of its attempted firings. In a statement, Ms. Collins blamed Democrats for the shutdown but said that terminating federal workers could “cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.”

”Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,” she said.

The White House repeatedly declined to answer questions about its strategy or the scope of the layoffs. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said only in a social media post that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to the reduction-in-force notices to federal employees about pending dismissals.

A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the cuts as substantial. The president’s aides had previously indicated they could range into the thousands.

By seeking to fire federal workers during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Rather than negotiate a resolution with Democrats, the president has embraced the government closure as a political advantage, using it as an opportunity to try to rearrange the federal budget without Congress and exact revenge against his political foes.

The administration has already canceled or frozen tens of billions of dollars in federal aid that had primarily benefited Democratic-led cities and states. Mr. Trump has also threatened to slash what he has described as “Democrat agencies,” reducing spending perhaps on a permanent basis, even though lawmakers have not agreed to any cuts.

“We’ll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans, frankly,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, adding that he would give Democrats a “little taste of their own medicine.”

If the Trump administration proceeds with its plans, a new round of layoffs could further decimate the federal work force, which is expected to employ 300,000 fewer people by the end of December compared with January, officials have said. The staggering decline is a direct result of Mr. Trump, who has presided over an aggressive and legally contested effort to shrink the bureaucracy through firings, layoffs and induced retirements.

Under its published guidelines, the government must give workers 60 days’ notice before a layoff, though this may be reduced to 30 days in certain exceptions.

The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began. In a memo last month, the president’s budget aides essentially argued that a lapse in funding would mean that the government no longer needed to retain some of its workers.

The Trump administration even appeared to issue guidance that allowed officials producing termination notices to work throughout the federal stoppage, a status typically reserved for the most vital employees, including military service members.

Unions representing federal workers have contested both the rationale for layoffs and the administration’s efforts to carry them out. On Friday, labor officials told the judge reviewing the case that they believed the cuts could be significant, citing one agency — the Treasury Department — where they believed officials were working to issue 1,300 terminations.

A court previously ordered the Trump administration to respond by Friday, at which point the government was supposed to offer an explicit accounting of the layoffs it was seeking.

Many Democrats condemned the Trump administration for targeting federal workers while many were out of work or serving without pay. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who leads his party on the House Budget Committee, described the layoffs on Friday as an “illegal” attempt by Mr. Trump to “seize more power for himself.”

By the afternoon, Democrats and Republicans did not seem anywhere close to a resolution that might reopen the government, with Congress having left Washington for the weekend.

Democrats continue to reject a Republican plan to reopen federal agencies into next month as they seek to extend a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance.

“I think to their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, told reporters on Friday.

But, he added, that could soon change.

“That’s what a shutdown does,” Mr. Thune said. “You put the administration and this presidency in a position where you have to make some hard decisions.”

The announcement followed a post Friday morning in which the president threatened retaliation and to cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping.

The president called the curbs that China put out this week on its exports of rare earth minerals “sinister and hostile” and said they would “make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World.” He added that he had planned to meet Mr. Xi in two weeks at an international economic conference in South Korea, “but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”

“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” he wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”

Markets shuddered at the developments, with the S&P 500 index sliding more than 2 percent on Friday.

Rare earth minerals, which are vital for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets, have been at the center of tensions between the United States and China this year. In April, the Chinese government responded to stiff tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods by clamping down on mineral exports destined for U.S. automakers and defense manufacturers.

The Trump administration tried to encourage China to back down by imposing its own restrictions on exports of chip design software, airplane engines and other products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese products rose to a minimum of 145 percent, bringing much trade between the countries to a halt.

But China’s curbs threatened to close U.S. factories and forced the United States, which depends on Chinese supplies, to pull back. Ultimately, officials from both countries reached a fragile truce in meetings this spring that led to Mr. Trump’s reducing his tariffs and Beijing’s approving more mineral exports.

On Thursday, Beijing again escalated its controls, asserting broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology.

The Chinese government said it would require foreign companies to obtain licenses to export products containing even a minimal amount of rare earths, including for chip manufacturing. It also put new controls on technology and equipment used for extracting and refining minerals, and for making electric vehicle batteries. Those rules are set to take effect Dec. 1.

China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, and it also performs the chemical processing for roughly 90 percent of the global supply of such minerals. In addition to rare earths, the Chinese government has set out long-term plans in recent decades to dominate key industries, including steel, shipbuilding, robotics and biomedicine.

On Friday, China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into the American chipmaker Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports.

The new restrictions have caused significant anxiety among U.S. companies. Analysts said the new limits could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple.

Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent.

The stock market was already on edge this month, after five straight months of gains had lifted prices to record levels, prompting some investors to warn of the potential for a pullback.

Analysts had speculated that China’s move could be Beijing’s effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. If so, it may have backfired. In addition to the president’s calls for retaliation, other critics of China said the measures highlighted the need for the United States to reduce its exposure to the Chinese economy.

John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House Select Committee on China, called Beijing’s action “an economic declaration of war against the United States and a slap in the face to President Trump amid his efforts to fight for a level playing field.”

Mr. Moolenaar said the United States should immediately pass legislation to end preferential trade treatment for China, build the U.S. supply of minerals and “strangle China’s technology sector with export controls instead of selling it advanced chips.”

Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the think tank Asia Society Policy Institute, said the president’s statements showed “how fragile the emerging détente between the two countries really is.”

“Beijing has become increasingly assertive, believing it has the upper hand in the bilateral relationship,” she said. But Mr. Trump’s counter threats showed that “two can play this game.”

With the planned summit between the leaders in just over two weeks, it was unclear whether the two sides would be willing to de-escalate in order to still hold the meeting, Ms. Cutler added.

In his social media post, Mr. Trump said that the changes “came out of nowhere.” The United States’ relationship with China over the past six months had been a very good one, he said.

The president went on to say that although China had a monopoly on rare earth minerals, the United States had other monopolies that were “stronger and more far reaching.” He added, “I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW!”

The White House has been planning a trip to Asia later this month for the president, which would include a meeting with Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea.

The plans had generated speculation about whether the meeting could lead to an economic deal between the countries, potentially including Chinese purchases of American products or Chinese investment in the United States. Beijing has also been interested in having the United States roll back the global controls it has put on China’s access to advanced A.I. chips.

American farmers have also asked the administration to push China to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybean exports that have crippled business this year. One of them, Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer who is the president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement that his group was “extremely disappointed” that the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would be canceled.

“Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis,” Mr. Ragland said.

In a letter on Friday to the Trump administration, M.I.T.’s president, Sally Kornbluth, wrote that the university has already freely met or exceeded many of the standards outlined in the proposal, but that she disagrees with other requirements it demands, including those that would restrict free expression.

“Fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone,” Dr. Kornbluth wrote.

A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, said in a statement that “any university that refuses this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform higher education isn’t serving its students or their parents — they’re bowing to radical, left-wing bureaucrats.”

“The best science can’t thrive in institutions that have abandoned merit, free inquiry, and the pursuit of truth,” she added. “President Trump encourages universities to join us in restoring academic excellence and common sense policies.”

The White House has said it wants responses from the universities by Oct. 20. The other eight colleges are the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia.

The idea of the compacts has been deeply unpopular among faculty members and free speech advocates, who view them as yet another political intrusion into the affairs of academia. They argue that the Trump administration is threatening the independence of American higher education by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding to force top universities to adopt its agenda.

But at a politically sensitive moment, as schools are trying to avoid being singled out by the administration, most of the universities’ responses have been noncommittal.

“Brown’s course of action should and will be informed by the perspectives of our community,” Christina Paxson, its president, said in a message to the community on Friday.

Some schools, like the University of Virginia, have turned to the time-tested higher education strategy of delaying controversial decisions by creating a committee.

A letter from university board leaders to faculty said on Wednesday that the school’s response would be guided by principles of academic freedom and free inquiry and that the board “has no intention of abandoning the university’s principles,” according to a copy of the letter.

Others expressed what appeared to be concern about the compact but did not shut the door on signing it.

“I am deeply committed to Dartmouth’s academic mission and values and will always defend our fierce independence,” Dartmouth’s president, Sian Leah Beilock, wrote last week.

“You have often heard me say that higher education is not perfect and that we can do better,” she wrote, “At the same time, we will never compromise our academic freedom and our ability to govern ourselves.”

The University of Pennsylvania’s president hit a similar note.

“The long-standing partnership with the federal government in both education and research has yielded tremendous benefits for our nation,” J. Larry Jameson, Penn’s president, said in a message on Sunday.

“Penn seeks no special consideration,” he continued. “We strive to be supported based on the excellence of our work, our scholars and students, and the programs and services we provide to our neighbors and to the world.”

While university leaders have walked a tightrope, faculty members on those campuses have been more forceful. The American Association of University Professors, a faculty rights group and union, lauded M.I.T.’s decision to reject the compact.

“The ability to teach and study freely is the bedrock of American higher education,” Todd Wolfson, the group’s president, said in a statement. “We applaud M.I.T. for standing up for academic freedom and institutional autonomy rejecting Trump’s ‘loyalty oath’ compact. We urge all institutions targeted by the administration’s bribery attempt to do the same.”

The University of Virginia faculty senate called on its president to reject the compact, saying it threatens the school’s independence and “likely violates state and federal law” by infringing on constitutional rights. Sixty faculty members supported the resolution and only two opposed it.

The compact has complicated negotiations between the Trump administration and individual schools, including Harvard, who worry it is a sign that even if they reach a deal with the administration, the government will come back and ask for more concessions. Among the schools asked to join the compact are Brown and Penn, which had already come to agreements with the Trump administration.

The University of Virginia has been engaged with the Department of Justice’s civil rights division about a potential deal for months. As part of those negotiations, the department pressured the school, saying that its president had to resign before it could resolve the investigations. The president has resigned and the school has been negotiating a potential agreement. Because the University of Virginia is a public school, the negotiations have become a flashpoint in the state’s governor’s race.

The offer of a compact has added a layer of complication to the ongoing talks, according to three sources involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Perhaps the most enthusiastic response came from the University of Texas at Austin, which is in a state that has aggressively tried to control what professors can teach in the classroom on sensitive topics like gender.

The chair of the system’s board, Kevin Eltife, a former Republican state lawmaker, said he was honored that the Austin campus was selected. “We enthusiastically look forward to engaging with university officials and reviewing the compact immediately,” Mr. Eltife said in a statement last week.

What we know:

Agents surrounded the vehicle in a school pickup line. Though the women were not there to collect any children, the incident happened as parents and students watched nearby.

In the video, one of the women says they were followed by ICE agents from Cicero to the West Loop — a distance of just over seven miles. The incident occurred around 2:51 p.m.

The video was recorded by a teacher named Eryn, who began filming after hearing screams.

She said she saw a woman named Jocelyn shouting that the agents did not have a warrant. Eryn said she was alarmed for the woman’s safety and well-being.

Later that day, Eryn said she heard from Jocelyn’s friends and family that both women were released, raising questions on whether any wrongdoing actually occurred.

""I was scared for Jocelyn's life… I didn't know what was about to happen. Even just talking about it right now. It just makes you feel very uncomfortable. That's not something that we want to see, it's not something that's fair, it's not something that's okay. I needed to cry because that was very scary. The last thing I saw was just them pushing them into their car. I didn't know where she was headed,"" Eryn said.

Even in the early days of the current Trump term, Canada and Europe were courting U.S. scientists.
Seventy-five percent of U.S. scientists polled by the journal Nature said they were contemplating leaving the country, according to a survey published in March.","Growing up, Omar Yaghi shared a room with his siblings—and some cattle—in Amman, Jordan, with no access to running water or electricity. The son of Palestinian refugees who “could barely read or write,” the University of California, Berkeley, researcher was captivated by chemistry at a young age after gazing at “stick and ball” models of molecules in a library. This week, Yaghi received a share of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on revolutionary materials called metal-organic frameworks.

Yaghi moved to the United States at 15 years old, initially attending community college and eventually receiving his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His path isn’t unique: Half of this year’s United States Nobel Prize winners in science are immigrants. Researchers with stories similar to Yaghi’s have propelled the country’s global scientific ascendance for generations. But with the increasingly restrictive immigration policies and science funding austerity enacted by the administration of President Donald Trump, the country’s top research rank—and future Nobel wins—hangs in the balance.

“The Trump administration is systematically discouraging international students and undercutting the research infrastructure that attracts them,” says James Witte, professor emeritus at George Mason University and former director of its Institute for Immigration Research. “Those students will find their academic homes elsewhere.”

“I think we will definitely see a long-run decline in U.S. science overall—measured by Nobel laureates.”

The U.S. wasn’t always the academic powerhouse it is today. Prior to World War II, Nobel laureates mostly hailed from European institutions—before the 1930s, scholars affiliated with U.S. institutions received less than 12 percent of all science Nobel Prizes. But as the country invested more in research and conflict rocked Europe, foreign scientists increasingly migrated to the states. Most famously, this exodus included Albert Einstein, who escaped Nazi Germany, eventually landing in the U.S., and Enrico Fermi, who fled fascist Italy by attending the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm and from there decamping to New York City. At the time, most researchers emigrating to the U.S. hailed from Europe, some of whom, like Fermi, contributed to the Manhattan Project.

This trend helped fuel the United States as it rocketed to scientific preeminence. From 1941 to 1950, researchers working at U.S. institutions represented 47 percent of all Nobel laureates in science categories, 19 percent of whom were immigrants.

“That was a period when the U.S. jumpstarted the golden age of science and innovation,” says Ina Ganguli, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Growing numbers of scientists from Asia, including India and China, began arriving in the U.S. in the 1960s. This coincided with the end of immigration quotas affecting Asian countries and, a decade later, the opening of China’s economy. The U.S. share of Nobels peaked between 1991 and 2000. During this period, U.S. scientists composed 72 percent of all academic Nobel laureates—a quarter of those prizewinners were immigrants.

Seeking bountiful academic opportunities, researchers and students across the world have continued to flock to the U.S. After receiving their Ph.D.s, the majority of international STEM students settle down here and start their scientific careers, some carving their path toward a Nobel or other accolades over the course of decades. One study, looking at the career trajectories of young medalists from the International Math Olympiad, found that those who immigrated to the U.S. went on to have more productive careers than those moving to other countries. This higher productivity in the U.S. has likely owed to more abundant resources and opportunity, says Ganguli, one of the paper’s authors.

Beyond awards, immigrants have outsized impacts on innovation—in 2011, 76 percent of patents awarded to the country’s top patent-producing universities “had at least one foreign-born inventor” on the team, according to a report from the Partnership for a New American Economy.

But over the past two decades, the share of international students at U.S. universities and colleges have declined. This is likely related to the rising costs of attending school here, Witte says, which are particularly prohibitive for people arriving from low- or middle-income nations. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with strict immigration policies from the first Trump administration, have likely also played a role, Ganguli adds.

Now, the Trump administration’s increasingly restrictive policies may exacerbate the slowing trickle of global academic talent to the U.S. by attacking academia on multiple fronts. For one, significant federal funding cuts and freezes threaten research programs that have long attracted people from around the world. Just getting here is becoming increasingly difficult. The administration introduced travel bans and restrictions affecting nearly 19 countries this summer, is ramping up vetting of student visas, and recently attached a hefty $100,000 fee to H-1B visa applications. This latter policy change could wreak “catastrophic setbacks” to U.S. research, according to higher education groups who recently filed a lawsuit challenging the fee.

Potential impacts on the U.S.’s Nobel chances likely won’t be obvious at first, says Patrick Gaule, an economist at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom who co-founded the Global Talent Fund, a non-profit that supports STEM students across the world. Over time, more young students could opt to attend universities in nations other than the U.S.—taking their award-winning smarts with them.

“It’s a very long gestation lag with the Nobels,” Gaule says, because it can take decades for one’s research to mature to the point that it’s recognized by these awards.

But an exodus of scientists already further into their careers could yield more immediate effects, Ganguli says. Even in the early days of the current Trump term, Canada and Europe were courting U.S. scientists. Seventy-five percent of U.S. scientists polled by the journal Nature said they were contemplating leaving the country, according to a survey published in March.

“If we go at this rate with more [immigration] restrictions, then I think we will definitely see a long-run decline in U.S. science overall—measured by Nobel laureates,” Ganguli says. “The big question is, how soon is that gonna come?”

U.S. District Court Judge for Western Washington Tiffany Cartwright issued a temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring that Martinez be released.
There’ve been similar rulings across the country in recent months, but that doesn’t mean every detainee is being released, Stock said.
“The class action covers hundreds of people, but people have to assert their status as a class member somehow,” Stock said.","An Anchorage restaurant worker who was detained by federal immigration officials in August has been released after a judge’s ruling in a class action lawsuit.

ICE arrested Santiago Martinez, a 30-year-old Mexican national seeking asylum in the U.S., on Aug. 11 outside the sushi restaurant where he worked and sent him to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington.

Martinez is one of at least 56 people detained by ICE in Alaska this year, according to the state Department of Corrections, which jails detainees under a contract with the federal government.

Immigration judges in Seattle were refusing to let detainees like Martinez out on bond, said Margaret Stock, Martinez’s lawyer. A legal advocacy group called the Northern Immigrant Rights Project filed a class action suit against the Seattle ICE field office, she said.

“They won their case, and they got an order from a federal judge saying that people cannot be detained, that their detention is unlawful,” Stock said.

U.S. District Court Judge for Western Washington Tiffany Cartwright issued a temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring that Martinez be released. He officially left ICE custody on Tuesday.

There’ve been similar rulings across the country in recent months, but that doesn’t mean every detainee is being released, Stock said.

“The class action covers hundreds of people, but people have to assert their status as a class member somehow,” Stock said. “And because Santiago had an attorney, me, I was able to assert his membership in the class and work with the lawyers to get the TRO issued. People who don't have an attorney, it's very difficult for them to deal with this situation.”

A regional ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Stock said she’s concerned over the high number of immigration detentions during Trump’s second presidency. The Department of Homeland Security is acting unlawfully and misrepresenting who’s being detained, she said.

“Although DHS claims they're only arresting criminals, that's not the case,” Stock said. “They're going after mostly people that are not criminals. They're going after people who are legally in the country, doing things that are perfectly legal, working legally.”

Stock said she plans to continue helping Martinez apply for asylum, now that he’s been released from detention.

“The screening of Borderland: The Line Within is meant to be generative,” Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic Studies, said.
The former is an organizer working to empower undocumented women through education on their rights as immigrants.
Yates and de Onís’ visits to various classes sparked conversations regarding the process of shooting and editing a documentary like Borderland.
And, yeah, maybe you can still argue about it, but what [Yates and de Onís] have shown is … there’s a point.","Pamela Yates and Paco de Onís visited Oberlin this week for the screening of their film, Borderland: The Line Within, at the Apollo Theatre. Over the course of their time in Oberlin, they visited classes, spoke with students, and hosted a Q&A following the film’s showing.

“The screening of Borderland: The Line Within is meant to be generative,” Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic Studies, said. “What they’re asking is, ‘What kind of things can be done now to prepare for future reckoning?’”

Yates and de Onís head Skylight, a nonprofit responsible for creating documentary films that center protagonists’ stories in the name of human rights and strengthening networks between activists. Faber, a longtime friend of Yates and de Onís, has helped organize past Skylight screenings at Oberlin, including that of their film, Granito: How to Nail a Dictator, which included outtakes from Yates’ prior work that were used as key evidence in the trial against Guatemala’s former dictator. Their latest film was created with past truth commission processes in mind. Faber noted that Latin America and the rest of the world may have much to teach the U.S. about exposing governmental abuses of power.

Paco de Onís, producer of Borderland, explained in an interview the importance of applying the same tools used by the government to track undocumented immigrants to monitor detention centers and removals of people from their homes and families by ICE. In the documentary, digital humanists analyze data on everything from these centers to companies and politicians with funds linked to ICE to demonstrate the vastness of the border industrial complex.

“They turn the tables,” de Onís said. “The whole point of journalism is a kind of surveillance of the government and society, in the sense that you’re bringing into account if there’s corruption, mishandling of government. Journalists can bring that to light.”

Together, Yates and de Onís are forging a path in documentary film that traces narratives back to those experiencing them and puts the authority in their hands. From there, narrators like Gabriela Castañeda and Kaxh Mura’l delve into their own experiences. The former is an organizer working to empower undocumented women through education on their rights as immigrants. The latter is a Guatemalan land activist who was forced to flee his home and seek asylum in the U.S. following death threats from a mining company.

“It’s important to realize what is being done and who’s doing it,” Faber said. “It’s the communities most affected that are also the most active resistors and the smartest resistors and the most inventive resistors. … The movie lays out what the interests are that are driving much of this so that the audience can come out more informed, more hopeful, and with a clearer sense of what they can do.”

The question of what could be done weighed on many students’ minds following the screening. As Yates described it, people become emotionally invested in the lives of those they’ve met in the film. During a Q&A following the Wednesday night showing, one student inquired about how Obies can use their privilege to help those who need it. Yates and de Onís pointed students to identify their local representatives and find out what is being paid for in their district by the border industrial complex, then voice their concerns. Yates in particular emphasized that all students should ensure that immigrants they know have their name, address, and phone number, in case they ever need to use it. More broadly, she spoke to the idea that everyone affects change differently, and the power is in one’s commitment to the cause.

“That is a great question,” Yates said. “And, I can’t really answer that for you. But what I can say is, you have to throw yourself into some activity … and become proximate to the immigrant community.”

In creating films that take years to come to fruition, Yates and de Onís place value back on long-term reporting. They tell compelling stories about complex issues in a moment when news is often reduced to a stream of information that can feel distant from peoples’ day-to-day lives. Borderland closes the gap by championing individuals and their place among the national headlines. Yates and de Onís know better than anyone what it is to devote themselves to the facts that build the basis for future justice.

In response to the screening and surrounding events, students have shown curiosity and gratitude. Yates and de Onís’ visits to various classes sparked conversations regarding the process of shooting and editing a documentary like Borderland. College first-year Griffin Larson-Erf spoke of his own interest in the field of journalism and said that the film reminded him why reporting is still valuable.

“Everybody says ‘tell the story, document’ … because we think it’s going to help.” Larson-Erf said. “We don’t actually know. And, yeah, maybe you can still argue about it, but what [Yates and de Onís] have shown is … there’s a point. … I’m glad the documentary exists, that all of their work exists, and I’m hopeful.”

Samantha Soto, College second-year, described at once the distinctiveness of each individual story in Borderland and the familiarity of the film’s sentiment as a child of immigrants.

“Having family members, friends that have been deported, the process of leaving your home country to go to the United States … [they’re] experiences that aren’t too out of this world,” Soto said. “I’m glad more awareness about this is spreading to Oberlin.”",https://oberlinreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/masthead_alt.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:56.873635

The Department of Homeland Security has argued for months that “doxing” threatens its personnel’s safety, and is therefore an act of violence.
There’s no federal law specifically prohibiting “doxing.” But the act can break anti-harassment or cybercrime laws.
Miller argued that “doxing” existed on “a continuum of violence.” “It involves both organized doxing.
DHS, in a news release and in several posts on X, accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, of doxing.","The Trump administration says it’s cracking down on “organized doxing campaigns,” but free speech advocates worry its use of the vague term is conflating forms of protected speech with crimes, or most recently, domestic terrorism.

The administration has accused a Democratic lawmaker and activists who document enforcement operations of “doxing,” a nonlegal term that usually means exposing someone’s private or identifying information online. But as the administration stretches the meaning of the word, civil liberties groups are growing increasingly worried that it will intimidate people out of recording or reporting on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s activities with the threat of criminal charges.

The Department of Homeland Security has argued for months that “doxing” threatens its personnel’s safety, and is therefore an act of violence. In DHS’s own words, “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents.”

But there’s plenty of pushback to that interpretation.

“The law protects federal agents against disclosures of personal information made with the intent to threaten, intimidate, or incite crimes against them, but it doesn’t protect ICE agents from public criticism or justify this Administration’s efforts to silence dissent, investigate activists, and recast lawful organizing as ‘domestic terrorism,’” said Becca Branum, the deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Free Expression Project, in a statement to NOTUS.

There’s no federal law specifically prohibiting “doxing.” But the act can break anti-harassment or cybercrime laws.

Constitutional experts and former national security officials have already expressed discomfort with President Donald Trump’s newest public national security directive, which links some commonly held Democratic and progressive viewpoints to domestic terrorism — potentially subjecting more citizens to warrantless surveillance.

In that order, the president argues that online “doxing” is essential to so-called left-wing terrorist groups’ operations.

“These campaigns often begin by isolating and dehumanizing specific targets to justify murder or other violent action against them. They do so through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions,” the order reads, without providing examples or evidence.

“These campaigns then escalate to organized doxing, where the private or identifying information of their targets (such as home addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information) is exposed to the public with the explicit intent of encouraging others to harass, intimidate, or violently assault them,” the order goes on.

Last month, DHS issued a subpoena to Meta, demanding the social media company hand over information about accounts that posted about an agent for an “official, criminal investigation regarding officer safety,” calling it “Doxing.”

Federal judges so far have temporarily blocked the request for at least three immigration activists’ Instagram account information. Lawyers representing those users maintain that their clients didn’t break any laws.

“DHS’s Subpoena demanding that Meta disclose identifying information appears motivated by the government’s disdain for Doe’s viewpoint and a desire to chill Doe’s expressive conduct,” the ACLU of Northern California argued in its motion to quash the request.

In a separate motion filed on behalf of another user whose data was subpoenaed, the Civil Liberties Defense Center, an advocacy and legal defense nonprofit, argued that the request violated their client’s First Amendment right to anonymously engage in political speech.

“If they actually had evidence that someone violated one of the federal cyber laws, for which there are many, they would utilize those, but they don’t,” said Lauren Regan, an attorney with the CLDC. “That speaks to the true intention of subpoenas like this, which is to try and chill Americans from engaging in this First Amendment-protected activity in criticizing, or drawing attention to, ICE and the government.”

A judge last week temporarily blocked Meta from complying with the government’s request for that user’s information.

When it comes to the administration’s focus on what it sees as left-wing terrorism, doxing is clearly top of mind. A reporter pressed White House senior adviser Stephen Miller on Monday about the “vast” networks he’s claimed are responsible for recent high-profile shootings. Miller argued that “doxing” existed on “a continuum of violence.”

“It involves both organized doxing. It involves violent threats and intimidation. It involves explicit calls to commit violence against a targeted person, and then that tends to escalate into physically violent and obstructive acts,” Miller said. “It’s this continuum that we see over and over again, where they’re trying to use illegal violence and intimidation to disturb the operations of the federal government and federal personnel.”

“Who’s ‘they?’ Antifa isn’t actually an organization, right?” the reporter asked, as Miller moved onto the next question. In response to questions from NOTUS, the White House did not clarify which specific organizations Miller was talking about, or address civil liberties’ groups concerns.

“Left-wing, anti-Trump organizations are constantly looking for new ways to criticize the President’s popular efforts to Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in a statement, referring NOTUS to “the President’s antifa roundtable highlighting the countless examples of radical left-wing violence that his executive action will address.”

Doxing did not come up at that meeting, and the White House didn’t clarify how it distinguishes protected speech from doxing.

But plenty of case law protects people who post truthful information that serves the public interest, including people who film and identify DHS personnel, said David Greene, the civil liberties director with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“There might be governmental interest in shielding people from harassment, but then the government has to tailor their response to actually the harassment, not the mere identification,” Greene said. “The fact that someone is involved in something, that’s a matter of public interest — not typically something that would be considered ‘doxing.’”

Greene added that prosecutors attempting to go after people the Trump administration considers doxers would mean that the government still has to prove that the publisher intended for an illegal result to happen, according to existing statutes.

“Merely calling something ‘doxing’ doesn’t really have any type of legal effect. It’s just a rhetorical characterization,” Greene said.

If throwing around “doxing” is intended as a rhetorical tool, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has a history of using it loosely, and often.

DHS, in a news release and in several posts on X, accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, of doxing. The administration alleged that he shared an ICE official’s business card “with members of the violent mob” at a farm raid in Carpinteria, California, which DHS said resulted in someone throwing a rock at an ICE employee.

“ICE’s ‘doxing’ claims are completely unfounded. Their on-site public relations officer voluntarily handed me a business card in full view of TV cameras, reporters, and dozens of livestreamers,” Carbajal wrote in a statement to NOTUS. “To characterize it as ‘doxing’ is a deliberate distortion, and an attempt to mislead the public and deflect accountability for their aggressive actions that day, which endangered numerous civilians.”

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

DHS routinely argues that its personnel wear masks to protect them from “doxing.” DHS and Republicans have generally characterized Democratic efforts to prohibit that policing tactic as an effort to subject federal law-enforcement personnel to acts of targeted violence.

The administration’s rhetoric about so-called doxing is especially worrying organizations representing photojournalists — people who might find themselves documenting and publishing identifying photos of federal law-enforcement personnel as part of their job.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/8471c3f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5587x3143+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2F4d%2F55e870b749f19567b856a2b2079d%2Fap25129668082609.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 23:57:01.257603

Presidential removal authority became accepted over time as a “practical construction” of the President’s executive power under the Constitution.
In other words, removal authority was established through historical practice, just like the limits on removal authority that later developed for multimember regulators.","The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) is led by three presidentially appointed members who may be removed from office only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. In 2025, President Trump attempted to fire FLRA Chair Susan Tsui Grundmann without cause, in violation of the FLRA’s governing statute. President Trump asserts that the FLRA’s leadership structure is unconstitutional because it allows the President to remove the agency’s members only for good cause, not at will. After Grundmann sued, a federal district court held that her attempted firing was unlawful, and the Trump administration appealed this ruling. In October 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in support of Grundmann.

President Trump argues that under the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, the FLRA’s members must be removable at will by the President. Our brief shows why this is wrong.

We first demonstrate that Seila Law did not call into question the legitimacy of agencies structured like the FLRA, sometimes referred to as multimember independent agencies. As we explain, Seila Law addressed only the relatively new phenomenon of an agency led by a single director who is not removable at will. Based on three unique features of these single-director independent agencies, the Court concluded that they represent a novel intrusion on presidential authority that clashes with constitutional structure. The Court was clear, however, that it was not overruling its precedent upholding similar removal limits for the leaders of “a traditional independent agency, run by a multimember board.” None of the reasons the Supreme Court gave for striking down the leadership structure of the CFPB in Seila Law apply to the FLRA—a traditional multimember agency that resembles agencies dating back 150 years in every constitutionally significant way.

Our brief next explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt. In separation-of-powers cases, courts place significant weight upon historical practice, because it embodies the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of government themselves have reached. Congress has been assigning regulatory authority to multimember independent agencies for most of the nation’s history, beginning nearly 150 years ago. Supreme Court decisions, including Seila Law, have consistently confirmed the validity of these traditional agencies.

Finally, the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. The Constitution does not address removal, and there was no agreement at the Founding that presidents had inherent or exclusive removal authority. Instead, the topic was vigorously debated. Presidential removal authority became accepted over time as a “practical construction” of the President’s executive power under the Constitution. In other words, removal authority was established through historical practice, just like the limits on removal authority that later developed for multimember regulators. These two doctrines do not conflict: both reflect established practice that settled what was initially a constitutional ambiguity.

In short, the FLRA’s leadership structure is consistent with Supreme Court precedent and established practice, and the attempt to fire Chair Grundmann without good cause was unlawful.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:58:34.640306

There are, to be sure, cars at the stoplights near the corner of corners: Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road.
“But Canadians make up about 3% to 3.5% of all the visitors that come to Las Vegas.
“People from California,” said Diana Valles, president of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Juanny Romero opened seven high-design cafes in Las Vegas called Mothership Coffee Roasters.","The travel and tourism industry contributes $2.9 trillion to the U.S. economy, bigger even than the size of the automotive industry. But can travel and tourism thrive at a time when the U.S. is working to overhaul border and trade policy?

Las Vegas, Nevada, had been a red-hot spot for travel and tourism in America, but, right now, the economy there is being dealt some tough hands.

Take dinner time on a weeknight, for example. There are, to be sure, cars at the stoplights near the corner of corners: Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. But traffic’s a breeze. Next month, a big Formula One event should bring a surge of racing fans.

And since it’s Vegas, you’ll always find some hubbub.

“I'm a big TikTok person,” said Ashley, from Toledo, Ohio. “So everything says it's going to be dead here. It's a dying city. And we're like … it's not that dead.”

So not totally empty, but using the August figures, the number of visitors is down 6.7% from a year earlier. And under the video canopy covering Fremont Street downtown, foot traffic is also sparse. Leah and Claes are part of a Dutch and Belgian tour group out sipping refreshment. They came, but, “some people of our group, they skipped the trip because the situation here in the U.S.,” Leah said.

That situation being hardened borders and a global trade war, along with higher fees to come into the U.S. and other restrictions for people without U.S. passports. For instance, the early fall has typically been prime time for people from Mexico and points South to come. But this time, many Latin-themed events got canceled. As for that other part of North America President Donald Trump talks of adding to the United States?

“Canada's down, probably the most significant of anyone, by some measures, down 30% over where they were a year or two ago,” said Jeremy Aguero at Applied Analysis. “But Canadians make up about 3% to 3.5% of all the visitors that come to Las Vegas. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's an impact.”

Among the down spots are what people here call “the three Cs”: visitors from Canada; China, with its property market mess hitting disposable incomes there; and, one more “C.” Not a country but the adjacent state.

“People from California,” said Diana Valles, president of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, Nevada. “And with all these raids and deportation and all these anti-immigrant messages that are going on right now, people — they don't feel good coming in here. They're fearful.”

“We're seeing layoffs,” she added. “We're seeing restaurant closures. People are nervous just to, like, go to the grocery store. Yeah, the people are nervous just to go to church. Even if you are documented … you never know what's going to happen. Is it your profile? When we heard people saying that they're going to deport criminals, we're OK about that. Our members are not OK to deporting people, working people, just because the way they look.”

Another shift engineered in Washington that’s percolating into every regional economy — this one included — are new import taxes, the tariffs.

Juanny Romero opened seven high-design cafes in Las Vegas called Mothership Coffee Roasters.

“Oh, my goodness. The majority of coffee is from Brazil,” she said. “And it's like, just because the president doesn't like the way the Brazilian president is talking to him, we're going to impose a 50% tariff and literally change everything overnight.”

Mothership has deals with women-owned suppliers of raw beans in Brazil — relationships not easily switched to lower-tariff countries.

“The most important thing is, like, we care from beginning to end, and that's what makes coffee really cool and relevant,” she said. “But with these things going on, a lot of roasters aren't able to care as much because prices are going up. They can't afford to care and charge their customer like — you can't charge your customer $40 for a bag of coffee. That's insane.”

Here’s how Aguero see this: “Any of these things, if it was just one of them, you and I wouldn't be even talking,” he said.

“But the combination of conflict in Washington, D.C.; conflict around the world; the fact that consumers are feeling uncertain — all of that is converging today into this very difficult circumstance that we see ourselves in,” he said. “Do I think it's permanent, like structurally unsound? No, I do not.”",https://img.apmcdn.org/b8285eff7e180461938c24535013bf06d6f7c971/widescreen/d98582-20251008-las-vegas-slowdown-tourism-trump-economic-immigration-policy-2000.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:52.149635

“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”","The Department of Homeland Security has condemned the “dangerous” doxxing of immigration agents and their families as the agency pleads to dial down the pervasive and escalating rhetoric emanating from lefty politicians and media outlets.

“The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

“Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

DHS says not only have threats increased against its agents, but assaults have skyrocketed by 1,000% in recent months as the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown.

The menacing incidents have come in the form of vicious, profanity-laced voicemails and social media postings revealing the home addresses of the federal officers, leading to several arrests.

Three women were indicted last month for allegedly stalking an ICE agent from the Los Angeles Civic Center to his home, livestreaming the unhinged pursuit on their Instagram accounts while providing detailed directions to their followers.

When they arrived at the agent’s home, they continued streaming while shouting to bystanders that their “neighbor is ICE,” “la migra lives here” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know.”

They publicly disclosed the agent’s home address and encouraged viewers to “come on down,” according to the US Attorney’s Office of the Central District of California.

On Sept. 22, a 68-year-old man was busted in San Diego after he posted the home address of an ICE attorney online and urged people to harass her, or even “swat” her, a dangerous harassment tactic where fake emergency calls are made to provoke an armed response by law enforcement.

The hateful messages continued with a vile voicemail left for a Texas ICE officer’s spouse, comparing them to Nazis and outright threatening their family.

“I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F–k you, f–k your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F–k you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family,” an unidentified female said on the line, her voice dripping with contempt.

Another agent’s spouse received a message on Facebook from an account apparently with the sender’s full name, Robert Buckley, warning, “your husband, the ice man, is a f–k and retribution will come your way eventually.”

“These types of threats against our brave ICE law enforcement officers and their families are disgusting. These officers risk their lives every day to arrest murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our communities,” McLaughlin said, slamming the harassment campaigns.

Members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, early Thursday morning.","The US Department of Defense has yet to say directly whether any National Guard troops remain inside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, a day after a federal judge temporarily halted a National Guard deployment to the state.

CNN on Friday asked the Department of Defense whether any National Guard troops remained inside the Broadview facility Friday, including members of the Texas National Guard seen entering it earlier in the week.

In an emailed response, the department said: “As a matter of longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.”

“The federalized National Guard personnel will remain in a federalized status; we don’t have any other details to provide at this time,” the Defense Department email reads.

The statement is identical to one the Defense Department released Thursday.

A CNN crew in Broadview did not see any National Guard troops outside the facility on Friday morning.

Before Thursday’s ruling, the Trump administration federalized National Guard troops from Texas and deployed them to Illinois, arguing the troops were needed “to protect federal property and personnel who are executing federal law.”

US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Illinois Army National Guard before retiring as a lieutenant colonel, slammed the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard in American cities in a Friday news conference outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois.

Duckworth made her comments as she and a fellow Illinois Democrat, US Sen. Dick Durbin, visited an ongoing protest outside the Broadview facility.

The site is a flashpoint in the legal battle over the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the Texas National Guard to Illinois and send some to the Broadview facility. A federal judge Thursday temporarily halted the deployment, and no troops were seen outside the Chicago-area facility this morning, though some were seen entering it earlier in the week.

Duckworth said both she and Durbin tried to enter the facility Friday to “see what the conditions are, and they would not let us in.”

“You don’t run and hide if you are proud of what you’re doing. That’s what ICE is doing right now,” Duckworth said. “This is not America. This is not what this democracy is about.”

Duckworth also said she believes the Trump administration is trying to “normalize” the presence of troops on American streets.

“They are trying to normalize an extension of presidential power that is not appropriate under the Constitution,” she said.

“Our National Guard men and women are doing a fantastic job, but you know what? They signed up to be tank drivers. … They should be practicing to defend America against our enemies around the world, and that’s what they would rather be doing.”

CNN has asked the Department of Defense whether any National Guard troops remained inside the Broadview facility Friday, including those seen entering it this week. In an emailed response, the department did not answer the question directly, but said, “As a matter of longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.”

“The federalized National Guard personnel will remain in a federalized status; we don’t have any other details to provide at this time,” the Defense Department email read.

Speaking Friday outside the Broadview Immigrations, Customs and Border Patrol facility – which has become a flashpoint in the debate over the National Guard deployment –US Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he agreed with the federal judge who temporarily halted the Trump administration’s plans to deploy troops in the state.

“She said that the information given to the court was unreliable. It’s a point we made over and over again. This is totally unnecessary,” Durbin said of the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the Texas National Guard.

“If you want to fight crime this is … a diversion of law enforcement from what they can be doing in our neighborhoods to make them safer,” he added. “This political theater may have a lot of opportunities for television and such, but it doesn’t get the job done in fighting crime.”

Durbin made the comments while visiting the protest site outside the Broadview facility with US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois.

Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen who was shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent last weekend in Chicago after she allegedly rammed a CPB vehicle, was indicted Thursday on one count of forcibly impeding, intimidating or interfering with federal agents using a “deadly and dangerous weapon.”

Martinez was scheduled to appear in court today, but the hearing was canceled following the indictment. Her attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN he expects an arraignment to be scheduled next week.

A 21-year-old man, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, was indicted on the same charge as Martinez.

The Department of Justice says both Ruiz and Martinez boxed in and struck a federal government vehicle. The Department of Homeland Security previously said that CBP agent fired “defensive shots” at Martinez.

But her lawyer disputes that account. Parente said body camera footage, which he said he viewed but has not made public, shows an agent saying “Do something, b*tch” to another agent before engaging with Martinez.

“To me, that’s someone looking for a problem,” Parente said.

The video, the attorney said, shows a CBP vehicle swerving into Martinez’ vehicle — not the other way around, as the charging complaint claims. Then, “within seconds” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez.

The charging complaint says a CBP agent shot at Martinez five times. Parente said she suffered five gunshot wounds.

National Guard troops were seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump’s federal task force, which faces multiple legal challenges.

At least nine National Guard troops began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in Memphis.

It was unclear how many Guard members were on the ground or expected to arrive later.

During an NAACP Memphis forum on Wednesday, Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped Guard personnel would help direct traffic and have a presence in “retail corridors,” but not be used to operate checkpoints or anything similar.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he never requested the Guard come to Memphis. But after Trump announced the Guard’s deployment on September 15 and Republican Gov. Bill Lee agreed, Young and other officials said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.

Members of the National Guard were absent Friday from outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, a day after a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration’s deployment of Guard troops in the state.

When CNN arrived at the facility Friday morning – located about 13 miles from downtown Chicago – no Guard members could be seen outside the facility or on the roof, where they’d been staged in previous days.

“We do not see a single member of the National Guard,” CNN’s Whitney Wild told Kate Bolduan from outside the facility.

Instead, local law enforcement observed as a group of protesters occasionally erupted in boos and jeers as vehicles passed.

Members of the Texas National Guard had arrived at the facility Thursday. Although they did not appear to be outside the facility today, it’s unclear where they are or if they’ve returned to an Army training base about 40 miles away, where they had been staging earlier this week.

Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated which type of personnel was absent outside the facility.

Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt criticized the deployment of the Texas National Guard into Illinois during an interview with the New York Times Thursday, saying it goes against his beliefs in states’ rights.

While he said he supports the National Guard’s mission to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, he thinks the president should have federalized the Illinois National Guard first, saying he worries about the precedent set for future presidents.

Stitt is the first Republican governor to speak out against the tactic. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, however, joined two filings in the Portland and Chicago cases supporting the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard.

“We believe in the federalist system — that’s states’ rights,” he told the Times. “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”

“As a federalist believer, one governor against another governor, I don’t think that’s the right way to approach this,” he said.

Stitt, who is also a chair for the National Governors’ Association, said he is speaking for himself and says his views don’t represent the organization. CNN has reached out to Stitt’s office for comment.

A federal judge says Immigration and Customs Enforcement must remove the 8-foot-high metal security fence on a street in front of its building in Broadview, Illinois, which has been the site of intense protests.

The village of Broadview, a Chicago suburb, filed suit, saying the fence had been installed in the middle of a public roadway without local government permission or permits.

Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, had blamed the situation on Broadview.

“Local inaction has enabled agitators to escalate violence and placed federal offices, first responders, and Broadview residents in harm’s way,” Lyons wrote in a letter to village officials. “If our officers were provided the support they need, the crowd control … would not be necessary.”

Hunt ordered both sides to submit a proposal by mid-afternoon Friday to determine a deadline and process to dismantle the fence, which has been in place since September 22.

Editor’s Note: Since this post was first published, the court record has been updated to reflect that today’s scheduled hearing for Marimar Martinez was canceled after she was indicted by a grand jury on Thursday. Her next court appearance has not yet been scheduled.

LEARN MORE: Woman shot by CBP agent indicted, will not appear in court today

Marimar Martinez, an American citizen who was shot by a Border Patrol agent in Chicago last Saturday during an altercation, will appear in court Friday to face a charge of “forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin described the shooting as “defensive” and claimed the suspect was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” But Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN on Monday the federal agents were being provocative.

Parente said body camera footage of the incident showed a Customs and Border Protection vehicle swerving into his client’s car, not the other way around as the charging document says. He also claimed the video shows one agent saying to another, “Do something, b**ch” before engaging with Martinez.

“To me, that’s someone looking for a problem,” he said.

Parente acknowledged Martinez had a handgun in her purse at the time of the incident but says his client – who has a concealed-carry license – did not brandish it and has no criminal record.

CNN has requested the CBP body camera video, but federal authorities have not released it. Parente is not allowed to share a copy of the video because it is covered under a protective order from the court.

In a criminal complaint, Martinez was described as part of a “convoy of civilian vehicles” that was “aggressively” following a Chevy Tahoe with three Border Patrol agents inside through Chicago streets, attempting to “box-in the CBP Vehicle.”

After the vehicle was sideswiped by Martinez, according to an FBI affidavit, a Border Patrol agent exited their SUV and fired on the car driven by Martinez five times.

Martinez drove to a repair shop a mile away, according to the complaint, and called 911. She was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where a nurse said she was treated for gunshot wounds, the complaint states. Martinez was later released from the hospital and is free on a $10,000 bond.

CNN’s Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.

After video of a Chicago pastor being repeatedly shot by pepper balls during a demonstration outside of an ICE facility went viral, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order Thursday to limit the types of force and crowd-control measures agents can use against protesters.

The judge’s order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from firing various types of less-lethal projectiles and chemical irritants and from “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual.”

In an interview with CNN, Rev. David Black said agents shot him in the head and the face and “multiple times” in his chest, arms and legs during a September 19 demonstration outside of an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.

“I was shielded by the bodies of others who were there, who rushed in to support me and took many more hits that were intended for me,” Black told CNN. “We could hear them laughing as they were shooting us from the roof … It was deeply disturbing.”

The future of National Guard troops now standing by for deployment in Portland, Oregon, is in the hands of a three-judge appeals panel in San Francisco, following a hearing in which the conservative majority expressed skepticism that President Trump’s orders could be constrained.

The attorney representing Oregon argued that the protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that have been going on for months are no longer experiencing the violence cited by Trump in his original order and the current clashes can be handled by non-military means.

The appeals court did not give a timetable for when it will make a decision.

Even if the Trump administration gets the stay they are requesting, Guardsmen would still be prohibited from mobilizing in Oregon under a separate order by District Court Judge Karin Immergut, who is also a Trump appointee to the bench. But administration attorney Eric McArthur said if their appeal is successful, they will ask Immergut to immediately cancel her order, which is scheduled to expire on October 19.

CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report from Portland.

The mayor of Chicago declared victory Thursday over the Trump administration’s efforts to mobilize the military in that city – at least for the next two weeks.

“This ruling is a win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement after US District Court Judge April Perry blocked any National Guard troops from being deployed in Illinois until at least the end of the day on October 23.

The decision came at the end of a contentious hearing that stretched on for hours in a Chicago courtroom, with Perry – a Biden appointee – expressing strong skepticism that continuing protests outside a suburban Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility prevented federal agents from doing their jobs.

The Trump administration immediately announced it will appeal the ruling. That appeal had not been filed with the court as of Friday morning.

Unlike the judge in a similar case in Portland, Oregon, Perry did not suspend President Trump’s order federalizing hundreds of Illinois guardsmen against the wishes of the government, and the administration says there will be no change to their status.

Members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, early Thursday morning. It’s not clear if they will remain there or go back to a base 40 miles away where they were staging when they first arrived from Texas.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul declined to speculate on what would happen if the troops don’t leave the ICE facility, saying if they believe the judge’s order isn’t being followed, the state will take that up with the court. But he added the Texas troops do not have to leave the state as long as they are not mobilized.

“They’re welcome to stay at our hotels if they pay the hotel rate,” said Raoul. “They’re welcome to eat at our restaurants like any American city.”

Francisco Miranda, 46, was leaving work on Friday, Oct. 4, when he was approached by two plain-clothed immigration officers wearing masks, who repeatedly told him that he was “here on an overstay,” meaning he had stayed in the country longer than he was allowed as a non-citizen.

Miranda recorded much of the interaction on his cellphone before it was confiscated by immigration officials. The video appears to show officers asking him repeatedly where he was born, which he responded was in California.

Miranda’s attorney, Michael Fuller, wrote in a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, that Miranda showed the officers his Oregon driver’s license, but officers handcuffed him, struck him so hard they knocked him to the ground, then placed him in the back of an unmarked van.

Miranda was taken to the ICE facility in Portland and detained for hours, Fuller said.

He was eventually released, Fuller said, “without being given any legitimate reason for his abduction.”

Miranda’s arrest was first reported by Willamette Week.

In the days since Miranda’s arrest, Congresswoman Janelle Bynum has called for an investigation into what happened, saying that raids by ICE are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act of the mid-1800s, when law enforcement would hunt down runaway slaves.

“That was a dark and shameful time in our nation’s history,” Bynum wrote in a statement. “We must not allow that to repeat. Masked federal agents aren’t welcome in our state and they can’t keep kidnapping Americans.”

The Milwaukie City Council has also condemned the actions.

“This is not just unconstitutional, it is immoral,” the council wrote in a shared statement, “It represents an affront to the basic values of our nation and to this community: dignity of the individual, compassion for our neighbors, fairness under the law, and respect for human life.”

Miranda’s case is not unique. The agency has been criticized for detaining, and sometimes deporting, U.S. citizens by mistake several times over the years. Reports of such incidents have increased over the past year, since the Trump administration expanded ICE’s mission, giving them more authority to find people living in the U.S. illegally.",https://oregoncapitalinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/10/IMG_1772-1536x1152-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:58:09.810169

While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.","Greenbelt, Maryland — A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about Trump administration plans to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to a prison in his home country earlier this year before he was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned what is standing in the way of immigration authorities removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, a country that he has said is his preferred place to go and which has indicated it is willing to accept him.

Xinis also repeatedly expressed frustration with testimony from a U.S. immigration official, Jonathan Schultz, who appeared to answer questions about the administration's next steps regarding Abrego Garcia's potential removal to Eswatini, a small African nation formerly known as Swaziland, or other countries, including Costa Rica.

Xinis told Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, that the government presented a witness who ""knows nothing, and I mean next to nothing, about Costa Rica."" She said she gave specific directions about the scope of the testimony she was seeking, and said the Justice Department had again ignored those instructions, ""getting to the three strikes, you're out.""

The administration has attempted to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal case on charges of human smuggling plays out in Tennessee, but Xinis issued an order in August preventing immigration officials from removing him from the U.S. Xinis is weighing whether to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention moves forward.

Schultz, an official from Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the court that government officials have had discussions with numerous foreign nations about accepting Abrego Garcia upon his removal from the U.S.

Schultz said the U.S. reached an agreement with Eswatini to accept people deported from the U.S. and has made assurances they will be safe from torture and persecution. But he said Eswatini hasn't agreed to receive Abrego Garcia, specifically, and the Trump administration did not reach out to the African nation about him until Wednesday evening, according to Schultz.

Administration officials do not appear to have undertaken efforts yet to evaluate whether Abrego Garcia would be tortured, detained or face persecution if deported to Eswatini, Schultz said.

The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.

Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country ""is not accepting Abrego Garcia.""

""He cannot be deported to Ghana. This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,"" Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, the foreign affairs minister, wrote on Facebook. ""In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.""

Schultz said he is ""confident"" that once the Trump administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.

Ahead of the hearing, Xinis said she wanted the witness to have answers on what steps the government has taken to deport Abrego Garcia to Eswatini or any other country, including Costa Rica, which he designated as his preferred country of removal. The judge also said the administration official should be prepared to testify about what additional steps the government could take ""in the reasonably foreseeable future"" to deport Abrego Garcia.

Schultz revealed that he believes Eswatini entered into discussions about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed to the country after the government in Uganda declined to accept him. Abrego Garcia's lawyers received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security in late August informing them that he might be deported to Uganda. Documents obtained by CBS News in August indicated that the Trump administration and Uganda reached a deal for the East African nation to accept deportees.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have moved to free their client from federal immigration detention as his immigration case plays out, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision that found federal law does not permit ""indefinite detention"" for those the government seeks to deport. Detention should be limited to a ""period reasonably necessary"" to bring about their removal from the U.S, the high court ruled.

After being released from criminal custody on unrelated charges, Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody in late August, and his lawyers argue that his continued confinement is illegal. They wrote in a challenge to the legality of his detention that because the Trump administration has been relying on a ""purported"" final order of removal for Abrego Garcia from 2019, the ""presumptively reasonable period"" of detention would've expired in 2020.

Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, argued that his client has been in ""continuous confinement"" since March, when he was first arrested by immigration authorities and then deported to El Salvador, where he remained detained — with the exception of a brief weekend in August.

The ""U.S. government held the keys"" to Abrego Garcia's confinement at a Salvadoran prison, he said.

Rossman said the administration is ""0 for 3"" in finding a country that will accept Abrego Garcia for removal to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also said they confirmed with him that if the U.S. moved to deport him to Costa Rica, he would go.

The Costa Rican government said in an August letter to the top U.S. diplomat in the country that it intends to provide refugee status or residency to Abrego Garcia, and would accept him ""upon the conclusion of any criminal sentence he may serve in the United States of America.""

Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is ""intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.""

""They have spun the globe and picked various places,"" he said, to effectively ""fail on purpose"" by selecting countries that would be ""completely unpalatable"" to Abrego Garcia and lead him to express reasonable fear of persecution or torture that then have to be adjudicated — during which he would remain detained.

""That shows the real aim of the government, the improper aim, is a punitive one, which is just to keep him incarcerated,"" Rossman said.

Xinis questioned Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, about whether the Trump administration has had any conversations with Abrego Garcia and his lawyers about potentially being removed to Costa Rica given his designation of the country as the place where he wanted to be removed.

""Why hasn't there been?"" she said of discussions.

Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.

Xinis ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.

He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But Abrego Garcia remained detained for several more weeks because of concerns that he would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.

He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.

Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Maryland rejected a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to reopen his immigration case and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Last week, a federal judge in Tennessee said he believes the Justice Department's criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia may have been ""vindictive,"" writing on Friday that ""The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego's success."" The judge has not made a final ruling on those claims, and will allow for discovery and a hearing on Abrego Garcia's claims.

There are 62,000 people in immigration custody, Schultz, the immigration official said.

Since then, according to the petition, the asylum seeker had ""diligently attended every immigration court hearing” until ICE agents arrested him this past July at immigration court.
ICE did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request to discuss the habeas cases or Donato’s comments.
Weiner said she’s filed nearly a dozen habeas cases in the past few months alone, securing the release of roughly 28 migrants from ICE detention.
“Never in my country was I treated like this, like a criminal,” said Valera, describing his recent arrest at San Francisco’s immigration court.","As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests continue to soar across the country, federal judges in San Francisco are rebuking the agency over due process concerns and have ordered the release – at least temporarily – of dozens of immigrants being held in detention facilities across California and beyond.

The judges’ orders come in response to a wave of legal filings from attorneys representing immigrants being held in ICE detention – called “petitions for writ of habeas corpus” – arguing their clients are being illegally and indefinitely locked up without being afforded a pre-detention hearing in front of an immigration judge.

An NBC Bay Area review of 24 habeas cases filed in the Bay Area’s federal court district – involving 37 separate immigrants detained by ICE in recent months – found that in every case, judges have issued temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions granting the temporary release of those immigrants until their habeas petitions are resolved.

In a small handful of other cases, judges have yet to rule on the detainee’s motion for a temporary restraining order that would release them from ICE custody.

“The violation of constitutional rights is so egregious,” said Jordan Weiner, who heads the immigration defense program at the San Francisco nonprofit La Raza Centro Legal. “Just arbitrarily arresting someone who hasn’t missed any court hearings or hasn’t committed any crimes.”

Until recently, Weiner said her work typically focused on helping immigrants navigate their asylum cases, not fighting in federal court to free them from detention.

“That’s all changed because ICE agents have been waiting for them in court and arresting them,” said Weiner, who also serves on the San Francisco and San Mateo County Rapid Response Networks, which dispatch attorneys to provide legal aid when immigrants are detained by ICE.

In San Francisco, ICE agents have arrested dozens of immigrants – many of them asylum seekers – after hearings in immigration court, according to multiple Rapid Response Network attorneys. Others have been detained at routine ICE check-ins.

Immigration cases are considered a civil matter in the U.S., and immigrant rights advocates have slammed the agency for the widespread detention of people who are not being held in connection to an alleged crime.

One habeas petition, filed in late July, described the arrest of an asylum seeker who fled Peru and arrived in the U.S. nearly three years ago. When he first arrived in the U.S., according to the petition, federal agents “briefly detained him” before releasing him on his own recognizance with a notice to appear for removal proceedings in immigration court.

Since then, according to the petition, the asylum seeker had ""diligently attended every immigration court hearing” until ICE agents arrested him this past July at immigration court.

A day after the habeas petition was filed, federal Judge Trina Thompson issued a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to release the asylum seeker from custody.

“District courts have routinely granted temporary restraining orders barring the government from detaining noncitizens who have been on longstanding release in their immigration proceedings, without first holding a pre-deprivation hearing before a neutral decisionmaker,” Thompson wrote in her order.

The judge has since issued a preliminary injunction ordering the immigrant’s continued release from ICE custody until the resolution of his habeas case.

“He risks being separated from his family and community, and being subjected to ICE’s inadequate, subpar medical care,” Thompson wrote in her order granting the preliminary injunction. “The public has an interest in preventing constitutional violations, and Respondents-Defendants only risk minimal harm in delaying Petitioner-Plaintiff’s detention.”

For decades, immigration judges have been permitted to grant bond to migrants who were not deemed a safety threat – and who attended mandatory ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings – until their cases were resolved.

However, a July Department of Homeland Security policy memo stated that anyone who crossed the border without permission would be classified as “an applicant for admission” to the U.S, irrespective of when they arrived. According to the memo, those immigrants would be subject to mandatory detention and immigration judges – who serve under the Department of Justice, not the judiciary– lack the authority to hold bond hearings.

In September, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) – also under the executive branch – upheld the administration’s interpretation of the law. Government attorneys opposing the wave of habeas petitions hitting federal court have cited the BIA decision, and the underlying regulations, in support of keeping many immigrants in detention for the duration of their pending immigration cases.

Attorneys such as Weiner, however, say the new policy upends decades of tradition, and call the practice a violation of immigrants’ civil liberties.

“Our argument is that the constitution protects people from arbitrary deprivations of liberty,” Weiner said.

Time after time, federal judges are agreeing.

NBC Bay Area was in federal court in September when a seemingly frustrated Judge James Donato pressed an assistant U.S. attorney on why ICE continues to detain migrants without giving them a pre-detention hearing in front of an immigration judge.

“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney.

“There’s an easy answer here, government: Just give them a hearing,” Donato added.

ICE did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request to discuss the habeas cases or Donato’s comments.

Weiner said most, if not every federal judge in San Francisco, likely has at least one habeas case involving an ICE detainee on their plate, something that has not gone unnoticed by Donato.

“What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again and again and again in front of every judge in this district,” Donato asked.

Weiner said she’s filed nearly a dozen habeas cases in the past few months alone, securing the release of roughly 28 migrants from ICE detention.

Jorge Valera - an asylum seeker from Peru with no criminal record, according to his habeas petition – is one of the detainees a judge ordered ICE to set free.

“Never in my country was I treated like this, like a criminal,” said Valera, describing his recent arrest at San Francisco’s immigration court. “They shackled my feet. I am not a criminal, I am not a murderer.”

Valera said he was sent to a detention center in Arizona and spent a week in ICE custody before a judge ordered ICE to release him.

Weiner said her “little nonprofit” is focusing on what they can, but they’re hoping others will take up the cause.

“I just want to show that this is how they’re spending their time and resources,” Weiner said. “I’m hoping to shine a light on the lengths that the government is willing to go. They don’t care that the local AUSAs, the local government attorneys defending these cases are overworked and fighting losing cases over and over again.”",https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/10/ice-releases-1010-e1760102488903.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-10 18:57:50.013683

But the State Department has reported just three end-use violations to Capitol Hill.
The report added that the State Department hasn’t informed Congress what merits reporting and that it investigates violations inconsistently.
Yet the GAO found no formal procedures inside the State Department for making, recording, and sharing their decision-making process.
Overseas Defense Department staffers told the watchdog they’re using “professional judgment” to decide what should rise to the State Department’s attention because the State Department hasn’t defined the incident types, thresholds, or timelines.","On paper, the guardrails are clear. When the U.S. ships weapons overseas, partner governments promise three things: That they’ll use them only for authorized purposes, keep them secure, and not hand them off to third parties.

If those conditions are violated or serious suspicions arise that they are, the State Department is obligated to investigate and, in many cases, alert Congress.

In practice, however, a new Government Accountability Office report shows the system is ad hoc, with little guidance or follow through.

The State Department largely relies on overseas Defense Department officials for tips about potential end-use violations.

Since 2019, the Pentagon has flagged more than 150 incidents that could be violations. But the State Department has reported just three end-use violations to Capitol Hill.

The report added that the State Department hasn’t informed Congress what merits reporting and that it investigates violations inconsistently.

Experts in the arms trafficking and conflict monitoring are dismayed, calling the reported gaps an affront to both national and global security.

“It was really shocking to see how far the U.S had fallen behind,” said Kathi Lynn Austin, executive director of the Conflict Awareness Project, who added the number of potential incidents flagged was “extraordinary.”

“We are violating our law and not protecting our own security — at a time when there is so much volatility in the world,” Austin said. “We need to understand this is urgent, and Congress needs to push to maintain transparency and public trust in our arms dealings.”

The 39-page GAO report, published to little notice in September, lays out a simple mismatch: Defense personnel stationed abroad are often the first to see or hear about possible violations, but diplomats with the State Department haven’t told military officials clearly what to flag. (GAO, Pentagon, and State Department officials said the government shutdown left them unavailable to comment.)

In other instances of being tipped to potential violations, the GAO says, the State Department could not produce records showing whether anyone ever decided if the law’s reporting thresholds were met.

The Arms Export Control Act requires notifying Congress when there’s information that a substantial violation may have occurred regarding purpose, transfer, or security; it also requires reporting when an unauthorized transfer actually happens. Those are low thresholds for alerting the legislature, by design. Yet the GAO found no formal procedures inside the State Department for making, recording, and sharing their decision-making process.

In the report, the State Department agreed with GAO’s six recommendations, including providing concrete guidance to the Pentagon, standardizing investigations with timelines, and creating procedures for deciding and documenting what gets reported to Congress.

The GAO cannot force a federal agency to bend to its report and relies on voluntary compliance.

If the changes aren’t actually implemented, however, Congress will continue flying blind when it comes to U.S. arms sales negatively impacting national — and international — security.

The Misuse Pipeline

The mechanics of “end-use” sound bureaucratic, but the stakes aren’t. Around the world, U.S.-made weapons moves from legal sale to illicit use on the battlefield, stolen from depots, through corrupt commanders, transfers to proxies, or simple loss.

The results are everywhere. In Afghanistan, for instance, vast quantities of U.S.-supplied small arms and vehicles seeded regional black markets. Conflict Armament Research, a U.K. group that tracks conventional weapons, traced the Islamic State group’s ammunition stocks to dozens of countries — including U.S.-linked supply lines — often thanks to the chaos of collapsing units and unsecured stockpiles.

A recent Intercept investigation linked U.S manufactured rifle rounds to cartel slaughter in the heart of Mexico.

“The biggest concern for the average American citizen is the potential for these arms to be used against us,” said Brandon Philips, a public affairs professor at California State University, East Bay. “We are in a position right now where we aren’t everyone’s favorite country.”

When the government puts tracking systems in place, however, more of the leaks get plugged. In Ukraine — a challenging venue for containing arms flows because of the sheer quantity of material being introduced — early Pentagon watchdog reviews faulted shortfalls in tracking designated sensitive items amid an active war. Follow-ups found marked improvement as the U.S. expanded “enhanced end-use monitoring,” boosted staffing, and raised compliance rates.

Even with a partner government that has strong incentives to cooperate, effective control requires sustained, well-resourced checks. But the U.S doesn’t even have a system for how those checks should happen.

In its report, the GAO zeroed in on this vagueness. Overseas Defense Department staffers told the watchdog they’re using “professional judgment” to decide what should rise to the State Department’s attention because the State Department hasn’t defined the incident types, thresholds, or timelines.

The ambiguity increases the odds that important cases fall into a bureaucratic void, never formally investigated or reported. The GAO even found examples where one incident drew a full document review and coordination, while a similar one drew no action at all.

“A number of us for years have talked about insufficiencies around end-of-use monitoring, and this report continues to show the problems of how this is done,” said Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank. “The American people are attuned that a lot of harm is caused in the world by our weapons.”

The infrastructure exists to track weapons — the State Department has systems to vet its direct buyers, and the Pentagon has a program for enhanced end-use monitoring. But the GAO found that the connective tissue of such programs doesn’t.

“The fact that this report is mostly about things that happened during the Biden administration, and the second part of Trump, shows it’s a systemic problem. It shows that we are going sell things and not bother,” said John Lindsay-Poland, coordinator of the nonprofit Stop U.S. Arms to Mexico. Poland noted that the report only covers a small portion of government-to-government sales, while the bulk of U.S. arms exports are commercial sales and small arms.

“If your priority is selling stuff,” he said, “taking into account whether the stuff you’re selling is massacring people, destroying communities, strengthening terrorists and drug trafficking, or driving immigration is secondary.”

Gaza and Double Standards

The GAO’s accounting of the oversight vacuum comes at an incendiary moment.

In 2024, the Biden administration put a policy in place that required assessments of whether partners receiving U.S. arms in active conflicts were using them consistent with international humanitarian law.

In May 2024, the administration’s report to Congress concluded it was “reasonable to assess” that Israel had used U.S.-provided arms in ways “inconsistent” with international law in some instances, while adding that wartime conditions made case-by-case attribution hard. Human rights groups blasted the equivocation and urged suspensions; Israel rejected the accusations.

In February 2025, the new administration scrapped the policy.

The Gaza debate is precisely where a functioning end-use system should be strongest.

Independent investigators and journalists have documented repeated Israeli strikes that allegedly used U.S.-origin munitions against protected sites or in ways that were indiscriminate. The State Department’s own human rights reporting, before becoming hollowed out this year under President Donald Trump, catalogued grave harms.

Abramson, who has tracked global armament and misuse, said failure to monitor end-use violations and report them to Congress can put American foreign policy in a diplomatic chokehold.

“Around the world,” he said, “we are trying to make friends, But when they have seen our weapons being misused it undermines that ability, and makes us seem hypocritical, dangerous.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240008789-e1760106927494.jpg?fit=3960%2C1980&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-10 16:57:31.867274

(KABC) -- An Altadena woman has been detained by ICE after her family says she went in for her annual check-in. They're now desperate for her to be released.

Riya Khan never imagined she'd be visiting her mother, Masuma, behind bars. The 64-year-old is being held at the California City Correctional Facility since her appointment Monday took an unexpected turn.

""She went in for her annual check-in and that's when she was detained and taken,"" her daughter said.

Masuma Khan, originally from Bangladesh, has no criminal history. She came to the U.S. on a visa in 1997 when her daughter fell ill while visiting family.

Two years later, she was eager to get a green card. Her daughter says her mother was taken advantage of by someone who claimed they could help.

""He took her money and he was gone. She never got any notices, she never got any letters to appear in court or anything so she was just unaware.""

Since 2015, the Khan family has been working with attorneys as Masuma's husband, who is a U.S. citizen, petitioned for her green card.

The Florida Highway Patrol also participated in the raid. It happened at ""Outerspaces Landscaping"" on Cross Street.

This is the first ICE raid seen in the city limits. It was a quiet afternoon at the company.

Some employees who were returning from their shift say even people with the proper documentation were still detained while on the job.

A video shared with WEAR News news shows masked ICE agents swarming the property. Flashing lights from several law enforcement cars crowded the business.

A truck from the Escambia County Corrections Office was also on the scene to transport detainees.

McCaffrey is a community advocate and the owner of Latino Media Gulf Coast. She says upwards of 35 people were detained during this raid.

""From what I understand, they just swept up everyone who was Hispanic looking on site,"" said McCaffrey.

She was instead appointed to the Chicago federal bench.","For at least two weeks, National Guard troops won't be allowed to patrol the streets of Chicago after a judge blocked their deployment Thursday, citing no significant evidence of a “danger of rebellion.”

The Trump administration has, however, filed an appeal to that ruling.

The decision from U.S. District Judge April Perry was in response to a lawsuit filed this week by Chicago and Illinois and marked a temporary win for the city and state's Democratic leaders. It comes as President Donald Trump works to move troops into major urban areas, arguing they have a rampant crime crisis, despite statistics not always backing that up. Troops were expected to start patrolling Friday in Tennessee, and a court battle continued over Trump's plans to deploy them in Portland, Oregon.

But what will happen to the hundreds of troops already in Illinois, including a small number outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, remained unclear.

In U.S. District Judge April Perry's ruling, she said the administration violated the 10th Amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th Amendment, which assures due process and equal protection.

The judge said the order would expire Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. She set an Oct. 22 hearing by telephone to determine if the order should be extended for another 14 days.

State and city leaders celebrated the decision, including Gov. JB Pritzker, who said: “The court confirmed what we all know: There is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago.""

Local

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said they plan to take to the case to higher courts.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

Perry heard arguments in a crowded downtown Chicago courtroom from attorneys for the state of Illinois and the Justice Department.

She pressed Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton on whether National Guard troops would only be stationed around federal buildings or also in neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Hamilton responded that troops also could be used to “protect ICE agents” in the field.

Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime, though statistics show a significant recent drop in crime.

Perry referenced Alexander Hamilton in condemning the president’s actions.

“(The founders) would never believe that it would ever come to pass that one state militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” she said.

Officials at U.S. Northern Command directed questions to the Department of Defense, which declined to comment citing a policy that the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.

It marks the second major ruling surrounding Chicago immigration enforcement.

In a separate hearing, federal agents were ordered — temporarily — by a federal judge to wear badges and were banned from using certain riot control weapons against peaceful protesters and journalists outside the Broadview ICE facility.

The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis restricts agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving or tackling against protesters and journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

“(We’re doing this to) keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe, (and) we’re not gonna have it any more from these thugs,” Bondi said.

Perry, a President Biden appointee, was at first his nominee for U.S. attorney in Illinois, but that confirmation blocked by then-Sen. J.D. Vance. She was instead appointed to the Chicago federal bench.

And the Portland Police Bureau said its officers arrested two people around the facility. One person was arrested on a harassment charge, and the other one had a warrant for his arrest.

It was not immediately clear why the federal agents arrested the three people.

Two of the federal arrests happened shortly before 9:30 p.m. The gate to the ICE facility opened, and federal officers came out into the street. Someone started playing “The Imperial March,” Darth Vader’s theme song in the “Star Wars” movies.

Protesters and agents faced off in the street as a helicopter circled overhead, and then several agents took the two people into custody.

As federal agents led a man away, he yelled, “I’m innocent. I didn’t do anything.”

As the federal officers went back into the facility, officers fired pepper balls from the roof.

KATU was live streaming outside the facility as part of its ""24 Hours Outside ICE"" initiative and captured the federal agents taking the three people into custody. Watch the recorded stream below.

Later, federal agents appeared to try and arrest another person, but they were unsuccessful. That happened at about 11 p.m. Federal officers came out of the facility and then a group of them chased someone about a block east, but they did not catch up to that person.

At about 11:45 p.m., federal officers came out again and made their third arrest. The officers also took the man's guitar.

Other than during the arrests and the agents' unsuccessful apprehension of the other person, it was a party atmosphere outside the facility most of the night. People danced to music in inflatable costumes, like frogs, a polar bear, and other characters.

KATU reached out to ICE for additional information about the arrests.

Portland police have increased presence

There was a noticeable increase in the number of Portland police officers Thursday.

Protesters like Bianca Barrett took notice of the increased presence by Portland police.

""Yes, it definitely got a lot more aggressive and more cars and like patrols and bike police,"" she said.

One man, who would only give his first name, Horace, was a counter-protester from Illinois. He thought Portland police are taking sides.

""Sometimes I feel like they do let stuff get out of hand on some occasions. They don't pay attention that much to situations,"" he said.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day told reporters earlier there is ""no cover-up or collaboration.""

""Our job doesn't change. It's the same today as it was yesterday as it was six months ago,"" he said.

According to Portland police, officers have made 47 arrests since the protest began in June. Twenty-eight of those were in June.

In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R.","The American Civil Liberties Union and two Colorado law firms sued federal immigration officials Thursday in an effort to stop what the legal groups call the agency’s “indiscriminate stops and arrests” across the state.

The lawsuit brought in federal court in Colorado alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are arresting and detaining people because of their skin color, accent or perceived nationality to fulfill arrest quotas set by the Trump administration without determining probable cause and flight risk.

The firms are bringing the lawsuit on behalf of four people, including Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah student who was brought to the U.S. as a child. ICE arrested Dias Goncalves in June after a Mesa County Sheriff deputy pulled her over in Fruita and asked about her accent and immigration status. She spent 15 days in ICE’s Aurora detention center.

“Our state’s 169,000 undocumented immigrants, and hundreds of thousands more Latine Coloradans, now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the lawsuit said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

The lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Colorado, Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray, LLC, names three defendants: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons and Director of ICE’s Denver Field Office Robert Guadian.

ICE’s Denver Field Office referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE agents must have probable cause to believe the person they are arresting is living in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs in the case say they were arrested indiscriminately. All reported experiencing physical injuries, pain and hunger during their arrests or while in detention, according to the lawsuit.

Refugio Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father and lawful permanent resident who has lived in Colorado for 20 years and is the father of four U.S. citizen children. ICE agents in unmarked cars pulled him over in May when he was on his way to work in Grand Junction at the construction concrete company where he has worked for 18 years. ICE held him at the detention center in Aurora for more than 90 days, according to the lawsuit.

A 36-year-old asylum seeker identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. has lived in Colorado for 15 years. On Feb. 5, ICE agents raided the Whispering Pines Apartments complex, where he had lived for seven years. At the time, J.S.T. was leaving the apartment parking lot to drive to his job at a restaurant and grocery store when ICE agents arrested him. He spent four weeks at the Aurora detention center and lost his home as a result, according to the lawsuit.

That same day ICE agents conducted raids in at least seven apartment complexes and communities across Denver, Aurora, and Thornton, the lawsuit said. At some apartments, ICE agents knocked on every door, the lawsuit alleges, asking tenants to provide identification without a warrant.

A 32-year-old father and construction business owner identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. has lived in the U.S. for 11 years. In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R. was waiting as a designated driver for a friend. G.R.R. spent seven weeks at the Aurora detention center, according to the lawsuit.

“Plaintiffs and their families were devastated by the unlawful captures and now live every day in a heightened state of fear of again being separated,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to consider the plaintiffs as representatives of a class of all people in Colorado who have been arrested since Jan. 20, 2025, or will be arrested without a warrant and without “a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk.”

The lawsuit describes the similar experience of many other people whom ICE has arrested since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to deport “vicious and bloodthirsty criminals,” but also promised to execute “the largest deportation program in American history.” The resulting roundups of immigrants working in fields, attending court hearings or walking in their neighborhoods have included those with work permits, permanent residency cards and even U.S. citizenship.

In May, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said, “we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day” after reports from other news outlets that Miller and Noem had set the daily arrest quota. The administration later disavowed the quota after running into questions from federal judges about its constitutionality.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSCF2614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 14:57:24.404854

In campaign speeches, press conferences, and executive orders, President Donald Trump has relentlessly vilified Latin American immigrants as criminals, invaders, and burdens on the U.S. economy.[i] He has declared a “national emergency” at the southern border to justify authoritarian power grabs, deployed troops and razor wire against asylum-seekers, and fast-tracked deportations to countries like El Salvador — stripping people of due process and ignoring well-documented risks to their lives and safety.[ii] These tactics are not about border security; they are about scapegoating vulnerable people to obscure deeper systemic failure as corporations cash in.

As Trump and other politicians use immigration as a political weapon, the real crisis goes unexamined: the economic system that displaces people through trade and investment policies, exploits their labor upon arrival, and criminalizes their existence.

“This fight is ours, it’s our community’s, but it belongs to everyone. We all have to fight for them.” -David Huerta, President of the Service Employees International Union California. Original photo: David Crane, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG.

The consequences are felt beyond the border. Within communities, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is detaining Spanish-speaking American citizens, sweeping up Native Americans in immigration raids, and even deporting U.S. citizens.[iii] This targeting stems from hate-fueled bias, and a recent Supreme Court ruling has effectively sanctioned racial profiling and the unjust treatment of individuals whose only “crime” is their heritage.[iv]

Trump’s criminalization of migrants does nothing to address the U.S. economic policies that displace people across Latin America and extract profit at every step of their journey. Instead, it lines the pockets of a powerful corporate lobby: the private prison industry.

In his second term, President Trump has directed his administration to intensify its efforts to crack down on immigration. In the early days of the administration, ICE arrests averaged around 660 daily, but just four months later, the agency arrested a record 2,300 individuals in a single day.[v] White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made clear the administration’s goal is to increase arrests to 3,000 per day.[vi]

Detainment operations, conducted with militarized tactics and unmarked vehicles, have sparked widespread peaceful protests. In Los Angeles, community resistance was met with an unprecedented deployment of federal troops. The raids have affected diverse communities such as garment workers, day laborers, and local businesses, leading to mass arrests and heightened community unrest.[vii]

Private Prisons: Cashing In on Detained Migrants

The Trump administration’s xenophobic campaign rhetoric and ensuing ICE raids have proven highly profitable for private prison companies, especially GEO Group and CoreCivic. Since Trump took office, their stock value soared — GEO Group’s by 35% and CoreCivic’s by 57%.[viii] Their financial success is intricately linked to Trump’s policies, particularly his rescission of a Biden-era order aimed at reducing the use of private prisons.[ix] These companies run detention centers and create surveillance technology to monitor immigrants, capitalizing on the mass deportation strategy.

Lobbying

GEO Group and CivicCore have aggressively lobbied to expand immigration enforcement and detention to boost their revenue. Between 2008 and 2014, they collectively spent over $16 million on federal lobbying, targeting the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees immigration detention funding and policies.[x]

In 2017, during Trump’s first administration, GEO Group significantly increased its lobbying expenditures, spending $1.7 million — a more than 70% increase from the previous year — to influence policies related to immigration enforcement and detention. This marked the highest amount on record for a private prison contractor at the time.[xi]

In 2024, GEO Group reportedly spent $1.38 million, and CoreCivic allocated $1.77 million to federal lobbying, continuing their efforts to influence immigration and detention policies.[xii] In the first quarter of 2025 alone, GEO Group invested $350,000, while CoreCivic spent $490,000 on lobbying efforts.[xiii] These expenditures help secure favorable government policies that align with their business interests.

Government Contracts

That lobbying has paid off. Following its surge in lobbying in 2017, GEO Group announced it had won the Trump administration’s first federal contract for a new immigration detention center: a $110 million, 1,000-bed facility in Conroe, Texas.[xiv] GEO Group and CoreCivic have continued to benefit directly from mass deportation efforts, securing lucrative ICE contracts to run detention centers and provide detention beds. GEO Groups secured $747 million in contracts in 2023 alone, and CoreCivic received an ICE contract worth $2.2 billion, representing 30% of its total revenue.[xv]

The companies’ profit model thrives on the detention of immigrants, with “bed quotas” mandating a minimum number of immigration detention beds, thus ensuring a steady demand for facilities.[xvi] This “bed quota” policy, which guarantees payment of $150 per detainee per day, is funded by taxpayer dollars.[xvii] This financial incentive to maintain high incarceration rates further fuels the cycle of mass detention, as private interests profit from the very policies that fuel the raids targeting the displaced.

Revolving Door

The revolving door between government officials and high-ranking roles within companies raises serious ethical concerns. For example, Pam Bondi, Trump’s Attorney General, previously lobbied for GEO Group.[xviii] Most recently, David Bible, a top ICE official, left his position to become Executive Vice President at GEO Group, shortly after advocating for more funding to expand detention capacity and technology to monitor migrants — efforts that directly benefited his future employer.[xix]

Forced Labor and Inhumane Conditions

A key element of the profit-driven model is the exploitation of detainees as cheap labor. GEO Group, which operates 16 ICE detention facilities, has faced multiple lawsuits over inhumane labor practices, including forcing detainees to prepare meals, wash laundry, and scrub toilets for just $1 per day.[xx]

Forcing detainees to do this work for so little avoids the costs associated with hiring paid employees. A federal court ruled that GEO must pay $17 million in back wages, plus $6 million for “unjust enrichment” — still accounting for less than 1% of GEO’s total revenues in 2024.[xxi] Nevertheless, GEO Group is refusing to pay and vowing to “vigorously pursue all available appeals.”[xxii]

The company has also faced numerous lawsuits for mistreating detainees, including children.[xxiii] These conditions include moldy food, solitary confinement, and severe medical neglect, resulting in preventable deaths.[xxiv]

In 2023, GEO Group was sued for using toxic chemicals to clean its facilities, causing detainees to fall ill and suffer long-term health consequences.[xxv] Such inhumane conditions are unacceptable under any circumstances. Importantly, migrants detained in ICE centers are not criminals. They are held in legal limbo while an immigration judge determines whether they should be deported.

Booming Business

As the mass detainment of migrants following ICE raids intensifies, the financial incentives of this punitive system become increasingly apparent as corporations that house detained migrants profit from human suffering, funded by taxpayer dollars.[xxvi]

In 2022, the GEO Group reported $4 billion, accounting for approximately 43% of its revenue, from ICE contracts.[xxvii] This revenue stream has only grown as demand for detention space surges under the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. In 2025, CoreCivic signed a new contract with ICE to expand its detention capacity, accommodating up to 784 additional detainees at correctional facilities that the company runs in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, and Oklahoma, including a maximum-security prison.[xxviii]

Criminalizing migrants does not protect national security — it protects corporate profits. It sustains a system in which workers displaced by trade are penalized for surviving, and where their legal precarity is exploited as a tool of wage suppression.

Our officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.

Harassment at home: In September, three women were indicted by a federal grand jury for livestreaming their pursuit of an ICE agent to his home and then posting the victim’s home address on Instagram. Upon arriving at the law enforcement officer’s home, they began shouting “neighbor is ICE,” “la migra lives here,” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know.”

Direct threats to families: In Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse received a call saying, “I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”

When agents and their families are identified, they receive violent threats in their messages and even death threats. One agent’s spouse was sent this Facebook message by Robert Buckley of Lakeville, Massachusetts: “Your husband, the ICE man is a f*** and retribution will come your way eventually.”

Doxxing online: An investigation by the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility in San Diego led to the arrest of Gregory John Curcio, 68, who is accused of doxxing an ICE attorney by posting her personal information online and urging others to harass her. Court documents allege in February 2025, Curcio posted the attorney’s home address to social media and directed others to “swat” her; a tactic involving false emergency calls to provoke an armed law enforcement response. The documents further allege he used multiple accounts and conducted a harassment campaign against the attorney and her family dating back to January 2024.

Houston Halloween display: Effigies of ICE agents dressed in black shirts with red hats were hung from homemade gallows with zip ties in their pockets. The display, surrounded by coffins, barbed wire, and featuring a Mexican flag, was a mock execution ground.

In recent weeks, public demonstrations and policy debates have surged, highlighting concerns over the legal status of undocumented youth in Canada. With immigration a key topic, the push for inclusive policies is gaining momentum across North America.

The Push for DACA Canada Immigration Reform

Advocacy groups across Canada are intensifying their efforts for DACA immigration reform. The growing political and public interest stems from recent discussions about immigrant rights and legal protections. These groups are calling for policies that reflect Canada’s values of inclusivity and diversity. Research shows that an inclusive approach can lead to better social and economic outcomes, benefiting the country as a whole. In the past month, several rallies have taken place in major Canadian cities, drawing attention to the plight of undocumented youth. These events aim to galvanize public support and influence policymakers. Experts argue that reforming immigration policies not only upholds human rights but also enhances Canada’s international image. This push is part of a larger movement to align North American policies on immigration.

Challenges in Canadian Immigration Policy

While advocacy efforts intensify, challenges remain in reforming Canadian immigration policy. Current policies often leave undocumented youth without clear legal status or pathways to citizenship. This uncertainty impacts their access to education and employment, creating barriers to full participation in society. Recent reports indicate that over 200,000 undocumented people are residing in Canada, many of whom arrived as children. Advocacy groups stress that reform is crucial to address these pressing issues. Legal experts also point to the need for clearer frameworks that protect the rights of all residents, including the undocumented. Enhanced legal status would provide much-needed security for these individuals and their families.

How the Immigrant Rights Movement Influences Policy

The immigrant rights movement in Canada has gained traction as more people advocate for comprehensive reform. Social media has played a significant role in spreading awareness and initiating conversations about DACA and immigration policy. Platforms like X and Reddit have become hubs for discussion, where advocates share strategies and highlight personal stories. For instance, a recent report shows how these advocacy efforts are starting to influence political agendas. Politicians are increasingly acknowledging the need for policy adjustments to reflect Canada’s commitment to human rights. By leveraging public and policy support, the immigrant rights movement continues to pave the way for meaningful changes.

Conclusion: The Way Forward for DACA and Immigration Reform

Looking ahead, the momentum for DACA and immigration reform in Canada seems strong. Advocacy groups are rallying support not only from immigrants but also from broader communities. These efforts highlight an increasing awareness that inclusive immigration policies are vital for social cohesion and economic prosperity. Moreover, as Canada positions itself as a leader in human rights and inclusivity, aligning immigration policies with these values becomes imperative. The focus now is on translating public support into legislative action, so undocumented youth and immigrants can secure their future. Change may not be immediate, but each step taken by advocacy groups, individuals, and policymakers contributes to a more just and equitable system. Canada’s journey towards reforming immigration policy underscores a commitment to diversity and inclusion, offering hope for those who seek certainty and belonging.

Final Thoughts

As advocacy groups in Canada push for reform, attention is turning to the impact of uncertain legal status on undocumented youth. Their efforts emphasize the need for policies that reflect Canada’s commitment to inclusivity and human rights. As awareness grows, so does the potential for meaningful change in immigration policy. It’s crucial for lawmakers to heed the call for reform, providing pathways to legal status that ensure the well-being of all residents. This ongoing movement offers hope for a more inclusive future.

Friday morning's demonstration got underway after a federal judge granted the state's temporary restraining order, barring National Guards troops from taking part in immigration operations.

That TRO is in effect for two weeks and could be extended.

Chopper 7 captured dozens of National Guard members gathering outside the Army Reserve training facility in far southwest suburban Elwood on Friday morning.

Judge April Perry's decision came hours after the Guard arrived at the Broadview immigration facility on Thursday. Troops could be seen walking around and lingering near the facility.

The Trump administration has argued that the bolstered military presence is needed to protect federal property and employees. But the judge said the government's claims about an out-of-control public on the brink of rebellion were not credible.

The White House responded to the judge's move to grant a temporary restraining order, writing, in part, ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement, saying, ""President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Chicago following violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxed by left-wing rioters. The President's lawful actions will make Chicago safer. We have the law and supremacy clause on our side.""

Judge rules fencing surrounding Broadview ICE facility must come down

Meanwhile, a judge has ordered the removal of a fence surrounding the Broadview facility.

Attorneys for the federal government argued that the fencing across Beach Street was needed to conduct business and to protect vehicles and personnel, after conflicts erupted during protests of ICE action during operation ""Midway Blitz.""

The village of Broadview said the fence was put up without village approval, and it blocks emergency response.

The judge sided with Broadview officials, granting their request for a TRO.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson issued a statement, saying, ""This is a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety. The judge's decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview's ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders. The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge's order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.""

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.
In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.
G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs.
In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver.","The ACLU of Colorado has sued the Trump administration, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials carried out unlawful, warrantless arrests as part of a broad effort to detain immigrants living in the United States without legal status.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a legal permanent resident, a “Dreamer” brought to the country as a child, and an asylum seeker, all of whom have lived in the country for more than a decade.

A “dreamer” is a colloquial term for an immigrant who was brought illegally to the United States as a child and is eligible for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunction relief.

“They are going door-to-door, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking near their homes or jobs,” the complaint claimed, referring to immigration agents. “They are pulling over workers and college students going about their daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latino people without warrants, without probable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law.”

Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has embarked on a mass deportation effort, a key campaign promise. That effort has drawn lawsuits.

Federal data suggest that arrests have more than doubled since the spring, according to TRAC Immigration at Syracuse University.

Nearly 60,000 people across the United States were being detained in August.

To make a dent in the 14 million immigrants estimated to be living illegally in the U.S. — according to the Pew Research Center — House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed ICE in June to make 3,000 arrests a day.

That’s up from the 650 arrests a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term.

ICE agents arrested nearly 2,000 people in Colorado alone in the first half of the year, according to the complaint.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.

Meyer represents the four immigrants named in the suit.

Meyer added: “They’re not going to change unless a court steps in and makes them change.”

Supporters of the immigration crackdown said they trust that federal immigration agents are following the law.

In an earlier interview, Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky said she was aware of at least one person detained and later released on bond by ICE at Whispering Pines, one of three troubled apartment complexes owned by CBZ Management, which nabbed headlines last year over the activities of a Venezuelan gang that gained a foothold in metro Denver.

Jurinsky said she doesn’t believe federal agents have acted inappropriately.

“If they are doing things without judicial oversight, that would be concerning to me,” Jurinsky said. “I have to trust that they are; that they are doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, had noted ICE can lawfully enter if given consent or under other legal authorities, including criminal warrants, administrative code inspections or exigent circumstances.

“I would be shocked if ICE were attempting to forcibly enter private residences on an administrative warrant,” Matthew O’Brien, FAIR deputy executive director said in an email to The Denver Gazette, in reference to questions about the warrants used in Colorado.

The ACLU’s complaint relies on national media outlets that have reported a change from “targeted and investigation-based operations” to the administration encouraging “immigration agents to ‘turn the creative knob up to 11’ when it comes to enforcement including through arrests collateral to anyone actually identified in a warrant.”

The roughly 200,000 immigrants living unlawfully in Colorado “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the complaint said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

Two of the plaintiffs — Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old construction worker and Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah college student — were pulled over while driving.

In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.

Dias was pulled over by a Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy near Fruita on June 5.

J.S.T, a 36-year-old asylum seeker, was detained by ICE agents while pulling out of the parking lot at the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora on Feb. 5, while on his way to work. J.S.T was held in the Aurora Detention Center for four weeks, according to the complaint.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs. According to the complaint, G.R.R. was held for six weeks in the Aurora Detention Center.

None has a “criminal” record, the complaint maintained.

The Trump administration has said its operations target criminal aliens and, specifically, “the worst of the worst.”

As previously reported by The Denver Gazette, federal agents from a joint operation that included the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ICE and the FBI earlier this year appear to have largely carried out immigration raids with limited judicial oversight.

DEA agents executed two judicial search warrants at a property, according to Steffan Tubbs, a spokesperson for the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Field Division. More apartments than that, however, were breached that day.

In the days following the Feb. 5 raid, The Denver Gazette submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to ICE, DEA and the FBI seeking copies of the warrants used to justify the forced entry into private residences.

After touting the immigration raids on social media, both the DEA and FBI have refused to release the warrants, citing what’s called a “Glomar” denial — a response that allows agencies to neither confirm nor deny the records exist.

One of the individuals represented in the lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Colorado was detained as part of the Feb. 5 raids, which included the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora, one of three said to have been overtaken by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Authorities have said TdA gang members have been involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion and human trafficking.

The organization has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 members, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist.

Trump cited the gang during a campaign stop in Colorado, in which he unveiled his plan to crack down on immigrants unlawfully staying in the U.S. and who have been found to be guilty of violent crimes or facing such charges.

“We are a country under tremendous distress” Trump said at a campaign stop in Aurora last year. “We will send elite squads from ICE to deport every single gang member.”

Roughly 600 miles from the southern border with Mexico, Denver hasn’t always been the magnet for immigrants that it became three years ago when the Mile High City began to see an influx.

In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver. About half, when considering the number of tickets for travel purchased, have stayed.

“I am more than Black, female, and even Conservative,” Badenoch told an overwhelmingly white audience.
In Britain, of course, Farage didn’t swallow up an existing party a la Trump — he forged his movement under its own banner.
Jillian Mortimer, who lost her seat in last year’s Tory wipeout, said Farage’s coalition was just too incoherent to last through a general election.
And when the mainstream parties ask the inevitable “how,” the answer is “by wanting it harder,” Cleverly said.","To say bluntly what was on most every mind here, it’s entirely plausible that Britain, Germany and France are led by far-right nationalist parties by the end of the decade, and it’s not clear the traditional parties and leaders know how to stop it from happening.

But before we consider that jarring future, let’s dip into the past.

In one respect, the Tory conclave had the “It’s a Wonderful Life” feel of an alternative past in the U.S., had Trump lost the primary or general election in 2016 and created his own populist splinter party.

Republicans before 2016 longed for another Reagan, decorating their conferences with his image and even cardboard cutouts, and surely would have continued to do so had Trump not taken over the party. So it was no surprise that Thatcher’s name was emblazoned on one of the conference forums, her dresses and campaign posters were on display and, yes, there was even a cardboard cutout of the Iron Lady.

Even the venue had the air of yesterday, taking place beneath the bones of Manchester’s renovated old central train station.

Swap out ill-fitting suits and missing collar stays for Barbour and tweed and this could have been a CPAC or RNC meeting in a world where Trump doesn’t define the modern Republican Party.

Beyond the nostalgia for what was — and airbrushing out of more recent, inconvenient party leaders — the Conservative leaders and rhetoric reflected the course Republicans surely would have taken had Trump walked. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch used her speech on the conference’s opening day to denounce identity politics from both flanks, Labour on their left, and the right-wing party that’s supplanted the Tories: Nigel Farage’s Reform.

“I am more than Black, female, and even Conservative,” Badenoch told an overwhelmingly white audience. “I am British, conference, I am British, as we all are.”

It doesn’t require much imagination to envision a Nikki Haley or Marco Rubio delivering their version of that same speech as they jockeyed to lead a non-Trump GOP after 2016.

Yet it’s what Badenoch said next that illustrates how desperate Conservatives here are to catch up with Farage’s Reform, which has made a hardline on migration its calling card. In Britain, of course, Farage didn’t swallow up an existing party a la Trump — he forged his movement under its own banner.

“Yes, Britain is a multiracial country,” Badenoch said. “That is part of our modern story. But it must never become a multicultural country where shared values dissolve, loyalty fragments and we foment the home-grown terrorism we saw on the streets of Manchester this week.”

Badenoch was alluding to the terrorist attack on a local synagogue on Yom Kippur, a tragedy which prompted a show of security that took longtime conference-goers by surprise. Manchester police wielding long guns were ubiquitous, and one of the officers told me that, until last week, his force hadn’t fired a service weapon in the line of duty for 14 years.

The incident has only accelerated the pressure Conservatives feel to keep pace with Reform here and Trumpism abroad, a task Tories have nobody to blame for but themselves, given the soaring migration that took place on their government’s watch following Brexit. The urgency was made clear on the conference’s opening day when Badenoch explicitly modeled her deportation proposal after ICE and even included a Stephen Miller-level quota by vowing to deport 150,000 migrants a year.

But why would Britons who are animated by immigration support the lite beer version of what Farage is offering when they can vote for full-bodied Reform? More challenging for the Tories in the UK’s multi-party system is that their lurch right isn’t cost-free. While they strain to slow the exodus of hard-liners to Reform by proposing an ICE-style crackdown, they lose more of their moderates to the centrist Liberal Democrats. It’s not hard to grasp why the governing party of the previous 14 years is in danger of not even claiming third today when you see how they’re being eaten away from the middle and far-right.

More to the point, Badenoch can attempt a third way-style criticism of the identity politics of both extremes, but the inescapable fact is that many would-be Conservative voters grow more enamored with right-wing identity politics when somebody named Jihad al-Shamie drives a car into pedestrians outside a synagogue and then stabs Jews celebrating the highest of holy days. And if that wasn’t apparent, then the crowds that racist rabble rouser Tommy Robinson are drawing to his rallies — with Elon Musk cameos! — should make it blazingly obvious. Which is to say nothing of the ever more frequent display of the British flag, a topic of frequent discussion here as some argue it’s being used to sow discord.

The famous former Manchester United footballer, Gary Neville, caused a stir this week by saying “the Union Jack flag being used in a negative fashion is not right” and lamenting the division being “created by angry middle-aged white men, who know exactly what they’re doing.”

Well, one of the middle-aged white men whom Neville clearly had in mind, Farage, emphatically does know what he’s doing. And he responded with a rejoinder video that has already racked up over 1.5 million views on Twitter. The Reform leader said Neville was insulting the sort of Brits who watch the athlete-turned-telecaster on Sky Sports — the same people “who pay his wages” — rather than faulting the real source of division: an “evil, crazed, mad Islamist.”

To say that Farage’s counter-attack on a Man U legend moved more quickly into the British bloodstream than, say, Badenoch vowing to pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights is like saying images of Trump at that McDonald’s drive-thru got more attention than Kamala Harris’s campaign-concluding speech on the Ellipse. In other words, the Tories are using conventional weapons against Farage’s nuclear warheads.

Revealingly, the old guard is trying to mimic some of the same language that has vaulted Farage to the de facto leader of the opposition.

When The Guardian reported that top shadow minister, Robert Jenrick, had complained that he “didn’t see another white face” when he visited an area in Birmingham, lamenting he didn’t want to live in such a country, one of his Conservative colleagues defended him. “We’re a majority white country,” said Claire Coutinho, a shadow minister whose parents were Indian immigrants. “If you walk through an area and don’t see a single white face, it is a sign that integration has failed.”

Privately, Tories sound a lot like those less-than-MAGA Republicans explaining that, look, voters want this from us. As one Conservative told my colleagues this week, “The Overton Window has shifted” on immigration.

Yet that doesn’t mean they’re fully comfortable with the shift.

Sitting for separate interviews in the POLITICO Pub during the conference, two of the party’s most prominent shadow ministers shied away from the ICE comparison when it was posed directly to them.

“The way they do their border security is for them,” said shadow housing secretary James Cleverly, alluding to Americans.

“America’s model is very different,” said Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary.

Interviews with former members of Parliament turned up more hope than much of a plan. Farage wasn’t offering realistic solutions and, once faced with the real prospect of him as prime minister, surely Britons wouldn’t elect such a character — right?

“The big problem that Reform has is that, while they can definitely benefit from exasperation with the whole scene of the moment, by the time we come to the next election, it’ll be a job of work to do, and I don’t think that they will have demonstrated that they either have the team or the ability necessary given the scale of the challenge,” Michael Gove, the former minister in a series of Conservative governments, told me.

Jillian Mortimer, who lost her seat in last year’s Tory wipeout, said Farage’s coalition was just too incoherent to last through a general election.

“They’ve got left-wing labourites supporting socialist economic policies and those on the far-right because of immigration,” said Mortimer.

To my ear, after 10 years of watching Trump, it all sounded quite familiar.

The most realistic assessment was the one that Democrats in the U.S. should pay heed to: that the only way to defuse populism is for traditional parties to show an interest in and aptitude for the issues voters want addressed. And for all the talk about making the economy work again, voters here couldn’t be clearer that it is identity (and therefore immigration) that they’re focused on.

If Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is able to bring order to the immigration process, that could drain some of the energy out of an issue that right now would vault Farage to Number 10.

“It depends on whether this government can make any progress,” is how Mark Harper put it when I asked him if immigration would be as central in the next general election, likely in 2029, as it is now.

As he pulled a frothy, pre-noon brew from the POLITICO Pub tap, Cleverly, who lost on the final ballot to be party leader in the Tories’ general election defeat last year, acknowledged that “disillusionment in the public is a real problem” across western democracies.

There is, he said, “this real desire for simple answers to complicated questions,” and populist parties like Reform here or the AFD in Germany or the National Rally in France are offering simple answers.

And when the mainstream parties ask the inevitable “how,” the answer is “by wanting it harder,” Cleverly said. “But wanting it harder, mate, is not a policy. That’s where it falls down.”

Looming over the conference — the demanding Ghost of Christmas Present to Thatcher’s inviting Ghost of Christmas Past — was Farage.

And his answer to the proceedings, to Cleverly and company’s demand for hard answers and specifics, was succinct.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc9%2F8f%2Fcfae60cc43329d049cbf09bffed9%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2239929394,N,,2025-10-10 11:59:55.505580

The order went into effect just hours before the Merlos family were scheduled to board a flight.
Only when its hands were tied by the court did the government move to release Jackie’s kids.
The Merlos children, she says, “are strong, really, smart, confident kids, which is a tribute to how they’ve been raised.
Attached to a mirror are family photos of the Merlos children from the before times, clinging affectionately to their parents.","Jackie and her kids had been missing for four days.

When Mimi Lettunich, a family friend with powerful social connections in Portland, Oregon, learned of their disappearance, she spared no effort to locate the immigrant mother and her four U.S. citizen children.

It would take another eight days — and an unorthodox road trip by a hands-on member of Congress — before the Trump administration would even disclose where it was holding the family. And it would be four days after that before the children were released to Lettunich and set free from conditions likened in a congressional hearing to “psychological torture.”

The story of Jackie Merlos is singular and conscience-shocking. “They literally disappeared her — kept her from due process in the presence of her four U.S. citizen children,” Rep. Maxine Dexter, who serves Portland in Congress, tells Rolling Stone. But her experience is also emblematic of the full-throttle mass-deportation machinery put into motion by the Trump administration. “Our government is kidnapping people,” Dexter says, “and holding them in incredibly inhumane situations.”

The Merlos family nightmare began, ironically, with a hug, at Peace Arch Park.

Kenia Jackeline “Jackie” Merlos is the mother of four children under the age of 10. Although she arrived undocumented from Honduras more than two decades ago, Jackie was a model non-citizen, with a pending U-visa, a work permit, and no criminal record. She and her husband Carlos own a small business in Portland. Jackie had been the worship director in her church.

For the Merlos family, early summer was a season of reunion: Jackie’s parents had flown to the United States on valid tourist visas. With her mom, Juana, and her four kids, Jackie drove from Portland to the U.S.-Canada border for the afternoon of June 28 to have a picnic with Jackie’s sister, Flor, and her family, legal residents of Canada.

Peace Arch Park sits astride the border, near Vancouver. Maintained by both British Columbia and Washington state, the park doesn’t have a clearly delineated boundary between the two countries, and it has long functioned as a neutral space for cross-border reunions and international exchange. (During the pandemic, cross-border lovers canoodled in the park without attending to international quarantine controls.)

Editor’s picks

The Merlos family picnic took a devastating turn when Flor was giving goodbye hugs to her relatives. The family was intercepted by Customs and Border Patrol agents, who claimed Flor had crossed illegally into the United States. The CPB agents took the whole clan into custody. A spokesperson for CBP told Rolling Stone in a statement that its agents “arrested Kenia Jackeline Merlos at Peace Arch Park as she attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States.”

To Jackie’s advocates, this notion is nonsense. Jackie’s father and her husband, Carlos, had remained in Portland because there wasn’t room in the family car for more passengers. “If you’re smuggling somebody, you’re certainly not bringing your four young children and your elderly mother,” Lettunich tells Rolling Stone.

The government never brought smuggling charges against anyone. Flor and her kids were soon released back to Canada. Jackie’s mother Juana, despite her tourist visa, was transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. But Jackie and her four children disappeared into off-the-grid federal custody, while the Trump administration attempted to speed-run their removal from the United States.

The family remained hidden from friends, a lawyer hired on their behalf, and even Rep. Dexter, who made it a mission to physically track down her missing constituents. In the meantime, Carlos, the children’s father, was also seized and detained by ICE. This story has been pieced together from congressional and court documents, interviews with Dexter and Lettunich, as well as comment from CPB.

The mistreatment of the Merlos family — and in particular the citizen children — offers context for why the ICE building in Portland has become a hotspot of local protest, and a focal point for Donald Trump’s militarized crackdown on dissent.

At a moment when anti-immigrant hysteria affects the highest levels of our national government, likely hundreds if not thousands of similar stories are unfolding outside of public scrutiny, as law abiding immigrants and even their citizen children are being torn from the fabric of their communities and unjustly exiled from America.

Mimi Lettunich runs a creative agency and lives in a wooded, modernist home in Portland’s prosperous West Hills, where she invited Rolling Stone for an interview in late September. She had known Jackie and Carlos for nearly 20 years; the couple’s firm had done work on a remodel of Lettunich’s home, and the two women became fast friends. “Jackie and I are like sisters,” she says.

When Jackie and her children were first detained, Lettunich had been out of town attending to a death in the family. She returned home July 2 to news that her friends were missing. “I talked to Carlos that evening,” Lettunich recalls. For the Merlos family, the nightmare was about to widen. “By the next morning he was taken,” she says of Carlos, by federal immigration agents.

The following days, encompassing the 4th of July holiday, were a blur. “We started calling everybody we could. We got an attorney. We got some national groups involved. And we started navigating the chaos of the immigration system,” Lettunich says. “Make a phone call. Somebody tells you to call somebody else. You call — it’s a dead end. It’s very challenging. I feel horrible for people that don’t have other resources,” she says. “How they’re finding their loved ones has gotta be just a nightmare.”

The days ticked by. Jackie and her children didn’t turn up through any of the online locator tools maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Lettunich reached out to Rep. Dexter through a mutual friend to see if the congresswoman — newly elected in 2024 — could help.

Dexter was all in. The freshman legislator is a medical doctor who has carved out a lane in Congress fighting for the due process rights of immigrants. Earlier this year she joined a congressional delegation that traveled to El Salvador demanding the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from that nation’s foul gulag.

But even a member of Congress couldn’t get a straight answer from the Trump administration. “Nothing from CBP or ICE was helpful,” Dexter tells Rolling Stone. “They’re like, ‘We don’t know where they are. Maybe they’re in Blaine or Ferndale,’” she says, naming Washington state cities with immigrant detention facilities.

On Thursday, July 10, Dexter decided to take matters into her own hands. “Carrie, my chief, and I just got in the car, and we’re like, ‘We’re gonna go try to find them.’” As the congresswoman headed north, she and her staff were still gathering information, and leading a loose caravan up the interstate. “Mimi was a couple hours behind us.”

Dexter zeroed in on CPB lockups, because few ICE centers can hold children and they’re not supposed to hold U.S. citizens. By policy, CPB facilities are only supposed to hold detainees for 12 hours. “But it’s not illegal to do longer than that,” Dexter says. “And because Jackie was refusing to separate from her children, they couldn’t send her to an ICE facility. So they were caught in this sort of no man’s land, literally, near the border.”

Late in that afternoon, Dexter and her crew pulled up at the CPB facility in Ferndale, outside Bellingham, Washington, well north of Seattle. “We literally rang the bell. I said, ‘I’m Congresswoman Maxine Dexter. I’m here looking for a family.” The representative was told she’d have to wait for the arrival of the facility supervisor. Dexter persisted: “Can you just tell us if we’re in the right place? And he was like, ‘Yes, you are.’”

“That’s the first time somebody was recognizing that they had custody of these kids and their mom,” she says.

Dexter alone was allowed to enter the lockup, without her phone, to see where her constituents were jailed. “It’s a windowless cell to the outside,” she recalls. “But there’s a soundproof glass window that the guards can look through. There’s no privacy at all. The lights go on and off all night long.” The cell had a toilet, a “tiny sink,” and a cement bench. “They were the only people at this detention facility. They don’t have food facilities, they don’t have shower facilities. It is not meant for long term detention.” The conditions looked dismal: “There were a few mats on the floor and a couple blankets,” Dexter says. “They had been there 12 days at that point.”

The member of Congress wasn’t allowed to communicate with Jackie. She could only wave, as the mother sat on the floor with her children, praying. “Jackie had no idea who I was, or that we were trying to help her. She didn’t know if her family knew where they were. This is happening on our watch,” Dexter says. “With our taxpayer dollars.”

Attempting to talk sense into the officials in the scene, Dexter objected to the jailing of the Merlos children, insisting: “They didn’t do anything wrong. You can’t just detain them.” The officials countered that Jackie wouldn’t let herself be separated. “Would you?” Dexter shot back. “You don’t know if you’ll ever get to see your kids again.”

“I’m a mother,” she tells Rolling Stone during an interview from her district office in a federal building in Portland. “I wouldn’t agree to have my kids removed from me either.”

Locating Jackie and the children didn’t end the drama. Federal authorities were still attempting to rush the family out of the country. Dexter had arrived on a Thursday, and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next day she presented again at the facility with Jackie’s attorney. But the family was already being moved around by federal authorities, who were pressing forward with a plan to remove Jackie and the kids from the country. “They put them in a van and went to Portland to go try to find the paperwork that they needed to get them passports,” Dexter says.

The government claimed that Jackie had signed an order for voluntary removal — but would not produce that paperwork, even for Dexter. The children didn’t have passports, and to obtain them the government needed their father’s consent. Jackie’s team soon learned the government had taken pictures of the children to the ICE detention center in Tacoma where Carlos was being held, and had him sign documents verifying these were his offspring. “They showed him photos of each of his kids, and said, ‘Is this your child? Yes? Sign this form,’” says Dexter. “It was the form to get them passports.”

For Jakie’s advocates, it was time to pull out all the stops. Dexter dressed down the Congressional Affairs liaison for CBP, warning him that effectuating the involuntary removal of four American citizens would be an “enormous illegal maneuver, and I, as a member of Congress, will not stand silent on that.” Simultaneously, Jackie’s lawyer filed a request for a temporary restraining order in federal court to block Jackie and her children from leaving the country.

That restraining order came through Monday morning, with the judge detailing that Jackie had been “serially re-located and denied contact with counsel” in ruling to block her removal from the court’s jurisdiction. The order went into effect just hours before the Merlos family were scheduled to board a flight.

Only when its hands were tied by the court did the government move to release Jackie’s kids. “I got a call the day we got the TRO,” Lettunich recalls. “They say, ‘We have the Merlos children. Would you like to come get them?” It was the first time the idea had been floated, and suddenly the government was behaving, Lettunich says, as if the children had just wrapped up a play date. “Come get them.” Lettunich rushed to the pickup at SeaTac airport. ”I still didn’t get to see Jackie, but we picked up four children — with four new passports.”

Rolling Stone reached out to the Department of Homeland Security with a detailed list of questions about the Merlos family’s experience. A CPB spokesperson responded with a brief emailed statement about Jackie: “At her request, her children initially remained with her in CBP custody. She is now in ICE custody, and formal removal proceedings are underway.” The statement adds: “For clarity, DHS does not deport U.S. citizens. In cases involving minors, parents are given the choice to accompany their children during removal proceedings, or alternatively, to have the children placed with a designated guardian of the parent’s choosing.”

In the car with Lettunich, the kids revealed a secret. “Mimi, Mom wrote you a note.” One of the children had left the facility with a coloring book provided by the feds. On the first page was a handwritten note to Lettunich offering thanks and parenting pointers — asking that the kids be careful near the swimming pool and noting an upcoming orthodontist appointment. “I will miss my babies. Please take care of them. This is so hard,” Jackie wrote, adding: “We are on God’s hand.”

Lettunich and her husband were aspiring empty nesters. “I have two boys. They’re both drinking age,” she says. In her mid 50s, Lettunich has now been vaulted back into caregiving for nine-year-old triplets — two boys and a girl — and one younger brother, seven. The children share a bedroom, and have the run of the lower floor of the Lettunich home, which has a basketball hoop and a life-size sculpture of a bull by the covered pool.

Debriefing the children from the traumatic experience of their incarceration, Lettunich learned that they had been questioned by federal agents, away from their mother. She testified to this in an unsworn “shadow” congressional hearing held by Democrats in Washington D.C. in mid-September. Lettunich denounced “the state sponsored abuse the children endured.” As she described it, “Agents interrogated the children without Jackie. They were asked: Where did they live? Did they have any money? Did they have relatives? Did they have a father? Shortly thereafter, ICE took their dad,” Lettunich said. “The children believed that was their fault.”

Jackie is now being held in an ICE facility where she can be reached by phone and is an active part of the children’s parenting. “They talk every day,” says Lettunich. The Merlos children, she says, “are strong, really, smart, confident kids, which is a tribute to how they’ve been raised. That said,” she adds, “they’re in trauma. They’re seeing a psychologist. A couple of them have night constant nightmares.”

The four children have their clothes and possessions organized in a tidy series of bins with their names on them, spaced throughout their bedroom, and on shelves in the closet. Attached to a mirror are family photos of the Merlos children from the before times, clinging affectionately to their parents.

Here is also taped a handwritten note from Jackie to her children, in Spanish, decorated with an array of small pink hearts. “Pardon me for not being there,” it reads, promising the children that she is saving up all the hugs and little kisses she has not been able to give them directly. “What’s happening to us won’t last a lifetime,” Jackie adds. “I only ask, my children, that you be patient and that we trust in God that the best is yet to come.”

Jackie has so far been denied release, and her next court date is October 14. After weeks in detention, her mother, Juana, was finally set free in late September, telling The Oregonian: “I’m so traumatized that I have nightmares that I’m still there.” As detailed on the family’s Go Fund Me page, Carlos lost his own hearing in early October. Lettunich tells Rolling Stone he was deported to Honduras on October 7. “It’s hard to be optimistic,” she admits.

Dexter holds up the Merlos family story against the promises of Trump and his administration to to target violent offenders and drug dealers for deportation. “This story is so egregious and so cruel — and so clearly not what the American people thought Donald Trump was going to be doing,” she says. “He said he was going after the ‘worst of the worst’ — and cleaning up crime and getting fentanyl out of our communities.”

Perez, who was arrested in February, admitted to using his position to smuggle people across the border illegally, accept bribes, and traffic cocaine.

Prosecutors revealed that his criminal activities dated back to November 2019.

RELATED:

Perez was arrested at the Paso Del Norte Bridge in downtown El Paso, where investigators say the timeline of alleged offenses begins in December 2023 when he allowed a gray Nissan Pathfinder to cross the border multiple times to smuggle undocumented migrants for money.

The same vehicle reportedly passed through the entry point again in January, May, and August of 2024, each time with undocumented migrants.

In November 2024, Perez allegedly permitted the vehicle to enter with three undocumented migrants, including two adults and a minor.

The charges he pleaded guilty to carry significant prison sentences:

Drug trafficking could result in 10 years to life

Human smuggling up to five years

Bribery of a public official up to 15 years

Prosecutors stated that Perez accepted:

Over $700,000 in bribes

A black massage chair

A Rolex watch

Assorted jewelry

$3,884

He also helped smuggle more than 250 migrants and conspired to distribute over 32 kilograms of cocaine, which ended up in North Carolina and Louisiana.

RECOMMENDED:

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said,

To traffic drugs and smuggle humans while wearing the badge is not only a disgusting betrayal of our patriotic Customs and Border Protection officers but of our nation and the American people. Manuel Perez will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

CBP declined a request for an interview, however, they provided the following statement:

CBP stresses honor and integrity in every aspect of our mission, and the overwhelming majority of CBP employees and officers perform their duties with honor and distinction, working tirelessly every day to keep our country safe. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. We defer to the office of the U.S. Attorney for anything further on this matter.

A sentencing date for Perez has yet to be set.

So they can take a look at that social media, those social media pages, and they’re getting an accurate snapshot of what’s happening.","A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

When helicopters descended on a Chicago apartment building last week with federal agents kitted out in military gear, locals saw a terrifying escalation in the federal government’s incursion into Chicago.

Department of Homeland Security officials saw a cinematic opportunity for a “Call of Duty”-style recruiting video with images from helmet cameras and dramatic music.

Flush with money from Republicans in Congress and on a hiring spree, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs to recruit a lot of people.

It also wants to send a message to immigrants, as it did with a more traditional international ad campaign earlier this year. The message is stay out of the US and leave if you’re here.

From the DHS side of the camera lens, there are videos like the one with the hunting or military-style tag line “Bag it. Tag it. Take it down,.”

The behind-the-scenes versions are on CCTV, like this post from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute immigration expert David Bier, a critic of the administration, that shows agents, with a masked photographer in tow, sprinting after unidentified men who had been drinking coffee on the corner.

These videos borrow from the wartime Uncle Sam posters of yore to call for recruits as it has relaxed standards, waiving age requirements and offering a $50,000 signing bonus to bring in new people. And its videos might be intended to entice a certain type of young adult into the federal service.

At the same time, the underlying events behind the videos today could be traumatizing kids, including US citizens, who find themselves on the business end of raids.

“Imagine being a child wakened in the middle of the night by a Blackhawk helicopter on your roof,” said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a news conference on Tuesday, as he complained about federal agents arriving with camera crews in tow.

Not the first propaganda films

The videos also dovetail with a long line of US government wartime propaganda efforts, albeit with a harder edge than Rosie the Riveter. During World War II, the Hollywood director Frank Capra produced a series of “Why We Fight” films in order to boost morale and instill loyalty.

The DHS videos, by contrast, are focused on action inside the US instead of protecting the country from foreign threats.

The videos also make questions about deploying the National Guard in US cities beside the point. There’s already a militarized force on the ground.

CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said there is nothing strange about law enforcement recording their activities. Some jurisdictions in fact require the use of body cams. But these videos are different, she said.

“They do not look like police videos,” said Kayyem, who was assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs during the Obama administration. “They look like campaign ones.”

Rather than serve a policing purpose, Kayyem said, the videos seem more designed to “scare communities, pretend like they are fighting a dangerous threat, or, as I suspect, to be used in GOP campaigns.”

When the government trolls

DHS doesn’t just post action movie-style content. It also trolls critics who don’t like the image of masked agents arresting people without warrants in American streets.

When the country singer Zach Bryan published a snippet of a song that seemed to criticize ICE for kicking down people’s doors with the tag line, “the fading of the Red White and Blue,” DHS clapped back at the US Navy veteran by using another one of his songs, “All Night Revival,” as the soundtrack for a montage of its raids.

Bryan has since clarified that he falls on neither of the “radical sides” of the political aisle.

“Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are,” he said in an Instagram story. “We need to find our way back.”

“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos”

The DHS social media effort is hip to the social media age, loaded up with guns, “Cops”-style arrests, fit-looking agents in combat gear, and knowing jokes.

One video took out of a context a comment by the comedian and manosphere podcaster Theo Von, who was recorded by a fan saying, “Heard you got deported dude, bye.”

That snippet was used by DHS as the punchline of another video. In his own social media post, Von asked the government to take it down.

“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos,” Von said on X. “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”

Surely the Von controversy only got more eyeballs on the video. A video featuring hard-hitting arrests over the Pokémon theme also got attention. The US government did not seek permission to use the theme, according to Pokémon.

Who is being arrested and deported?

The videos make use of the conservative media ecosystem by tapping influencers for ridealongs.

One recent video shared by the conservative content creator Benny Johnson showed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, apparently talking to a man she identified as a pedophile, driving home the government allegation that they are first targeting criminals for deportation.

But the man being arrested was not identified, making it impossible to verify the story.

When DHS posted a release identifying the “worst of the worst” of the undocumented immigrants arrested in Portland, alleging they were hardened criminals and pedophiles, some of the names did not have Oregon or federal cases associated with their names. Others had recently been in prison, serving sentences.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Their allegations about detainees must be verified, however — especially after allegations about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador for a time earlier this year, turned out to be overstated.

Abrego Garcia is back in the US and the government has charged him with human smuggling, a charge a federal judge said recently may have been brought out of vindictiveness.

Stars of the genre

Abrego Garcia was initially taken to a supermax prison in El Salvador, a place that seems designed to go viral for its harshness, as CNN’s David Culver documented.

The initial transfer of deportees to that prison was the subject of multiple US government videos.

Noem is a frequent star of government deportation videos, including a trip to the El Salvador prison, after which critics accused her of playing to cameras.

Another star of DHS videos is Gregory Bovino, the border patrol chief leading efforts on the ground in Chicago.

During an interview for a recent profile, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez asked him about the videos and social media strategy. Bovino argued they are “so real life they appear to be Hollywood.”

“You think it’s a Hollywood video? That’s real life”

The full exchange is interesting:

ALVAREZ: What is the message you want people to take from the videos and your general presence on, for example, X?

BOVINO: Transparency. Uh, I think the public sometimes doesn’t get transparency. We can go back to that reporter that misquoted me. That wasn’t transparent. That was agenda-driven. This is not agenda-driven. Our social media is designed to give the public a snapshot, a real-time snapshot of what is really happening, whether it’s on the border, or now in Los Angeles and or Chicago, what’s really happening. So they can take a look at that social media, those social media pages, and they’re getting an accurate snapshot of what’s happening. Now you might say, “Hey, that’s Hollywood. That looks like Hollywood.” Well, you know …

ALVAREZ: It’s highly produced.

BOVINO: Well, you know, it’s actually produced — there are Border Patrol agents that produce that. Those are border patrol agents that have learned their craft. Border Patrol agents right off the line — and they learn their craft — that are producing those, but you think it’s a Hollywood video? That’s real life. It might be so real life that it appears to be Hollywood, but a lot of that is real time.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-03t160559z-680349489-rc2d4hatbfze-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago-20251009210438411.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-10 12:00:35.017488

At a low-rent apartment complex on Chicago’s south shore, people started hearing the boots hit the roof around one in the morning. The oh-dark-thirty immigration enforcement raid in the early hours of 1 October featured an air assault from helicopters. Officers went door to door in the building, using charges to blow the hinges off doors and flashbang grenades to clear apartments. They hauled men, women and children from the building in zip ties and often little else, ostensibly to capture undocumented gang members.

The troubled apartment building at 7500 S South Shore Drive hadn’t passed an annual inspection since 2022. With the remains of doors and furniture and the bloodied, scattered belongings of former tenants in tatters, it may struggle to pass another.

“So many of these people remain without shelter or a place to live because it essentially rendered their homes and that entire apartment complex uninhabitable,” said Colleen Connell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. She described the apartment raid as a military-style attack. Days afterward, the building looked like a war zone, which may be the point.

Addressing an assembly of high-ranking military officers last week, Donald Trump in impromptu comments called for the military to use American cities as “training grounds for our military”. The comment was a continuation of his belligerence toward cities full of Democratic voters and nonwhite populations, delivered a couple of weeks after he meme-posted an image cribbed from the war movie Apocalypse Now about going to “war” in Chicago.

For those on the receiving end of federal force from masked agents in military fatigues, a flashbang grenade thrown by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent or a soldier may be a distinction without a difference.

Mónica Solórzano was standing next to the mayor of Carpinteria, a farm town in southern California, watching Ice raid a marijuana farm when a flashbang grenade went off at her feet.

“The canister flashed and made a loud explosive sound, like a firecracker. The noise hurt my ears,” she wrote in a deposition for a suit filed by the Los Angeles Press Club in July, seeking an injunction against attacks on the press, protesters and observers there during the administration’s immigration enforcement surge. “When the flashbang detonated, the people around me started screaming and running. I fell to the ground and thought I was going to be trampled.”

Solórzano, a Carpinteria city council member, was one of dozens of witnesses who described homeland security officers wearing military-style fatigues, using armored personnel carriers and military equipment as they rolled through communities as part of Ice’s surge.

Flashbang grenades are standard tools for clearing a room when soldiers conduct military operations on urban terrain. But the use of them by civilian police officers has been sharply curtailed, with many jurisdictions banning them entirely.

“The use of flash-bang or stun grenades for crowd control is an example of the inappropriate, inadequately regulated use of military weapons for crowd management,” wrote California physician Rohini J Haar, offering expert testimony for the LA Press Club suit. “While the stated objective of stun grenades is to cause disorientation and a temporary sense of panic, the potential for severe blast injuries and even death caused by the pressure of the blast or by shrapnel from the fragmentation of plastic and metal constituents of the grenade is disproportionately high. The blinding light and deafening sound they produce can also cause injuries indiscriminately.”

Haar is the author of Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons, a report cataloguing deaths from flashbang use.

Federal agents used flashbang grenades both to disperse crowds of protesters in California in July, and as room-clearing munitions on the raid on an apartment building in Chicago last week.

“Treating a US city like a war zone is intolerable,” wrote a group of eight Democratic lawmakers on the US House homeland security committee, asking the Department of Homeland Security to produce arrest or search warrants for the operation, arrest figures, confirmation of anyone they claim was a member of Tren de Aragua, and a justification for the “heavy-handed” tactics employed. “Please detail why helicopters were needed for this operation,” they asked. “Which agency provided the helicopters and agents manning them?”

DHS has not responded to their questions, nor to those of the Guardian.

Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and former Seattle police chief, reviewed the testimony offered in support of the LA Press Club suit, concluding that DHS had regularly engaged in excessive use of force.

“Some of the agencies involved have no responsibility for urban crowd control, such as Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is an investigative agency within DHS, that typically does fraud investigations and human trafficking investigations,” Kerlikowske wrote in an affidavit. “Similarly, the Special Response Team (SRT) is a tactical unit with DHS that is part of CBP Office of Field Operations that executes dangerous warrants. It also provided security for me, when I was head of CBP. These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so.”

A preliminary injunction was granted last month barring LA police from arresting journalists and limiting their use of force.

Even without reference to the use of national guard troops and equipment in support of enforcing the law – a proposition by Trump that federal courts have rejected multiple times this year – the use of military equipment and military tactics like armored vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, Predator drones and military weapons by civilian law enforcement in the administration has drawn notice and condemnation.

The police agencies of large cities have experience with street protests, and the crowd-control tactics permitted to those agencies are often the result of arduous, deeply argued policy debates by locally elected leaders.

That’s not what Chicago is seeing on the ground.

“What we have seen in particular is the shooting of projectiles, so-called nonlethal rounds, at protesters and at members of the press,” said Connell of the ACLU. “Rather than shooting at the ground, we’ve seen actual incidents of protesters and the press being hit by those projectiles. … We’ve seen an exacerbation of the sort of display of military-style equipment and tactics, whether it’s an armored vehicle with an armed, masked, camouflaged Ice agent or other federal law enforcement agent atop the turret, armed with heavy military-style equipment.”

Journalists from Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club and other press organizations filed suit Monday in federal court, seeking an injunction against the federal government for actions against journalists outside the Broadview Ice facility. Four of Block Club’s journalists were “indiscriminately shot with pepper-spray bullets and tear-gassed by federal agents” while covering the raid. The lawsuit is an attempt to bar federal agents from, among other things, indiscriminately using chemical weapons against journalists asserting their first amendment right to report.

While federal agencies could fly a helicopter in for a raid on an apartment building in Chicago, many civilians in the Windy City have been locked out of their drones for two weeks.

Citing “special security reasons”, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 12-day-long ban on drone flights by anyone without a special commercial operating exemption across a 15-nautical-mile radius around the Ice facility near Chicago. As a practical matter, it denies anyone except news stations with a helicopter from observing federal operations from the air. Practiced drone operators – and journalists – have little experience with this kind of airspace control.

“I’ve had a drone license basically with the FAA for almost as long as that program has existed – at least eight years – and I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Adam Rose, press rights chair of the LA Press Club and deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “They’re trying to basically take their militarization techniques to the sky. They’re trying to keep the enemy out of the sky, the enemy being anyone who is observing them.”

Rose notes that the no-fly space above Los Angeles during the protests earlier this year was 900 times smaller than Chicago, but that DHS filled that airspace with Predator drones drawn from the border to surveil crowds.

“It doesn’t matter what uniform they wear, whether they are federal agents or troops, they are bound by the constitution,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s National Security Project. “People need to know that if any member of the federal force violates their rights, they need to be held accountable”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0b612c25ad32d87969d7a66d8df2faac2b9bfc/621_0_6211_4971/master/6211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47ad2d558c9cb006e34498ec9ec699fd",N,,2025-10-10 11:59:47.648965

Why it matters: In recent days, Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago over the objections of local city officials — and he's steadily ramped up immigration raids around the country since taking office.

Zoom in: The Seattle Police Department ""will maintain functional independence"" should federal troops arrive in the city, and ""not act at the direction of the National Guard or federal authorities,"" according to the first executive order signed by Harrell Wednesday.

Seattle police will ""report daily"" to the mayor on the known actions of any deployed federal troops, the order adds.

It also creates a city task force aimed at preparing for troops to arrive, while directing Seattle officials to ready a lawsuit to challenge any such deployment.

What they're saying: ""As we've seen in Portland and now Chicago, President Trump is unilaterally ramping up his military occupation of American cities,"" Harrell said during a press conference.

""He is showing no respect for the rule of law,"" Harrell said. ""We are ready to fight in court.""

The order also addresses possible protests against federal troops, saying the city ""shall offer to work with organizers to keep protests peaceful"" and ""minimize the potential for conflict.""

In the other executive order, Harrell pledges to submit an ordinance to the City Council banning federal civil immigration enforcement activities on city property.

The mayor will also propose an ordinance to ban the use of face masks by federal law enforcement agents, the order says, citing recent ""warrantless arrests and detentions by masked and un-uniformed individuals"" under the Trump administration.

Between the lines: ""We'll continue to build trust and transparency to ensure that our immigrant and refugee communities continue to see Seattle as a true welcoming city,"" Hamdi Mohamed, director of Seattle's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs, told reporters.

That will involve regularly requesting information about federal immigration enforcement actions in Seattle, to help ""identify any patterns of bias and overreach,"" per Harrell's order.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.
In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.
G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs.
In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver.","The ACLU of Colorado has sued the Trump administration, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials carried out unlawful, warrantless arrests as part of a broad effort to detain immigrants living in the United States without legal status.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a legal permanent resident, a “Dreamer” brought to the country as a child, and an asylum seeker, all of whom have lived in the country for more than a decade.

A “dreamer” is a colloquial term for an immigrant who was brought illegally to the United States as a child and is eligible for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunction relief.

“They are going door-to-door, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking near their homes or jobs,” the complaint claimed, referring to immigration agents. “They are pulling over workers and college students going about their daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latino people without warrants, without probable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law.”

Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has embarked on a mass deportation effort, a key campaign promise. That effort has drawn lawsuits.

Federal data suggest that arrests have more than doubled since the spring, according to TRAC Immigration at Syracuse University.

Nearly 60,000 people across the United States were being detained in August.

To make a dent in the 14 million immigrants estimated to be living illegally in the U.S. — according to the Pew Research Center — House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed ICE in June to make 3,000 arrests a day.

That’s up from the 650 arrests a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term.

ICE agents arrested nearly 2,000 people in Colorado alone in the first half of the year, according to the complaint.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.

Meyer represents the four immigrants named in the suit.

Meyer added: “They’re not going to change unless a court steps in and makes them change.”

Supporters of the immigration crackdown said they trust that federal immigration agents are following the law.

In an earlier interview, Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky said she was aware of at least one person detained and later released on bond by ICE at Whispering Pines, one of three troubled apartment complexes owned by CBZ Management, which nabbed headlines last year over the activities of a Venezuelan gang that gained a foothold in metro Denver.

Jurinsky said she doesn’t believe federal agents have acted inappropriately.

“If they are doing things without judicial oversight, that would be concerning to me,” Jurinsky said. “I have to trust that they are; that they are doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, had noted ICE can lawfully enter if given consent or under other legal authorities, including criminal warrants, administrative code inspections or exigent circumstances.

“I would be shocked if ICE were attempting to forcibly enter private residences on an administrative warrant,” Matthew O’Brien, FAIR deputy executive director said in an email to The Denver Gazette, in reference to questions about the warrants used in Colorado.

The ACLU’s complaint relies on national media outlets that have reported a change from “targeted and investigation-based operations” to the administration encouraging “immigration agents to ‘turn the creative knob up to 11’ when it comes to enforcement including through arrests collateral to anyone actually identified in a warrant.”

The roughly 200,000 immigrants living unlawfully in Colorado “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the complaint said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

Two of the plaintiffs — Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old construction worker and Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah college student — were pulled over while driving.

In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.

Dias was pulled over by a Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy near Fruita on June 5.

J.S.T, a 36-year-old asylum seeker, was detained by ICE agents while pulling out of the parking lot at the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora on Feb. 5, while on his way to work. J.S.T was held in the Aurora Detention Center for four weeks, according to the complaint.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs. According to the complaint, G.R.R. was held for six weeks in the Aurora Detention Center.

None has a “criminal” record, the complaint maintained.

The Trump administration has said its operations target criminal aliens and, specifically, “the worst of the worst.”

As previously reported by The Denver Gazette, federal agents from a joint operation that included the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ICE and the FBI earlier this year appear to have largely carried out immigration raids with limited judicial oversight.

DEA agents executed two judicial search warrants at a property, according to Steffan Tubbs, a spokesperson for the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Field Division. More apartments than that, however, were breached that day.

In the days following the Feb. 5 raid, The Denver Gazette submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to ICE, DEA and the FBI seeking copies of the warrants used to justify the forced entry into private residences.

After touting the immigration raids on social media, both the DEA and FBI have refused to release the warrants, citing what’s called a “Glomar” denial — a response that allows agencies to neither confirm nor deny the records exist.

One of the individuals represented in the lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Colorado was detained as part of the Feb. 5 raids, which included the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora, one of three said to have been overtaken by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Authorities have said TdA gang members have been involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion and human trafficking.

The organization has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 members, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist.

Trump cited the gang during a campaign stop in Colorado, in which he unveiled his plan to crack down on immigrants unlawfully staying in the U.S. and who have been found to be guilty of violent crimes or facing such charges.

“We are a country under tremendous distress” Trump said at a campaign stop in Aurora last year. “We will send elite squads from ICE to deport every single gang member.”

Roughly 600 miles from the southern border with Mexico, Denver hasn’t always been the magnet for immigrants that it became three years ago when the Mile High City began to see an influx.

In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver. About half, when considering the number of tickets for travel purchased, have stayed.

Belgium expands police checks against irregular immigration

Overcrowding and migration links

Belgium’s prison network now holds 13,689 detainees for roughly 11,040 places, the Central Monitoring Council for Prisons reported in April 2025. Amnesty International has described the situation as ""structural overcrowding,"" citing people sleeping on mattresses on the floor and limited access to rehabilitation services.

In an analysis published on 1 April 2025, Belgian newspaper Le Soir reported that foreign nationals account for about 43 percent of Belgium’s prison population, though only around 31 percent lack residence rights.

The paper noted that many inmates had valid permits before detention and lost them while serving their sentences, complicating assumptions about who could legally be transferred abroad.

Van Bossuyt argues that convicted offenders without the right to remain in Belgium should serve their sentences outside the country.

""Anyone staying illegally in our country and choosing to commit crimes must leave -- either to their country of origin or to a prison outside Belgium,"" she told Belgian media.

The government argues that transferring even part of this group could ease pressure on domestic facilities while reinforcing its policy of linking migration control with enforcement of criminal judgments.

Balkan option under study

Under the Belgian government's current coalition agreement, any new facility must be located outside the European Union but in a European constitutional state where the rule of law and human-rights standards are respected. An internal feasibility study by the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons concluded that Kosovo and Albania meet those criteria.

The idea draws on the Denmark-Kosovo agreement, under which Copenhagen is renting 300 cells in Gjilan prison for foreign inmates at a cost of about 210 million euros over 10 years. Implementation has been delayed until at least 2027 as Kosovo upgrades the facility to Danish standards.

Belgium also rented space in the Tilburg prison in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2016 to cope with similar shortages, but that arrangement ended amid financial and logistical difficulties.

Legal and human-rights issues

Any foreign-detention plan would have to comply with Belgium’s obligations under the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the EU Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA, both of which require agreement of the states involved and usually of the prisoner.

Existing bilateral treaties with Albania and Kosovo allow only case-by-case transfers. Establishing a prison abroad would therefore require new bilateral agreements and parliamentary approval.

Legal experts and rights advocates warn that moving prisoners outside Belgium could blur accountability. As the sentencing state and a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, Belgium would remain responsible for ensuring detention conditions meet international standards and that inmates have effective access to Belgian courts if their rights are violated.

Both Amnesty International and the Central Monitoring Council have urged the government to strengthen domestic capacity and maintain clear oversight mechanisms if any foreign facility is pursued.

A Justice Ministry briefing reported in Belgian media found that only about 255 cases were legally transferable under existing treaties -- less than 2 percent of the total prison population -- highlighting the limited short-term impact of such schemes.

Afghan returns and migration diplomacy

The prison initiative coincides with a broader tightening of Belgium’s migration policy, particularly concerning returns of irregular migrants and foreign offenders.

On October 3, 2025, Van Bossuyt announced that she would seek European Union support to explore ""technical cooperation"" with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to confirm the identities of Afghans that Belgium intends to deport.

""At a diplomatic level, we need to look at how to deal pragmatically with the Afghan regime,"" she said in a statement released by her office.

Van Bossuyt said she had discussed the issue with EU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner during talks on the implementation of the European Migration Pact, and planned to raise it again at an informal ministerial meeting in Munich on October 4 with counterparts from Germany, France, Denmark, Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic.

According to the Flemish news agency VRT, Afghans remain among the largest groups applying for asylum in Belgium, yet less than half of the applications are approved. Returns and voluntary repatriations have been impossible since 2021 because Belgium has no diplomatic ties with the Taliban.

""This problem is not unique to Belgium,"" the minister’s office stated. ""Solutions for the voluntary and forced return of Afghans must be sought at a European level. For those that have no future in the European Union, the message must be clear: return is the only option.""

Van Bossuyt said she hopes to build a coalition of EU countries to address the European-wide impasse on Afghan deportations.

European and regional context

Several European governments are experimenting with ways to manage migration and detention externally.

In the United Kingdom, Politico reported that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is considering a ""migrant-return hub"" in the Western Balkans, with Kosovo viewed as a possible location for processing failed asylum seekers.

Both the Belgian and British discussions illustrate a shift toward regional partnerships for returns and detention, even as analysts warn that political fragility and foreign influence in the Balkans could complicate implementation.

Next steps

Belgium’s talks with Albania and Kosovo are exploratory; no binding agreements have been signed. A senior Justice Ministry official told The Brussels Times that even under favorable conditions, ""it would take at least three to five years before becoming operational.""

By the numbers: 75% of Latino registered voters in California say President Trump is unfairly targeting everyday undocumented immigrants who are not violent, according to recent polling of 1,200 people by the Latino Community Foundation.

49% are in favor of deporting only undocumented people with a proven criminal record or a warrant for their arrest, while 37% say they don't favor any large-scale deportation policy.

Memphis Mr. Trump announced on Sept. 12 that he would send National Guard troops to Memphis, citing concerns about safety in the city.","President Trump has sent National Guard troops to several American cities, mostly heavily Democratic ones, this year as a way to help protect federal buildings and personnel amid protests against his immigration enforcement tactics and to address what he claims are rampant levels of crime.

Since June, Mr. Trump has sent soldiers — often over the objections of state and local leaders — to cities including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago, Memphis and Portland, Ore.

The mobilizations represent a departure from the traditional role of the Guard, a state-based military force whose domestic deployments have historically involved humanitarian assistance. And they have prompted lawsuits across the country, several of them accusing the Trump administration of exceeding its legal authority.

Here’s how courts have landed on those cases so far.

Los Angeles

In June, the Trump administration sent nearly 5,000 troops, from both the National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps, to the Los Angeles area, citing a need to quell protests over immigration raids. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California filed suit on June 9, accusing Mr. Trump of an “unprecedented usurpation of state authority and resources.”

On Sept. 2, Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the National Guard troops were being used illegally. He wrote that the Trump administration had violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that makes it illegal to use federal troops for domestic policing in most circumstances.

The ruling barred the federal government from using troops anywhere in California to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

Mr. Trump has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which agreed to pause the district court’s ruling for now, pending a hearing. In the meantime, the Pentagon has withdrawn most of the troops who were sent to Southern California, and Mr. Newsom has asked the court to send them all home.

Portland, Ore.

State and local leaders in Oregon filed suit against the Trump administration on Sept. 28, after it called 200 Oregon National Guard members into Portland. Mr. Trump called the city “war-ravaged” and cited protests against federal immigration raids.

On Oct. 4, a federal judge blocked the mobilization with a temporary restraining order. The judge, Karin Immergut of the U.S. District Court in Oregon, said the president had most likely exceeded his legal authority in calling up the troops. Judge Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the protests “were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the president’s directive.”

Mr. Trump then tried to deploy out-of-state National Guard troops to Portland. In response, Judge Immergut broadened her order to cover “the relocation, federalization or deployment of members of the National Guard of any state or the District of Columbia in the state of Oregon.”

The federal government appealed Judge Immergut’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Government lawyers argued that the protests in Portland amounted to a “rebellion” and that courts do not have the power to review the president’s decisions about when to deploy the National Guard.

Three judges from the Ninth Circuit ruled on Wednesday that Oregon National Guard members could stay under federal control until a broader legal ruling was issued, though they left in place a temporary order from Judge Immergut that barred the troops from being deployed. At a hearing on Thursday, the panel appeared to take seriously arguments by the administration’s lawyers that deployment would be legal, and they questioned Judge Immergut’s conclusion that a military presence was not needed.

It is not clear when the court will issue a ruling in the case.

About 200 National Guard troops were brought in from Texas. Earlier in the week, a federal judge declined to immediately block the deployment, setting a hearing in the case for Thursday.

After that hearing, the judge, April M. Perry, temporarily blocked National Guard operations in the area for 14 days. She said that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois” and that the deployment of troops would “only add fuel to the fire.”

Judge Perry said a full written opinion was likely to be issued on Friday. The Trump administration is likely to appeal.

Washington

The case in Washington, filed earlier this year by Brian Schwalb, the District of Columbia’s attorney general, is a bit different from others.

The District of Columbia does not have a governor — the official who typically approves the use of federal military forces before they can be sent to a state — and the case and arguments over the deployment of National Guard troops there have largely hinged on the Home Rule Act. That law, from 1973, gives the federal government control of the District of Columbia National Guard, while the district is granted local governance rights, such as giving residents the power to elect their own mayor and a local council.

On Aug. 11, Mr. Trump, citing the Home Rule Act, took control of the District of Columbia police for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to address what he called a “crime-infested wasteland” in the nation’s capital.

Mr. Schwalb sued the administration over the takeover, saying its actions had exceeded the law and would “sow chaos” in the police force. The case settled after lengthy negotiations in which the U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, agreed to allow the city’s police chief to maintain control of her department’s day-to-day operations while taking orders from the mayor. Ms. Bondi directed the mayor to order the Police Department to help with immigration enforcement.

On Sept. 4, Mr. Schwalb filed suit again, this time over the deployment of the troops, whose numbers peaked at about 2,400. He argued that the deployment without the mayor’s consent had violated the U.S. Constitution and Washington’s autonomy under the Home Rule Act.

Mr. Schwalb asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the deployment. A preliminary hearing for the case is scheduled for Oct. 24.

Memphis

Mr. Trump announced on Sept. 12 that he would send National Guard troops to Memphis, citing concerns about safety in the city. The State of Tennessee, which has a Republican governor, has not filed any legal challenges seeking to block the troops. The soldiers are expected to be deployed in Memphis on Friday.

Building on our client alert, ""Supreme Court Decision Continues Legal Battle Over Birthright Citizenship,"" we also explore how an implementation memo would operate in practice and what clients should anticipate while the Supreme Court considers whether to hear the case.

Recap of Supreme Court Ruling

In its June 27 decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court did not address the merits of the birthright citizenship EO ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship"". Instead, the Court narrowed the scope of the lower courts' nationwide injunctions that blocked its implementation, limiting them to the parties involved. SCOTUS directed the lower courts to revise their orders ""expeditiously,"" and pushed the EO's effective date back to July 28, 2025. While that date has now passed, subsequent lower court rulings have kept the EO on hold, as discussed below.

Subsequent Court Rulings & The Rise of Class Actions

In July 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a nationwide preliminary injunction, agreeing that broad relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. This appeal arose from a February 2025 decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, which had blocked the EO in a suit brought by a coalition of states: Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit sent a signal of its view on the merits, concluding there is a ""strong likelihood"" that the EO is invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Similarly, on October 3, 2025, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the nationwide injunction. The latest appeals court decision marks the fifth federal court since June to either issue or uphold orders blocking the EO.

Throughout the various cases this summer, the Trump Administration indicated that it planned to ask the Supreme Court to take up the question of the constitutionality of birthright citizenship imminently. On Friday, September 26, the Administration did so. Specifically, the Administration cited the ruling by the 9th Circuit, as well as the district court decision in New Hampshire.

The July 25 USCIS Memo

On July 25, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released a memorandum outlining how the Trump Administration intends to implement its birthright citizenship policy in the event that it prevails in the courts. The memorandum provides new definitions of ""unlawfully present"" and ""lawful but temporary"" presence and specifies which categories of children would no longer be recognized as U.S. citizens at birth: changes that, if implemented, would have sweeping consequences for mixed‑status families, temporary visa holders, and other noncitizen populations.

The USCIS memo does not recognize the U.S. citizenship of certain children whose mother is ""unlawfully present"" or whose mother was present in a ""lawful but temporary"" status if the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. The ""lawful but temporary"" category broadly encompasses most nonimmigrant visa holders, TPS beneficiaries, and Visa Waiver Program entrants, among others.

Potential Impacts of Birthright Citizenship Restriction Policy

The USCIS implementation memo could affect a broad range of temporary visa holders, humanitarian beneficiaries, and mixed-status families. These include, but are not limited to:

A child born to a mother whose nonimmigrant status, such as an H-4, is pending might also have ""pending"" citizenship status.

A child born to an F-1 parent who violated their duration of status (D/S) by unauthorized employment might also be deemed in violation of immigration status and potentially subject to removal.

A child born to parents who applied to adjust status based on an employment-based sponsorship, who are waiting for a green card number to be available from their country, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a mother with DACA who has spent years in the United States and to a father on an H-1B visa leading a team at a tech company in Texas, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a Ukrainian mother living in the United States who fled Russia's invasion and was granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) as the father remains fighting for the Ukrainian army, would not have certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a Haitian mother who recently fled political violence and instability, paroled into the country only months ago, while her partner claims asylum, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S. citizen.

Concerns About Inconsistent Application

If the Supreme Court were to further restrict national injunctions and allow the implementation of this policy, it could take effect in some states but be blocked in others. As a result, if a mother traveling for work from Arizona to Nevada goes into labor unexpectedly, then her baby, delivered in a Nevada hospital, would not be recognized as a U.S. citizen, while a baby born a few days earlier at her home hospital in Phoenix would be recognized as a U.S. citizen. A family living near the New Jersey–Pennsylvania border could have two very different outcomes depending on which side of the state line their child is born on while visiting relatives.

Concerns About Stateless Children

This policy implementation could also result in some children being born stateless. Some countries do not automatically grant citizenship to children born abroad, or impose complex requirements that parents may be unable to meet. A stateless individual without a recognized citizenship may be denied a passport or public benefits and could lack certainty about where they could lawfully reside.

Concerns About Uncertain Enforcement

The USCIS memo also creates uncertainty about what would happen to children born without citizenship under this policy. It states that, ""to fill any regulatory gaps,"" the Department would propose to defer immigration enforcement against these children until new rules are in place. That language is unclear about whether it intends to only offer temporary protection from deportation or whether the government would ultimately seek to remove those children once that deferral ends.

Next Steps at SCOTUS

The Trump Administration chose not to fast-track its request, but instead allowed the case to move through the Court's normal schedule. If at least four justices vote to hear the case, oral arguments could occur sometime in 2026, with a decision by the end of the Court's term next summer.

We recommend that employers assess whether they have workers who may be affected, that families with pending or potential immigration applications seek legal guidance on available paths to permanent status, and that all stakeholders stay informed as litigation and additional agency actions unfold.

""Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge's order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.""

Big picture view:

The Broadview processing center has been a flashpoint for protesters since President Donald Trump ramped up immigration enforcement in the Chicago area in recent weeks.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is appealing another federal judge’s decision that temporarily blocked it from sending National Guard troops to the Chicago area to assist federal agents, including ICE officers, in curbing violence.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/gettyimages-2239236779-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-10 12:00:41.913936

The overture was rebuffed by the head of the County Board, which also oversees the jail as the Board of Corrections. Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of ICE tactics, responded in a brief statement that the board had not been involved in related conversations with Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

Garcia said he does not anticipate the board entertaining an ICE contract “any time in the foreseeable future.”

The authority to bring forth an agenda item to the Board of Commissioners or Corrections of the state’s most populated county lies with the board chair (Garcia) or a four-commissioner majority.

Money source

Hanson, in his statement, said he has urged the County Board to reconsider entering into a detention agreement with ICE. Attached was an Oct. 7 memorandum addressed to Garcia and Vice Chair Mike Friend, which noted in part that nearly 80 workers detained in a June 10 Omaha immigration raid were transported to the Lincoln County jail in North Platte, which is more than four hours away.

Hanson said that, for those individuals, a Douglas County-ICE detention contract could have meant staying nearer to loved ones, with “real, in-person access to legal representation” and access to Omaha’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.”

Furthermore, Hanson said, an ICE detention contract would result in “millions of dollars of much-needed revenue.” He said his department’s proposed budget was trimmed by nearly a half-million dollars and said the safety of county residents will suffer.

Hanson’s proposal comes as the State of Nebraska is transforming a McCook-based state prison facility into a nearly 300-bed Midwest hub for ICE detainees. That proposal, backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and several state legislators, has sparked controversy and opposition from various organizations and some lawmakers.

“Ultimately we cannot control what the federal government does,” Hanson wrote to county commissioners. “What we can control is retaining our neighbors and shared constituents within our community as they navigate their due process.”

He contends the county jail is operating at “historic low capacity” and that space exists to “keep our neighbors in our community.”

LULAC’s role

Hanson’s statement also announced that his office and the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) Nebraska, had started discussions on “humane and accountable detention practices.”

The sheriff said that while his office and LULAC Nebraska hold different perspectives on whether the county should enter into a detention agreement with ICE, their dialogue “reflects a commitment to transparency and community input.”

Elsa Aranda, LULAC Nebraska state director, said she has offered to help develop independent oversight structures and detainee support frameworks to ensure fairness.

However, national LULAC spokesman David Cruz told the Nebraska Examiner that the sheriff’s statement was “premature” and that “any inference that LULAC is either supporting or endorsing or approving such a project would be inaccurate.”

He said the civil rights organization’s national leadership did not approve “a public statement using the name of LULAC in such a context.” LULAC describes itself as the largest and oldest Hispanic and Latin-American civil rights organization in the U.S.

Three months after Omaha raid: One ICE detention chapter winds down, another heats up

Cruz said LULAC’s national president Ramon Palomares and advisor Hector Flores did speak with Hanson and his chief deputy at a conference they all attended in Dallas — as the sheriff wrote in his memo to the County Board.

But he said that the LULAC representatives did not know beforehand the topic to be discussed. “They went and listened,” he said, and said they’d take it back to the organization’s attorneys.

Aranda, in remarks included in the sheriff’s statement, said her role as Nebraska state director was “to ensure that if detention occurs, it happens under humane, fair and transparent conditions – and that the rights and dignity of every person are protected, just as the sheriff is proposing.”

Cruz, however, said the national network’s stance is “staunch” opposition to detention centers for “detainees who are being held on immigration-related issues.” He added, “Any use of the name LULAC or the appearance lending weight to this decision would be inaccurate.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MaskICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:00:08.195249

Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The ceasefire in Gaza is now in effect and Israeli forces are pulling back from parts of the territory in accordance with the deal approved by the Israeli government overnight, the Israeli military said today. The IDF troops positioned along the “updated deployment lines” will “continue to remove any immediate threat,” the IDF said. BBC News reports.

Thousands of Palestinians have started moving from southern Gaza toward Gaza City following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the area. According to an IDF spokesperson, “movement from the south to the north of Gaza is permitted” as the ceasefire came into effect at 12 p.m. local time. CNN reports; Alexander Cornwell and Nida Al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

The Israeli forces’ partial withdrawal has now triggered a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release the hostages it is holding. Separately, Israel has published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners set for release as part of the agreement and Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya said he received guarantees from the United States and other mediators that the war is over. Jeremy Diamond reports for CNN; Tamar Michaelis reports for CNN; Reuters reports.

Eyewitnesses in Gaza told BBC News of Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis and artillery shelling and gunfire in the Netzarim corridor early this morning. According to the IDF, the ceasefire agreement came into effect at midday local time. The IDF said they were looking into the reports of airstrikes. According to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, a total of 17 people have been killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours. Tom Bennett and Hugo Bachega report; BBC News reports.

In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today thanked President Trump “for his global leadership and his relentless efforts to put together this plan to return the hostages” and “great friendship toward our people and country.” Netanyahu also thanked the U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Tamar Michaelis and Catherine Nicholls report for CNN.

ISRAEL HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

U.S. officials said yesterday that the United States will send 200 U.S. troops to Israel to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire deal in Gaza. The U.S. soldiers will join troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE to provide oversight and will work to establish a civil-military coordination center in Israel to provide security and humanitarian support. The U.S. soldiers are not intended to enter Gaza, one official said. Tyler Pager and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

European and Arab politicians met in Paris yesterday to discuss further details on the reconstruction and administration of Gaza after the war. “We discussed the major fields to which we intend to contribute: security, governance, reconstruction and humanitarian aid,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel reporters said this morning. Barrot said that the details would be shared with the United States “so that they can integrate them” into future plans. John Irish reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian drone and missile strikes overnight have wounded at least 20 people in Kyiv and caused blackouts across Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities said today. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko called the attack “one of the largest concentrated strikes” against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian attack drones, missiles and guided bombs over the Zaporizhzhia region killed a 7 year old and wounded his parents, military officials said. AP News reports.

23 Ukrainian children have been brought out of Russian occupied areas of Ukraine and into territory under Kyiv’s control, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said yesterday. Reuters reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are drawing up contingency plans to respond to the possibility of mass displacement of their citizens following a Russian attack, officials told Reuters. The town of Kaunas in Lithuania has plans to house 300,000 people in schools, universities and churches. “It’s a very reassuring message to our society that we are ready and we are planning,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said. “We have done our homework.” Andrius Sytas reports.

Peru’s congress voted yesterday to remove Peruvian President Dina Boluarte from office. Boluarte refused to attend the vote which approved her removal on grounds of “permanent moral incapacity.” Boluarte has denied all allegations against her, which include bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022. Mauricio Torres and Jessie Yeung report for CNN.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary reportedly killed 13 people on Tuesday night in an attack on the Saudi hospital in the besieged city of El-Fasher, a source told BBC News. The source said that 16 others were injured by the shelling, including a doctor and a nurse. A group of Sudanese medics called the attack a war crime. Richard Kagoe and Wedaeli Chibelushi report.

Taiwan President William Lai announced today that Taiwan will build a dome-like air defence system to guard against “hostile threats.” Lai said there was also “clear necessity” to boost defense spending, confirming plans to increase spending from 3% to 5% of GDP by 2030. Kelly Ng reports for BBC News.

Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday acknowledged Russia’s responsibility for the downing of an Azerbaijani jet last year, which killed 38 people. Putin indicated that Russia would be willing to pay unspecified damages to the victims’ families. Nataliya Vasilyeva reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Venezuela’s government yesterday requested an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council to focus on U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean sea in recent weeks. Venezuela’s U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada accused the United States of seeking “regime change” in Venezuela in “order to seize control of the vast natural resources found in the Venezuelan territory,” adding that the Trump administration is threatening “peace, security and stability regionally and internationally,” in a letter addressed to the Security Council president. AP News reports.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent yesterday announced that plans for the United States to provide $20 billion to Argentina had been finalized, adding that the United States had also directly purchased Argentine pesos in an attempt to stabilize Argentina’s financial market. Bessent did not confirm how many pesos were purchased. The $20 billion “currency swap” framework gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for U.S. dollars with the Treasury. Michael Stratford reports for POLITICO; Elisabeth Buchwald reports for CNN.

“We import from China massive amounts and maybe we will have to stop doing that,” Trump said yesterday following Beijing’s announcement of export restrictions on rare-earth materials. A White House official said that China’s new rules were announced without notice to the United States and appear to be an attempt to control the world’s technology supply chains. Amrith Ramkumar and Lingling Wei report for the Wall Street Journal.

China’s Ministry of Transportation announced today that a special port fee will be imposed on vessels owned by U.S. companies, organizations, or individuals docking at Chinese ports. U.S. vessels will be charged $56 per net ton from October 14, with planned increases from 2026 to 2028. The Wall Street Journal reports.

The United States is trailing behind Russia and China in the development and deployment of hypersonic weapons, fostering “battlefield asymmetry,” according to an Atlantic Council study shared with Axios. Incremental improvements are “not enough,” Hypersonic Capabilities Director Stephen Rodriguez said. “We need to act decisively now.” Colin Demarest reports.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Teams of customs officers at major ports in China have been carrying out stringent checks on semiconductor shipments, according to three sources. The sources said that the inspections started to ensure that local companies stop ordering Nvidia’s China-specific chips following guidance from the Chinese regulators to discourage their purchase. Zijing Wu and Cheng Leng report for the Financial Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

A grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, yesterday indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James yesterday on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan. James’ first court appearance is scheduled for October 24. “These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost,” James said yesterday. Kristen Holmes, Hannah Rabinowitz, and Kara Scannell report for CNN.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week fired Navy chief of staff Jon Harrison, without providing a public explanation. Five former and current officials said that there is a deepening sense of uncertainty in the department and concerns about Hegseth’s objectives. One official spoke about a “culture of fear; there’s a culture of intimidation and retaliation.” Another said, “It’s better just to keep your head down.” Paul McLeary and Daniel Lippman report for POLITICO.

The Internal Revenue Service yesterday pivoted on its position that furloughed workers would be “compensated on the earliest date possible” after the Government shutdown ends, according to an email obtained by POLITICO. The email sent to employees yesterday states that IRS’s initial memo on furlough guidance “incorrectly stated the nature of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019” and that further guidance will be provided on the issue. Danny Nguyen reports for Axios.

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children is running out of money, despite a White House pledge earlier this week to use tariff revenue to support the program during the government shutdown. “We have gotten no information about how much money would be available, when it would be available to states or what states would be able to use it for,” National WIC Association policy director Ali Hard said. Several sources said that lawmakers and their staff had not been informed of the administration’s plans. Marcia Brown reports for POLITICO.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) yesterday criticized the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Illinois, adding that he “believe[s] in the federalist system – that’s states’ rights.” “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration,” Stitt told the New York Times. Stitt expressed support for Trump’s effort to protect ICE agents but raised concerns about the precedent that was being set by guard deployment. J. David Goodman reports.

Tennessee National Guard troops will begin patrolling Memphis today, providing additional “eyes and ears” to Memphis police officers, the city announced in an online update. It is unclear how many troops will be deployed. Emily Cochrane reports for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Officials in Los Angeles County are considering declaring a state of emergency to provide relief for immigrants who have suffered financially from fear of ICE raids. The county board voted 4 to 1 on Tuesday to put an emergency declaration up for a vote on October 14. “Families are now afraid to go to work, to attend school or even to buy groceries,” a county supervisor said on Tuesday. A declaration would allow the LA County Board of Supervisors to put in place an eviction moratorium and other protections. Orlando Mayorquín reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

Appeals court judges yesterday appeared sceptical of Oregon’s case that Trump did not have the authority to deploy National Guard troops to Portland during oral arguments. “What I’m struggling with is, the president gets to direct his resources as he seems fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say ‘No, you need to do it differently,’” Judge Ryan Nelson said. It is unclear when the court will issue a ruling. Kale Williams reports for Axios.

A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked Trump from federalizing or deploying the National Guard from Illinois or any other state for use in Illinois for two weeks. The judge said that “there is overwhelming evidence submitted that the provocative nature of ICE’s enforcement activity, the repeated constitutional violations, has itself caused a significant increase in protest activity.” The judge added that her full written order will be made available today.

A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.","“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations.

The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE, a 10-fold increase in its current budget, as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as a result of the Republican dominated Congress and its failure to pass a spending measure by October 1, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, one of Trump’s top priorities, is still flush with cash.

MILLIONS SPENT ON THE 30-SECOND ADS

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,” according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington DC. Adding to the list: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of October 6, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in October, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a September 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city’s mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

LOCAL POLICE CAN’T COMPETE WITH ICE PROMISES

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city’s Police Officers Association, said he’d seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city’s police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.”

The government shutdown could dampen ICE’s recruitment hopes, he said.

“They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,” he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Captain John Walker said it’s too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city’s recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It’s the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who’s in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That’s all this is, strengthening the belief that they’re doing something.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

LAKE NORDEN — The names on the list included some of Dorothy Elliott’s best employees: hardworking, reliable, honest.

Most had been working at Drumgoon Dairy for years. Some worked there for nearly two decades, playing a role in the operation’s expansion and success.

But after an audit of the dairy at the end of May by the federal Department of Homeland Security, 38 of those employees are gone.

The department said they each had inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.

Elliott co-owns the farm near Lake Norden, 5 miles from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s eastern South Dakota home. Elliott asked the affected employees for updated documentation but ultimately had to fire those who weren’t able to adequately resolve the problems with their documents. One person returned home because his visa was expiring, and another quit.

The audit decimated Elliott’s workforce, once more than 50 employees, dropping it to just 16.

Audits at dairy farms under the Trump administration’s escalated immigration enforcement efforts have “created unrest” among workers and owners, Elliott said. It’s made for a tough summer in an industry that was flourishing after decades of support from state government.

Elliott’s remaining employees have been working without breaks, she said. Without a pathway or plan to create a sustainable workforce in agriculture and by “removing everyone working in it,” she worries some agricultural operations will go out of business. She hopes Drumgoon isn’t one of them.

“Basically, we’ve turned off the tap, but we’ve done nothing to create a solution as to how we find employees for the dairy industry,” she said.

Never previously audited

Elliott is required to file I-9 forms with documentation proving her workers’ identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. It puts employers in a difficult position, said Scott VanderWal, president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, because applicants may present fraudulent documents an employer doesn’t catch. Yet employers could also be sued for mistakenly rejecting valid documents.

“If employers are presented with documentation that looks real and legitimate, they’re obligated to accept it,” VanderWal said. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offers similar guidance, saying employers must accept documentation if it “reasonably appears to be genuine.”

Elliott could use the federal government’s web-based system, E-Verify, that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the country. But E-Verify is not mandated for new hires in South Dakota, and Elliott said she doesn’t use it because of “unreliable results.” Organizations ranging from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute to the American Civil Liberties Union have opposed the use of E-Verify, citing reasons including errors that cost people jobs because the system wrongly flagged them.

So Elliott evaluates applicants’ documents herself. If their IDs are out of date or if they have a visa and are applying from another farm without returning home, she passes on hiring them. She’s turned people away a dozen times over the years, she said.

Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

Drumgoon was never audited before. In her past dealings with the Department of Homeland Security during nearly two decades of running the dairy, Elliott said, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would merely tell her they were searching for a person and ask for a notification if the person applied for a job.

This time was different. After an audit, employers are required to terminate unauthorized workers who can’t prove their employability, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Audits — which are distinct from raids or other immigration enforcement operations — are meant to ensure businesses comply with federal employment laws.

Elliott does not know where her 38 former employees went. They could be working at other dairies in the U.S. They could have left the country. They could be anywhere.

Because the dairy is near a farm owned by Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, and because Noem was in the state during the month of the audit to receive an honorary degree, South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Homeland Security if Noem had a direct role in the audit. The department didn’t respond to the question.

Elliott declined to talk about Noem, saying she recognizes that federal immigration authorities “have a job to do.”

South Dakota Farmers Union President Doug Sombke called federal dairy audits “stupid,” because they needlessly displace workers.

“Why the heck can’t we continue to use them there as an intern or apprentice or whatever you want to call it and make it legal? Why is it so important we grab them and call them a criminal? No one wants those jobs,” Sombke said. “I don’t understand why you’d cripple or cause problems for a labor shortage when all you have to do is get them legalized.”

Immigrants hiring immigrants

Elliott’s connection to immigrants isn’t limited to her employees. She was born in the United States but married her husband, Rodney, in Northern Ireland, where they had their children.

Eliott worked in health care and her husband operated their 140-cow dairy farm in Northern Ireland when a newspaper ad, “Wanted: Dairy farmers in South Dakota,” caught their attention. Moving to America meant fewer regulations, cheaper land, cheaper feed and the ability to grow their business, she said.

The couple used the EB-5 investment-for-visa program to secure backers for their operation, opened the dairy in 2006, paid off the investors within a few years and have been expanding ever since. They started with about 1,500 cows in 2006 and have grown to 6,500.

Elliott’s children got their citizenship shortly after moving to the U.S., and her husband became a citizen about eight years after they moved. That experience helps her empathize with her workers, many of whom are Hispanic. She said everything they’re doing is to support their families back home, even though many aren’t able to see their families for years at a time.

“All they’re guilty of is working and doing a job that isn’t currently being filled by an American,” Elliott said.

Taneeza Islam advocates for immigrants as executive director of South Dakota Voices for Peace. She’s spoken to immigrant workers in other industries who were scared and confused after being terminated due to stricter immigration enforcement.

“We have two very separate worlds right now: the community that’s impacted and worried about getting detained and deported, and the community that doesn’t know this is happening here,” Islam said.

State recruited dairies

The Elliotts are among many new South Dakotans who’ve helped the dairy industry boom in the last two decades. Then-governor and now-U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, focused on supporting the industry in the early 2000s, which included efforts to recruit farmers from overseas.

In 2010, South Dakota’s dairy industry had an economic impact of $1.27 billion. By 2023, that had grown to $5.67 billion.

“We’ve achieved our goals we set out for ourselves: build a dairy, milk cows and grow the dairy industry in South Dakota,” Elliott said. “Is it a sustainable goal if there’s nobody to work on these dairies? No. So all the time, money, effort, investment and hard work that has gone into it will be null and void if there isn’t a workforce.”

Sombke, the state Farmers Union president, said the state’s investment in dairy “has been a good thing,” but he isn’t surprised by the recent disruption in the industry.

South Dakota Searchlight requested the number of audits conducted in South Dakota so far in 2025, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the department “does not disclose specific data on audits or enforcement actions by state or industry.”

Sombke said dairy audits are “way up” in the state compared to last year. He said nobody should be surprised to find workers at dairies without permission to be in the country.

“What do you expect? The unemployment rate is less than 2% in the state,” Sombke said. “You’re going to be looking for labor anywhere you can find it.”

Aftermath of an audit

Drumgoon Dairy’s remaining employees have made mistakes because of the long hours they’ve had to cover — like reversing a payloader into a manure pond — or because they’re new to working on the farm.

“Some of them only get one or two days off in a 15-day period,” Elliott said. “But what else do you do? Do you just let cows starve or calves die because there’s no one there to take care of them?”

Some nearby farms sent workers to help at Drumgoon for a couple of days at a time this summer after the audit. Elliott and her husband have spent over $110,000 on recruiters and transportation so far to hire 22 visa workers from Mexico. But the visas come with restrictions on the types of jobs workers can do, so Elliott hired a dozen or so new employees locally, and still wants to hire another 10 to 15 people to replace terminated staff.

Elliott is struggling to find local applicants, which she is required by law to attempt before hiring visa workers.

“If raising wages even more will bring Americans to work on the farm, we can try it,” Elliott said, “but there is a limit to how high you can raise wages when you don’t get to set the price of milk. Can I afford to pay a milker $25 an hour? At some point, you’d produce milk for more than you’re receiving for it.”

Trump could lead immigration reforms, Thune says

After a panel discussion at the annual Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell in August, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that he believes President Donald Trump is interested in legal immigration and work visa reforms.

“If we can find some willing partners in the Democrats, some sort of an immigration policy or a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility,” Thune said. “Ultimately, that’s the best long-term solution, and I’ve heard him talk about it.”

Sen. Rounds told Searchlight that as more people are deported and industries are disrupted, “we will get enough support from the administration to begin looking at a legal system again.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is running for South Dakota governor next year, said some visa programs should be modified to meet the needs of the dairy industry. Some visas are seasonal programs that require participants to return home after a few months. The programs don’t fit the needs of dairy operations that require workers year-round.

Elliott has broached the issue for years to Thune, Johnson, Rounds and other federal officials.

“All I hear is, ‘I’ll mention that. We’ll talk about that.’ But nothing,” Elliott said. “What we hear is there is absolutely no passion for any kind of change to the status quo.”

Farmers suggest solutions

Lynn Boadwine of Boadwine Farms in Baltic has “run out of gas” trying to advocate for visa and immigration policy changes to support the dairy industry. But he was heartened to hear the congressional delegates’ comments.

“There’s rhetoric, but are you really working on it?” Boadwine said. “I hope they are, because the clock is really ticking on all of these issues and we’re going to start to run out of people.”

Boadwine shared immigration reform ideas with congressional offices but hasn’t heard back on the topic. His hope is to modernize and simplify the H-2A visa program for dairies. His proposal would remove the seasonality requirement and allow workers in the country without legal permission to transition to guest-worker status. Long-term guest workers would have a path toward permanent residency by proving they are law-abiding, hardworking employees.

VanderWal, with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, said he met this spring with Noem in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He urged Noem and the Trump administration to back off on audits in the agricultural industry in hopes that Congress would “fix the system.”

“We wanted to impress upon the administration that if they started removing illegal workers up and down the food chain, from production to processing to transportation to grocery stores to restaurants, we’d see a disaster worse than the pandemic,” VanderWal said.

The administration has since “backed off ag,” VanderWal said, but the consequences linger for producers like the Elliotts and their employees. He said that unless President Trump “gets real forceful and goes after it,” he doesn’t expect Congress to undertake legal immigration reforms.

Economic consequence predicted

At Drumgoon Dairy, Elliott has tried automating aspects of her operation. She and her husband put in 20 robots a few years ago with the expectation they could hire students from nearby Lake Area Technical College’s robotics program to maintain them.

They posted robotics maintenance positions to attract graduates, but the response was deflating.

“To date, no one,” Elliott said.

She plans to remove the robots because the cost of running and servicing them is too expensive. So far, they’ve sold three. If the cost of technology continues to be prohibitive or there aren’t reforms to workforce visa or immigration programs, she said, “I wonder how we will become a sustainable industry.”

Elliott fears there will be consequences and higher prices for milk and other consumer dairy products without action at the federal level. Boadwine agreed.

“If we keep down this road we’ll have no choice but to import more food,” Boadwine said, “and the reason we’d import more is because it’s gotten so much more expensive here because we crippled ourselves.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/591A1151-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 11:59:51.459740

Nawrocki, a conservative who became president in August, had already declared during his election campaign that he would seek to unilaterally withdraw from the EU’s flagship migration deal, the Migration, and Asylum Pact. He lacks, however, the constitutional authority to do so as president.

“I will not consent to the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum in Poland,” he wrote in the letter.

While agreeing that irregular migration is a European problem, Nawrocki said the answer is not to send migrants to Central and Eastern Europe. Instead, he called for action at the source, including cracking down on smugglers

Earlier this year, pro-EU Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said that Warsaw would not implement any migration pact, nor any provisions of such projects that would force Poland to accept migrants identified in other European countries.

Still, Nawrocki said he was ready to work with other EU countries on border security, joint operations, sharing information, and giving technical help to countries facing strong migration pressure.

He added that Poland already carries a heavy load by defending the EU’s eastern flank, and sheltering nearly one million refugees from Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion.

In 2025, Poland spends as much as 4.48% of GDP for defence, according to NATO data – the largest percentage in the Alliance. Three years after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, 993,000 Ukrainians were under temporary protection in Poland, according to the office for foreigners.

Nawrocki also cited “the reluctance of the vast majority of Poles, regardless of political views”, to accept the forced relocation of migrants to Poland without providing data.

As many as 75% of Poles oppose Poland accepting migrants under the so-called solidarity mechanism, according to an Opinia24 survey for RMF FM. One in five respondents supported taking in migrants.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of immigrants in Colorado, including Caroline Dias Goncalves.

On June 5, Dias Goncalves, a Brazilian national and University of Utah student, was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff's deputy on Interstate 70 for following a truck too closely.

Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office said Dias-Goncalves had an expired visa but no criminal history, and the deputy used a Signal group chat with other law enforcement agencies to alert ICE agents of Dias Goncalves’ location.

The deputy let Dias Goncalves go, but ICE detained her shortly afterwards. She then spent two weeks at the ICE facility in Aurora, run by The GEO Group.

Weiser filed a civil lawsuit against the Mesa County deputy for violating Colorado laws that prohibit state and local officials from assisting federal immigration enforcement.

The ACLU said Dias Goncalves' case is yet another in which ICE agents made no effort to evaluate whether she was a flight risk. If they had, they would have learned she was a scholarship student in college with a stable home and family life, according to the lawsuit.

Denver7 anchor Shannon Ogden spoke with Hans Meyer, a co-counsel in the case, about the ACLU lawsuit. He said before making an arrest, ICE is required by law to have probable cause and to have determined the person is a flight risk. ICE agents in Colorado are doing neither, according to Meyer.

""ICE is breaking the rules and breaking the law when it's going out and conducting immigration enforcement,"" Meyer said. ""And that's why we're seeing these videos and reports showing that ICE is doing basically de facto racial profiling in communities throughout Colorado. That practice needs to stop and stop immediately.""

Meyer believes this lawsuit will work to get the missing guardrails back in place for immigration agents.

""We do think that if a court steps in and forces ICE to follow the law, it will restore balance with lawful law enforcement and respect for our constitutional protections,"" he said.

Ogden reached out to ICE for comment on the allegations and lawsuit.

,Policy,2025-10-10 08:56:35+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Federal judge blocks Trump from deploying National Guard to Chicago - Chicago Tribune,"Jason Meisner, Jonathan Bullington, Dan Petrella",,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/09/trump-national-guard-restraining-order/,"The temporary restraining order issued by Perry, which took effect immediately, bars the president from deploying federalized National Guard troops from any state to any location in Illinois.
And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Pritzker wrote.
The deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois’ sovereignty and right to self-governance,” the AG filing stated.
Marshals Service, and there are no plans for the National Guard to be at the courthouse,” the declaration read.
He also took a jab at how National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., ended up cleaning litter.","A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state as part of its ongoing immigration enforcement push, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry is the latest setback for President Donald Trump, who has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as a security force, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

The temporary restraining order issued by Perry, which took effect immediately, bars the president from deploying federalized National Guard troops from any state to any location in Illinois. A written ruling would be issued Friday, she said.

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, “”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

Perry’s ruling “confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Pritzker wrote.

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong — and there will be an appeal.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

It was not immediately clear what would happen with National Guard troops already working at sites around Chicago, including Broadview.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court ” due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Standing in front of a bevy of cameras Thursday evening in the federal court lobby — a building he noted that “doesn’t need the protection of the National Guard right now” — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s voice broke as he praised prosecutors he called “true American heroes.”

The judge’s ruling, Raoul said, “is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois but for the entire country. The question of state sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the president of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today.”

The ruling came down after hours of arguments in court that came to an emotional end Thursday with a lawyer for the Illinois attorney general choking up as he talked about the American tradition of public virtue that puts the common good of the republic ahead of self-interest.

“This case is replete with evidence of bad faith, of an abandonment of public virtue, of a lack of honest devotion to the public interest and a grave risk of usurpation or wanton tyranny,” attorney Christopher Wells said in his closing argument in a shaky and halting voice.

Wells argued that Trump’s plan to put federalized National Guard troops in the Chicago area, ostensibly to protect federal personnel and property during his “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement push, was a dangerous prelude to his real endgame: a federal takeover of Democrat-led cities like Chicago that have long been among his favorite political targets.

A Trump administration lawyer, meanwhile, argued strenuously that the president was well within his constitutional authority to mobilize troops given the violence perpetrated against federal immigration officers by protesters that he characterized as “rioters” and criminals bent on rebellion.

“This federalization happened to respond to an urgent and serious ongoing threat to officer safety and to the protection of property,” said Eric Hamilton, a civil litigation attorney for the Department of Justice, citing the boxing in of vehicles, assaults and even an alleged bounty put on a border patrol official’s head by a reputed gang member.

Hamilton said the operation was limited in scope and entirely within the president’s powers to ensure the ability to execute federal laws, and that the state’s motion for an injunction blocking the National Guard deployment “entirely meritless.”

“There is no possible irreparable injury from 500 members of the National Guard protecting federal property in a state of 13 million people,” Hamilton said.

The extraordinary back-and-forth between the lawyers capped a landmark day at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where Perry’s 17th floor courtroom quickly filled to capacity in advance of the hearing, as did an overflow courtroom three floors below.

The hearing also featured a remarkably detailed question-and-answer session between Perry and Hamilton, with the judge trying to pin him down on everything from what the troops would be doing in Chicago to the president’s own public statements about sending the military to the city to end crime.

Near the end of his remarks, Hamilton said that if the judge was inclined to issue an injunction it should be limited and narrowly tailored. He also asked that she put an administrative stay on any injunction so that it can be appealed quickly to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Arguments got underway shortly after 11 a.m. with the lawyers sparring over what constitutes a “rebellion” that such troops might be sent to quell.

Wells, the attorney for Illinois, said the country’s founders did not use words such as “rebellion, insurrection, or war” lightly.

“The president of the United States believes there is a rebellion brewing in the United States? That is such an audacious claim,” Wells argued. “Who are the rebels? Are the rebels well armed? … There is no rebellion in Illinois.”

“There doesn’t have to be an actual rebeller,” Hamilton said. “It is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here. Which there is.”

In requesting the emergency restraining order, Kwame Raoul’s office asked the federal court on Monday to find the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops unconstitutional and to block Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from deploying troops to the state over the objections of Pritzker.

“The Trump administration’s illegal actions already have subjected and are subjecting Illinois to serious and irreparable harm. The deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois’ sovereignty and right to self-governance,” the AG filing stated.

But Department of Justice lawyers argued in a filing late Wednesday that escalating violence against immigration officials during “Operation Midway Blitz” justify the deployment of National Guard troops to protect against “a danger of a rebellion against federal authority” that impedes “the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law.

In their 59-page filing, the Justice Department cited the recent protests at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, charges against people accused of ramming Border Patrol vehicles on the city’s Southwest Side that led to a woman being shot by agents, and a case brought against an alleged Chicago gang member accusing him of putting a $10,000 bounty on the head of Bovino, the Border Patrol boss in charge of the Chicago operation.

The defendant in the Bovino case is scheduled to have a detention hearing Friday — apparently one of the cases that the Trump administration claims the National Guard was called in for.

“The violent actions and threats by large numbers of protesters, directed at those enforcing of federal immigration laws and at federal property, constitute at least a danger of a rebellion against federal authority and significantly impede the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law,” the Justice Department said in the filing.

Controversy was brewing before the hearing began Thursday. The Trump administration’s late-night filing included a declaration from a U.S. Army official claiming the National Guard had been requested to help secure the courthouse for two “high-profile cases” involving Department of Homeland Security personnel on Friday.

But in an apparent response, U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall said in a letter Thursday morning that the U.S. Marshals Service has jurisdiction over courthouse security.

“At no point did I, nor the Building Security Committee, authorize or request the National Guard’s assistance to secure the Dirksen Courthouse,” Kendall wrote.

During the hearing Thursday, Perry grilled Hamilton, the Justice Department lawyer, about the claim, saying she’d been assured that it was “not an accurate statement.” She told Hamilton to go back to the Army official and either “provide further details for the factual basis” or withdraw it.

Before Perry came back to the bench to issue her ruling, the defense filed an updated declaration from the Army official clarifying that it was Federal Plaza, not the courthouse, that was at issue. “To date, there are no requests from the U.S. Marshals Service, and there are no plans for the National Guard to be at the courthouse,” the declaration read.

Perry spent well over an hour pressing Hamilton for specifics on the administration’s plans for the deployment. Would armed patrols be sent to neighborhood streets, she asked, or inside hospitals and schools? Would troops be able to search people or chase vehicles?

“You’re the ones who are deploying them,” she replied. “What are they being trained and deployed to do?”

Hamilton said it was too early to say exactly what Guard members would be asked to do and where they might be sent. Still, he said the mission would center on protecting federal buildings and federal agents who have been subjected to “very tragic and serious acts of violence,” including what he classified as coordinated attempts to block and ram DHS vehicles and an improvised explosive device described in court documents as “a round, green ball with a wick” found last month outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview.

But Perry noted at least some of that violence appeared to be instigated by federal agents. The judge referenced evidence of ICE agents “indiscriminately gassing” peaceful protestors outside the Broadview center as well as several recent cases in which citizens had been charged with assaulting immigration agents only to have a grand jury later find no probable cause that a crime had been committed.

She also pushed Hamilton to reconcile the administration’s legal arguments for the deployment with public statements made by Trump, who in the past has said Guard troops would be asked to tackle Chicago’s endemic crime.

“Frankly,” she said, “there’s a very large disconnect between those two bodies of evidence.”

As with much of the questioning, Hamilton fell back on the position that the president’s authority to federalize the National Guard is not for a judge to decide. And even when the question has been put to judicial review, the president has been given “great deference” to determine when the Guard should be deployed.

In this case, he told Perry, Trump has decided the Guard is needed to protect federal property in Illinois and to ensure that DHS agents are able to enforce federal immigration laws.

“I am very much struggling to figure out where this would ever stop,” Perry said. “The plaintiffs really believe it’s not going to stop with that. You haven’t told me it’s going to stop after that.”

Perry later questioned whether the level of violence reportedly faced by federal agents was enough to deter ICE agents from making arrests, which have dramatically spiked this year.

Acts of vandalism — slashed tires and keyed cars — sounded “a bit like a Carrie Underwood song,” she joked, eliciting a brief chuckle in a packed court room that, until that moment, had been silently tense. “I struggle to say you can’t execute laws because you can’t do it as quickly as you’d like,” Perry said.

Ahead of Perry’s expected ruling, Mayor Brandon Johnson appeared outside Funston Elementary School, near the scene of ICE’s tear gas deployment last week, and affirmed that Chicago police will protect protesters’ rights outside the Dirksen Courthouse and citywide.

“It is the local police department’s responsibility to ensure that we keep the peace, and that’s what they’ll do, and that’s what their assignment is,” Johnson told reporters.

He also took a jab at how National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., ended up cleaning litter.

“I mean, you saw them in D.C. They were streets and sanitation workers,” Johnson said. “Here’s the thing, that you don’t need a uniform to volunteer to pick up trash.”

Johnson watched much of the hearing in a back pew. He sat quietly, leaning forward as he intently watched Perry question the sparring attorneys.

He left before closing arguments, praising the judge to reporters in the courthouse lobby, but adding concerns that even with an order from her Trump might still break rules.

“This administration has made it very clear that its sole intent is to be an authoritarian government, versus a democracy,” he said. “I believe that we all should be concerned about that.”

The Defense Department has moved in recent days to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard as well as 400 Guard members from Texas. Approximately half of the Guard members from Texas ultimately are expected to be sent to Illinois, with the support of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump suggested he could invoke the Insurrection Act if needed to sidestep court orders or uncooperative officials.

“If I had to enact it, I’d do it, if people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up,” he said.

A White House spokeswoman repeated that Trump was exercising “his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.”

Given Trump’s weekslong flirtation with sending troops to Chicago and his shifting rationale, which at first was ostensibly about combating violent crime in the city but has since turned to protecting immigration enforcement operations amid “Operation Midway Blitz,” “the manufactured nature of the crisis is clear,” the state argued in its filing.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the Illinois attorney general’s office wrote.

The state’s filing noted Trump’s long history of “threatening and derogatory statements toward” Illinois and Chicago, as well as city and state leaders, dating to even before he entered the 2016 presidential race.

“The supposed current emergency is belied by the fact that Trump’s Chicago troop deployment threats began more than ten years ago,” the state argued. “In a social media post from 2013 Trump writes ‘we need our troops on the streets of Chicago, not in Syria.’”

The state lawsuit also turned the Trump administration’s braggadocio to undermine its argument that troops are necessary, citing statements touting the successes of recent immigration enforcement activities and a “confident show of force” on Sept. 28, during which “dozens of DHS agents dressed in tactical gear and carrying semi-automatic rifles walked the streets of downtown,” as evidence that no emergency exists that would require the deployment of federalized troops.

In a show of unity, U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, a veteran wounded in combat in Iraq, and all 14 Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation sent a letter to Trump that urged the president to reverse course.

In Thursday’s cabinet meeting, Noem called the local leaders ""lying and disingenuous and dishonest people.""

""As soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response, so we're looking at new facilities to purchase there in Portland, too, and we're gonna double down,"" she said. ""I told them if they didn't meet our demands for safety and security on the streets and work with us then we were going to bring in more federal law enforcement.""

Following her visit, Noem said in a FOX News interview that she wanted more security at the facility, including a larger ""buffer zone,"" claiming that Portland police had been ""leaving (federal) officers hung out to dry."" She also wants designated ""free speech zones"" where people would be allowed to protest.

In that interview, Noem threatened to send ""four times the amount of federal officers"" to Portland if Wilson didn't comply with her demands in the FOX News interview.

In addition to Portland, Noem said Thursday that the federal government is looking to expand facilities in Chicago, where National Guard troops were recently deployed.

""If we have to do it the hard way in Portland and Chicago, we will,"" she said.

'It hurts our hearts to the core'

Outside the South Waterfront ICE facility on Thursday, protesters signaled that they aren't going to let up, no matter the administration's characterizations.

""I've been here pretty close almost close to 100 days myself,"" said Shadow, one of the protesters.

""This is not some battleground that we have here; there's nothing on fire,"" said Nancy Burris. She explained her handmade sign. ""It says, 'We the people are ashamed of ICE.' We are — our whole nation is embarrassed right now.""

Shadow acknowledged that things get more ""hectic"" at night. More anti-ICE protesters come down, but so do supporters of the Trump administration — and federal officers always make an appearance.

Over Wednesday night, the Portland Police Bureau said they arrested three people on harassment charges, booking them in the Multnomah County jail. Just before 11 p.m. they arrested another person who allegedly shined a laser at the PPB surveillance plane circling overhead.

The FBI said that federal law enforcement made no arrests at all Wednesday. In general, they've been responsible for the bulk of arrests there since June — 179, by their count. But only 31 of those arrests, or 17%, have resulted in any federal charges. The rest were released with a citation or without charge.

As for who's making trouble when trouble does flare up, it depends on who you ask.

""Just a lot of agitation from both the right wingers, mostly the right-wingers,"" said Shadow.

Conservative influencers who spoke with KGW earlier in the week denied being agitators, saying it's the other way around.

Margaret Salazar is CEO of REACH Community Development, which runs an affordable housing complex directly across the street where more than 200 people live. For her tenants, the problem has less to do with the protesters and counter-protesters, and more to do with the feds.

""Really, the prominent thing that we are hearing about is the tear gas that is actually encroaching into residential units and making it difficult for folks to breathe,"" Salazar said.

The Portland Housing Bureau is now giving REACH $55,000 toward buying air cleaners. The city also sent a crew Thursday to clean the sidewalks outside.

""What we are seeing is that there's debris from the pepper balls and tear gas canisters that is basically littered here by federal agents, and the federal agents are not cleaning up their toxic trash,"" Salazar said. ""It hurts our hearts to the core to know that residents are experiencing this.""

'No interest in facts'

In statements on Wednesday, Mayor Keith Wilson signaled that he does not intend to comply with the administration's requests to expand the security perimeter or restrict protest areas around the ICE facility.

Meanwhile, as of Thursday, a city spokesperson said that they've received no indication thus far that the federal government intends to buy property in Portland. The spokesperson added that Wilson stands by his earlier statement:

""The federal government's actions in Portland are deeply disturbing. They undermine local authority, erode public trust, and escalate tensions rather than resolve them.""

The spokesperson also said Wilson urges federal partners to ""engage constructively"" and to ""refrain from rhetoric that misrepresents our city's leadership and values.""

In response to Noem's comments, Kotek said in a statement:

""I met with Secretary Noem during her visit to stand up for Oregonians' safety, deescalate the situation perpetuated by the Trump administration, and raise concerns about the aggressive tactics that federal officers are using against peaceful protesters such as tear gas and unprovoked physical force.

""It is clear from Secretary Noem's continued false narrative about what's happening in Portland that the Trump Administration has no interest in the facts, no interest in public safety, and that we cannot take them at their word. I support the Mayor's decision to hold the line in response to the Trump Administration's lies and aggressive tactics. I am calling on President Trump and his administration to focus on real problems, not made-up ones.""

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement:

""Chief Bob Day is a 35-year law enforcement veteran who came out of retirement out of a deep commitment to help lead the Portland Police Bureau through this period of renewal for our city. He continues to serve with integrity, honesty, and genuine curiosity. Chief Day requested the meeting with the secretary in the spirit of respectful dialogue.""

Trump's cabinet meeting

During Thursday’s cabinet meeting, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi referenced the ongoing federal case over deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland.

""The (local) government doesn't want it there, but we do. We're gonna keep those citizens safe,"" she said.

""The people want it,"" President Donald Trump said in response. ""I don't understand the politics of it.""

""I asked the mayor (Wilson) that himself (regarding troop deployment),"" Noem said. ""'He said that Portland was 'perfectly safe, a beautiful city, no problems.' And I said then why did you clear the streets for me today (Tuesday) then and build out a four-block radius to make sure that I could get in and out of here and these people on the street screaming death to ICE?""

A one-block radius was blocked off around the ICE facility during Noem's visit and into the next morning. In a news release Wednesday morning, PPB said the blockade would likely stay that way for now — but that same evening, barriers were removed and all roads around the facility reopened.

PPB, in an email to KGW, said in part, ""We have removed the area closure and people are free to move through that space again. As always, PPB has the authority to restrict access to certain areas whenever a threat to the public health or safety is created by any emergency. We continue to evaluate the situation and consult with city leadership.""

The city also brought in crews from Rapid Response Bio-Clean, its contractor for clearing homeless camps, to remove a small protest encampment that's persisted across from the ICE facility for weeks. They were done clearing the camp by noon Wednesday.

Namely that the tepid jobs numbers this year trend more towards a new normal than an outlier, and the declining economic growth this dynamic brings with it doesn’t even lower inflation either.
The combination of Trump’s policies leads to lower growth and higher inflation, which when combined with persistent unemployment can create stagflation, the worst thing that can happen to an economy.
The poor jobs numbers that drive Trump mad and make Wall Street nervous are actually good enough after all.
If decreased immigration’s impacts on the labor market are lasting, that means America’s economic engine has lost horsepower.","Demographic changes are hitting America hard as the largest generation ever (up until their children) ages into retirement. An aging population is the short story of why everyone is terrified to buy 20- and 30-year European bonds right now, because the simple fact is that healthy long-term economic growth is dependent on having a growing and robust labor force of working age. As the Dallas Fed notes, we saw this demographic change hit America before Trump did, as “In late 2023 and early 2024, when actual payroll growth frequently fell below the elevated break-even estimate, the unemployment rate correspondingly drifted higher.” That is a dynamic that suggests boomers are leaving the labor force for retirement.

But unemployment has not drifted higher in 2025 alongside payroll growth falling below estimates. As Cheremukhin notes, this “provides important external validation for my measure.” He created a methodology from natural population change, legal immigration and net unauthorized immigration represented in that line above which “shows a significantly higher peak in 2023 and a much steeper fall into 2025 compared with series based on official sources.” A different group of analysts at the Dallas Fed earlier this year detailed how “Declining immigration weighs on GDP growth, with little impact on inflation,” combining to create a pretty unsettling reality in plain English for the American economy.

Namely that the tepid jobs numbers this year trend more towards a new normal than an outlier, and the declining economic growth this dynamic brings with it doesn’t even lower inflation either. This is not some abstract economic dynamic constrained to a Fed paper, you can see it for yourself in farmers on the verge of bankruptcy amidst all time high beef prices and inflation persisting around 3 percent while the Fed says they fear inflation risks to the upside, signaling that they may be cautious in further cutting rates to try to spur our slowing economy. The combination of Trump’s policies leads to lower growth and higher inflation, which when combined with persistent unemployment can create stagflation, the worst thing that can happen to an economy.

But the…good news? I guess? Is that this new Dallas Fed paper suggests that the tepid jobs growth we are currently experiencing is actually enough to keep the unemployment rate constant and us away from stagflation. It’s just one paper zooming in on a new two-year dynamic, but that it spans across two very different presidencies seeing different unemployment trends makes it significant. That there are external confirmations for Cheremukhin’s methodology make this a pretty compelling and bleak depiction of what the American economy actually looks like going into 2026. The poor jobs numbers that drive Trump mad and make Wall Street nervous are actually good enough after all.

Immigration is an economic superpower. It’s what separates America from the rest of the world. Last year the Congressional Budget Office found that “An increase in immigration over the 2021–2026 period boosts federal revenues as well as mandatory spending and interest on the debt in CBO’s baseline projections, lowering deficits, on net, by $0.9 trillion over the 2024–2034 period.” If you can get a steady flow of the globe’s best and brightest, you are less subject to the swings of population trends inside your borders. Only a doofus who knows literally nothing about economics would think that less immigration is good for our economy long-term, yet here Republicans are bankrupting their own voters and betraying them for Argentina as they prove themselves to be economic frauds time and time again.

If decreased immigration’s impacts on the labor market are lasting, that means America’s economic engine has lost horsepower. We could still grow the economy to degrees we have in the past, which is the great hope/lie of AI, but without growth in the labor force and the natural feedback loop that creates with spending that gets recycled through the economy, economic growth without bringing inflation along with it becomes more difficult to accomplish. If you are piling 1934-stuyle tariffs on top of that dynamic, it is akin to pouring stagflationary gasoline on a fire that can stay lit long after Trump has left office depending on how much the rest of the word hates us now.

America used to be the immigration capital of the world, now that’s not so certain given how one party here has made it clear they are fine throwing the rest of the world in foreign gulags if they travel here. Immigration is (was?) our economic secret weapon. Now the nativist GOP wants America to look more like nativist aging Europe whose long-term bonds have fewer buyers today than they did yesterday every day, bringing depressed European economic growth and its lack of long-term investment over the Atlantic. This year’s economic trends fueled by changes in immigration have proven that it is not at all inaccurate to say that the Trump and his enablers like racism more than they like money, and they may have permanently damaged the economy because of it.",https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2025/10/Fresh_Mark_Worksite_Enforcement_in_Salem_Ohio_50044087573-ICE-DHS.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:58:54.721622

Government funding lapsed last Wednesday, and Republicans are insisting Senate Democrats approve a bill to continue operations through 21 November, which has already cleared the House of Representatives.
Federal workers are expected to miss a paycheck next week if funding is not restarted in the coming days.
“It’s so stunning to me how callous he can be to play political games and use American citizens as the pawns in a political game,” Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference.
In a bid to convince Senate Democrats to drop their demands, Johnson has kept the House of Representatives out of session since the shutdown began, since any compromise bill would need his chamber’s approval.","The US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the government shutdown on Thursday, as Donald Trump reiterated his threat to make Democrats pay for the funding lapse that has closed federal agencies and furloughed workers nationwide.

The Senate took its seventh round of votes on competing Democratic and Republican proposals to restart the funding, but neither won enough bipartisan support to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the chamber. In a sign that neither party had budged from its demands, no senators changed their votes from when the bills were last considered in recent days.

Government funding lapsed last Wednesday, and Republicans are insisting Senate Democrats approve a bill to continue operations through 21 November, which has already cleared the House of Representatives. But Democrats say any government funding deal must be paired with an extension of premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act health plans, which expire at the end of the year.

They are also demanding that funding for public media outlets be restored and cuts to the Medicaid health insurance program for poor and disabled Americans are reversed.

Congress’s Republican leaders have refused to negotiate over their demands until the government is reopened, and during a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump repeated his threat to single out Democratic-led states and cities for retaliation, if their lawmakers do not back down.

“We will be making cuts that will be permanent, and we’re only going to cut Democrat programs, I hate to tell you,” he said. “So they will get a little taste of their own medicine.”

The Senate’s top Democrat Chuck Schumer projected confidence in the party’s strategy, telling Punchbowl News: “Every day gets better for us.”

Republicans seized on that remark as evidence that the minority party is careless of the economic impacts of the shutdown. Federal workers are expected to miss a paycheck next week if funding is not restarted in the coming days.

“It’s so stunning to me how callous he can be to play political games and use American citizens as the pawns in a political game,” Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference.

The White House office of management and budget has cancelled federal funding for projects in several Democratic-led jurisdictions since the shutdown started, but does not yet appear to have followed through on its threat to carry out mass firings of government workers.

In a bid to convince Senate Democrats to drop their demands, Johnson has kept the House of Representatives out of session since the shutdown began, since any compromise bill would need his chamber’s approval. He signaled he would extend the recess into next week if funding was not restored.

“Is it better for them, probably to be physically separated right now? Yeah, probably is,” he said, referring to House lawmakers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55668cac6faf115da2a5438ed479072f30aa22ff/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d2527f71500e27128f7c0f6de63645be",N,,2025-10-10 03:56:19.341348

The unspecified real estate effort could potentially expand the federal government’s footprint beyond the suburban Broadview facility that has become the focal point of local protests against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

“We’re purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of,” Noem told Trump during an open Cabinet meeting. “We’re gonna not back off. In fact, we’re doubling down and we’re gonna be in more parts of Chicago in response to the people there.”

Encounters between federal agents and protesters in Broadview occasionally have grown hostile over the past month, with masked officers often escalating tense physical confrontations with civilians trying to disrupt the agency’s enhanced deportation operation.

National Guard troops federalized by Trump have been assigned to Broadview to protect ICE agents, though protests largely have been peaceful, with only dozens in attendance over the past few days.

Conservative social media influencers who have been granted access to the deportation campaign shared videos last week of Noem and other officials scouting vacant warehouses around Chicago as potential ICE processing centers. It’s not clear where the feds are looking to expand.

“I was there a few days ago and looked at some facilities that we can deploy more law enforcement out of. Because what they’re trying to do with these riots and violence is distract us and keep us from going after those murderers and rapists that are out on the streets,” Noem said.

Trump initially cited crime in Chicago as the impetus to send in the Guard over the strong opposition of Gov. JB Pritzker and other local officials, despite the fact violent crime has fallen steadily over the past few years.

During a federal court hearing over Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s lawsuit seeking to block the deployment, an attorney for Trump’s Justice Department said the mission for troops who arrived in the city this week is to protect federal agents and property.

“I don’t understand why Pritzker is trying to protect people that are really bad people,” Trump said, nodding at Noem’s suggestion that the Democratic governor is being swayed by “anarchists that are on the street.”

“I think Pritzker’s threatened by people, because there’s no other reason that this could be possible, that they don’t want to have a safe Chicago,” Trump said. “And we can solve the problem very quickly, and we’re doing that anyway, regardless of if he doesn’t want it, or if he does want it, we’re doing it anyway.”

At an unrelated press conference, Pritzker said Trump administration officials “are just looking for ways to provoke people.”

“If they can plant troops or agents in place where there might be the prospect of people being upset — and by the way, there’s a high prospect in the city of Chicago, in fact, across the state of Illinois, [of] people being upset about having troops posted in front of them in a way that’s never been done before — I think that’s what their aim is, is to try to provoke something,” Pritzker said. “There are a whole lot of peaceful protests that have gone on and peaceful protesters, and I want to emphasize peaceful. That’s what they’re doing.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d599e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6924x3953+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2F45%2F4ff31121419eb6c7b97632e8b589%2Fnoemchicago-080925-023.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 04:56:40.635873

As James mounted a lawsuit claiming that Trump's business persona was built partly on lies, he returned fire, calling her “grossly incompetent” and “an evil person.""

James, a Democrat, and Trump, a Republican, have long been legal and political foes, tangling in dozens of lawsuits over the years.

On Thursday, Trump's Justice Department indicted James on mortgage fraud charges after he vowed revenge on his enemies, escalating a feud that has persisted since she campaigned for attorney general in 2018. She has denied wrongdoing.

Here's a look at some of James and Trump's legal tussles:

A lawsuit accusing Trump of lying about his wealth

James sued Trump after his first term, alleging in September 2022 that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars by misleading banks and insurers about the value of assets such as Trump Tower and the Mar-a-Lago property in Florida. She dubbed it “The art of the steal,” a twist on the title of Trump's memoir. After a trial, a judge ordered Trump last year to pay a massive monetary penalty. An appeals court later threw out the penalty, which had grown to more than $500 million with interest, but affirmed a lower-court finding that Trump committed fraud. James is now asking the state's highest court to reinstate the penalty, while Trump is seeking to have other non-monetary punishments lifted.

Face-to-face at a deposition, fireworks in a courtroom

Trump sparred with James at a deposition for her civil fraud lawsuit in April 2023. Answering questions for seven hours at her Manhattan office, he told her that “the whole case is crazy” and accused her staff of trying to trip him up like fictional TV lawyer Perry Mason did to witnesses. A few months later, they came face-to-face again as Trump testified at trial. Trump looked away from James and scowled as he walked past her on the way into court. On the witness stand, he accused her of pursuing him to advance her career. “She’s a political hack, and this is a disgrace that a case like this is going on,” he testified, adding that James “should be ashamed of herself.”

A leading role fighting Trump administration policies

Working with a coalition of Democratic state attorneys general, James sued Trump and his administration multiple times since he returned to the White House in January, challenging everything from cuts to funding for counterterrorism and public safety to plans to deploy National Guard troops in Oregon. Those efforts began the day after Trump took office with a lawsuit challenging his effort to overturn birthright citizenship. Other lawsuits have challenged the work of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, mass firings of federal workers and the revocation of temporary protected status for Venezuelans.

Dozens of lawsuits in Trump's first term

During his first term, James sued the administration at least 66 times in a two-year span, challenging policies on environmental, immigration and education policy, health care and other issues. She fought his plans to include a question about immigration status on the Census, winning in the U.S. Supreme Court, and sued the U.S. Postal Service over slowdowns before the 2020 election. Other major victories during the first term included restoring what’s known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, which allows people who came to the country unlawfully as children to remain, and a ruling that barred immigration authorities from arresting people at courthouses.

Helping build a criminal case against Trump's company

James teamed with then-Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to bring tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and Allen Weisselberg, its chief financial officer. The company was convicted in 2022 of helping its executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. James assigned two lawyers to work with Vance’s office after uncovering evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing. James was not involved when Trump was prosecuted last year by Alvin Bragg, the current District Attorney, and convicted of falsifying business records.

Closing down Trump's charity over misspending

In 2019, James finalized an agreement brokered by her predecessor dissolving his charitable foundation and forcing him to pay $2 million to various nonprofits as a fine for misspending funds to further his political and business interests. The Trump Foundation’s $1.7 million in remaining funds were also given away. Trump acknowledged in a court filing that he allowed campaign staff to coordinate with the charity for a veterans fundraiser before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. He also admitted to arranging for it to pay $10,000 for a 6-foot (1.8-meter) portrait of him and the spending of $11,525 in foundation funds on sports memorabilia and Champagne at a charity gala.

Trump fights back, but judges reject his lawsuits

Trump sued James in 2021 in an attempt to block her from investigating him and his businesses. After a federal judge in New York quickly threw out the case, Trump sued her again in Florida. A judge there refused to block the probe, writing in December 2022: “This litigation has all the telltale signs of being both vexatious and frivolous.” Trump abandoned efforts to revive his first lawsuit against James after the Florida judge rejected a lawsuit he filed against his 2016 presidential election rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. In tossing that case, U.S. District Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks ordered Trump and one of his lawyers — Alina Habba, currently acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey — to pay nearly $1 million for filing frivolous lawsuits for political purposes, which the judge said amounted to a “pattern of abuse of the courts.”

Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea’s governments have been at odds over how South Korea’s investments will be decided.
Forces Korea’s mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.
Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea.","Zip ties. Helicopters. Crowded cells. Guns trained on bewildered workers. Foul water. Forced vaccinations. An unconscious detainee left on the floor by negligent guards. A pregnant woman in handcuffs. A detainee being called “Rocket Man” (Donald Trump’s nickname for Kim Jong Un) by sneering federal agents. A menstruating woman forced to attend to her period with only toilet paper.

These are the details of 316 South Korean nationals’ experiences in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention that have flooded the country’s media in the weeks after the September 4 raid on a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. A wave of fury is now pouring forth from across South Korean society — and the political consequences are only just beginning.

There is far more at stake than a single factory in Georgia, which by itself represented 8,500 jobs and $4.3 billion in investment, and is just one of 23 plants being built across the U.S. by Korean conglomerates. Since the raid, the U.S. and South Korea have announced that Korean workers will be able to use B-1 visas and ESTA visa waivers to continue working in the U.S. A new bill in Congress, the Partner with Korea Act, also seeks to extend 15,000 professional E-4 visas to South Koreans for the first time.

But U.S. flexibility on immigration is not all that matters. Seoul and Washington have yet to finalize their trade deal instigated by Trump’s threat to impose a 25 percent blanket tariff on South Korean goods. At the current stage of negotiations, South Korea has agreed to accept a 15 percent tariff on its exports and provide tremendous investments and other financial agreements: $350 billion in state-backed short-term investment, $150 billion in private sector contracts with U.S. corporations, and a guarantee to purchase $100 billion in U.S. liquid natural gas. Despite so much on the table, a written agreement has yet to be produced, and negotiations are proving tense as the Trump administration presses for Seoul to provide the lion’s share of its $350 billion commitment in cash. While some of the shock over the ICE raid has died down, Washington’s conduct over the course of months of negotiations has also raised deeper questions in South Korea about the real nature of the alliance — and whether this is a relationship that can last.

The Art of the Steal

The anger unleashed by ICE’s abuse of Korean workers has been building for some time. Trump’s tariff threats, announced in March, hit South Korea at a difficult time, when the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol was unresolved, and the country was reeling from years of flagging economic performance.

The issue was not only a matter of timing. The Biden administration’s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act also used similar (though less onerous) tariff threats to force South Korean conglomerates to transfer production and make large investments in the U.S. — which is how the Hyundai-LG plant made its way to Georgia in the first place. Having already complied with the previous administration, South Korea nevertheless now finds itself facing an even graver economic threat that could lead to recession: not just a 25 percent tariff on all exports (since reduced to 15 percent), but sector-based tariffs impacting most of South Korea’s key industries as well.

While much of the anger on either side of the Pacific has focused on the current administration in Washington, Trump’s tariffs are just the latest in a string of U.S. policies that have sought to deny South Korea its economic sovereignty, open its markets to foreign takeover, and degrade the rights and dignity of its working people.

The 1997 International Monetary Fund crisis is the most notorious of these, and led to the “irregularization” of nearly half the workforce as employers moved to subcontracting and other forms of indirect employment to dodge existing labor law and deny rights to their workers. The 2007 U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement further empowered U.S. multinationals, devastated local agriculture, and weakened the power of workers. With Joe Biden, and now Trump, the U.S. has moved to maintain its privileges under the agreement while subjecting South Korea to unequal burdens and penalties.

As with prior rounds of U.S. economic warfare, South Korea’s workers and other affected sectors of society responded to the tariffs with force. Farmers reacted with rancor to demands to open up the rice and beef markets to U.S. imports; civic groups staged protests at the U.S. embassy; peace groups highlighted the military demands attached to the tariff threats; and unions educated their workforces and, in some cases, moved to partial strike action — as with the case of General Motors Korea.

Like most governments, South Korea opted to appease the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15 percent, with no corresponding tariff on U.S. goods in the Korean market. So far, Seoul has offered to inject a cumulative $600 billion into the U.S. economy. This is a dizzying figure for any country, no less for South Korea with an annual GDP of roughly $1.7 trillion in 2023, and an annual budget of roughly $500 billion in 2024.

According to the Export-Import Bank of Korea, the $350 billion in short-term state-backed investments offered by South Korea is more than the total direct investments it made worldwide over the five-year period from 2020-2024. Beyond extracting such an enormous tribute, Washington has cast a covetous eye toward South Korea’s most valuable and strategic industries, seeking to either smother them through tariffs or transfer their most lucrative parts of the production chain to the U.S.: in shipbuilding, automobiles, steel, and more.

While South Korean President Lee Jae Myung attempted to spin the deal as a victory, the domestic labor movement and many progressives swiftly rejected this. The minority Progressive Party, which holds seats in the National Assembly, denounced Trump’s tariff maneuvers as “an act of plunder.” The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a massive umbrella union representing over a million workers, described the “unilateral” negotiations as “humiliating,” and criticized the government’s declaration of victory as an attempt to confuse the public, since the 15 percent tariff is still ultimately an increase that will burden Korean industry and workers.

Fraying Bonds?

At the outset of Trump’s tariff threats, labor, farmers, and progressive civil society organizations spearheaded vocal opposition. South Korea’s conglomerates (or chaebol) opted to hedge against further potential losses by adopting conciliatory rhetoric and offering handsome investment packages before the details of a deal were worked out at the state level. This was reflected in Lee’s first summit with Trump in August, which was noted for its convivial atmosphere and his lavish praise of Trump. Pressure to transfer production to the U.S. was no doubt uncomfortable for South Korea’s capitalists, but for a moment, an illusion endured that profits might be sustained in the long term. Then came the ICE raid in Georgia — not only raising questions about the safety of the workforce, but also raising questions about investments.

This precipitated a sharp change in tone among traditionally pro-U.S. elements in South Korea. Right-wing papers and business media outlets released a barrage of editorials in the wake of the raid. The Chosun Ilbo, South Korea’s conservative paper of record, said the raid “raises fundamental questions about what the United States truly means by ‘alliance.’” Even the People Power Party, whose former leader, ex-President Yoon, now sits in jail, spoke out against the incident.

Some even went as far as to speculate whether the ICE raid might have had something to do with the unsettled tariff negotiations. The Korea Economic Daily, one of South Korea’s most important business papers, left little room for subtlety in its editorial: “If the US attempts to leverage this incident in trade negotiations, such as the $350 billion US investment fund and the further liberalization of agricultural and livestock products, it would be a betrayal of the trust of the alliance.” While this statement falls short of an outright accusation in print, one wonders what might have been said in more private settings among the elite.

Despite the pivot in South Korean public opinion, Washington has since only doubled down. Since the announcement of the trade deal in July, the U.S. and South Korea’s governments have been at odds over how South Korea’s investments will be decided. Trump has long claimed that he will personally determine the allocation of South Korea’s investments, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick previously tweeted that “90 percent” of the profits will go to “the American people” — a point that continues to rankle South Koreans.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Lutnick is also applying additional pressure to get Seoul to further raise its investments. Trump has no doubt taken confidence in his success in getting Japan to agree to similar terms, under which its $550 billion tariff tribute will be distributed according to the decisions of a U.S. committee — with Japanese input relegated to only a consultative position. If this all sounds bizarre and corrupt, that’s because it is. While Trump has touted his tariff deals as the prelude to a U.S. manufacturing renaissance, a better way to see them may be as just another handout for Wall Street — this time subsidized by taxpayers worldwide.

Now, the Trump administration is demanding that the majority of Seoul’s $350 billion investment be made “up front” in cash. Though an arrangement based on some credit is more likely, if handed over in full, the $350 billion would represent 83 percent of South Korea’s foreign reserves, threatening to trigger a currency crisis for the Korean won. Lee’s government has rejected this demand and countered with an offer for an unlimited currency swap to protect the value of his country’s currency, but the Trump administration has so far refused.

As negotiations drag on, Lee faces growing pressure to adopt a more assertive stance — including from within his own Democratic Party. For a moment, Lee put up more combative rhetoric, telling the Korean press he would not accept “any irrational or unfair negotiations,” and noted that, “We did not go to the US to gain anything, but to defend ourselves against the US’ unilateral tariff increases.” In a separate statement, Lee’s office indicated it would be willing to accept a 25 percent tariff to the U.S. market if the alternative were overly detrimental to South Korea. And in a much-circulated Facebook post, Lee called for a “self-reliant” South Korean military while castigating the “submissive mindset of some who think that self-defense is impossible without foreign troops” — a statement widely interpreted as made in reference to U.S. Forces Korea, which stations over 28,000 permanent U.S. troops in South Korea in more than 60 military bases.

Lee’s rhetoric is certainly sharpening, but his administration isn’t done with the U.S., or Trump, just yet. There are real obstacles preventing a sudden strategic shift from Washington. Lee’s economic program pegs South Korea’s future competitiveness to massive investments in AI and associated hardware, and recent deals with BlackRock and Open AI would provide the capital for the necessary data infrastructure and chip production.

More immediately, South Korea needs to diversify its trade partners to soften the blows of the U.S. tariff cudgel. Exports rallied to a new monthly record high in September, buoyed by a sharp rise in trade with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the European Union, and more modest gains in trade with China. Beyond the economic dimension, the U.S. also holds operational wartime control of South Korea’s military — something Lee has vowed to recover more than 20 years since Washington first agreed to a process for transferring military control.

A disadvantageous deal for South Korea may yet be in the offing, but a victory on trade may prove pyrrhic for Washington. For its part, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has unambiguously called for Seoul’s investment pledges to be withdrawn. Should a potential deal fail to spark public ire immediately, ample opportunities will remain. Trump’s demands go far beyond economic matters. The U.S. is also calling for South Korea to raise its defense spending to 3.5 percent of its GDP (Lee has already taken steps towards this, increasing defense spending by 8.2 percent in next year’s budget); raise its annual military “cost-sharing” payments to the U.S. to $10 billion a year; and consent to changes in U.S. Forces Korea’s mission that would permit U.S. troops and weapons in South Korea to be deployed throughout the region.

Out of all these demands, the proposed change in the mission of U.S. Forces Korea poses the gravest threat to South Korea. By redefining the mission of the U.S. occupation of Korea, South Korea would essentially lose any ability to avoid a U.S.-China war, since its territory would become part of a battlefield of Washington’s making. Lee has consistently maintained that South Korea should stay out of a potential conflict in the Taiwan Strait, which Washington has not been shy about as its rationale for pursuing “strategic flexibility” in Korea. As U.S. Forces Korea Commander Gen. Xavier Brunson put it, to the U.S. military in the New Cold War, South Korea is akin to a “fixed aircraft carrier” whose geographical position makes it indispensable to dominating the region.

The ICE raid and trade wars alone will not undo the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance, but they will likely persist as an open wound marring the relationship for years to come. As Washington presses on with its efforts to economically cannibalize Seoul and impose its military exigencies in preparation for wars few Koreans or Americans want, something will have to give. Whether that will be the alliance and the U.S. empire of bases, or whatever vestiges of democracy that remain in both countries, only time will tell.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234317168-1536x985.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 01:56:43.363381

US district judge April Perry issued her decision from the bench after more than two hours of arguments from lawyers for the federal government and the state of Illinois, which sued the Trump administration over the deployment. The order took effect on Thursday and will remain in place for two weeks.

According to reporters present in the courtroom, Perry said she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois”. On Thursday evening, around the time of Perry’s ruling, about half a dozen guard soldiers were milling around inside the gate at the Ice center in Broadview. A group of about 10 protesters were outside.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker said in a statement: “Donald Trump is not a king – and his administration is not above the law.”

Quoting the judge, he said: “Today, the court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago.”

Chicago mayor Brandon Johnson, who attended the court hearing, called the decision a “win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law”. He vowed that the city would “continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to end the Trump administration’s war on Chicago”.

Lawyers for the state of Illinois had called the sending of national guard soldiers to the city – which was opposed by Chicago and state political leaders – a constitutional crisis.

The government “plowed ahead anyway”, attorney Christopher Wells said. “Now, troops are here.” Chicago and Illinois, run by Democratic elected leaders, say Trump has exceeded his authority and ignored their pleas to keep the national guard off the streets.

Eric Hamilton, a justice department lawyer, said the Chicago area was rife with “tragic lawlessness”.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton said. “They’re not protesters. There is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here, which there is.”

In handing down her order, Perry assailed the Department of Homeland Security for providing a version of events on the ground that was “simply unreliable”.

Lawyers for Illinois and local officials have said the government is exaggerating and misrepresenting the situation in Chicago, which Trump has referred to as a “war zone”.

Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said the president had “exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets” and “will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities”. She added that the president and his administration “expect to be vindicated by the court” upon appeal.

National guard members from Texas and Illinois arrived this week at a US army reserve center in Elwood, south-west of Chicago. All 500 national guard members are under the US northern command and have been activated for 60 days.

Earlier this week, Trump said Johnson and Pritzker should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor have signed an appeals court filing in support of the legal challenge by California – and also one in the Portland, Oregon, where a similar troop deployment is also being challenged.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

In a separate ruling on Thursday, the US district judge Sara Ellis issued a preliminary injunction restricting agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving or tackling against protesters and journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.

Ellis’s order covers all of northern Illinois and also requires federal agents to wear “visible identification” such as badges, the subject of heated debate as viral footage has surfaced of masked, plainclothes officers carrying out immigration enforcements in several US cities.

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington DC. In Memphis, Tennessee, Paul Young, the city’s mayor, said national guard members would begin patrolling on Friday. Bill Lee, Tennessee’s Republican governor, supports using the troops.

It’s a victory for Democratic officials who lead the state and city and have traded insults with President Donald Trump about his drive to put troops on the ground in major urban areas.

“The court confirmed what we all know: There is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Gov. JB Pritzker said.

The judge said the administration violated the 10th Amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th Amendment, which assures due process and equal protection.

It wasn’t clear what the troops will do now, including a small number outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview. Officials at U.S. Northern Command directed questions to the Department of Defense, which declined to comment citing a policy that the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.

Guard was already in Illinois

The lawsuit was filed Monday by Chicago and Illinois as Guard members from Texas and Illinois were on their way to a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 are under the U.S. Northern Command and had been activated for 60 days.

Some slept in vans Wednesday night outside the Broadview building, near Chicago, and emerged Thursday morning on patrol behind portable fences. For weeks, the ICE site has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and federal agents.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton said the Guard’s mission would be to protect federal properties and government law enforcers in the field, not “solving all of crime in Chicago.”

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. But Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

“Chicago is seeing a brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement,” Hamilton told the judge.

Perry, however, wasn’t swayed.

“I have seen no critical evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” she said hours later.

Order could be extended

The judge said the order would expire on Oct. 23 at 11:59 p.m. She set an Oct. 22 hearing by telephone to determine if the order should be extended for another 14 days.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in Trump’s ""animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” said Perry, who was appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson sat in a corner of the courtroom, which overflowed into a room with video of the hearing.

The city and state have called the deployments unnecessary and illegal.

“The president does not have the unfettered discretion to turn America’s military against its own citizens when they exercise their constitutional rights,"" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said.

Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime despite statistics that show a significant drop in crime. He said Pritzker and Johnson should be arrested for not protecting agents during immigration sweeps. Pritzker's response: “Come and get me.”

Court challenges elsewhere

Also Thursday, a federal appeals court heard arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building.

A judge on Sunday granted a temporary restraining order blocking the move. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after the judge first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

Two dozen other states with a Democratic attorney general or governor signed a court filing in support of the legal challenge by California and Oregon. Twenty others, led by Iowa, backed the Trump administration.

Chicago’s federal court issued other decisions this week related to immigration enforcement. In one, a judge said immigration agents have repeatedly violated a 2022 consent decree outlining how ICE can make so-called warrantless arrests. That decree requires ICE to show documentation for each arrest it makes for people besides those being targeted.

Immigrant advocacy groups believe hundreds of people arrested around Chicago could qualify for reduced bond or have ankle monitors removed.

Guard expected on ground in Memphis

Trump previously sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington. In Tennessee, Memphis Mayor Paul Young said troops would begin patrolling Friday. Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports the role.

Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped the Guard would direct traffic and have a presence in retail corridors, but not set up checkpoints or make the city “feel like there is this over-militarization in our communities.”

In a California case, a judge in September said the deployment was illegal. By that point, just 300 of the thousands of troops sent there remained and the judge did not order them to leave.

G.R.R., also going by a pseudonym, was detained by ICE during an April raid at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo.","The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado and migrant advocates filed a lawsuit against three Trump administration officials on Thursday, alleging that federal immigration officers are violating the law in arresting migrants in the state.

The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Colorado, lists Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons and ICE’s Denver field office Director Robert Guadian as defendants.

Citing the cases of four migrants who have been detained by ICE in Colorado this year, the ACLU suit attests that ICE officers are ignoring Title 8, Section 1357 of the U.S. Code. The statute requires that federal immigration officials have probable cause to believe an individual is in the country illegally and likely to escape before a warrant is obtained in order to arrest them.

When reached for comment, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told The Hill that the department “complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.”

According to the latest ICE data, officers from the Denver field office have arrested 15,756 individuals across their jurisdiction in Wyoming and Colorado. According to the complaint, ICE arrested nearly 2,000 individuals in Colorado in the first half of the year.

The ACLU and advocates filed the lawsuit on behalf of 43-year-old Refugio Ramirez Ovando, 19-year-old Caroline Dias Goncalves, 36-year-old J.S.T. and 32-year-old G.R.R. All four have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade and were detained by ICE officers earlier this year.

Ramirez was detained without a warrant in May and held at an ICE detention facility in Aurora, Colo. for more than three months, before an officer admitted to mistaking him for someone else. Dias Goncalves, a student at the University of Utah, was arrested by ICE officers while driving in June and spent 15 days at the Aurora facility.

J.S.T., going by a pseudonym, was arrested at his apartment complex in February and spent four weeks in the Aurora facility. G.R.R., also going by a pseudonym, was detained by ICE during an April raid at a nightclub in Colorado Springs, Colo. He later spent six weeks in Aurora.

The lawsuit claims that instead of following immigration law, ICE is “scrambling to fill arbitrary quotes set by the Administration, causing chaos and terror in neighborhoods throughout Colorado.” It adds that the roughly 169,000 immigrants without legal status and other Latinos in the state “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices.”

In May, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller said the administration’s goal is for ICE to arrest 3,000 individuals per day.

“ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities,” the suit added.

Why it matters: The ruling will halt the president's plans — for now. The White House has indicated it will appeal the decision.

Trump could also tap other executive authority to mobilize troops to support his immigration crackdown.

Driving the news: Judge April Perry in her oral ruling Thursday, granted Illinois and co-plaintiffs in part, an emergency motion to stop the president from deploying troops.

Her written ruling is expected Friday.

State of play: National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas have been posted in southwest suburban Elwood since earlier this week.

Even before troops from out of state arrived, Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration, arguing in the suit that the deployment was ""unlawful and dangerous.""

Catch up quick: About 500 Texas and Illinois National Guard soldiers arrived in the Chicago area this week for an initial period of 60 days ""to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" U.S. Northern Command spokesperson Becky Farmer told Axios in a statement.

The other side: Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claim troops are needed to protect federal law enforcement, especially after they've clashed with protesters and residents near an ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview and last weekend on the city's southwest side.

""Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like [Gov. JB] Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an emailed statement Thursday evening.

""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement this week, ""If J.B. Pritzker actually walked the streets of his own city, he would see domestic terrorists and violent rioters attacking police officers and the scourge of violent crime as a direct result of his own policies.""

Of note: Trump this week called for Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson to be jailed for ""failing to protect Ice officers.""

What's next: The temporary restraining order expires Oct. 23, and a hearing is scheduled for the day before to determine if it should be extended another 14 days.

What we're watching: It remains to be seen where troops will go from here.

""If deputies encounter undocumented aliens during regular criminal enforcement, they may detain them for removal proceedings,"" said Sheriff Brian Kozak.

Earlier this month, Kozak and 25 deputies reaffirmed their pledge to obey and enforce the Constitution, prohibiting any type of profiling or discrimination.

""We will have zero tolerance on profiling or discrimination with enforcement,"" said Kozak.

Deputies may inquire about immigration status only after a lawful stop, detention or arrest based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.

""We're not going to be doing immigration sweeps. Our focus is if we contact someone criminally, then we may as a secondary investigation conduct an immigration investigation,"" said Kozak.

This allows deputies to detain the individual for removal proceedings.

Part of the policy is involving a direct ICE supervisor.

""They will validate everything that we're doing and actually give us the green light to proceed with the detention or not,"" said Kozak.

This is all authorized and funded under Title 8, Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, an agreement that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wyoming has been very outspoken about.

The ACLU said these agreements have a history of eroding public safety, imposing heavy financial burdens on localities and leading to civil rights violations.

""It’s not wise to divert local law enforcement resources to subsidize federal immigration enforcement,"" the ACLU told Wyoming News Now. ""Laramie County deputies belong in the neighborhoods of our communities providing crime prevention services to build trust and maintain order – not to be pulled out of neighborhoods to handle a federal responsibility.""

The ACLU continued, ""Deputizing so many local law enforcement officers to act as immigration agents diverts resources away from activities and investigations that actually keep our neighborhoods safe. By participating in 287(g) agreements, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office is actually eroding trust in local law enforcement and deterring immigrant families from coming forward when they are the victims of crime or even asking for basic assistance.""

Sheriff Kozak said training for the authorized deputies included classes on cultural diversity, profiling, naturalization process, document identification, visas and constitutional standards.

The sheriff said his priority is to deploy deputies to stop human and drug trafficking on Interstates 25 and 80.

The agreement also allows deputies to help trafficking and domestic violence victims obtain visas, ensuring the remain in the U.S. to testify.

""Our number one focus is to help people, and that's what we're going to do,"" said Kozak.

The Laramie County Detention Center has been approved by ICE to hold detainees, and the jail expected to receive 10 from an overcrowded facility in Colorado.

As of Oct. 1, the jail was housing 11 detainees on ICE holds. It receives a daily fee of $120 per detainee.

Some members of the Guard have been moved into the Chicago area.

And the president argues they should also be in Portland, Oregon.

Those plans were the focus of two federal court hearings today.

And just this evening, a federal judge in Chicago blocked the Trump administration's request for now to deploy the Guard, saying there's no danger of a rebellion to justify it.

She said the Guard would only -- quote -- ""add fuel to the fire.""

William Brangham reports on those developments.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Handcuffing a city councilmember, deploying tear gas near a public school, and, in this stylized video shot and distributed by the Department of Homeland Security, rappelling from a helicopter and storming an apartment complex while families inside slept, it's all part of a wave of aggressive actions by federal immigration agents in Chicago in recent weeks.

LAWRENCE BENITO, Executive Director, Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights: Their behavior definitely feels like it has escalated, where they now have permission to use excessive force.

It feels like it's shoot first, ask questions later.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lawrence Benito runs the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

His staff were on scene within hours after the helicopter-led raid.

LAWRENCE BENITO: They knocked down every door and took almost every person in that building, regardless of citizenship status.

There were children.

There were mothers.

All were taken, all were zip-tied, with no real communication about what they were there for or no real transparency whether they had warrants to do what they did or not.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin rejected those accusations, writing: ""Children were never zip-tied.

This is a shameful and disgusting lie.""

In the last month, more than 1,000 people have been arrested in and around Chicago since the Trump administration ramped up immigration raids in the city.

And, today, during a Cabinet meeting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem defended the administration's moves and said they will ramp up the federal presence.

KRISTI NOEM, U.S.

Homeland Security Secretary: We're purchasing more buildings in Chicago to operate out of.

We're going to not back off.

In fact, we're doubling down, and we're going to be in more parts of Chicago.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This week, over the objections of state and local leaders, President Trump mobilized and deployed some 200 members of the Texas National Guard to Chicago.

DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: We have cities where this tremendous crime.

And Chicago is one of them.

And if the governor can't straighten it out, we will straighten it out.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The administration says the Guard is needed to protect ICE agents from protests, which have erupted at an ICE facility outside the city.

Protesters have blocked government vehicles at the entrance to the site and agents have thrown demonstrators to the ground, deployed tear gas and fire pepper balls.

In one instance last month, a DHS agent appears to shoot a protesting Presbyterian minister in the head with a pepper ball.

In response, DHS said force was necessary because protesters were impeding operations and they'd been ordered to leave the federal property.

And further away from that facility, there have been two separate incidents in the last month underscoring the rising tensions between the community and federal officials.

In one instance, an ICE agent shot and killed Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a 38-year-old father of two during a traffic stop.

DHS alleges Gonzalez resisted arrest and dragged the agent with his car.

Agents were not wearing body cameras.

And one eyewitness said Gonzalez was driving away, trying to escape.

And then, over the weekend, protests broke out when a federal agent shot a woman who allegedly rammed his vehicle.

Yesterday, hundreds marched peacefully through downtown Chicago in opposition to the immigration crackdown and the National Guard's presence.

The city and the state are both suing the Trump administration over the move.

Therefore, in the context of the World Day of Migrants and Refugees and the Jubilee of Migrants, we wish to emphasize a central truth of our Christian faith: that every human person is created in the image and likeness of God and thus possesses an inherent dignity that is inviolable.

Many individuals and families have come to America fleeing violence, poverty, and extraordinary hardship. These are not mere statistics, but brothers and sisters in the human family, members who belong to and contribute to our local communities, parishes, and our nation.

As shepherds of the Church in Missouri, we support secure borders that ensure the safety and welfare of our nation. We also stand in solidarity with immigrants and their families, especially those who have already suffered so much in search of stability, peace, and safety.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church (n. 2241) teaches that a society oriented to the common good must address the issue of immigration in a manner that is both just and merciful. Civil authorities are duty-bound to protect citizens and ensure the rule of law, especially against evildoers. Yet it is equally just, and profoundly Christian, to distinguish between violent criminals and those who are fleeing persecution or crushing poverty to seek a better life. As Pope St. John Paul II wisely stated, “His irregular legal status cannot allow the migrant to lose his dignity, since he is endowed with inalienable rights, which can neither be violated nor ignored.” (Message for World Migration Day, 1996)

We urge our elected officials at every level to reflect this truth in policy by pursuing comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders while offering a just and merciful pathway for those who are already part of our communities. It is time to move beyond temporary fixes to a solution that honors the dignity of all and provides security and protects the sovereignty of our nation. Both are necessary for a prosperous future.

While this challenge is complex, we cannot remain indifferent. Our Lord reminds us, “Amen, I say to you, whatever you did for one of these least brothers of mine, you did for me” (Matthew 25:40). Let us pray fervently for our nation’s leaders, that they may govern with wisdom and compassion, and for those who flee persecution and hardship in search of safety. Let us educate ourselves on what the Church teaches about migration and the dignity of the human person. And let us extend the hand of charity to migrants and refugees in our neighborhoods, schools, and parishes.

May Our Lady of Guadalupe, Patroness of the Americas, intercede for us.

Shapiro in Philadelphia on Oct. 9, 2025.

Pennsylvania has joined several states taking legal action against President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in U.S. cities, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced on Wednesday night.

“Deploying the National Guard to patrol American cities over the wishes of their governors is incredibly dangerous and an unprecedented infringement on states’ rights,” Shapiro wrote on social media. “Pennsylvania just took legal action to support our fellow states and put an end to the dangerous overreach of power we are seeing with Donald Trump’s Guard deployments.”

Over the summer, Trump ordered National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests. That action was ruled by a federal judge in California in September to be a violation of federal law against military members conducting domestic law enforcement.

Trump has deployed troops to three cities; Could Philadelphia be on his list?

Since then, Trump has also sent National Guard troops to Chicago, Memphis, Tennessee, and Portland, Oregon, in what he says is an effort to combat crime. However, elected officials in Illinois and Oregon have argued against this move and have filed legal challenges over it. The Republican governor of Tennessee has welcomed the deployment.

Shapiro joins a coalition of 24 attorney generals and governors in an amicus brief supporting Oregon’s court challenge to Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in their state.

“President Trump’s deployment of Oregon’s National Guard, and attempted deployment of out-of-state Guard forces in Oregon, without the consent of Oregon’s Governor and in violation of the statute on which the President relies, is unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic,” the officials wrote in the amicus brief. “It is inconsistent with one of our Nation’s founding principles that freedom depends on the subordination of the military to civilian authority.”

“It violates core constitutional principles of federalism, and it infringes on the sovereignty and police powers reserved to the States,” they add. “By calling forth troops when there is no invasion to repel, no rebellion to suppress, and when state and local law enforcement are fully able to execute the law, the President flouts the vision of our Founders, undermines the rule of law, and sets a chilling precedent that puts the constitutional rights of all Americans at risk.”

Shapiro has been an outspoken critic of Trump’s threats to send the National Guard to these cities for months, saying that his administration is prepared to act if Trump decides to deploy troops in the Keystone State.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Shapiro said his office could take “many additional actions” over this matter in the future.

“This is just one piece,” Shapiro said in response to a question from the Capital-Star.

The brief includes Shapiro’s name, but not state Attorney General Dave Sunday, a Republican.

Shapiro told the Capital-Star that he has a “very constructive” working relationship with Sunday.

“I have authority as governor to file an amicus brief like that, to file lawsuits,” Shapiro said. “As does he under the Commonwealth Attorneys Act.”

Sunday’s office declined to comment on the legal action taken by Shapiro.

Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner held a series of town halls last month to provide advice for what citizens should do if the National Guard was deployed to Pennsylvania’s biggest city, while also sharply criticizing the president’s approach.

Shapiro, noting his current role as commander in chief of the Pennsylvania National Guard and former state Attorney General, referenced his administration funding 1,500 more police officers as a reason that gun deaths have decreased in the state since he was sworn in to office.

“If Donald Trump is actually serious about crime, he should support states and local governments who know their communities best,” Shapiro wrote.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/losangelesnationalguard-2048x1355.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 09:56:38.560026

Nevertheless, large numbers of Chinese nationals submitted frivolous asylum claims, effectively short-circuiting their removal – at least temporarily.
However, national security concerns relating to large numbers of Chinese nationals who are here on student and other visas persist.","A key component of FAIR’s mission has always been to educate the public about the impact of our immigration policies on the vital interests of the American people. The merger of the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) into FAIR earlier this summer promised to enhance this mission by bringing together IRLI’s investigative portfolio with FAIR’s well-established research capabilities. This synergy led to FAIR’s publication of two new reports in early September that expose how America’s adversaries have been exploiting U.S. immigration policies to undermine our interests and national cohesion.

How China Weaponized America’s Immigration Chaos

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has made their objective very clear: they plan to supplant the United States as the world’s dominant military and economic superpower. It is a goal they have been pursuing relentlessly for more than 40 years. And, during the past four years, the Biden administration’s open-borders policies provided them with a new opportunity to advance their mission.

A comprehensive analysis conducted by FAIR’s Research department finds that China took full advantage of the Biden administration’s open-borders policies. The magnitude of illegal immigration from China grew exponentially during that period and can be summed up with two numbers: 29,136 and 182,628.

29,136 is the cumulative number of illegal aliens from mainland China who were encountered entering the U.S. illegally during the eleven-year period prior to former President Biden taking office.

182,628 is the cumulative number of illegal aliens from mainland China who were encountered entering the U.S. illegally during the four years of the Biden administration.

It is important to note that the 182,628 figure only reflects the number of Chinese illegal aliens who were encountered by U.S. immigration authorities. Under the Biden administration, some 2 million known “gotaways” crossed our borders illegally and disappeared into the country. It is reasonable to assume that, at least some of those 2 million people were nationals of the People’s Republic of China.

Like most of the illegal aliens who arrived here during the Biden administration, the vast majority of Chinese nationals were economic migrants. China’s economy suffered greatly from the COVID pandemic. Poor economic conditions in one’s homeland, however, are never grounds for seeking asylum. Nevertheless, large numbers of Chinese nationals submitted frivolous asylum claims, effectively short-circuiting their removal – at least temporarily. By the end of 2023, 112,495 Chinese citizens had pending asylum claims. Should any of these asylum claims be denied, the likelihood that the applicants will be successfully removed from the United States is low. China heads the list of recalcitrant countries (those nations who will not accept their own nationals for repatriation after they are deported from the United States). Accordingly, thousands of Chinese citizens with final orders of deportation are essentially free to roam the U.S. until U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement effectuates their removal to China or a third country.

What makes illegal immigration from China especially concerning is that the Chinese government is engaged in large-scale military and industrial espionage against the United States. Even beyond the borders of China, the CCP holds enormous leverage over expatriates in the form of family members who remain there. Chinese law also requires its citizens to participate in intelligence operations. FAIR’s report found that, “Up to 100 incidents have been documented of Chinese nationals accessing or attempting to access military bases and other sensitive sites,” including by those who entered illegally.

China is also an integral player in the fentanyl crisis, working closely with Mexican cartels. Many of the component chemicals for the lethal drug originate in China. The Biden administration’s open borders facilitated the entry of fentanyl to the U.S., and Chinese nationals were involved in laundering the cartels’ drug money.

President Trump has effectively curtailed unlawful crossings of the U.S. – Mexican border since taking office. However, national security concerns relating to large numbers of Chinese nationals who are here on student and other visas persist. In many cases, these students and visitors have access to highly sensitive research vital to economic and national security. Unfortunately, rather than reducing the numbers of Chinese students at American universities and instituting tighter vetting, President Trump has indicated that he supports American universities continuing to take in hundreds of thousands of Chinese students, effectively training America’s competition.

The June 2025 Anti-ICE Riots in LA Were a Coordinated Campaign Organized by Anti- Border Groups and Foreign Actors

The civil unrest that took place in Los Angeles was anything but a peaceful and spontaneous grassroots reaction to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations that took place in that city earlier this year. FAIR’s new Investigations department uncovered extensive evidence that the attacks on ICE officers and widespread destruction of property that took place in June were orchestrated by outside agitators.

The mayhem, and the refusal of local and state officials to respond meaningfully, precipitated the need for the federal government to dispatch the National Guard and active-duty Marines to the city to quell the violence. In fact, the investigative report found that it is likely that both the LAPD and the LA County Sheriff’s Department had prior knowledge of this orchestration but failed to act on it.

FAIR’s report analyzes how outside groups – including those representing foreign interests – took advantage of legitimate expressions of protest against ICE enforcement policies to foment violence and sow domestic discord in the U.S. FAIR’s investigation found that, “Command structures were evident as the riots unfolded, with agitators using megaphones and hand signals to direct crowds toward specific locations.” Additionally, there were “individuals driving trucks full of supplies and handing out face shields to rioters so they could continue their attacks against law enforcement.”

These organizers included domestic groups, such as the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (CHIRLA) and the Hispanic Federation. CHIRLA has been the beneficiary of $34 million in state grants since 2023, while the Hispanic Federation has received $20 million in funding from corporate sponsors and progressive foundations.

Funding also flowed in from foreign sources, including China which has also been exploiting our open borders and access to leading American universities. It appears that money from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), channeled through American expatriates Neville Roy Singham and his wife Jodie Evans (who managed Jerry Brown’s 1992 presidential campaign), was directed to the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL). PSL was one of the groups that played a role in inciting the unrest that unfolded. The Mexican government also provided support for detained Mexican nationals, and openly condemned ICE’s enforcement actions in the second largest city in the U.S.

The findings of FAIR’s investigation reveal striking similarities to other violent protests that have taken place across U.S. cities and college campuses over the past several years.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/NL2510_Article-2.jpg.webp?itok=Br4YgEIB,N,,2025-10-10 12:59:18.808047

The lawmakers said agency officials failed to adequately answer their questions during the visit, prompting a formal inquiry to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.

“We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility,” the lawmakers wrote in a shared letter to Erik Johnson, the deputy field office director of enforcement and removal operations at ICE’s Seattle field office. “We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility.”

The data is understating the scale of the reorganization, as the FBI only provided counts for agents who are now spending more than half of their job doing immigration enforcement, according to Warner.
The senator’s office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents’ total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS.
FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids.
The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear.","Nearly half of the FBI agents working in the US’s major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to newly released data, a stunning shift in law enforcement priorities that has raised public safety concerns.

Personnel data obtained by Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, and shared with the Guardian, suggests the Trump administration has moved 45% of FBI agents in the country’s 25 largest field offices to support the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration crackdown. Across all of the FBI’s offices, 23% of the roughly 13,000 total agents at the bureau are now working on immigration, according to Warner, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.

Warner’s office said the FBI agents now deployed alongside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent have been taken away from their work tackling cybercrimes, drug trafficking, terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, counterintelligence and other efforts that are part of the bureau’s mission – some areas that Trump has claimed are White House priorities.

The data, first reported by the Washington Post, suggests the FBI is dramatically shifting its objectives in an effort to back Trump’s increasingly aggressive immigration raids, with the administration targeting 3,000 daily arrests and seeking to expand its detention capacity to detain more than 100,000 immigrants.

The data is understating the scale of the reorganization, as the FBI only provided counts for agents who are now spending more than half of their job doing immigration enforcement, according to Warner. The senator’s office said it was likely that more than a quarter of FBI agents’ total hours were now dedicated to immigration, and that in some field offices, more than half of the agents had been redirected to DHS.

“When you pull a quarter of the FBI’s top agents off the front lines of fighting terrorists, spies, drug traffickers, and violent criminals, the consequences are clear: critical national security work gets sidelined, and our country is put at greater risk,” Warner said in a statement.

The transformation of the FBI has raised alarms about the potential consequences for communities targeted by immigration raids and the impact on the work the bureau is abandoning, experts said.

Mike German, a former FBI agent and civil liberties advocate, said it was unprecedented for the bureau to redirect this many agents to a mission that is not part of the FBI’s mandate. Some agents might be eager to support the president’s immigration agenda while others likely oppose the redirection, he said: “Part of the reason FBI leadership would be doing this at such scale is to separate those two – to identify who are the loyalists and who are potential impediments to the administration’s goals.”

The move is in line with FBI director Kash Patel’s efforts to purge the bureau of agents seen as disloyal to Trump, German said, noting reports of the termination of personnel involved in the January 6 investigation.

FBI agents, he said, are generally trained as investigators who may make targeted arrests, a job that significantly differs from those of many immigration enforcement officers, which could lead to problems in the field during immigration raids. “Just jumping in an SUV with a bunch of armed men and rolling around the streets until you see someone running away is inherently a more dangerous type of activity they are not very well trained for,” German said.

There has been extensive documentation of the violent and indiscriminate nature of the Ice raids, which have often been carried out by masked men and have at times led to the detention of US citizens, and adding FBI personnel to the mix could exacerbate the chaos and potential for abuses, the former agent said.

The exact tasks and responsibilities of the FBI agents now working alongside Ice are unclear. Spokespeople for DHS, Ice, the FBI and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

German, an FBI whistleblower who has spoken out about the civil rights abuses of the bureau’s intelligence work, said he was most concerned about the agency shifting away from public corruption and white-collar crime, offenses state and local agencies don’t have capacity to tackle: “That’s where the real harm will come.”

Current and former FBI agents told the Washington Post there were growing concerns about low morale within the agency and that agents were stretched thin, which could hamper national security investigations and complex cases.

Kenneth Gray, a former FBI agent and professor of practice in the University of New Haven’s criminal justice department, said the shift in priorities resembled the post-9/11 reorganization at the FBI, when counterterrorism became the central focus.

“The bureau can withstand a temporary change in its priorities, but in the long-term, if agents are continuing to work immigration matters, as opposed to counterterrorism, foreign counterintelligence or cybercrimes, that may end up biting us big time,” said Gray, who worked at the bureau for 24 years, before leaving in 2012. “The next 9/11 might happen if agents who were working on counterterrorism have been diverted.”

Gray, however, said he was not concerned about a temporary shift while DHS engages in rapid recruitment of new Ice officers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6bdfe7d049a29e516c57d4d6abdfc6a2001dca/1006_0_6849_5479/master/6849.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae2aa8b16716e571ff06ef6480cae497",N,,2025-10-09 19:56:47.696572

Dear Mr. Johnson:

Thank you for coordinating the visit to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on September 25, 2025. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative, and today we write to follow up on several items that we discussed during the visit. We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility.

We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility. There are multiple instances of agents breaking car windows and ripping people from their vehicles, holding knives to people’s necks, and shoving bystanders to the ground. In addition to this unnecessary violence and use of force, ICE agents hide their identities by wearing masks and do not have visible identification or badge numbers. This poses a serious safety concern and makes the entire community less safe. We also heard about changes being made to expeditiously hire new ICE agents at the facility, including compressing the training. In addition to unnecessary aggression perpetuated by ICE agents, we are concerned about how new agents with less training might further escalate tensions in the community.

Because of the scale of immigration enforcement operations in Oregon and the lack of transparency around DHS and ICE procedures under the current Trump administration, we demand answers to the following questions:

What is the current process to initiate an initial review of a bond request at Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO)? Who at ERO is responsible for initial reviews of requests for bond?

What criteria is used to determine which requests for bond will be sent forward or denied? Please provide any directives that outline these criteria.

Of the total number of detained noncitizens who have come through the facility since January 2025, how many bond requests have been approved and how many have been denied?

We have seen reports that individuals with legal status have been detained. What criteria have agents been given to determine who to detain?

There are several instances of immigrants with documented medical and health concerns or who were recovering from surgery who were summarily deported. What standards are used to determine medical clearance for deportation? Please provide a copy of those standards.

Masked ICE agents are unidentifiable in our communities and hide their identities. This raises significant safety concerns. How are you holding your staff accountable for negligence and unnecessary violence if ICE agents do not have identification or badge numbers visible?

We understand that hiring for the community relations position at the Macadam facility has been challenging. What plans are in place to hire a Community Relations staff for the Macadam facility?

There are multiple reports of ICE staff harassing volunteers outside of the facility. What training are staff receiving on carrying out community enforcement? What plans are in place to guarantee that newly hired staff are adequately trained on a condensed timeline?

How are you complying with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements and working to make sure people with mobility issues are able to access the facility for appointments?

Thank you for your attention to this letter and we look forward to your prompt response.

Dear Secretary Noem:

On September 25, 2025, members of the Oregon congressional delegation visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on S. Macadam Avenue. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative. Today we write to follow up on several items that were discussed during the visit. We remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations by Federal Protective Service (FPS) at the facility.

More than a dozen advocates outside the facility have reported unprovoked attacks by Homeland Security police and FPS officers, leaving people with large bruises, chemical burns, and lingering pain. The Portland Police Bureau reported that federal police shoved, hit, and used chemical spray on people outside the facility when, according to multiple witnesses, there was no physical threat to officers. Additionally, a Portland Police Bureau Assistant Chief said in a court filing that federal police are instigating some of the clashes. These allegations are unacceptable. It is the responsibility of FPS to protect federal persons and property.[1] In June, the President issued a Presidential Memoranda calling at least 2,000 members of the National Guard into Federal service under the false premise that they are needed to “temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel performing Federal functions.”[2]

Over the weekend, federal law enforcement escalated their tactics against demonstrators outside of Macadam facility, including firing tear gas and smoke canisters, pepper spraying peaceful protestors in the face, and deploying pepper bullets. These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable.

We demand additional clarity about the response from your agents at the ICE Macadam facility:

What type of munitions are used against people collected outside of the Macadam facility? Please provide a detailed description.

What criteria is used to determine whether or not to use munitions against people outside the facility? How do you decide what tools to use at different times of day? Who makes those determinations?

There have been several reports of Federal Protective Services Agents instigating violent altercations with peaceful protesters outside the Macadam facility. How does FPS determine when to engage with protestors? What criteria is used to make these determinations? Are there protocols in place to hold FPS accountable when they use unnecessary force?

Neighbors and businesses near the Macadam facility have reported lingering substances in the air causing health concerns. How are you working with neighbors and businesses around the facility to reduce negative consequences of these substances?

Thank you for your attention to this letter. We look forward to hearing from you by October 22, 2025.

Dear Attorney General Bondi:

On September 25, 2025, members of the Oregon congressional delegation visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in downtown Portland on S. Macadam Avenue. The facility tour and meeting with ICE staff was very informative. Today we write to follow up on several items that were discussed during the visit. We remain extremely concerned about due process violations by ICE staff and attorneys.

The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees the right to due process, regardless of immigration status, and the Immigration and Nationality Act outlines the right to counsel in any removal proceedings.[3] Due process is a cornerstone of American democracy that is currently being eroded. When a person’s rights are violated, the result can be wrongful deportations.

Community organizations are reporting that some immigrants are being denied access to counsel at the Macadam facility. During our meeting at the ICE facility, we repeatedly asked for clarification about why individuals in detention have been denied access to counsel and were not provided with an adequate response. Because of the scale of immigration enforcement operations in Oregon and the lack of transparency around DHS and ICE procedures under the current Trump administration, we demand answers to the following questions:

What pre-representation support is allowed at the Macadam facility?

Do you allow attorneys to enter the Macadam facility to conduct pre-representational interviews?

Do you ever deny attorneys access to the facility to conduct pre-representational interviews? If so, under what circumstances and what authority?

The U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to due process and the law allows the right to an attorney. On what grounds are you denying counsel to individuals in custody?

What is the protocol staff follow when someone in ICE custody at the Macadam facility requests a lawyer?

What options are available for individuals seeking virtual immigration hearings? Are these ever granted? If not, on what grounds are those requests denied?

How long do removal proceeding hearings typically last?

Which personnel are allowed into immigration hearings (ICE staff, DOJ staff, attorneys, etc.)?

Thank you for your attention to this letter and we look forward to your prompt response.

,Litigation,2025-10-09 22:21:25+00:00,Chicago Sun-Times,Judge grants a partial temporary restraining order on National Guard deployment in Illinois,"Jon Seidel, Tina Sfondeles",,,,,https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/10/09/national-guard-lawsuit-judge-ruling-illinois-trump,"A federal judge said she is partially granting the state’s request to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard units in the Chicago area as part of an immigration enforcement action.
“I have seen no credible evidence that there is danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said.
Arguments have concluded in the hearing over the state’s lawsuit against the Trump administration that seeks to block the deployment of National Guard units over Gov.
No one from the Federal Protective Service requested any National Guard troops.” Perry also asked Hamilton what the troops would do.
“Where in Illinois are conditions so severe the president is unable to enforce federal law?”","A federal judge said she is partially granting the state’s request to block the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard units in the Chicago area as part of an immigration enforcement action.

After hearing arguments from lawyers representing the state and the Justice Department, U.S. District Judge April Perry said she will grant “in part” a state request for a temporary restraining order against troop deployment.

Perry said her decision comes down to a “credibility determination.”

“I simply cannot credit [the Trump administration’s] declarations to the extent they contradict state and local law enforcement,” Perry said. “[The Department of Homeland Security’s] perception of events [is] simply unreliable.”

Perry pointed to other federal prosecutions or lawsuits in Chicago and said “in the last 48 hours, in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ credibility and assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago.”

The Trump administration mobilized hundreds of National Guard members to protect federal agents and property over objections from Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who sued on behalf of the state and city to block the move.

“I have seen no credible evidence that there is danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois,” the judge said.

Perry is still ruling and the details of her order are not yet known.

Arguments have concluded in the hearing over the state’s lawsuit against the Trump administration that seeks to block the deployment of National Guard units over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections.

U.S. District Judge April Perry intends to reconvene in her courtroom at 4:30 p.m. with lawyers representing the state, which is seeking a temporary restraining order against the deployment, and Justice Department lawyers fighting that effort.

Before the court went into recess, Christopher Wells, the lead lawyer representing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Pritzker administration, summarized the state’s position that President Trump was acting maliciously with his push for National Guard troops in Illinois despite the governor’s objections.

“This case is replete with evidence of bad faith, of an abandonment of public virtue, of a lack of honest devotion to the public interest and of a grave risk of usurpation or wanton tyranny,” Wells said.

The Justice Department lawyer representing Trump, Eric Hamilton, reiterated that Trump’s judgment in this case is “unreviewable” and argued there’s “no possible irreparable injury from 500 members of the guard protecting federal property and personnel in a state of 13 million people.”

It’s unclear whether Perry will issue a decision from the bench later this afternoon.

U.S. District Judge April Perry asked Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton whether the president’s perceived inability to execute the law – a justification needed for Trump to mobilize the National Guard under federal law – was something “caused by the federal agents.”

Hamilton responded, “No, your honor.”

The judge then observed that the Broadview immigration enforcement processing facility had been the site of “nothing but peaceful prayer vigils” for 19 years. “And then,” Perry said, “CBP shows up and then suddenly things take a turn for the worse.”

Perry asked Hamilton whether the feds’ provoking protesters to the point federal law is unenforceable is something to be weighed under the National Guard mobilization law.

“No,” Hamilton said. “If that were true, the fact still remains that we are seeing sustained violence against federal personnel and property in Illinois.”

Singling out examples of violence the feds provided – claims of “slashed tires” and “keyed cars” – the judge said, “Some of this frankly sounds like a Carrie Underwood song.”

Hamilton shot back: “This is no Carrie Underwood song.”

He pointed to more serious incidents, including the claim of a bomb.

Perry asked what was in that alleged device, and Hamilton responded, “I don’t know.”

U.S. District Judge April Perry turned her questioning of a Justice Department lawyer toward statements President Trump has made about deploying National Guard troops to Illinois and asked whether he is relying on “completely invalid evidence.”

Perry said there appeared to be a “very large disconnect” between what Trump said on social media and in press conferences and what conditions are actually like on the ground in Illinois.

The judge zeroed in on the case of Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, protesters at the Broadview ICE facility who were arrested while each was legally carrying a gun. In an unusual move, a federal grand jury refused to indict the couple.

The couple’s arrest was used, in part, as a justification by the Trump administration for National Guard units to help protect federal agents on the ground in the Chicago area.

But Perry noted how carrying a gun is a constitutionally protected right and that a grand jury didn’t support criminal charges against the couple.

“This indicates to me a certain lack of credibility,” Perry told the Justice Department lawyer.

With opening arguments over, U.S. District Judge April Perry pressed the Justice Department lawyer on whether the National Guard deployment that appears now to exceed 500 troops could increase and exactly what their duties would be.

Eric Hamilton, the lawyer representing the federal government, called plans for headcount and the troops’ use a “dynamic situation that could change.”

Hamilton went on to say that troops expected to be assigned at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse would be there at the request of the Federal Protective Services, a contention the judge said is “untrue. No one from the Federal Protective Service requested any National Guard troops.”

Perry also asked Hamilton what the troops would do.

He said they would “provide protection” but in a way that’s “distinct from law enforcement.” They would not be authorized to make arrests, he said.

Perry pressed Hamilton on whether troops would be “solving crime in Chicago,” and he answered, “Certainly, to an extent.”

The lead federal government lawyer justified President Trump’s deployment of National Guard units to Illinois because Chicago is experiencing what he called a “brazen new form of hostility from rioters targeting federal law enforcement.”

Department of Justice attorney Eric Hamilton told Judge April Perry that those objecting to the actions of federal immigration enforcement agents are “not protesters. They are the violent resistance to duly enacted immigration laws.”

Hamilton pointed to different examples of alleged violence against federal agents and said that was the basis for the mobilization of Guard units. Federal law allows that, he said, if there is “either a rebellion or a danger of a rebellion.”

Hamilton called the president’s decision to send in troops “unreviewable” and denied Illinois’ claim that the deployment is in retaliation to the sanctuary status of Illinois and Chicago.

“This federalization happened to respond to an urgent and serious ongoing threat to officer safety and to the protection of property,” he said.

With Attorney General Kwame Raoul sitting in the front row, a lawyer representing the state of Illinois argued that the Trump administration’s mobilization of National Guard units over Gov. JB Pritzker’s objections upsets the “careful balance of our constitutional system” and must be stopped.

Christopher Wells opened his arguments for a temporary restraining order against Trump with a look back to the country’s founders.

“Rebellion. Invasion. Insurrection. War. These are heavy words,” Wells told U.S. District Judge April Perry. “The people who wrote our Constitution understood the weight of these words. The people who wrote our constitution had lived these words.”

The federal immigration enforcement action known as Operation Midway Blitz has boasted of 1,000 arrests, but Wells said there is no justification to warrant Trump’s deployment of National Guard units to help with that task.

“Where exactly is the problem?” he asked. “Where in Illinois are conditions so severe the president is unable to enforce federal law?”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/12efe0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5913x3375+0+284/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6f%2Fd5%2F3cc1192d4e8385186bcda69721aa%2Ftexastroops-101025-06.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:58:13.337621

CT lawmakers are considering it - Hartford Courant,Livi Stanford,,,,,https://www.courant.com/2025/10/09/more-legal-protections-for-immigrants-ct-lawmakers-are-considering-it/,"With ICE arrests continuing in Connecticut and immigrant advocates calling for state officials to act, lawmakers are in discussions about increasing legal protections during an upcoming special session.
Undocumented immigrants in the state have contributed about “one billion (dollars) in federal, state and local taxes each year,” according to DataHaven.
The state civil rights law would expressly protect federal constitutional rights in state law, according to Lesser.
“The only way to expand the Trust Act from its current form is by adding more crimes that undocumented immigrants can be convicted of and still be protected under the Trust Act,” he said.
“Never in the conversation about the Trust Act has anyone who is an advocate of the Trust Act said, ‘you know what, we are working to make sure more crimes don’t fall under this,'” he said.","With ICE arrests continuing in Connecticut and immigrant advocates calling for state officials to act, lawmakers are in discussions about increasing legal protections during an upcoming special session.

State Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, co-chair of the Judiciary Committee, said there are significant conversations among his colleagues and the executive branch about potential legislation during a special session but there are key differences internally among parties to the discussion.

He said nothing has been finalized.

“I think we should do everything we legally can to protect these people,” Winfield said. “Others are concerned about what those decisions mean for the federal government interfacing with the state,” the senator said. “I think that is where the differences come in. We are trying to negotiate between those different sets of thoughts and concerns and we just have not come to a place where we have done that.”

In the state there have been increased arrests and detentions of immigrants by ICE agents wearing masks showing up at court, at the offices where people go to make child support payments and at people’s workplaces and their homes, immigration advocates said.

Immigration advocates and faith leaders called on legislators Monday to pass legislation during the special session to protect immigrants.

“It is extremely important to protect the courthouses and make sure that people are not in danger of being picked up by ICE when they are reporting for other issues,” Constanza Segovia, cofounder of the Hartford Deportation Defense and organizing director for Connecticut For All Coalition said. “It ends up impacting the justice system as a whole if people don’t feel safe going to court for a speeding ticket or to report domestic violence. It is a matter of public safety to access the courts.”

Protecting personal data of immigrants and citizens is also crucial, Segovia added, explaining that people should feel safe paying taxes in the state and not fear that they will be picked up as a result.

Undocumented immigrants in the state have contributed about “one billion (dollars) in federal, state and local taxes each year,” according to DataHaven.

On Sept. 19, Gov. Ned Lamont and the state Supreme Court Justice Raheem Mullins issued a new policy that states that ICE cannot make arrests without a warrant inside the state courthouses. Further, the policy states that immigration agents cannot wear masks.

Ninety-two organizations committed to immigrant rights, civil rights, human rights, gender rights, worker rights and racial justice, sent a letter to the lawmakers outlining specific priorities for immigration protections including protecting immigrants at courthouses; preserving Husky Medicaid for undocumented children and pregnant individuals; protecting the personal information of the immigrant community and all Connecticut residents; and making communities safer by prohibiting the use of state and local resources to assist in immigration enforcement, according to the letter.

Local immigration attorneys said that ICE is targeting those with deportation orders and those enrolled in former President Joe Biden’s parole program. But some are just being profiled as ICE agents pass by.

This past June Lamont signed legislation strengthening the controversial Connecticut Trust Act, the current law maintaining the independence of state and municipal police.

The Trust Act blocks local police from making an arrest that is based only on a request by federal agents in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.

Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, said with over a $100 billion of federal funding allocated for ICE starting this fiscal year, the state has to respond in some way.

“I want to make sure the constitutional rights of everyone in Connecticut including U.S. citizens are protected,” he said. “The federal government has a responsibility to enforce immigration laws. I respect that. I am concerned about overreach and infringement of constitutional rights.”

He added that the legislature should pass the state civil rights law and ensure protections are in place to tighten rules upon state data.

The state civil rights law would expressly protect federal constitutional rights in state law, according to Lesser.

“The state has the ability to protect federal constitutional rights at the state level and to say that we are going to ensure that they are not violated,” Lesser said.

“We need to tighten up the rules on data sharing,” he said.

State Sen. Saud Anwar, co-chair of the state’s Public Health Committee, also called for legislation to protect immigrants.

“We need a comprehensive strategy going forward because the federal government is on a different trajectory,” he said. “We must make this a priority. No immigrant in the community should live in fear of masked individuals kidnapping them.”

Senate Republican leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said he has hesitation anytime any advocate wants to expand the Trust Act because in his view all it does is expand protections to criminals.

“The only way to expand the Trust Act from its current form is by adding more crimes that undocumented immigrants can be convicted of and still be protected under the Trust Act,” he said. “I am all for having a discussion for those who may be here illegally but otherwise abiding by the law and positively contributing to society. I am not willing to have any discussion about helping individuals that are being convicted of violent, heinous crimes and protecting those from deportation.”

Harding added that “we go down a very slippery slope when we start dictating to federal authorities what they can and cannot do in the state of Connecticut.”

Winfield said it is a red herring for Republicans to talk about the issue of crime related to the Trust Act.

“Never in the conversation about the Trust Act has anyone who is an advocate of the Trust Act said, ‘you know what, we are working to make sure more crimes don’t fall under this,'” he said. “The only thing that has happened with the Trust Act is we’ve said, ‘let’s put more crimes so more crimes are covered as exceptions.’

“The stuff we are talking about is what happens in our courts. The stuff we are talking about is whether ICE can run throughout the state of Connecticut unidentified. The stuff we are talking about is whether they follow the laws of the state. It is a distraction. They know better,” Winfield said.

The law strengthening the Trust Act also expands situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers and not be subject to litigation, according to the Connecticut Mirror. The Mirror reported the bill added 13 crimes including sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation and others for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request.

Winfield said at the core what we “are trying to do is offer people protections that we can and from my perspective you can call it the expansion of the Trust Act, you can call it something new — I don’t care what you call it. What I care about at the end of the day is what is the state of Connecticut’s policy toward immigrants who largely have been good neighbors to us.”

Ghanaian immigration authorities then “had no other choice” but to process Berchie into Ghana, according to the legal filing.
Ratkowski disputed this argument in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit, arguing that the difficulty of obtaining a travel document from Ghana had not changed since 2022.","A Ghanaian national who lived in Minnesota is alleging U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement illegally deported him earlier this week.

Martin Berchie, who had been detained by ICE in Sherburne County Jail since August, alleges that ICE forged his name on the travel document used to deport him to Ghana on Tuesday.

Travel documents are official paperwork needed that authorize the removal of a non-U.S. citizen to another country.

Berchie, 31, made the allegation in a legal filing Wednesday afternoon in U.S. District Court. The legal filing asks for an evidentiary hearing to present the allegations to a judge.

“The deportation was performed in an illegal manner through the use of forged documents,” Berchie’s attorney, Nico Ratkowski, wrote in the Wednesday legal filing.

Sahan Journal reached out to ICE for comment but did not receive a response.

Berchie alleges that ICE agents put his name on a travel document that was already used for a different ICE detainee who had already been deported. They then “abandoned” Berchie in pre-customs in Ghana “instead of presenting him to Ghana immigration authorities.”

“Ghana rejected [Berchie] and went to look for the immigration officers that brought him, but was unable to locate those officers,” Berchie’s legal filing reads.

Ghanaian immigration authorities then “had no other choice” but to process Berchie into Ghana, according to the legal filing.

“This is akin to pushing Berchie out of a helicopter with a parachute because a travel document could not be produced,” Ratkowski wrote in the legal filing. “If [Berchie]’s claims are true, [ICE]’s actions were extraordinarily illegal and are a seminal and extremely concerning example of bad faith by the agency.”

In August shortly after his arrest, Ratkowski filed a habeas corpus lawsuit in court asking ICE to release Berchie because previous attempts to deport him had been unsuccessful. Habeas corpus lawsuits are requests to the court to be released from jail while an immigration case is pending.

Berchie came to the United States from Ghana in 2018 on an F1 visa to attend college. His visa expired the following year, according to a legal filing by Assistant U.S. Attorney Trevor Brown opposing his habeas motion.

In 2020, he was charged with two counts of criminal sexual conduct after a woman accused him of sexual assault. Berchie ultimately pleaded guilty in September 2021 to fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct. Court documents say he was credited for time already served at the time of his sentencing.

ICE detained him in November 2020, and held Berchie in the Freeborn County Jail. In March 2021, an immigration judge ordered Berchie to be removed from the country and deported to Ghana. But ICE had trouble deporting Berchie and released him from jail in February 2022 because “Ghana was not timely issuing a travel document at that point,” according to the legal filing by Brown.

ICE instead placed him on an order of supervision, which required him to check in with the agency on a monthly basis.

Berchie complied with the supervision order through August of this year, according to his habeas lawsuit. In fact, ICE detained Berchie during a check-in required under the supervision order.

“[Berchie] is now detained because there is a significant likelihood of his removal to Ghana in the foreseeable future,” Brown wrote.

Brown wrote that Ghana had, so far this year, issued 70 travel documents to ICE detainees and that ICE officials applied for a travel document for Berchie on Aug. 12.

“Berchie will be removed from the United States in the foreseeable future,” Brown wrote.

Ratkowski disputed this argument in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit, arguing that the difficulty of obtaining a travel document from Ghana had not changed since 2022.

“The government is not in possession of any credible or persuasive documents or evidence that Berchie’s removal is likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future,” Ratkowski wrote in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit.

He characterized Berchie’s detention as “punitive” and serving “no legitimate purpose.”

“The redetention of Berchie is designed to send a message to other individuals with final orders of removal that they need to leave the United States or they will be jailed indefinitely and without any process,” Ratkowski wrote in Berchie’s habeas lawsuit.",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WhippleBuilding-9314.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:58:31.460929

In a separate letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers accused the Federal Protective Service of using unnecessary force against demonstrators and advocates outside the Portland facility.
“These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable,” the lawmakers wrote, demanding details on when and how agents are authorized to use such munitions.

Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., led Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and Rep. Maxine Dexter in sending letters this week to top federal officials following a Sept. 25 visit to the ICE facility on Southwest Macadam Avenue, which has been the site of frequent clashes between protestors and federal officers. The lawmakers said agency officials failed to adequately answer their questions during the visit, prompting a formal inquiry to ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.

“We received conflicting information from ICE staff, and we remain extremely concerned about civil and human rights violations occurring at the facility,” the lawmakers wrote in a shared letter to Erik Johnson, the deputy field office director of enforcement and removal operations at ICE’s Seattle field office. “We are deeply concerned by the lack of oversight and accountability of ICE agents, including those operating out of the Macadam facility.”

The delegation cited reports of ICE agents breaking car windows, forcibly removing people from vehicles and concealing their identities with masks. They also raised concerns about shortened training for new hires and possible violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In a separate letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers accused the Federal Protective Service of using unnecessary force against demonstrators and advocates outside the Portland facility. The letter described accounts of unprovoked shoving, pepper-spraying and firing tear gas and pepper bullets into crowds, causing health concerns for nearby residents and businesses.

“These attacks initiated by FPS and other federal law enforcement are unacceptable,” the lawmakers wrote, demanding details on when and how agents are authorized to use such munitions.

A third letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi raised questions about due process and access to attorneys for immigrants detained at the facility. The lawmakers said some detainees have been denied legal counsel, potentially leading to wrongful deportations.

“We repeatedly asked for clarification about why individuals in detention have been denied access to counsel and were not provided with an adequate response,” the lawmakers wrote.

Chicago police were reportedly ordered not to answer federal agents calls for back-up.","One of Chicago’s most prominent South Side Democrats thinks the anti-ICE radicals are only showing why federal troops are needed in the Windy City.

He also blames local liberal leaders for goading agitators into the violence seen over the weekend.

Raymond Lopez — alderman for Chicago’s 15th Ward — fears rhetoric from leaders like Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson is pushing the city and the country to a dangerous place that there may be no coming back from.

“The politics of this city and of hyper progressive liberalism is bringing us closer to the brink with an escalation that I don’t think any of us truly wants to see,” Lopez told The Post.

“The governor, the mayor, with a wink and a nod, told everyone to protest peacefully. And we’ve seen the exact opposite unfold,” he added.

“They’re continuing to play a game of chicken with other people’s lives.”

Lopez is one of Chicago’s only Democratic leaders to openly support President Trump’s plan to use the National Guard to fight local crime since it was first proposed over the summer.

He said his position hasn’t changed since the White House confirmed over the weekend that 300 troops would be dispatched to protect ICE agents conducting immigration-enforcement raids in the city.

Those ICE operations were targeted by violent harassment, with some protesters even following federal agents and boxing them in on Saturday, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Chicago police were reportedly ordered not to answer federal agents calls for back-up.

The Chicago Police Department has since disputed those reports.

Lopez feels that such behavior — encouraged “directly or indirectly” by local leadership — made Trump’s decision to send in federal troops “a fore-drawn conclusion.”

“If we’re not going to allow law enforcement to protect [ICE] and keep the peace with our residents, then the president of the United States most definitely is going to take that action,” he said. “We cannot have our our citizenry thinking that they can take up arms against the federal government and suffer no consequences.”

And none of the current chaos had to happen if leaders simply followed a “common sense” approach to apprehending Chicago’s worst criminal element by just coordinating with the federal government to “surgically” remove them months ago, Lopez said.

“Instead, what we got were politicians — from the governor to the mayor on down — challenging the Trump administration to go into our communities and find those targets themselves,” he said. “They almost joked about it, as if they as if that would never have been a possibility or a reality. And yet here we are today.”

“We are making the case as to why we need the National Guard now more than ever, with people choosing to try to attack federal law enforcement agents here in the city of Chicago,” Lopez added.

Tensions have continued to boil as National Guard troops began arriving in the Chicago area Tuesday — with Trump raging on Truth Social that Pritzker and Johnson both should be “in jail,” while the governor and mayor returned fire by calling the president a “wannabe dictator.”

Alderman Lopez maintains that both sides are so busy playing politics they’ve forgotten about the Chicagoans they claim to be protecting — and that the longer they squabble, the greater the stakes become.

“We have nearly three and a half years left with Donald Trump. We better figure it out because we cannot exist in this fashion,” he said, adding that federal agents are “going to do what they’re trained to do, which is to de-escalate by any means necessary in order to protect life and property.”

“This is what you get when you are acting in this manner with people who are trained in a very different level,” he added.

“I don’t think they’re prepared for what’s going to happen next.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/democratic-alderman-raymond-lopez-chicago-113016739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-10-09 18:57:17.094017

“The dominant federal interest here is that, for 150 years, the Supreme Court has made clear that there is an exclusive federal authority over entry into the United States,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Cody Wolsy told the three-judge panel. “This is a scheme that has been addressed in a bunch of different ways, all the different values and policies and interests that the federal government might have in a particular case of a person entering without inspection. And it gives the federal government a lot of different tools. Some of them are much more punitive, like the criminal provisions that are duplicated here.”

In February, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 4-C, which created two new criminal statutes for immigrants who enter the state after “eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers” at the U.S. border. Republican Governor Ron DeSantis immediately signed the legislation.

Immigration advocates, including the Florida Immigrant Coalition and Farmworker Association of Florida, responded with a federal lawsuit in April claiming SB 4-C unconstitutionally encroaches on the duties of federal officials to implement immigration law. The lawsuit names Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and state attorneys across Florida.

Within days, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida issued a restraining order barring any enforcement of the law and directing Uthmeier to inform local law enforcement of her decree. After news of continuing arrests, the judge extended the restraining order.

Uthmeier previously asked the 11th Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the injunction so arrests could continue while the litigation proceeded, but both courts declined.

During Thursday’s hearing, Wolsy of the ACLU reiterated that the federal government’s control over immigration preempts laws like SB 4-C.

“Congress in this very unique federal realm has given the president a bunch of tools and then left them at the president’s discretion,” he said. “The state can’t come in and say, ‘Well, we’re now going to take that discretion for ourselves and make the decisions for ourselves.’”

Wolsy said the law picks “winners and losers among immigrants and immigrant communities,” pointing to statutes allowing Cuban refugees, asylum seekers and victims of human trafficking to stay in the country, at least temporarily, after entering illegally.

Wolsy also argued that SB 4-C in some cases is more punitive than federal law, including withholding bail and more lengthy mandatory sentences.

“It’s another example of the state here making its own immigration policy,” he said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa pushed back slightly about preemption between federal and state policies by bringing up marijuana.

“So let me ask you a question about, let’s say marijuana, because that’s sort of a drug choice where the states are allowing legalization of marijuana and the federal government still has that as an illegal substance, but it’s choosing not to, in most cases now, prosecute for marijuana possession,” said Lagoa, a Donald Trump appointee. “I mean, it sort of goes to the issue of the federal government is choosing not to prosecute for illegal entry, but the state of Florida decides, well, we’re going to prosecute for illegal entry of someone who’s illegally in the country, but also in Florida.”

Wolsy said the two can’t be compared.

“I think that this statutory scheme is very different from just saying possession of marijuana,” Wolsy said. “Here we’re saying there is a complex problem at the border that we’re dealing with, which is there are people who are coming in between ports. We both want to deter that, but we also want to acknowledge foreign policy considerations, humanitarian considerations, connections with U.S. citizens. How do we figure that out? We have one sovereign make the decision about which tools are going to be deployed, and that’s the federal government.”

Jeffrey DeSousa, the attorney representing Uthmeier and state prosecutors, argued SB 4-C is not preempted by federal law.

“It’s very particular,” he told the judges. “It says that if the federal government has granted lawful presence or discretionary relief, either temporarily or permanently, that is enough to absolve a person of liability under our statute.”

Lagoa interrupted.

“So you could be picked up,"" Lagoa said. “And then the way I read the statute, I think it’s a mandatory hold. So it’s sort of like a stand your ground immunity argument. You have to then move to dismiss the information and assert a defense.”

“I think that could happen,” DeSousa explained. “That would be one route. I mean, again, we’re in the pre-enforcement posture.”

Lagoa expressed skepticism. “It seems like a strange way to handle it,” she said. “It causes me some concern.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Adalberto Jordan took issue with how SB 4-C would be prosecuted.

“Under the Florida law, my understanding is that entry is a continuous offense and you can be prosecuted anywhere you’re found,” Jordan, a Barack Obama appointee, said. “It doesn’t say, neither provision says where you can be prosecuted, right?

“That’s correct,” DeSousa responded. “I want to emphasize that because this is a pre-enforcement challenge, we don’t yet have a great sense of how Florida state courts are going to interpret the term ‘entry’ here.”

DeSousa also took issue with the overly broad nature of the injunction that requires the attorney general to monitor arrests made by state law enforcement agencies to ensure they are complying with the restraining order. DeSousa said those agencies are not part of the litigation and thus “we have monitoring and oversight obligations that we should not have.”

“So that’s a diversion of our resources as an agency, where our lawyers spend time having to consult with those non-party law enforcement officers to ensure their compliance,” DeSousa said. “The situation only exists because of the overbroad nature of the injunction. We otherwise would not be engaged in that practice, because we don’t actually exercise any control under Florida law over law enforcement.”

Lagoa agreed.

“I’m speaking for myself only, I think the district court erred,” she said. “I don’t think that you have the ability to order someone who is not a party to you, where the person you’re ordering someone who does not have control over that individual to have them do something. I mean, I don’t have to affirm legal error.”

Wolsy of the ACLU said the injunction only required the attorney general to give notice of the lower court’s order.

“He didn’t have to agree with it,” Wolsy said. “He didn’t have to command them to do anything.”

Uthmeier initially complied with the order, notifying state agencies of the judge’s order. But five days later, he sent a letter to police agencies across the state, telling them “there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” according to court documents.

The lower court then held the attorney general in contempt for defying the order.

U.S. Circuit Judge Charles Wilson jumped on that point.

“It’s not a situation where the attorney general just didn’t do what he was ordered to do, which was provide notice of the ruling,” Wilson, a Bill Clinton appointee, said. “He went beyond not complying and suggested, and I’m using the word kindly, suggested to law enforcement officers that there was no valid order and they could go about their business enforcing these statutes.”

“The defendant seeks a new trial based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.
The defendant’s first argument regarding immigration consequences fails, as this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass.
… “The defendant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective by not discussing an appeal with him and by not filing a notice of appeal after the defendant’s convictions.
… “If counsel never discussed the possibility of an appeal with his client, that may constitute ineffective assistance.","Where (1) a defendant was convicted of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony and (2) his subsequent motion for a new trial was denied, the defendant’s argument that trial counsel did not advise him of the immigration consequences of a conviction is foreclosed by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass. 115, 128-130 (2013), but a remand is necessary for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant received ineffective assistance regarding his right to appeal.

“The defendant seeks a new trial based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. In 1999, the defendant, an undocumented immigrant, was charged with assault 2 and battery, breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, and malicious destruction of property over $250. Of these offenses, the latter two are considered ‘crimes of moral turpitude’ under the immigration laws. Following a bench trial in District Court in 2000, the defendant was convicted of the breaking and entering charge, and the lesser included offense of malicious destruction of property under $250.

“Many years later, the defendant learned that his conviction of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony foreclosed a path to permanent residency. This path had otherwise become available when the defendant’s mother became a naturalized citizen, which occurred after his trial. In 2021 the defendant moved for a new trial, arguing (1) that trial counsel did not advise the defendant of the immigration consequences of a conviction, and in particular, that a conviction after trial could foreclose a specific path to permanent residency; and (2) that trial counsel did not advise the defendant of his right to appeal or file a notice of appeal.

“A District Court judge denied the motion for a new trial, as well as a motion for reconsideration. The defendant presses his arguments again on appeal. The defendant’s first argument regarding immigration consequences fails, as this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Marinho, 464 Mass. 115, 128-130 (2013), in which the Supreme Judicial Court ruled, under similar circumstances, that the defendant in that case had not shown prejudice because he had not demonstrated a reasonable probability that he could have achieved the plea bargain he posited in his motion for a new trial. As to the failure to file a notice of appeal, we must remand the matter as to this issue to the District Court, which under the circumstances needed to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant received ineffective assistance regarding the appeal and if so, whether the defendant otherwise would have timely appealed from his convictions. …

“The sole difference between this case and Marinho is that here the defendant has identified one immigration consequence that a favorable plea allegedly could have avoided — namely, that conviction of a crime of moral turpitude rendered the defendant ineligible for a form of discretionary relief from inadmissibility known as an unlawful presence waiver, available to the children of United States citizens. …

“However, even if we assume that counsel’s failure to advise of this potential consequence and to structure a possible plea bargain could constitute ineffective assistance under the circumstances, the defendant has not shown prejudice here. …

“The defendant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective by not discussing an appeal with him and by not filing a notice of appeal after the defendant’s convictions. As to this issue, we are constrained to remand this matter for an evidentiary hearing. …

“If counsel never discussed the possibility of an appeal with his client, that may constitute ineffective assistance. …

“So much of the order denying the motion for a new trial and order denying the motion for reconsideration that were entered as to trial counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness regarding the defendant’s right to an appeal and counsel’s failing to file a notice of appeal are vacated. The orders are otherwise affirmed. The case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.”

Dissenting judge’s comments

Smyth, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. “I concur with the court that the case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing and further findings as to whether trial counsel ever discussed the possibility of appeal with the defendant. However, I dissent from the court’s conclusion that the judge properly denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial as it pertained to trial counsel’s failure to provide adequate immigration warnings to the defendant.

“Instead, I conclude that the defendant demonstrated that his trial counsel’s performance was deficient under the protections of both the United States Constitution and Massachusetts Declaration of Rights because trial counsel failed to advise the defendant that a conviction on two of the charged offenses would adversely impact the defendant’s ability to lawfully remain in the United States. As such, the defendant satisfied the first, or performance, prong of Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).

“Concerning Saferian‘s prejudice prong, trial counsel’s failure to correctly warn the defendant of the clear immigration consequences of a conviction caused the defendant to forgo seeking an immigration-safe plea. The defendant instead proceeded to trial unaware of the immigration consequences that a conviction would have on him and his family. The defendant’s submissions established the existence of a substantial issue as to prejudice, requiring an evidentiary hearing. Specifically, the defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which he would bear the burden to prove a reasonable probability that he would have successfully negotiated a plea bargain had he known of the adverse immigration consequences, and further, that the result of the plea would have been more favorable to him, as to adverse immigration consequences, than the outcome of his trial. … Thus, I would remand for that additional purpose.”

At the same time, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 10 times more bills than last year targeting local immigration policies, the report found.
Cities and towns that are found in violation of state law could have state funding withheld should they not address it.
In the meantime, opponents of state preemption have had to get strategic about how to push back.","This week, President Donald Trump escalated his plans to send National Guard troops into blue cities — fighting in court to deploy them to Portland and sending others to Chicago ostensibly to fight crime and support federal immigration agents. He has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if courts rule against him. While images of soldiers on city streets offer a visible show of federal power, a quieter takeover is simultaneously emerging: state preemption.

On March 17, the Fort Myers City Council declined to approve an agreement that would have entered the Florida city’s police department into a partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Those who voted ‘no’ could not have foreseen what came next.

The following morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis rebuked the council members who opposed the agreement, posting on X: “The days of inaction are over. Govern yourselves accordingly.” Hours later, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier sent a letter to the council threatening to remove the lawmakers from office, which he shared on X, adding: “Fix this problem or face the consequences.”

This was no empty threat. In February, the Florida legislature passed a pair of immigration bills, SB 2-C and SB 4-C, that targeted “sanctuary” policies in the state. The new laws not only required municipalities to cooperate with ICE, but also gave the governor the authority to remove local officials that got in the way.

Three days after the removal threats, the council held an emergency meeting and voted unanimously in favor of the immigration agreement.

What happened in Fort Myers could happen anywhere in the U.S., experts warn. Florida’s bill represents one of hundreds of GOP-sponsored preemption bills that threaten the ability of cities and towns to govern independently. So far this year, lawmakers in 48 states have pushed more than 800 bills seeking to wrestle control from local jurisdictions — nearly double the number from the previous year — according to a recent report from the Local Solutions Support Center (LSSC), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on local democracy. This uptick reflects a troubling trend, experts say, with the Trump administration signaling to states to consolidate power to help advance its agenda.

“Trump needs the states because they have the authority to implement many of his actions, particularly around immigration,” said Katie Belanger, the lead consultant at LSSC.

Since returning to office in January, President Donald Trump has made immigration raids in cities and towns across the country a defining priority of his administration. At the same time, state lawmakers have introduced nearly 10 times more bills than last year targeting local immigration policies, the report found. But preemption efforts in conservative states have not been limited to any single issue. Rather, state lawmakers this year have targeted an array of local laws concerning civil liberties and protections, including LGBTQ rights, housing, elections, workers’ rights, and education.

Take Oklahoma. In May, lawmakers passed a bill — HB 1217 — in an attempt to ban drag shows. The law carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. While on the books, the state’s governor and attorney general are at odds on how to enforce the statute.

In Missouri, HB 595 effectively legalized a form of housing discrimination against low-income families. The new law overrides local regulations that prevent landlords from rejecting rental applications from people who receive federal housing subsidies.

Five states — Arkansas, Kansas, North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming — passed bans on ranked-choice voting. Two states — Utah and Florida — prohibited local governments from adding fluoride to drinking water. Montana barred vaccine mandates for shots under emergency authorization.

“Some of the stuff that was shocking even five years ago is now so commonplace that we’re numb,” said Lori Riverstone, a prominent researcher of state preemption at Illinois State University.

Riverstone, who in 2017 published an article documenting conservatives’ increased use of preemption as a tool for blocking progressive policies in their states, worries that what researchers initially saw as a short-term strategy has now become the norm.

“It’s just blown up,” Riverstone said, adding, “We’re being boiled by degrees.”

Since January, hundreds of preemption bills have been introduced across the country, though only a fraction — about 11 percent — have been signed into law, according to the LSSC report. Many others that became law have faced legal challenges, such as a Tennessee law that created criminal penalties for local officials who adopt sanctuary immigration policies, and a Louisiana law that required public schools to post the Ten Commandments inside of classrooms. Similarly, a controversial section of Florida’s new immigration law, which makes it a felony for some undocumented immigrants to enter the state, is under a court injunction.

But while many bills fail to become law, and others get tied up in legal battles, experts say that may not be the point. Leslie Zellers, a public policy attorney who co-leads LSSC’s legal team, described the Republicans’ strategy as “laying the groundwork and really kind of shifting the argument to incorporate ideas like this, which were not mainstream a year ago.” Another goal, she says, is to appease President Trump.

“Some of those are definitely Republican lawmakers, maybe in a blue state or a purple state, and they are introducing the bill to show that they support the Trump agenda,” said Zellers.

Lawmakers in Florida did not shy away from their support for the president when they named an early version of their immigration bill the “TRUMP Act.” Legislative leaders in Florida reportedly consulted with the Trump administration while working on the bill. Governor DeSantis, promoting a version of the bill on X, called the legislation “necessary to ensure that Florida leads on fulfilling the Trump Administration’s mandate to enforce immigration law and deport illegal aliens.”

As the GOP’s willingness to use preemption as a political tool grows, so does the scope of the bills aiming to centralize power. Increasingly, conservatives have explored blanket preemption policies, known as “Death Star” bills, which give states the authority to impose their will on local governments with progressive policies. In 2023, Texas lawmakers passed a bill that effectively nullified local laws that conflict with state laws in a number of areas, including agriculture, finance, labor, and natural resources. The Texas “Death Star” bill survived a court challenge in July.

This year, Tennessee enacted a “Death Star” preemption, giving state lawmakers the ability to challenge local laws they object to by requesting an investigation by the state attorney general. Cities and towns that are found in violation of state law could have state funding withheld should they not address it.

“[State legislators] are largely using preemption to punish cities for doing things that they don’t like,” said Luke Fowler, a professor of public policy and administration in the School of Public Service at Boise State University.

When the Fort Myers City Council reconvened for its emergency meeting on March 21, city officials heard from anxious residents during a public input session. Kathy James, a Fort Myers resident and veteran, told lawmakers that she felt like her vote was meaningless after Governor DeSantis threatened to remove council members from office.

“I haven’t seen anything like this since what was reported in Germany in the 1930s,” James said. “People need to wake up.”

Examples like Fort Myers have experts worried that Republicans are trying to send a message to other officials who may disagree with their agenda.

“It is a very chilling effort to really silence duly elected local leaders who are doing what their constituents voted them into office to do,” said Belanger.

In the meantime, opponents of state preemption have had to get strategic about how to push back. Lawsuits in Texas, Tennessee, and Florida have had mixed success. Local officials and activists have successfully blocked or mitigated preemption efforts through organizing efforts in recent years, according to a January report that Zellers co-authored. The wins, however, come at a cost.

“It’s a huge time-suck for advocates to try to counter these negative bills and put in the effort to try to get them stopped,” said Zellers.

Another approach, Fowler says, may be laying low.

“[Democrats] are figuring out how to operate in an environment where they don’t have to call attention to the things they’re doing,” Fowler said. “If they do the exact same things, and they just do it quietly behind closed doors, don’t really invite attention, they can normally get away with it,” adding that, “in bureaucracy, where there’s a will, there’s a way.”

For many Latino members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is an ambivalent sense of the Church’s stance on immigrants.
Shutting the center down added another chilling effect for church members.
“I don’t think the Mormon Church should be responsible for us.
“BYU is a part of the Church and is a university that stands to help promote the Church’s ecclesiastical mission.","On a recent Sunday morning in Provo, Utah, a small congregation of about two dozen people gathered in a church hall for ward services. At the front of the room stood the bishop, who blessed the bread and water in Spanish before passing the trays around for the congregation. The melodic sounds of the piano reverberated across the room as members sang “Welcome Home” — a new hymn for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Ward services like this have brought a consistent comfort and sense of community for Izzy, who came to Provo to study at Brigham Young University a few years ago. But lately, the increased possibility of ICE raids across the country has made him nervous.

“I just couldn’t focus. Just instant anxiety and fear. I worried about my family, and how I was gonna get through this year or the next four or three,” Izzy said. The prospect of an ICE recruitment fair nearby also disturbed him.

When he was just a toddler, Izzy and his parents came from Venezuela to the United States in search of a better life. Then one Christmas, Mormon missionaries brought gifts to their home in West Valley. He and his family were sealed in Utah. He was accepted into the DACA program, Deferred Action for Child Arrivals, years ago.

For many Latino members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is an ambivalent sense of the Church’s stance on immigrants. There is growing discontent about the Church’s silence regarding the ongoing ICE raids, compared to Catholic leaders like Pope Leo XIV, while others have focused on providing individual help to those in need.

The church has previously issued statements regarding immigration in 2011 and 2018 about the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border. But its most recent statement published in January listed three points in order. While it reads similarly to past statements on loving thy neighbor and concern about keeping families together, the first point this time notably focused on “obeying the law.”

When The Times reached out to ask about why the new statement was numbered and in this order, the Church declined to comment.

Dr. David-James Gonzales, a ward leader and history professor at BYU who studies Latino civil rights and migration, notes that the political climate has shifted on immigration in 2025.

“This issue is one of the most polarizing issues nationally and it has split the Church,” he said, adding that it’s fair to question the way the statement is written. “If I’m analyzing it as a historian, it’s speaking to this moment that the Church needs to make clear to this administration that it’s not a sanctuary church.”

The Church does not release publicly any demographic data, but according to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 86% of the Church’s membership is white. Latinos are some of the fastest growing members worldwide, thanks to missionary work in countries like Mexico, Brazil and Peru.

Yet despite the growth in Spanish-speaking wards and a more diverse Mormon community, many interviewed for this story still feel they face challenges of racism and belonging.

This January, Brigham Young University shut down its “Dreamers” resource hub for undocumented students, after facing backlash from state leaders who complained that their tithings — or 10% obligated donations to the Church — were being used for illegal immigrants. Nori Gomez, the founding member of the Dreamer resource center, said the program’s offices started receiving threatening phone calls. The university eventually removed the resource page.

“It was the highlight of my BYU experience,” she said. “But with how much universities are being attacked right now, I don’t agree with it, but I see why.”

Students like Izzy had found a sense of community among other DACA recipients through these online resources. Shutting the center down added another chilling effect for church members.

For former LDS leaders like Dr. Ignacio Garcia, a retired Latino studies professor and former bishop at a local Spanish-speaking ward, the Church’s silence has been disappointing.

“The Church’s struggle has a lot to do with some of its members, some of its very conservative white members,” Garcia said. “[These congregants] will love you as an individual member in your ward, but then go out and condemn all immigrants.”

In July, following hours of public comment from more than 100 community members opposing ICE’s presence in Utah, the Utah County Commission voted unanimously to enter a cooperative agreement with ICE to share data and work on a joint task force with local police. The county sheriff argued that a collaboration would allow more leeway for local officials to inject “Utah County values” into enforcement and public safety rather than allowing complete federal oversight.

Evelyn R. has worked as a trainer in Provo for young Mormons who are about to embark on their 18 to 24-month missions domestically and abroad. As a DACA recipient herself who previously served a Spanish-speaking mission in Georgia, she has overheard mixed feelings from attendees at the center about how undocumented people can even be baptized.

“[One girl said] you’re not really going to get anywhere with these people because they can’t get baptized. Because in order to be a member of the Church, you need to be abiding by the laws of the land, which is Article 12 of the faith,” Evelyn said.

Article 12 refers to a revelation written by Joseph Smith, stating, “we believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.” The article has guided members to be good citizens in their communities.

Evelyn said she had to ask her mission president if this was true. He reassured her that being undocumented did not gatekeep someone from belonging. It’s a stance that the First Presidency, the Church’s highest officials, also affirmed, saying that being undocumented should not itself prevent “an otherwise worthy Church member” from entering the temple or being ordained to priesthood, and calling upon congregation members to avoid being judgmental. As a convert to the Church and someone who comes from a diverse background, she said mixed responses like this were really hard to hear.

“God doesn’t care about our status or who we are, where we came from in order to be a member of the Church,” she said. Some days, she feels that she can identify as a member of the Church, but not necessarily as part of larger “Mormon culture” — one that might be predominantly white and more conservative on politics in Utah.

“We’re teaching principles and the doctrine of Christ,” she said. “I don’t think we’re necessarily learning how to apply those things.”

Luna Alvarez-Sproul, 25, works as a school teacher in Draper, Utah, where she often translates documents into Spanish for parents. She spent 18 months serving a Spanish-speaking mission in Salmon, Idaho, where many ranch hands were seasonal employees from Latin America.

“As a missionary, we didn’t have to receive special permission from somebody in order to baptize an undocumented individual,” she recalled. “But there [are] so many members of our church that don’t believe that they should be here with their families, which I feel is contradictory in and of itself.”

When guidance can vary so much, some church leaders have taken a more locally-focused ward approach — such as delivering food aid to members, helping out with rent or even sharing personal contacts with immigration lawyers. But addressing topics like the ICE raids during a service is likely taboo.

“Leaders are trained and asked to be very careful about how they address it. And I think that puts them in a really hard situation, especially when they have members of their congregation that are affected by this,” Izzy said.

The frustration may also have to do with reconciling religious principles with the views that are held by many people in the Church.

Other members disagree about an institution-wide response. Julia, who asked to use a pseudonym due to her undocumented status, has seen firsthand the ways that individual actions have been kind to her.

“I don’t think the Mormon Church should be responsible for us. The gospel teaches us to be independent,” she said.

Utah also has infrastructure for many undocumented people to succeed in their daily life, she noted; it was the first state in 2005 to implement the “driver’s privilege card,” a driver’s license specifically for those who were undocumented, allowing them to commute to work and obtain insurance.

Just a few miles away in Orem, conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was shot at Utah Valley University during a debate less than a week before I conducted these interviews. Hundreds of students and local community members attended vigils, laying bouquets of fresh flowers and American flags alongside crosses and the Book of Mormon on university lawns. “If you want unity, say his name UV,” one poster said. Others were adorned with Bible verses as the air echoed with different Mormon hymns.

The LDS Church released a statement condemning the violence and lawless behavior.

Isa Benjamin Garcia spent some time reflecting on the week’s tragic events after the Sunday ward service. As a daughter of a Mexican immigrant, she became more worried when President Trump rescinded a Biden-era policy that excluded churches and schools from immigration raids.

“There’s a lot of rhetoric around violence, but it’s not acknowledged all the other violence that has been and is,” she said, referring to ICE raids, including an incident where a day laborer died after running away from ICE in California.

Other members echoed this sentiment. “Something I’ve been wrestling with over the last few months is why the Church doesn’t say, ‘This is wrong.’ Like this isn’t what Christ would have us do,” said Benjamin Garcia.

In August, BYU’s Office of Belonging launched an immigration-focused eight-week course to help people gain a “basic understanding of complex immigration policies.” The goal is to equip more nonprofit workers to become partially accredited to represent clients in front of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Gonzales, the ward leader and professor at BYU, believes this step speaks volumes about the Church’s efforts, despite challenges earlier this year with the takedown of its Dreamer center.

“My heart was warmed seeing that,” he said. “BYU is a part of the Church and is a university that stands to help promote the Church’s ecclesiastical mission. I think that’s a form of messaging through one of its institutions.”

Ultimately, when facing these hurdles and different interpretations of what the Book of Mormon or the Church says, members focus on their relationship to the gospel.

“We also believe that we are the Church, and we believe that it is our responsibility to make it better. And that is what God is asking of us, and that’s what Christ is asking of us,” Benjamin Garcia said. She then paused.

“Despite feelings of frustration or questions, what keeps a lot of us here, despite any of that, is that we have a conviction.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1e23ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+392/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F28%2Fb8%2Fadcf55ed4d6290a180ca634208ff%2Fmormonlatinos-1.png,N,,2025-10-09 16:57:02.939659

This is the third in our ongoing series, “Your Questions Answered,” where we bring your questions directly to ACLU experts.
A reminder of what we can do, and who we can be, when we defend our communities against abuses of power.","In his first 10 months back in office, President Donald Trump has abused his power to attack our neighbors and communities, suppress free speech, and create a climate of fear. The president has deployed military troops and federal agents into our cities. He has threatened nonprofit organizations, universities, and political opponents who don’t conform to his dangerous agenda. He has targeted journalists, entertainers, and talk show hosts to quell criticism. These actions are designed to intimidate and silence opposition so he can expand his power by any means necessary.

With such a constant deluge of attacks on our rights —and on our communities—it can feel difficult to stay hopeful and engaged. But our history shows that when people organize, protest, and demand justice, we can disrupt abuses of power, and build collective power in response.

​​So how exactly do we show up at this moment to defend our freedoms? Below, you’ll find answers to five of the most pressing questions we’ve received about how to push back against the Trump administration’s abuses of power. This is the third in our ongoing series, “Your Questions Answered,” where we bring your questions directly to ACLU experts.

With all these attacks on our fundamental rights, where do we even start? What actions can make a real difference?

It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and wonder where to even start, but I’ve seen firsthand how powerful it is when millions take action together. The first “No Kings” mobilization proved that. From my vantage point on the core organizing team, I watched in awe as millions filled the streets in one of the largest demonstrations in modern memory. More than 2,000 events—from major cities to small towns where half the community turned out—sent one clear message: we, the people, reject abuses of power and will defend our communities. Being part of the team that helped support that day was one of the proudest moments of my life. But the real power came from everyone who marched, proudly asserted their free speech rights even in the face of intimidation, and showed that our communities are strongest when we stand together.

That’s why I’m so excited for the next “No Kings” rally on October 18. “No Kings” isn’t just another protest— it’s a bold and joyful assertion of our rights. A reminder of what we can do, and who we can be, when we defend our communities against abuses of power.

Whether you rally with your community, contact members of Congress, or display a sign in your front yard championing the principles of a free America, every action—big or small—contributes to the movement.

Does contacting members of Congress actually work? How do we get them to pay attention to the issues we care about?

Contacting members of Congress works. I’ve seen it firsthand. I used to work in Congressional offices and was once the one helping organize in-district town halls, answering calls, and reading emails from constituents. In the offices I worked in, every message was logged and, when enough people reached out about an issue, it was noticed and noticed fast. In fact, it’s not uncommon for a point made in a constituent’s email or call to be used as part of a member’s argument for or against a policy. Many times I have seen personal stories shared by constituents end up in floor speech, mentioned in press conferences, or even featured in newsletters.

Lawmakers rely on constituent stories and perspectives, which shape the narrative and help ground policy in real impacts. There are so many ways you can reach out to your members:

Sending an email or using a digital action tool like aclu.org/action

Calling offices through the Capitol switchboard at (202) 224-3121 to be connected to your representatives/senators

Attending town halls or events

Requesting meetings with staff

Your outreach matters and is so important—not just to inform and persuade, but also to hold elected officials accountable for the choices they make and votes they take.

—Elvia Montoya, senior advisor, Policy & Government Affairs

Beyond Congress, who should we be pressuring? Are local actions impactful? And if so, what are some ways I can get more involved in my local community?

Time and time again, it is the leadership of local and state leaders who uphold our civil rights and liberties. That’s why we have the mandate to meet this moment by standing with them and by partnering with them to pass responsive policies that protect all of our communities. It’s also why I’m so proud to be here at the ACLU, one of the few organizations designed to meet this moment, because of the incredible work of our 54 affiliates across the country. The Firewall for Freedom campaign has already led to dozens of actions being taken across this country. That includes mayors, city councils, state attorneys general, governors and state legislators. Each of us should join our affiliates in calling on officials to pass these Firewall measures to advance and protect our rights, especially in cases of federal overreach.

—Nahal Zamani, director of State Campaigns

It’s alarming to see the government censoring journalists, silencing talk show hosts, and deporting activists. How do we defend free speech when it’s under attack at every level?

The government’s actions are designed to instill fear in all of us because they know that the power of the people is stronger than the people in power. So, they want to silence us. But as we have seen again and again when we raise our voices, we create change. We have seen communities come together to speak up against the separation of families and the tearing apart of community members resulting in the release of mothers, children and students from immigration detention. We have seen how Jimmy Kimmel’s show returned to the air just hours after over 475 artists and 40,000 ACLU supporters signed a letter condemning the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel due to pressure from the administration.

I am proud to lead the ACLU’s Know Your Rights work to ensure that people know how the Constitution protects all of us regardless of immigration status. Just this year, we have empowered thousands of people with the information they need to protect themselves, their neighbors and their communities.

Sticking together works. Raising our voices works. Holding the government accountable works. This moment calls for all of us to do everything we can to protect each other, protect our democracy, and protect our rights.

—Maribel Hernández Rivera, national director of Immigrant Community Strategies

What gives the ACLU hope in this moment — hope that we can defend our neighbors, communities, and the future of democracy?

I remember hearing someone at the ACLU of Georgia say that “we’re not new to this— we’re true to this.” That really stuck with me: the fact that we’ve been here before. The ACLU has been in this fight for more than 100 years. That’s more than 100 years of resistance, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of justice. Our communities have faced attacks on civil liberties before, and we’ve never backed down. If we’ve made it this far, how can we give up now?

I draw strength from those who came before: the ancestors and organizers who dedicated their lives to move us forward. Their sacrifices remind me that this fight is not new, and it’s not any one person’s burden to bear alone. On our organizing team, we’re grounded in the truth that it takes all of us. Thousands of us are in this struggle, standing shoulder to shoulder and refusing to be silenced.

As the child of immigrants, I carry a profound belief in hope—the same hope that led my parents to this country, dreaming of a better life for their children. To give up now would betray that belief. So I won't. That’s what gives me hope: our history, our people, and the power of refusing to give up.

Looking ahead, CAC has also already filed several amicus briefs in cases the Supreme Court will be hearing in November.
CAC filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, urging the court to deny the pending motion to dismiss.
“Election Law Blog: “The Supreme Court Is Being Tested on History Once Again”” October 7: The New Civil Rights Movement quoted CAC in their article covering oral arguments in Chiles v. Salazar at the Supreme Court.
He also worked as an associate in the Supreme Court and appellate practice of Hogan Lovells.","This week, the Supreme Court’s new Term began, and the Court isn’t wasting any time before digging into incredibly important issues. CAC has filed in many of the big cases the Court will be hearing at the beginning of this Term.

On Monday, in Villarreal v. Texas, the Court considered whether a defendant’s right to counsel was violated when he was prohibited from discussing his own testimony with his attorney at a critical point in his trial. Our amicus brief explained why his Sixth Amendment rights were violated. As CAC Appellate Counsel Ana Builes explained after listening to oral argument in the case, “By prohibiting Mr. Villarreal from consulting with his counsel about important aspects of his case at a critical stage of his trial, the Texas trial court denied him his counsel’s assistance when he needed it the most and denied him the fair trial that the Sixth Amendment guarantees.”

And on Tuesday, in Chiles v. Salazar, the Court considered whether Colorado can prohibit licensed mental health professionals from practicing “conversion therapy” on young people, given the consensus in the medical community that this practice is deeply harmful. Our amicus brief explained that it does not violate the First Amendment for states to protect their residents from such dangerous practices. As CAC’s Vice President Praveen Fernandes wrote after oral argument, “The Court has long acknowledged states’ power to shield their residents from ineffectual or harmful practices by state-licensed professionals.”

Next week, the Court will hear Ellingburg v. United States. Though the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits Congress from retroactively making a punishment more severe, Holsey Ellingburg was told he must pay nearly double the amount of restitution he was assigned at his sentencing, solely due to changes in the law after his crime occurred. Our brief explains why the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to the restitution law Congress passed after Mr. Ellingburg’s crime.

And on October 15, the Court is hearing Louisiana v. Callais, a case with high stakes for the future of the Voting Rights Act. Our amicus brief explains that the Constitution gives Congress broad enforcement power to prevent impairment of the right to vote, including through the protections of the Voting Rights Act. As CAC’s David H. Gans explained in Slate magazine, drawing on his exciting new research on Black advocacy for voting rights in the aftermath of the Civil War, this ought to be an “open-and-shut” case if the Roberts court is faithful to constitutional text and history. Also on October 15, the Court is considering whether police may enter homes without warrants based on less than probable cause that an emergency is occurring. Our amicus brief details why allowing such entries would be at odds with the Fourth Amendment’s text and history.

Looking ahead, CAC has also already filed several amicus briefs in cases the Supreme Court will be hearing in November. When Damon Landor, a devout Rastafarian who wore his hair in dreadlocks in accordance with his religion, showed prison officials a printout of a court decision holding that the law protected his right to keep his dreadlocks in prison, the officials threw the decision into the trash, held him down, and shaved his head. When he sued the prison employees for violating his rights, the lower courts held that the law protecting the religious freedom of incarcerated people does not provide for damages against individual state officials. Our amicus brief explains that the law protected Landor’s ability to vindicate his rights.

On November 12, the Court will consider two cases about the scope of a sentencing judge’s discretion to grant compassionate release under the Sentencing Reform Act. In Rutherford v. United States and Carter v. United States, the Court is considering whether a judge can grant reductions in a petitioner’s sentence under the Sentencing Reform Act because of a significant difference between the sentence they are serving and the sentence that they would have received if they were sentenced for those same offenses today. Our amicus brief explains that judges should be allowed to consider major changes in the law that result in sentencing disparities solely based on when a person was sentenced. And in Fernandez v. United States, our amicus brief explains that a judge should be allowed to consider his “disquiet” about the validity of the jury’s verdict in granting compassionate release.

Needless to say, things have been very busy here at CAC. Even as we continue to support legal challenges to unlawful actions taken by the Trump administration, we’re also still fighting for our Constitution’s progressive promise at the Supreme Court.

San Francisco v. Trump— The District Court for the Northern District of California is considering whether the Trump administration can unilaterally withhold federal funds from jurisdictions that decline to implement his immigration agenda. CAC filed a brief in support of the plaintiffs, urging the court to deny the pending motion to dismiss. Our brief explains why the administration’s actions are a violation of separation-of-powers principles, and that Supreme Court precedent allows the constitutional claims at issue to be reviewed by the courts. Northern California District Court, brief filed October 7.

National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission — The Supreme Court is considering whether to strike down a law that limits the amount of money a national political party committee may spend in coordination with federal candidates for elected office. CAC filed an amicus brief asking the court to uphold the law’s coordinated party expenditure limits, explaining that the law is narrowly tailored to target corruption concerns dating back to the Founders, and that Supreme Court precedent permits contributions limits such as those considered here. Supreme Court, brief filed October 6.

National Treasury Employees Union v. Vought — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether to rehear en banc the case regarding the Trump administration’s efforts to unilaterally shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Our amicus brief explains why the administration’s actions violate the Constitution’s separation of powers, and why the constitutional claim at issue is judicially reviewable under Supreme Court precedent. C. Circuit, brief filed September 30.

PFLAG v. Trump — The Fourth Circuit is considering whether President Trump can legally cut off federal funding for institutions that provide gender-affirming medical care for people under the age of nineteen. CAC filed a brief explaining why constitutional history, centuries of executive practice and court precedent, and separation-of-powers principles prohibit the President from usurping Congress’s power of the purse in an attempt to achieve his own policy initiatives. Fourth Circuit, brief filed September 26.

RAICES v. Noem — The D.C. Circuit is considering whether the Trump administration’s efforts to prohibit certain people in the country from seeking asylum is lawful. CAC filed an amicus brief explaining that the law does not allow the government to “repatriate” asylum-seekers that are already within the country, and that the administration’s actions would upend the asylum system Congress established. C. Circuit, brief filed September 19.

Novartis v. Secretary United States Department of Health and Human Services — WIN — The Third Circuit upheld the constitutionality of the Medicare prescription drug price negotiation program at issue in this case, rejecting Novartis’s constitutional arguments, including its Takings Clause argument. Echoing our brief and citing the court’s earlier ruling in Bristol Myers Squibb v. Becerra, the court emphasized the voluntary nature of the government’s program and concluded that there is no physical taking. Third Circuit, decision rendered September 11.

Parada v. United States — The Supreme Court is being asked to consider whether the Sixth Amendment requires a 12-person jury for a felony conviction. After being convicted by a jury of only eleven people, the petitioners are asking the Court to hear their case and reconsider precedent that allows such a conviction. CAC filed a brief in support of the petitioners, explaining that at the Founding and throughout common law, juries were understood to consist of twelve people. We argue that the prior case that allowed such small juries improperly dismissed the history of the Sixth Amendment. Supreme Court, brief filed September 11.

Properties of the Villages, Inc. v. Federal Trade Commission — After the change in presidential administrations, the FTC moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal, acceding to the vacatur of the noncompete rule at issue in the case. Eleventh Circuit, case dismissed September 10.

C. v. Metropolitan School District of Martinsville — The Seventh Circuit is considering whether the Supreme Court’s recent decision in United States v. Skrmetti requires it to overrule previous decisions recognizing that schools that prohibit students from using bathrooms consistent with their gender identity are discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of Title IX. CAC filed a brief in support of a transgender boy whose school had such a policy, explaining that the Court’s decision in Skrmetti­—a case involving gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors—should have no effect on precedent regarding gender-aligned bathroom use. Seventh Circuit, brief filed September 10.

Newsom v. Trump — The Ninth Circuit is considering the legality of Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in response to mostly peaceful protests. CAC filed a brief explaining that, contrary to the Trump administration’s arguments, Supreme Court precedent does not prohibit courts from reviewing presidential decisions to federalize the National Guard, and that founding-era history demonstrates that judges may appropriately evaluate whether the necessary factual conditions exist to justify such action. Ninth Circuit, brief filed September 9.

Ortega v. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency — WIN — The Fifth Circuit denied the petition for review and dismissed the Seventh Amendment claim against the OCC. Echoing our brief, the court detailed the history of the national banking system and explained that “such a serious and unbroken historical pedigree” proves that “the public-rights exception applies to federal banking enforcement actions, and that petitioners had no right to a jury trial in this matter.” Fifth Circuit, decision rendered September 8.

That's just one of the many legal battles playing out.

A small group of protestors gathered outside the ICE processing facility, with their chants energized following a federal judge's extension of a nationwide consent decree. The 52-page ruling outlines who ICE agents can and can not arrest.

Since ""Operation Midway Blitz,"" concerns have been raised about the random way federal agents have come into the Chicagoland area, detaining people. Hundreds of people have since been taken into custody without warrants or probable cause.

""We now have potentially 200 on our list of potential violations. The vast majority being in the last several weeks,"" Attorney Mark Fleming said.

The National Immigration Justice Center is one of many that filed suit. The agency said it's also going to court about the violations they said took place when federal agents raided a South Shore apartment building, detaining both immigrants and Chicago residents in the middle of the night.

Back in Broadview, police are enforcing protest times after an executive order was signed by the village's mayor this week. Police were seen giving a warning shortly after 6 p.m. to disperse, or people would face citations or be arrested.

While many rally against the deportations, the biggest fight will play out in the federal courthouse.

""It's a glimpse of hope that the courts will still, at times, bear witness and will attempt to limit the harms being conducted by DHS in our communities,"" Said Xanat Sobrevilla, Organized Communities Against Deportations.

On Thursday morning, the city of Chicago and Illinois' attorney general will head to court. It's their attempt to stop the more than 200 National Guard members brought in from Texas from hitting the streets. The guards are currently stationed about 55 miles southwest of Chicago in Elwood. City, county, and state leaders are hoping the legal move will deter any movement.

According to a previous lawsuit against ICE filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office, she was detained at the ICE Detention Center in Aurora for two weeks.
""The true illegality here is ICE's flagrant disregard of federal law,"" said Hans Meyer, immigration attorney for the plaintiffs and owner of the Meyer Law Office.
The suit goes on to say that ICE explicitly changed its policies to comply with those decades-old requirements in 2022.
It also says that former ICE director and current ""Border czar"" for the Trump Administration, Tom Homan, has ""repeatedly"" said ICE would rely on ""indiscriminate warrantless arrests.""","The ACLU of Colorado and several law firms are suing the Trump Administration, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a new federal lawsuit filed on Thursday. They allege ICE is arresting people across Colorado without warrants and without determining if the people they're arresting are citizens or not.

The groups, which also include the Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray, LLC, filed the suit on behalf of Refugio Ramirez Ovando, Caroline Dias Goncalves, two other plaintiffs who are only identified by their initials, and ""all those similarly situated.""

""People are terrified that masked agents will snatch their loved ones or neighbors from the street because an ICE agent believes they look different or speak with an accent. This is unacceptable,"" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, said in a statement. ""The courts must see ICE's actions for what they are: an unlawful abuse of power that must be stopped.""

The ICE Denver field office responded Thursday that it does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation. After publication of this story, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in an email to CBS News Colorado through a department spokesperson, ""DHS complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.""

The suit names Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE acting director Todd Lyons, and ICE Denver Field Office director Robert Guadian as defendants. It alleges ""militarized"" ICE agents, ""often with masks, body armor, and long guns,"" are ""indiscriminately stopping and arresting people with brown skin in their mission to meet the Administration's ramped-up enforcement demands.""

The organizations that filed the suit are asking a judge to make this a class-action lawsuit, determine whether these arrests violated federal law, and, if deemed illegal, order ICE to stop future warrantless arrests.

One of the plaintiffs, Dias Goncalves, is a 19-year-old nursing student living in Utah who was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff's deputy in May and then reported to ICE, which state officials and the ACLU say violated state law. According to a previous lawsuit against ICE filed by the Colorado Attorney General's Office, she was detained at the ICE Detention Center in Aurora for two weeks. She has lived in the U.S. since she was brought here from Brazil as a Dreamer at 7.

Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father who's lived in Colorado for 20 years, according to the lawsuit, which claims that ICE mistakenly arrested him in May without a warrant and while looking for someone else. Ovando says he was held at the Aurora ICE facility for three months, the suit alleges.

One plaintiff, identified by his initials, J.S.T., is a 36-year-old asylum seeker who was arrested without a warrant during a large operation across Denver and Aurora in February, according to the lawsuit. He was held at the detention center for four weeks.

And the other plaintiff, identified by the initials ""G.R.R.,"" alleges he was arrested without a warrant during a large federal operation in Colorado Springs in April. The lawsuit says the 32-year-old father and business owner was held at the detention center for over six weeks.

The four plaintiffs named in the suit serve as representatives of an unknown number of people arrested in Colorado, as well as those who may be arrested in the future. They include ""All persons since January 20, 2025, who have been arrested or will be arrested in this District by ICE without a warrant and without a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk,"" according to the suit.

""The true illegality here is ICE's flagrant disregard of federal law,"" said Hans Meyer, immigration attorney for the plaintiffs and owner of the Meyer Law Office. ""The courts must act to halt this widespread and egregious ICE practice of arresting people without warrants based on how they look, how they speak, or simply because of who they are with. This practice is a frontal assault on our communities to advance Trump's mass deportation agenda.""

The suit says ICE is violating certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which prohibits warrantless arrests unless agents have ""reason to believe"" that a person is both unlawfully in the U.S. and that the person ""is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained for his arrest."" The suit goes on to say that ICE explicitly changed its policies to comply with those decades-old requirements in 2022.

It also says that former ICE director and current ""Border czar"" for the Trump Administration, Tom Homan, has ""repeatedly"" said ICE would rely on ""indiscriminate warrantless arrests.""

Bloomberg first reported that DHS had sent reassignments to “hundreds” of personnel, including CISA staff.
One DHS employee, who spoke to Federal News Network on condition of anonymity, said a wave of management-directed reassignments began going out to some DHS staff in September, while another wave began last week.
They speculated DHS may not have funding immediately available to cover the moves for employees who accept the reassignments.
The reassignments come as the vast majority of DHS staff work through the government shutdown.","The Department of Homeland Security has been sending out “management directed reassignments” to dozens of employees, forcing staff in some cases to choose whether to move hundreds of miles to a new job or face termination.

DHS has sent the reassignments out to employees across the department, including at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to multiple people familiar with the directives. They were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.

Employees have been handed reassignments to different DHS components, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Federal Protective Service.

Bloomberg first reported that DHS had sent reassignments to “hundreds” of personnel, including CISA staff.

The latest shifts come after DHS transferred more than 100 employees to ICE in August, including 50 staff from FEMA’s human resources department, according to the Washington Post.

“DHS routinely aligns personnel to meet mission priorities while ensuring continuity across all core mission areas,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “Any notion that DHS is unprepared to handle threats to our nation because of these realignments is ludicrous, especially given the abject failure at the hands of CISA in the last administration.”

One reassignment notice viewed by Federal News Network gave an employee seven days to decide on a reassignment hundreds of miles from their current duty station. If accepted, the “goal” would be to complete the reassignment within 60 days, according to the letter.

Declining the reassignment, or accepting but failing to report for duty, would subject the employee to removal from federal service, the letter added.

One DHS employee, who spoke to Federal News Network on condition of anonymity, said a wave of management-directed reassignments began going out to some DHS staff in September, while another wave began last week.

So far, the DHS employee said most staff who have responded – either to accept the reassignment or reject the move – have yet to hear back.

They speculated DHS may not have funding immediately available to cover the moves for employees who accept the reassignments. Employees who accept management-directed reassignments can be reimbursed for relocation expenses. Last month, the Office of Personnel Management paused the relocation of some OPM staff after facing significant costs.

Federal News Network has reached out to DHS for comment.

The reassignments come as the vast majority of DHS staff work through the government shutdown.

“The health care fight is the right fight for us to be in,” said Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont.
Now Republicans are demanding Democratic votes to fund the government and blaming their colleagues for the mounting damage in the shutdown.
“They don’t want to give the president a victory on anything.” Democrats say their apprehension about the Trump administration is well-founded, given what they have witnessed and experienced so far.
But they say a spending agreement is possible despite their ominous view of the Trump administration.","Democrats in Congress have been relentless about casting the government shutdown clash as a fight over helping Americans pay for health insurance.

But there is another, far deeper issue driving the impasse: their outrage about what is happening across the country under a president they regard as lawless and unchecked.

While Democrats believe they have a winning political argument in demanding the extension of Obamacare subsidies, they are also motivated by Mr. Trump’s extreme policies and tactics, and his penchant for running roughshod over the legislative branch with scant pushback from congressional Republicans. That is one reason that the shutdown impasse has dragged on, with no immediate move toward resolution and little sign that Democrats’ resolve is flagging.

Democrats have watched with increasing alarm as the administration has ignored congressional spending directives, dispatched the military to American cities, ordered government retribution against Mr. Trump’s perceived adversaries and mounted an aggressive immigration roundup that has prompted fierce fights in the courts.

“The issue that we are debating,” Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday, “is not just health care, as enormously important as that is. What we are talking about is whether we are going to allow our country to move toward an authoritarian society, run by a president who is a megalomaniac, who wants more and more power in his hands, who does not respect the rule of law or the Constitution of the United States of America.’’

Democrats have good reasons to center the shutdown fight around the extension of pandemic-era Obamacare health insurance subsidies. They fear that millions of Americans could see their coverage costs soar or become unaffordable without quick action by Congress. It is a unifying subject and has strong political resonance. The impact of not intervening would be felt by both Democratic and Republican voters, providing an opening to reach across the aisle for a solution.

“The health care fight is the right fight for us to be in,” said Senator Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. “And one of the reasons I think the health care fight is the right fight is that the folks who are going to be hurt are folks who voted for Trump, and folks who didn’t.”

Democrats employ language in describing the Trump administration that would be considered extraordinary in the past, but is becoming almost commonplace now, illustrating the depth of their apprehension about the administration and their dark view of its capabilities.

Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and one of the lawmakers central to ending the spending impasse, described the Trump administration this week as “run by crooks and cowards.”

Others were equally disparaging.

“We have a government that has been hijacked at the highest levels by people who act like mob bosses,” Senator Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat who was elected just last year, said in a floor speech. “I’m from Jersey. We know a thing or two about mob bosses.”

Senator Richard J. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat and one of those who broke with the majority of his party last March by voting to fund the government, has this time seen Mr. Trump dispatch Texas National Guard troops to his home state over objections from Illinois leaders, a move unlikely to win Mr. Durbin’s support on spending.

“Instead of working to find a bipartisan way to reopen the government and lower the cost of health care, President Trump is solely focused on scoring points against his perceived enemies,” Mr. Durbin said.

A secondary goal of the Democrats in the standoff is to win guarantees against the administration overriding congressionally approved spending plans in the future, though Democrats have chosen not to emphasize that aspect. They see it as inside baseball and do not want to distract from their focus on health insurance, which has more relevance to the general public.

Democrats also worry about the willingness of their Republican congressional colleagues to enforce any agreement, even though they say their G.O.P. colleagues assure them privately that they intend to resist more attempts by the White House to counter spending approved by Congress.

But so far, congressional Republicans have stood by complacently as Mr. Trump has usurped congressional authority in numerous ways, including his widespread imposition of tariffs without congressional action, and his instigation of military actions, such as deadly attacks on boats that the administration said were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea. A Democratic attempt to block those strikes won just two Republican supporters Wednesday night as the measure failed in the Senate.

Senate Republicans have also found ways to sidestep Democrats this year by stretching the rules covering what legislation is subject to the filibuster, and changing the rules to overcome Democratic opposition to Trump nominees. Now Republicans are demanding Democratic votes to fund the government and blaming their colleagues for the mounting damage in the shutdown.

“They just can’t fathom having to deal with us,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “They haven’t needed our votes. And so this is the first time that they’re confronted with the idea that we are not irrelevant, and it is making them angry.”

Republicans attribute the Democratic refusal to reopen the government without concessions on health insurance to their desire to placate elements of the party that have insisted on blanket resistance to Mr. Trump at any cost.

“It is sort of this blind Trump derangement syndrome if you will,” Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, said on Fox News. “They don’t want to give the president a victory on anything.”

Democrats say their apprehension about the Trump administration is well-founded, given what they have witnessed and experienced so far. But they say a spending agreement is possible despite their ominous view of the Trump administration.

“We’ve got to have faith we can get through this,” said Mr. Welch. “We’ve got to maintain as much as we can.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/09/multimedia/09dc-assess-TOP-new-zhcq/09dc-assess-TOP-new-zhcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:58:22.134449

Trump Administration Fires Immigration Judges

The Trump Administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, with ICE agents and National Guard troops deployed to cities across the country. And federal efforts to crack down are not solely focused on detainment, but also removing the judges that oversee immigration cases. Last month the administration fired dozens of immigration judges across the country, including three in Sacramento. These removals have raised alarms, and some within the judicial community are warning of a potential “chilling effect” for years to come. CapRadio Statehouse Politics Reporter Gerardo Zavala breaks down some of the reactions to these firings, and what the impacts are on local immigrants that need their legal services.

Don Craven, who had led the IPA since 2021, added the organization to the lawsuit Sunday alongside other Illinois news outlets and advocacy groups. The IPA board disagreed with the decision and told him “to do whatever necessary to dismiss the IPA as a Plaintiff in that litigation,” which Craven did before submitting his resignation, according to an email Craven wrote to an organization of other press associations Wednesday.

Craven wrote that his decision as the IPA’s President, CEO and legal counsel was based on the lawsuit’s aim “to preserve and protect the First Amendment rights of journalists.” Attempts to reach Craven for additional comment were not immediately returned.

The plaintiffs, which include digital news site Block Club Chicago and the Chicago News Guild among others, specifically cite violent actions from ICE agents toward reporters covering protests at a facility in Broadview, Illinois.

“Journalists reported being singled out for detention, being shot by rubber bullets, and being exposed to gas pellets, all because they were doing their jobs,” Craven wrote in his email. “A minister, in clerical garb, was shot at and gassed, while praying in front of the facility.”

The IPA board did not respond to a request for comment. It released a statement to the association’s members Wednesday afternoon, which read that a six-person executive team will oversee operations as the board begins recruiting candidates.

The IPA aims to provide “legislative, business, advertising, educational and legal services” for the 375 daily and weekly newspapers in its membership, according to its website. It is one of the largest newspaper associations in the country.

The IPA is a part of the Newspaper Association Managers, a fraternal organization of press associations across the country which organizes discussions among members on relevant industry issues. Layne Bruce, the executive director of the Mississippi Press Association who serves as the volunteer clerk for NAM, said this news will “without a doubt” be on the agenda for NAM’s next meeting in December.

A mix of news organizations and independent protesters filed the lawsuit Monday, listing ICE officials, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump among the defendants.

Jonathan Manes, senior counsel for the MacArthur Justice Center and professor at Pritzker School of Law on press freedom and freedom of information, said this is an “incredibly important lawsuit.”

The apparent raid occurred at Outerspaces Landscapes at 500 E. Cross St. in the morning hours of Oct. 9.

Several workers appeared to have been arrested. Video posted on social media shows ICE officers, some wearing masks and some not, alongside FHP officers at the business. The streets in a one-block area around the business were blocked by FHP during the raid.

Detained workers were placed in a bus labeled ""Escambia County Corrections.""

The News Journal has requested information about the raid from the Department of Homeland Security, ICE, FHP, and Escambia County. So far, Escambia County is the only agency to respond to the News Journal's request.

Escambia County spokesperson Davis Wood told the News Journal that ICE requested transportation assistance from the county, but any further information about the operation would have to be released by ICE.

""Escambia County Corrections periodically provides resources by request for inter-agency operations where multiple arrests are possible, whether it’s a federal, state or local agency,"" Wood said.

Video posted to social media also showed an Escambia County ambulance near the site, but Wood said that ambulance was responding to an unrelated call for service.

Pensacola Police Department spokesperson Mike Wood told the News Journal that PPD was not involved in the raid, but one detective was on scene solely as an observer because it was occurring within the city limits.

Grace Resendez McCaffery, publisher of the Spanish-language newspaper La Costa Latina and founder of the Hispanic Resource Center of Northwest Florida and South Alabama, told the News Journal that several workers were likely arrested at the site, including workers who had legal authorization to work in the United States.

Resendez McCaffery said a woman called her from the bus where the detained workers had been placed. She said the woman was told by one ICE agent she wouldn't be arrested after showing her documentation, but another said to ""take her anyway.""

""They’re not even distinguishing between documented and undocumented,"" Resendez McCaffery said.

Resendez McCaffery said it's unclear how many workers were arrested as she's had several families reach out to her. One report she received said it could be as many as 30, though she is not confident in that number. She said those detained were told they were being transported to the Escambia County jail.

Through her work with the Hispanic Resource Center of Northwest Florida and South Alabama, Resendez McCaffery has monitored the stepped-up immigration under the Trump administration. She noted that, although there have been other raids in Northwest Florida and many in Baldwin County, Alabama, this was the first large-scale raid to occur in Pensacola.

U.S. District Judge April Perry was hearing arguments in a packed downtown Chicago courtroom from attorneys for the state of Illinois and the Justice Department.

Perry pressed Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton on whether National Guard troops would only be stationed around federal buildings or also in neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Hamilton responded that troops also could be used to “protect ICE agents” in the field.

Perry called the Trump administration's claims of a so-called rebellion ""audacious"" and questioned the information being used to deploy the guard.

""What if the DHS folks are not tethered to reality? Does that matter?"" she said, asking ""who are the rebels"" and ""are they well armed?""

Thursday's hearing before Perry was over a request to block the deployment of Illinois and Texas Guard members in Illinois.

Chicago and Illinois filed a lawsuit on Monday to stop the deployments, calling them unnecessary and illegal. In a court filing in the lawsuit, the city and state say protests at a temporary ICE detention facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement.”

Local

Christopher Wells, a lawyer with the Illinois attorney general’s office, began Thursday's hearing by urging Perry to stop the National Guard deployment that “threatens the careful balance of our Constitutional system.”

Hamilton characterized Chicago as beset by what he called “tragic lawlessness,” noting a recent confrontation in which two residents were accused of using their vehicles to ram into and box in a Border Patrol vehicle. One person was shot and wounded by a Border Patrol agent.

Some Guard members ordered to Illinois by President Donald Trump now are protecting federal property near Chicago.

New video showed uniformed troops appearing to arrive at the Immigration Customs and Enforcement processing facility in suburban Broadview early Thursday morning, with soldiers seen behind a fenced area carrying shields, duffle bags and other equipment in and out of the building.

In a statement sent to NBC Chicago, the Village of Broadview confirmed that three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the federal building late Wednesday night.

""During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave. and all of the guards were sleeping,"" the statement said. ""We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night’s sleep, too.""

The Broadview facility has been the site of numerous protests and tensions between activists and masked, armed federal agents, with rubber bullets and chemical agents like tear gas deployed and barricades erected.

The new images come after the U.S Northern Command confirmed that approximately 500 soldiers from various units of the Texas and Illinois National Guards were activated in the Chicago area on a 60-day mission to protect federal agents and facilities.

""These soldiers are employed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" the U.S. Northern Command said in mission update.

City officials in Joliet told NBC Chicago they were notified Tuesday that the Texas National Guard would be stationed at the Army Reserve in Elwood, about 50 miles outside Chicago. Footage captured by NBC 5 and Telemundo Tuesday and Wednesday showed uniformed troops on the ground at the facility, along with dozens of trucks and what appeared to be fencing and mobile housing.

Court filings said there are approximately 200 federalized National Guardsmen in the State of Illinois, and that the Illinois Army National Guard has been authorized to ""mobilize 300 members of the Army National Guard, who are currently mustering to ensure readiness.""

Wednesday, federal Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past. Ellis issued a temporary restraining order Thursday with guidelines for how agents can interact with protesters and the press.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt.","Two protesters arrested in late July during an ICE-involved patrol in Ambridge are suing the borough and several local officers on claims they were unlawfully detained for exercising their rights.

Separate lawsuits, filed Oct. 8 in federal court, allege Isaac Elias and Katherine Melson were arrested without probable cause and without being read their Miranda rights, subjected to excessive force and denied legal counsel before being arraigned. The lawsuits also claim the arrests, made as Elias and Melson protested police activity, violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly.

Joe Askar, solicitor for the borough, said he is reviewing the filings and declined to comment.

Aftermath of an ‘intense’ operation

Interviewed over the summer, Ambridge Police Chief John DeLuca referred to the operation as a “saturation patrol,” involving multiple local and federal forces, and “not an ICE detention roundup.” He said the department would work with ICE when asked, though it doesn’t have a formal contractual agreement.

ICE agents, aided by Ambridge police, the Beaver County Sheriff’s office and at least one Pennsylvania State Police officer, arrested individuals across town over the course of several hours the night of July 31. Observers and response volunteers crowded outside the police station.

Elias witnessed 12 arrests targeting suspected immigrants and, according to the complaint, began marching the perimeter of the Ambridge police station holding a homemade sign that read “No Justice, No Peace” and chanting “Shame!”

The Ambridge operation followed protests across the country as immigrant communities and advocates denounced ICE’s increasingly forceful tactics under President Donald Trump. In the Pittsburgh area, immigration-related arrests soared in the first six months of his administration

Observers in Ambridge said the arrests disrupted the Beaver County river town that’s home to a growing Latino community. Some suspected racial profiling, pointing to a traffic stop of a young Latino couple earlier in the night.

Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer at Casa San José, said at the time, “This is the most intense thing we have ever seen.” Martinez leads a network of volunteers trained to respond in real time to ICE sightings, arrests and raids in an effort to document federal agents and deter a reported increase in civil rights violations under the Trump administration.

Melson and Elias told Public Source that their lawsuits help give voice to those arrested by ICE and draw attention to how a national issue is affecting the local community.

“The people who were taken that night aren’t afforded the ability to hold police and elected officials accountable,” Melson said.

Forceful arrests alleged

Elias was arrested around 10:40 p.m. and later charged with disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise and resisting arrest. A magisterial judge dismissed the charges for both Elias and Melson after they completed 25 hours of community service.

Melson and her wife joined observers outside the police department shortly before Elias’ arrest. The complaint states, after arresting Elias, officers directed Melson and others to step back another 10 to 15 feet because officers were taking someone into custody.

Less than a minute later, officers Michael Longo and John Chickos arrested her, according to the filing. She claims no other bystanders around her were arrested, despite also not stepping back after police orders.

While in custody, the filing states, Chickos used repeated force by “throwing her around” and pinching under her arms, leaving bruises. Another unidentified officer kicked her, according to the suit, and she was strip-searched at the Beaver County Jail.

She claims she repeatedly asked for legal counsel, but was not permitted to contact a lawyer. Later, according to the lawsuit, an attorney representing Melson called the police department, and was told by an officer she could not speak with her client. He said Melson’s charges were “not just disorderly,” though he refused to tell her what the charges were, according to the lawsuit.

Melson was ultimately charged with obstruction of administrative law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt. Sokheng Seng pulled Elias’ arm outside the normal range of motion, causing an “involuntary jerking” during the arrest. Elias claims he suffered physical injury, pain and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit.

Protecting the right to protest

Especially in a small town, Elias said, people should be able to trust that police will protect them.

“It’s important that somebody helps to keep the law enforcement folks within the law,” he said. “People that do [go to protests] should be able to exercise their rights.”

According to the lawsuit, Elias was also not given a reason for his arrest and was told by jail officials he was not “permitted” to have an attorney present at the arraignment per “jail policy.”

The lawsuit also states that Elias’ sign was confiscated and that he was arrested for the “purpose of chilling his First Amendment rights and in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.”

Christine Elzer, the attorney representing Melson and Elias, said peaceful protest is one of the most “fundamental” rights in the United States and that arrests like theirs are a “threat to free speech everywhere.”

Elias and Melson demanded a jury trial and are seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

Update (10/8/2025): This story was updated after the borough solicitor confirmed the defendants would not comment on the lawsuits.

""Immigration agents are keeping people from enjoying the basic things of life.""","CHICAGO – Ivy-covered walls. Forty thousand people singing in the middle of the seventh inning. The hope of raising a white flag with a symbolic ""W.""

Gametime at Wrigley Field on Oct. 8, a National League Division Series matchup between the Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers, carried on as if things were normal in Chicago. And the Cubs' hopes for another trip to the World Series stayed alive with a 4-3 victory.

But away from the Friendly Confines, residents say something never seen before is underway.

""Our communities are being terrorized by agents who are kidnapping people,"" said Corina Pedraza, a longtime South Sider. ""People are living in fear of going out to get groceries, dropping their kids off at school. People are strategizing how to get three or five blocks to work.""

Since President Donald Trump launched his immigration enforcement crackdown known as Operation Midway Blitz, life in and around Chicago has been upended.

The White House says the crackdown is aimed at catching ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Local officials say it’s a power grab. Residents feeling the brunt of the crackdown say immigration agents are making life untenable.

Scenes from the blitz include a Mexican man fatally shot by immigration agents in the northwest suburbs who said the man drove his car into an officer; federal officials deploying chemical agents on protesters and journalists outside the local immigration enforcement facility; and agents rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters to raid a South Side apartment building in the middle of the night.

Department of Homeland Security officials said on Oct. 8 that they had ""arrested more than 1,500 illegal aliens − including criminal pedophiles, murderers, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers"" in connection with the blitz. USA TODAY has not been able to independently verify Homeland Security’s arrests.

Most recently, Trump said he would jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson for resisting the administration's crime-fighting goals in the city. National Guard troops are now deploying to the area.

Here’s a look at how the blitz is affecting people in the Chicago area, from near the Wisconsin border to Indiana.

South Side parking lot stakeout

In the predawn hours Oct. 7, dozens of Chicagoans gathered near an empty parking lot off a busy thoroughfare on the South Side.

The early hour, they told reporters at the scene, was in response to the schedule they noticed immigration enforcement agents were keeping. They said they hoped to be able to document agents carrying out their duties.

Federal agents arrived at the parking lot in the Back of the Yards neighborhood and set up a staging point for operations. The Yards Plaza lot is off the major thoroughfare of 47th Street near schools and a Home Depot.

Residents say masked men carrying guns take people off the streets in the surrounding area and bring them to the lot to move them into a van to be taken elsewhere.

""We went from being this community that walks our kids to school or goes out to parks. ... . Now the streets are empty,"" said Pedraza, adding she worries about students in the area witnessing agents at work. ""Imagine being a first grader and seeing agents with military weapons, masked men. No child should have to pass through that.""

'Agents have created a war zone in our community,' local alderwoman says

Among the people on hand was local alderwoman Julia Ramirez. The City Council member said she came to fight back for residents she sees as caught in a ""war zone.""

""People can't live their lives the way they did before,"" Ramirez said. ""Agents have created a war zone in our community.""

Many of the people there were members of what’s known as the Southwest Side Rapid Response team, a group of volunteers that aims to document immigration enforcement actions and confirm sightings of immigration agents.

Pedraza, a team member, said neighborhood residents looking to leave the house will give her a call first to see about the latest confirmed immigration agent sightings.

After assembling in the morning, team members were seen standing on corners throughout the neighborhood, notably at sites where immigration agents have been reported before, including the Home Depot.

The Southwest Side team is one of many active throughout the Chicago area. Many regularly broadcast confirmed immigration agent sightings.

DHS officials have criticized those efforts, saying activists tracking federal immigration agents are endangering law enforcement officers who are doing their jobs.

On Oct. 8, the Southwest Side team reported sightings of immigration agents in the area that included the make, model and license plate number of immigration agents’ vehicles.

Across town, on the Northwest Side, another team reported seeing eight immigration agents' vehicles, including a white SUV with a Mexican flag on the hood. Locals believe agents are adding Mexican flags to cars to act as a decoy.

Teams in the suburbs also reported immigration agent sightings on Oct. 8, saying that in Oak Park, Berwyn and Cicero, volunteers ""were able to confirm that ICE was active in our communities and abducted at least two of our neighbors.""

Rapid-response teams respond to calls to a hotline organized by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Spokesperson Brandon Lee said their role consists of documenting federal law enforcement, not interfering with their work.

Friendly Confines still full of 'joy'

Amid the increasingly aggressive crackdown, many in Chicago are trying to maintain a sense of normalcy and big events help eclipse the national spotlight that comes from immigration agents clashing with residents or Trump calling for the governor’s arrest.

""It’s sometimes hard living your own life knowing all this is happening,"" said Jeanne Uehling, a Chicagoan of more than 20 years attending the Cubs game Oct. 8. ""It’s surreal that at work I have to care about someone turning something in when there are helicopters landing and raiding people.""

The downtown office worker spoke with USA TODAY outside Wrigley Field with longtime friend Julie Murphy. They said that they were going to the game despite the president calling Chicago a hellhole.

""We have to still feel joy, and this city has so much joy,"" said Murphy, who originally moved to the city from the suburbs. ""People outside the city, they don’t know what's going on. They think we're being rescued somehow.""

The game and crowds teeming up and down Clark Street outside the stadium are just the latest example of the city letting loose to enjoy itself. During a break in the first inning, fans stopped to sing ""Y.M.C.A.,"" a notable Trump anthem that has also been a Wrigley Field staple for years.

Hundreds of swimmers recently competed in races in the city’s river for the first time in nearly a century. The inaugural Chicago River Swim comes after decades spent cleaning the former industrial waterway.

For Sunday, Oct. 12, the city was preparing for its annual marathon, in which more than 53,000 runners were expected to compete. The race showcases the city’s iconic downtown Loop neighborhood.

'Closed due to the situation'

Unpredictable immigration raids and the deployment of National Guard troops have the region on edge.

""Over the past few weeks we’ve all felt it: families afraid to leave their homes and go to school, parents kissing their kids goodbye not knowing they’ll make it home. That’s something nobody should have to live with,"" said Edwin Lagunas of Toluca’s Restaurant in Waukegan.

Lagunas, who was born and raised in the Chicago suburb, spoke at a news conference Oct. 7 held in response to at least seven people being detained by agents in the area the day before.

The crackdown has had a severe impact on life in the area, locals say. Toluca’s and other neighborhood spots had signs posted saying that they were ""closed due to the situation"" until at least Oct. 9, when a federal judge in Chicago was expected to rule on the question of whether National Guard troops may remain in the area.

Sandra Fajardo, owner of a popular indoor soccer complex, said that suddenly teams had begun showing up with players missing, or canceling games outright.

""What’s happening in our city right now is heartbreaking,"" the Waukegan native said. ""Immigration agents are keeping people from enjoying the basic things of life.""

TALLAHASSEE — An appeals-court panel on Thursday grilled attorneys about a new state law making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to enter Florida, questioning whether enforcement and oversight of such issues should be left to the federal government.

The Republican-controlled Legislature passed the law during a February special session aimed at helping President Donald Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration.

The law (SB 4-C) makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter or re-enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”

Attorneys for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida and two individual plaintiffs filed a challenge in federal court in South Florida, alleging the law is unconstitutional.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams in April issued a preliminary injunction blocking the law, saying it was likely preempted by federal immigration-enforcement authority. In part, she pointed to part of the law requiring that violators go to jail and indicated that could conflict with federal authority.

A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday heard arguments in the state’s appeal of Williams’ order. The legal battle over the law has been highly contentious, with Williams taking the unusual step of finding Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in civil contempt because of a letter he sent to law enforcement agencies indicating he could not prevent police from enforcing the law after Williams ordered a halt.

Thursday’s arguments touched on the contempt order but focused on the underlying dispute about Florida’s authority to make it a crime for people who are in the country without authorization to enter the state.

Judge Adalberto Jordan, who was joined on the panel by judges Charles Wilson and Barbara Lagoa, pressed Jeffrey DeSousa, the state’s acting solicitor general, about the preemption issue.

“The federal government has created a scheme where only certain illegal entry or re-entry offenses are prosecuted, others are taken care of civilly through the removal process, but you think that’s not field preempted?” Jordan asked.

DeSousa pointed to previous court rulings establishing that “states could have precisely the kinds of regulations that Florida has adopted” and saying that “states aren’t powerless to deter the influx of immigrants into the United States illegally, and that’s all that Florida has done here.”

DeSousa also argued that federal immigration law “is primarily concerned with admissibility regulations” about who can enter the country.

Lagoa, a former Florida Supreme Court justice, asked DeSousa about part of the law that says people who are arrested pose a flight risk and must be held without bond.

“It seems like a strange way to handle it. It causes me some concern,” she said.

The panel’s review of Williams’ preliminary injunction “is governed by the abuse of discretion standards,” Jordan told DeSousa, noting that other courts that have considered similar state laws have found that they were preempted by federal authority.

“The general default principle is you don’t do merits review in a preliminary injunction appeal because the judge is weighing probabilities, and that’s a quintessential discretionary call unless there’s a clear error of judgment,” Jordan said.

But DeSousa argued that preliminary injunctions “have proliferated over the last decade.”

“This is a huge rule-of-law problem for states because a district court that wrongfully imposes a PI (preliminary injunction), as we think happened here, can effectively pause a state’s law for potentially years through the pendency of the litigation. It can take years and the state is irreparably harmed by that,” DeSousa said.

Cody Wofsy, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the plaintiffs, argued that the U.S. Supreme Court for over 150 years has said that immigration law should be regulated by the federal government.

“The interest here is an … inherent, central area of federal control and interest,” Wofsy, who is deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, told the panel.

Florida’s law is “even more punitive” than federal immigration law, requiring mandatory pretrial detention and longer mandatory sentences, according to Wofsy.

Lagoa noted that states can impose tougher penalties for drug crimes. But Wofsy said that immigration is different.

“Here, we’re saying there is a complex problem at the border that we’re dealing with, which is there are people who are coming in between ports. We both want to deter that, but we also want to acknowledge foreign policy considerations, humanitarian considerations, connections with US citizens. …. How do we figure that out? We have one sovereign make the decision about which tools are going to be deployed, and that’s the federal government,” Wofsy said.

The judges also wrangled over Williams’ contempt order.

Uthmeier has argued that a temporary restraining order — and a longer-lasting preliminary injunction issued later — should only apply to him and local state attorneys because they were the named defendants in the underlying lawsuit.

In an April 23 letter to police agencies, Uthmeier reiterated that position and said he could not prevent police from enforcing the law “where there remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so,” according to Williams’ June 17 contempt ruling.

Lagoa said she thought Williams “erred” when issuing the contempt ruling because Uthmeier’s office doesn’t have direct oversight of sheriffs.

“So how is it appropriate for the district court judge to order the attorney general of Florida to, in essence, supervise these law-enforcement officers?” she asked Wofsy.

But Wofsy said he disagreed with Lagoa’s representation of Williams’ order.

“What the attorney general and every defendant was ordered to do was to give notice of the court’s order. He didn’t have to agree with it. He didn’t have to command them to do anything,” Wofsy said, adding that the contempt issue is the subject of a separate appeal. “The problem with what the attorney general did here is not that he refused to command law enforcement officers, it’s that he told them that there was no lawful legitimate order binding them.”",https://cdn.wmnf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/US-citizenship-immigration-services-by-Evgenia-Parajanian-via-iStock-1251559190.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 14:57:36.150342

The immediate aftermath of the shooting was marked by panic and fear in the immigrant community.
The ever-expanding relationship between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is a key detail in how one of the victims of the September 24 shooting, Guzman-Fuentes, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, ended up at the Dallas ICE Field Office that day.
Shortly after Guzman-Fuentes was booked at the Dallas County Jail, ICE “encountered him” and filed an immigration detainer.
At a vigil held at Dallas City Hall on October 3, organizers gathered to “center the victims of the shooting” and to condemn the “dehumanization” of migrants by the Trump administration.","On September 24, a gunman shot at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas, killing two immigrants, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes and Miguel Ángel García-Hernández, and seriously injuring another, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, who were being detained at the site.

The federal government was quick to blame the attack on the “far left” and the “dehumanization” of ICE agents “who are simply enforcing the law.” Around four hours after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel posted a photo of bullets with the message “anti-ICE” written on them allegedly found at the scene, citing this as evidence of the suspected shooter’s “idealogical [sic] motive.”

But for the immigrant community in Dallas, the shooting is yet another instance of the violence and fear they have endured under President Donald Trump’s nearly $30 billion “deportation-industrial complex” and a continuation of the lack of transparency and accountability from the local and federal governments alike.

The immediate aftermath of the shooting was marked by panic and fear in the immigrant community. At a vigil two days after the shooting, at Parkland Hospital where victims were being treated, Noemi Rios, an organizer with the Chicana-led community initiative Vecinos Unidos DFW, said that local organizations were being flooded with requests seeking more information about the identity of the victims. Rios told reporters that family members who “knew their loved ones had been detained” at the Dallas ICE field office “couldn’t get confirmation of life or death.”

Flaka Martinez, another organizer with Vecinos Unidos, said that this panic was the result of ICE’s detainee locator system, which has been criticized by families of detainees and their lawyers for not providing up-to-date information regarding the whereabouts of detainees. Martinez urged that anyone detained by ICE must have their unique identification numbers (known as an “A-Number”) put into the system within 12 hours of detention. She also pointed to the fact that the facility where the shooting happened was not a detention center but rather an administrative office where people frequently visit for check-ins with ICE. “It’s not sustainable, nor safe to detain people at that facility,” Martinez said.

Well before the shooting, family members with loved ones detained at that Dallas field office reported inhumane conditions in the facility, including overcrowding, medical neglect, and individuals being detained for more than a week without access to running water and air conditioning. Over 600 people were held at the field office in June and July for longer than ICE’s own 12-hour limit on detention in so-called “hold rooms,” according to data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by El Movimiento DFW, a local group advocating for immigrant rights. Protests and public pressure led in part by Vecinos Unidos and El Movimiento led Democratic Congressmembers Julie Johnson, Marc Veasey, and Jasmine Crockett—who all represent parts of Dallas—to send a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, on July 28 demanding “immediate answers” to reports about the field office. As of October 6, the U.S. representatives have not received a response.

For the immigrant community in Dallas, this lack of transparency around what advocates claim are unlawful and unjust detentions has become an expected response not just from federal law enforcement but local police as well. While the Dallas Police Department (DPD) maintains no official 287(g) agreement with ICE, it has stated that the department “regularly” interacts with federal agencies and will “assist these agencies upon request.”

Tony Rodriguez, the regional commander of the Brown Berets of North Texas, a community defense group that runs an “ICE Watch” in the area, said that the DPD’s public comments are “political double speak.” Rodriguez pointed to a recent multi-agency operation led by Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of ICE, on the Chicas Bonitas Strip Club in Dallas for suspected “human trafficking and unlawful employment.” Rodriguez said that as soon as the Brown Berets’ ICE Watch was alerted of a possible raid, members of the organization were on the scene, collecting testimonials and documenting the arrests.

Corbin Rubinson, spokesperson for DPD, wrote in an email to the Observer that the department was “requested to provide perimeter security during the outside agency’s operation.” According to an ICE press release, federal agents arrested 41 undocumented immigrants; just five had criminal records in the United States.

With suspicion from community organizations already high, Senate Bill 8 could dramatically change how immigration enforcement is conducted in the state. SB 8 will force county sheriffs to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE by next December, which could give deputies the authority to arrest and detain people off the street on the basis of immigration status depending on the 287(g) model a sheriff selects. As the Texas Observer has previously reported, around 30 local county sheriffs and police departments have already voluntarily inked “task force model” agreements, which effectively deputize local officers as ICE agents.

The ever-expanding relationship between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is a key detail in how one of the victims of the September 24 shooting, Guzman-Fuentes, a 37-year-old from El Salvador, ended up at the Dallas ICE Field Office that day. According to a press release from ICE, DPD arrested Guzman-Fuentes on August 25 on an aggravated assault charge—which ICE said was later dropped—and an outstanding warrant for a DUI. Shortly after Guzman-Fuentes was booked at the Dallas County Jail, ICE “encountered him” and filed an immigration detainer. The press release states that he was being transferred into the office that morning when the shooter opened fire, killing him and García-Hernández, a 32-year-old immigrant from Mexico who passed away due to his injuries five days later.

As previously reported by the San Antonio Express-News, ICE is increasingly using county jails to detain undocumented immigrants before they are taken into federal custody and ultimately deported. While all Texas county jails have been sharing biometric data with ICE since 2010, since January of this year, the number of immigration detainers filed on immigrants booked at the Dallas County Jail has increased by 71 percent. When SB 8 goes into effect, those rates could further increase.

At a vigil held at Dallas City Hall on October 3, organizers gathered to “center the victims of the shooting” and to condemn the “dehumanization” of migrants by the Trump administration.

Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, an Austin immigration attorney who has been in contact with the families of the victims, told the Observer that for families, the loss of their loved ones has been compounded by the “way that the government has responded, by not giving them information quickly.” CBS reported that Guzman-Fuentes’ wife only found out that her husband had been killed after contacting the Salvadoran consulate. Organizers also read a statement from his sister, who said she wants people to remember her brother as “the greatest brother, tío, and friend.” The statement also noted that officials told her that she wouldn’t be able to see her brother’s body and would only be offered two hours for a funeral.

Eric Cedillo, an attorney representing García-Hernández’s wife, told the crowd that he must be remembered for his “heroism.” Cedillo said that when “bullets crashed through the window and hit Miguel,” he turned to the 18 year-old boy sitting next to him in the van and said, “I don’t think I’m going to make it, get underneath me. Let me shield you.”

Looking ahead, Martinez, the community organizer, said that in spite of the Trump administration using the shooting as a pretext to vilify resistance to ICE, her community is determined to continue to fight against Trump’s deportation machine and “serve justice for [the victims’] families.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4535-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 14:57:45.865426

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the resettlement organization Global Refuge, told the AP this would be “a monumental shift in U.S. refugee policy.”

“Not just in terms of reducing admissions, but also in terms of disproportionately privileging one group over every other,” he said. “Our concern is that this could turn what has long been a globally responsive humanitarian system into one that overwhelmingly favors a single group.”

The White House has said the refugee cap is not final until it negotiates a final number with Congress, according to the AP.

While it was a part of the DOJ’s Civil Division, the CPB oversaw both criminal and affirmative civil enforcement cases and provided expertise to various government-wide working groups, in addition to engaging with consumers, industry, and law enforcement around the world. The CPB also defended certain consumer protection and public health agencies, including the FDA, FTC, and CPSC, in federal district courts.

The Announced Mission of the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch

The EALB will focus on (i) bringing affirmative litigation to enforce federal laws and regulations, (ii) enjoining actions that conflict with or violate federal law, (iii) obtaining declaratory judgments, and (iv) seeking monetary penalties where appropriate. The DOJ’s Civil Division is consolidating its affirmative litigation work into one Branch to “hold powerful actors accountable, protect public health and safety, and enforce critical national policies.” The EALB’s announced goals largely overlap with those of its predecessor, but will have an increased focus on advancing the “interests of the United States.”

As stated in the DOJ’s press release, the EALB will (1) prioritize cases that protect women and children from alleged false or misleading medical claims related to gender transition procedures, as well as (2) matters involving “sanctuary” laws and policies that impede federal immigration enforcement. This new focus is consistent with Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate’s memo on Civil Division enforcement and underscores changes in priorities between the current DOJ under the Trump Administration and DOJ under the Biden Administration. Assistant Attorney General Shumate will also be in charge of the newly formed EALB. Since False Claims Act litigation remains a priority, the creation of the EALB should have minimal impact on these matters.

The DOJ’s stated approach aligns with the Civil Division’s recent lawsuits filed against Minnesota, the City of Minneapolis, the City of St. Paul, and others challenging their sanctuary city policies as violating federal immigration enforcement mandates. As alleged in the complaint, the Minnesota officials’ refusal to cooperate with federal immigration authorities results in the release of dangerous criminals otherwise subject to removal. This lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits targeting sanctuary city policies across the country, including in Boston, New York City, Rochester, New York, New Jersey, Colorado, and Los Angeles.

Responsibilities of The EALB’s Two Sections

There are two sections of the EALB:

Enforcement Section. This section will handle civil enforcement actions and affirmative litigation overseen by the now-dissolved CPB, including enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, and the Restore Online Shopper’s Confidence Act. Its mission is to protect consumers from harm ranging from deceptive practices by major technology companies, defective goods imported from abroad, false or misleading claims by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Affirmative Litigation Section. This section will bring lawsuits against states, municipalities, and private entities that obstruct or conflict with federal policies, ensuring compliance with the U.S. Constitution and federal law nationwide. It is anticipated that the Affirmative Litigation section will actively seek declaratory judgments in matters where there is an active controversy between the EALB’s enforcement priorities that conflict with state and local laws.

Key Takeaways

Increased Potential for Disparate Outcomes: The dispersal of CPB personnel and the division of its authority may lead to different outcomes than had the CPB had remained in place.

Review Compliance Programs: Now that the Consumer Protection Branch has been dissolved, company policies and procedures should be reviewed to ensure compliance with the announced focus by the Enforcement & Affirmative Litigation Branch.

Be Knowledgeable: Information about the new EALB currently is relatively limited due to the recent announcement of its creation coinciding with an ongoing government shutdown. As more information about its priorities, structure, and authority is revealed, clients should keep an eye out for any new developments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.5055_3837.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:58:34.117231

According to Wilson's office, administration officials required a response to their demands by noon Wednesday. His public statement and letter of response were critical of the administration's demands, but there were still signs Wednesday of the city making course adjustments.

During Noem's visit, Portland police officers had cordoned off the block in front of the ICE facility to keep protesters back. As of Wednesday morning, they were maintaining that cordoned-off area, but all roads have since reopened late Wednesday evening.

PPB, in an email to KGW, said, in part, ""We have removed the area closure and people are free to move through that space again. As always, PPB has the authority to restrict access to certain areas whenever a threat to the public health or safety is created by any emergency. We continue to evaluate the situation and consult with city leadership.""

The city also brought in crews from Rapid Response Bio-Clean, its contractor for clearing homeless camps, to remove a small protest encampment that's persisted across from the ICE facility for weeks. They were done clearing the camp by noon Wednesday.

A Portland police spokesman said that the agency was keeping the cordon up for the camp removal and because they are ""still providing a presence in the area,"" but that the police tape should come down later in the day; it did come down around 4:30 p.m.

""Ultimately, the encampment near the ICE facility was cleared due to ongoing public safety concerns. Criminal activity has been associated with the site, and the encampment was obstructing public right-of-ways,"" said Mike Benner, a spokesperson for the Portland Police Bureau. ""In addition, the camp has negatively impacted quality of life and economic activity in the area.

""This action was taken to restore public safety, access, and order while balancing the rights of all individuals. PPB remains committed to supporting peaceful protest and the right to free expression, but unlawful behavior and conditions that jeopardize health and safety cannot be allowed to continue. We appreciate the community’s understanding and cooperation.""

Benner said that PPB had requested the camp removal and was there to provide security.

""It’s important to note this camp has moved, been posted, and cleaned numerous times,"" he added.

PPB will continue to monitor events outside the ICE facility, Benner said.

Meanwhile, the Portland Bureau of Transportation was Wednesday morning ""temporarily"" changing South Bond Avenue, which runs north to south through the South Waterfront just east of the ICE facility, from a one-way to a two-way street. PBOT workers were seen drilling yellow line markers over the white lines, which divide the two lanes on the street.

""One-block stretch of South Bond Avenue is now open to two-way traffic between Lowell and Bancroft streets,"" the city said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. ""Making it easier for people to get to homes and businesses. Initial public input has been very positive in response to this change.""

In his statement Wednesday, Mayor Wilson said that one Trump administration official had raised the possibility of Portland taking over the ICE facility lease, something Wilson said he'd be open to discussing.

The federal government has leased the building from a private owner since 2011, Wilson's office said, when the city issued a conditional land use approval.

""Today’s decision makes clear that DHS and ICE — like everyone else — must follow the Constitution and the law,"" Michelle García, deputy legal director at the ACLU of Illinois and co-counsel in the case, said in a statement. ""The federal government’s reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people — and then finding a justification for the action must end.""

Trump deployed Texas National Guard troops in Illinois this week for an initial 60-day period to help with his administration’s crime crackdown and deportation rollout.

“So, it's just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that's serving mostly immigrants.”","Doctors at Adventist Health White Memorial hospital in Boyle Heights told LAist that hospital administrators are allowing federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist. Hospital leaders also have told doctors to allow immigration agents to remain by a detained patient’s side, even during consultations, inhibiting frank discussions between doctors and their patients and potentially violating patient privacy laws. Doctors say this is not typical protocol for any patients, including those brought in by local police or sheriff’s deputies.

These doctors are equally concerned about their inability to ensure follow-up care for patients released to the ICE processing facility known as B-18 in downtown L.A., where critics say some detainees have been held for days on end with no proper beds or medical care.

Why this matters

White Memorial is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The hospital has been operating for more than 110 years. Its calling is to “help improve the lives of our friends and neighbors in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights,” according to its website.

Five physicians at White Memorial shared the details with LAist about ICE’s presence at the hospital and hospital administrators’ response on the condition that they not be named for fear of retaliation from their employer or from immigration authorities. LAist reviewed internal emails supporting their claims.

“We have an ethical and moral duty to provide excellent medical care and to serve the patient’s interest,” one doctor at White Memorial told LAist. But the doctor said the frequent presence of masked, armed immigration agents in the hospital makes it “very difficult to do that.”

The physicians told LAist they believe the directives from their bosses conflict with the responsibilities all doctors have to their patients and with guidance from the California attorney general.

White Memorial did not respond to a request for an interview from LAist or to our emailed list of questions.

In a statement, a White Memorial spokesperson said the hospital’s staff “are passionately committed to providing the highest standard of medical care to all who come through our doors, regardless of their circumstances” and that the hospital has “protocols in place that are designed to help support the lawful respect of patient rights.”

“We are doing everything in our power to provide safe and compassionate care to our community during this time of unrest,” the statement reads. It also urged people not to ""delay the medical care you need.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to specific questions from LAist or agree to an interview.

In a statement, she wrote that “ICE is not denying any illegal alien access to proper medical care or medications.” McLaughlin said it was “longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

She added that she hoped LAist “would consider NOT writing this garbage” in the wake of the recent shooting outside an ICE detention center in Texas, where one detainee was killed and two injured.

“These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” she wrote.

An analysis of federal court filings for assault on a federal officer by Colorado Public Radio shows a sharp increase in charges in recent months. The data is far short of the scale suggested by officials.

The bigger picture

A version of the conflicts described at White Memorial is happening across the state and the country as hospitals are forced to contend with fallout from the Trump administration’s mass deportation program. Caught in the middle are doctors and other medical professionals who have a legal duty to provide medical care to patients and ethical concerns about policies they feel affect the traditional standards of care.

The five doctors who spoke with LAist say the conflicts are especially acute at White Memorial, a hospital whose patient and surrounding population is mostly Latino and where several doctors told LAist they’re seeing two to three detained patients per shift.

The situation also raises questions about medical privacy at a time when the federal government is seeking access to sensitive personal information, including medical information from both immigrants and U.S.-born citizens.

Lorenzo Antonio González is a physician who volunteers with Unión del Barrio, which patrols Boyle Heights and other neighborhoods to warn people about ICE raids. He does not work at White Memorial but is aware of the doctors’ concerns. He said he fears ICE’s frequent presence at the hospital will further the chilling effect already causing many Boyle Heights neighbors — where more than 80% of households speak Spanish and a quarter of residents are noncitizens — to forgo medical care and avoid leaving their homes. González called White Memorial’s alleged behavior “an erosion of trust within this pillar of a community.”

How we got here

As immigration raids ramped up in Los Angeles this year, some detainees have needed urgent medical care, either because they were injured while being detained, had a pre-existing illness, or because they became ill while being held at the downtown immigration facility.

Some of these incidents became headlines. In July, a Salvadoran woman was brought to Glendale Memorial Hospital with injuries suffered during a raid. In that case, camera crews descended on the hospital as activists protested the presence of ICE agents in the public lobby.

Meanwhile, White Memorial stayed out of the news. In June, a hospital leader sent an email to colleagues, flagging several incidents involving immigration detainees, including one in which agents remained in the room with a detained patient during the patient’s entire stay at the hospital. The email also noted that agents told doctors they could not call the patient’s family members when the patient couldn’t remember her medications, according to the email and doctors who spoke with LAist.

Doctors at White Memorial and other hospitals told LAist it’s not typical for law enforcement officers to remain in the room during patient care, even with criminal detainees, unless there’s a serious security risk. People in ICE custody are civil, not criminal detainees. Doctors also told LAist it’s common practice to call family members, with a patient’s permission, to inquire about their medical history and current medications.

So the doctors at White Memorial pressed hospital administrators for a clear policy and legal guidance on how to balance ICE agent demands with the hospital’s responsibilities for patient care.

The answer that came back from hospital administrators: defer to the agents.

Hospital leaders told doctors — both verbally, doctors say, and in writing in several emails reviewed by LAist — that immigration agents are allowed to be present at all times, even during discussions about a patient’s sensitive medical information. Doctors also were told they could not call a detained patient’s family member without an agent’s permission. In one email to subordinates, a hospital leader told White Memorial staff that doing so could be a “security risk.”

“That’s like encouraging medical negligence,” one White Memorial doctor told LAist in response to this guidance.

At least one doctor told LAist they are defying hospital leaders’ guidance, deferring instead to their medical duty to the patient and to follow medical privacy laws.

“There’s no way you can get me to not call a patient’s family if they’re hurt and need support,” the doctor said.

The bigger picture

The concerns about White Memorial come at a time when the care of people in ICE custody is under scrutiny. In August, a man was severely injured while being detained at a car wash in Carson. Agents brought him to Harbor-UCLA medical center for treatment and remained by his bed, to which the man was cuffed, for over a month, according to a recent court ruling. He was never charged with violating any immigration laws, and in October, a federal judge ordered the agents monitoring him to leave the man’s hospital room and remove restrictions on the man’s “ability to make telephone calls to family and friends and to confer confidentially with counsel outside the presence of ICE agents.”

Concerns about the medical care of detainees also extends to formal ICE detention centers. In September, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Westminster man who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, became the 17th person to die in ICE custody this year. Last year, 12 people died in ICE custody, according to agency statistics.

Ayala-Uribe, 39, was a former DACA recipient who supporters say had lived in the country since he was 4 years old. He was picked up in an ICE raid in Fountain Valley in August and sent to Adelanto. From there, a medical provider at the detention facility sent Ayala-Uribe to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an abscess, scheduled for surgery and sent back to the facility. He died in custody the following day.

Earlier this year, as immigration raids ramped up, the advocacy group Disability Rights California interviewed 18 people detained at the Adelanto ICE facility. In a subsequent report, the group concluded that ""due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated.” The report claimed detainees faced ""inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.""

In response to LAist’s emailed questions about medical care for ICE detainees, McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, said detainees received “medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare … many aliens have received in their entire lives,"" she wrote.

McLaughlin did not respond to LAist’s follow-up email asking her to specifically respond to questions about hospital care for detainees outside of detention centers or to questions about the availability of health care at the B-18 processing center, which unlike the Adelanto facility, is not an official detention center.

In a recent, ongoing lawsuit over the L.A. immigration raids, the ACLU and other groups called out alleged unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical care at B-18.

“Individuals with conditions that require consistent medications and treatment are not given any medical attention, even when that information is brought to the attention of the officers on duty,” reads the initial complaint, filed in July.

One doctor at White Memorial told LAist she had called ICE supervisors at the holding center on several occasions to inquire about follow-up care for patients and was told there were no doctors at the facility and there was no way to obtain medication.

What this all means for detainees — and doctors

Other groups have tried to bring attention to the problems associated with immigration agents in hospital settings. The Committee of Interns and Residents, which is is part of the Service Employees International Union, publicly denounced the presence of ICE agents at University of California hospitals in July, saying it creates “an unsafe environment that … directly contradicts our mission to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare to every member of our community.”

Mahima Iyengar, a doctor at L.A. General hospital and secretary-treasurer of the committee, told LAist that having a law enforcement officer present during doctor-patient conversations can compromise care.

“There's that level of trust that people have with their doctor that they don't necessarily have when somebody else is listening,” Iyengar told LAist. “Your doctor is then not getting as much information as they need, and that information … very well could be what helps them come up with a diagnosis or what helps them decide what treatment [the patient] is going to be on.”

Iyengar said doctors also are unlikely to feel comfortable asking a patient important non-medical questions when an ICE agent is present.

“A lot of what determines our patients' health are all of these social determinants, like where they're living, how they're getting to the hospital, if they have money, if they have kids that need childcare right now while they're hospitalized,” she said. “All of those questions are important questions to ask that I would not personally feel comfortable asking if an officer was standing right there.”

McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to LAist’s specific questions about whether the agency recognizes detained patients’ privacy rights at hospitals.

What do legal experts say?

Last December, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued “guidance and model policies” for health care facilities in responding to the anticipated increase in immigration enforcement. The guidance is not mandatory for private hospitals, like White Memorial, but all health care facilities were “encouraged to adopt” model policies. Doctors who spoke with LAist said they had read the guidance and felt beholden to it.

The document states that:

State and federal medical privacy laws apply to all patients “regardless of immigration status.”

Health care facility staff “should identify circumstances in which granting immigration enforcement officers access to patients may interfere with physicians’ duty to provide competent medical care, to safeguard patient confidences and privacy, and to otherwise prioritize their obligations to their patients”; and

Facilities “should educate patients about their privacy rights and reassure them that their healthcare information is protected by federal and state laws.”

A spokesperson for Bonta told LAist the attorney general could not comment on whether the office had received complaints about ICE privacy breaches in health care settings because they are confidential.

“We continue to monitor compliance with all state and federal laws,” the spokesperson said in an email.

LAist also asked two health care legal experts about White Memorial’s direction to staff to allow ICE agents to be present during patient exams and bar calls to detained patients’ family members. Both said the guidance could violate medical privacy laws and ethical standards.

“From a patient safety perspective, it certainly raises red flags,” said Paul Schmeltzer, an L.A.-based health care and data privacy lawyer, referring especially to the prohibition on calling a detained patient’s family member. Schmeltzer also said letting an ICE agent remain next to a patient throughout their hospital stay without the patient’s consent is likely illegal. Patient privacy is protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Both generally prohibit doctors and hospitals from disclosing a patient’s medical information without their permission or a search warrant or other court order.

Schmeltzer said he saw “no permissible situation” under these laws for “disclosing” a detained patient’s hospital treatment to an ICE agent.

“The fact that an ICE agent is present in the room while this patient is receiving treatment, that's a disclosure,” he said.

Deven McGraw, chief regulatory and privacy officer for the company Citizen Health, a patient data platform, agreed.

“ You're basically saying, ‘Yeah, patient, you don't have a choice but to disclose your medical information to this law enforcement official,'” she said.

McGraw was in charge of enforcing HIPAA at the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights from 2015 to 2017. She said there are personal and public health reasons for shielding a patient’s medical information from law enforcement. For example, a patient might hide that they have a communicable disease out of fear they’ll be targeted or isolated.

“ We're supposed to treat people,” McGraw said. “The failure to treat them has potential consequences for their own health, plus the health of others.”

Schmeltzer and McGraw both said the administration at White Memorial might be making a calculated decision when weighing the hospital’s potential liability for violating the privacy rights of immigration detainees versus angering the Trump administration. Only the federal government and state attorneys general can prosecute a hospital for violating HIPAA, Schmeltzer and McGraw noted.

Some of the behavior described by doctors could be prohibited under a new state law, enacted in September as an “urgency” measure. The law requires health care facilities to ban immigration agents from entering non-public areas without a valid warrant and to advise staff on how to respond to agents’ requests for entry.

Even before the law, groups like the Committee of Interns and Residents had begun to train colleagues on the privacy rights of detained patients and how to handle ICE agents. Iyengar said doctors at L.A. General, for example, distribute “Know Your Rights” cards to immigrant patients and hospital employees are instructed to immediately call hospital directors if immigration agents appear.

“ Even just if there is an ICE officer in the hospital, that will put people off from visiting a loved one, or if word gets out, the community finds out, and they don't want come to that hospital,” she said. “So, it's just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that's serving mostly immigrants.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce867b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fb2%2Fae9782c44aaa88d6fa904dcfd8ac%2Fwhite-memorial-hospital-6-d25a7003.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 13:57:54.866296

""That's a publicity stunt, man!"" Harvey, who lives in the south side, said.

This summer Chicago's homicide rate was the lowest since the 1960s. So, Harvey can't believe hundreds of troops have arrived in Illinois to make the city any safer. President Trump has called Chicago a ""war zone"" and has claimed the city's crime rate is unsustainable.

Under Trump's orders, National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas are tasked with protecting federal government employees such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and federal property.

Harvey said Trump is doing this to appear like he's keeping the city safe from undocumented immigrants. This hits close to home. Harvey lives in a neighborhood that recently had a big ICE raid in a residential building.

""You snatching kids and people that get up and go to work every day — that's who you grab, you not grabbing no criminals,"" Harvey said.

Trump's pressure is met with resistance

Last month, the Trump administration ramped up its immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the mission dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz"" has led to more than 1,000 arrests of migrants without legal status.

Chicago residents have taken to the streets to push back. They have recorded — and published — the ICE arrests, and have created ICE watch groups.

On Wednesday night, hundreds of people marched in downtown Chicago to protest the deployment of the troops and the presence of ICE.

Jessica Urbina, 26, came to march by herself because she felt it was important to join her community to repudiate Trump's actions.

""I feel empowered,"" she said. ""I don't know these people, but we all have a lot in common and we all have the same motive to help each other, lean on each other.""

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson told NPR Wednesday his office will do whatever it takes to resist Trump's attacks on his city. He says Congress and the Supreme Court are complicit.

""They're aiding and abetting the dismantling of our democracy and our Constitution,"" Johnson said. ""We'll use every single tool that's available to me. This is going to play out in the courts. It's going to play out on the streets.""

A federal judge in Chicago will hear arguments Thursday afternoon on whether the deployment is legal or not.

It's unclear what exactly Johnson will do. So far, he's used executive orders to make it harder for ICE to operate in the city — including a ban on the use of city-owned or operated space by federal agents.

He said it's the first time a mayor has had to fight off what he calls a federal invasion.

Johnson's defiance has irked Trump, who has called for the arrests of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Johnson for ""failing to protect ICE officers.""

""This is not the first time Trump has accused or insisted on a Black man being arrested,"" Johnson said. ""A president that is threatening to jail his political opponents is clear — yet another example of authoritarianism.""

All of this has caused a lot of fear in the Chicago neighborhoods where many immigrants live. Census data shows about one in five residents in Chicago are foreign born.

Jackson, a Venezuelan immigrant who is only using his first name because of his immigration status, said he's terrified of walking the streets of Chicago with so much federal law enforcement presence.

""And now with the National Guard things will be even more complicated,"" Jackson said in Spanish, his eyes filled with tears. ""It's super scary to even go grocery shopping.""

He has three kids and a wife. 39-year-old Jackson says they have had conversations about what to do if he gets picked up by ICE.

Jackson works in construction, but recently he has not been going to work.

He talked to NPR reporters while waiting at a bus stop right across the street ICE raided last week in a military-style operation. He was en route to meet an attorney to file for asylum.

""I'm trying to show that I'm working, that I have not committed any crimes,"" Jackson said. ""Maybe I'll be given a chance.""

Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs.
Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans.
Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.
“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says.","When I visited Hyundai Motor’s “Metaplant” in May to drive the new Ioniq9 electric SUV, the facility was a symbol of everything right about U.S. auto manufacturing. It’s a US $7.6 billion showpiece of automation staffed by gung-ho and highly skilled workers, capable of churning out 500,000 EVs a year at full crank. The biggest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history, the Metaplant is the linchpin of Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s bid to make the state the “electric mobility capital of the country.”

Then it all went wrong. On 4 September, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided the supersized facility in Ellabell, Ga., about a half hour from Savannah. Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs. Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans. Following a week of detention, and tense negotiations between the South Korean and U.S. governments, the workers were ejected from the U.S. and sent home on a plane chartered by South Korea. Outraged Korean officials opened an investigation into potential human rights abuses during the workers’ incarceration.

“America is not a safe place to work,” one of the workers told The New York Times, after his return home.

Production of the Ioniq 9 and smaller Ioniq 5 has proceeded apace. [Look for my fuller account of the plant, with photos from acclaimed photographer Christopher Payne, in the coming weeks.] But the opening of the battery plant, jointly owned by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, has been pushed back by at least two months. And the episode laid bare some messy contradictions, as America seeks to stand up an EV-and-battery business that can compete against China.

The Trump Administration’s Mixed Messages Confuse Investors

President Trump has demanded that foreign companies build products in the U.S., using tariffs and other strongarm tactics to secure investment pledges. That contrasts with President Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered generous incentives to manufacturers and consumers. The Trump administration has also been nakedly hostile toward EVs and most green initiatives, seeking to reverse Biden’s ambitious pollution and fuel-economy agenda, and deny the ability of California and other states to set their own greenhouse-gas standards. At the administration’s behest, the GOP-led Congress eliminated a $7,500 clean-car tax credit that ended Sept. 30. That tax break had spurred Hyundai to accelerate the Metaplant’s construction to make their EVs eligible for credits, and, over the years, had helped make EVs more affordable for hundreds of thousands of Americans. In the wary dalliance between Trump and manufacturers, there are enough mixed messages to keep a hundred dating apps buzzing.

“The Trump administration was raving about the plant, but then raided it less than two weeks later,” says Betony Jones, who served as senior advisor on labor to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Michigan’s former governor, and directed the Department of Energy’s office of energy jobs in the Biden administration. “It’s a confusing situation, and confusing for foreign investors,” she adds.

Trump insisted he did not want to “frighten off” foreign companies or their workers, including presumably the South Koreans—some of whom had helped build car, battery or semiconductor factories around the world, including in Michigan, Texas, Poland, Indonesia and the Middle East.

“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Responding to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Kush Desai, a White House deputy press secretary, said the President will support any company investing in the U.S. by slashing regulations and enabling them to bring in technical experts to set up facilities and train American workers. “Industry leaders in sectors ranging from autos to pharmaceuticals to technology have committed to investing trillions in the United States because they know they have a friend and ally in the White House,” Desai said.

Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028, a pledge that was further increased to $26 billion in August. The controversial raid comes at a fraught moment for EVs, amid slowing consumer demand and steep tariffs on raw materials and import cars, which have led many automakers to scale back electric plans and lean back into petrol-powered cars and hybrids.

The raid, Jones says, also exposed familiar fault lines in labor and manufacturing. These included ones related to workplace safety and the proper role of foreign workers, and the tendency of foreign manufacturers to locate factories in the southern U.S., where they can operate free of union labor, often at lower wages. A TV station near the Hyundai complex, WTOC, had aired investigative reports about poor safety conditions and unauthorized labor at the plant. At least three workers have died there, according to law enforcement. Hyundai has sought to distance itself from the battery portion of the Metaplant, saying none of the foreign contractors were directly employed by the automaker. Both Hyundai and LG Energy Solution have begun their own inquiries into the raid, and have vowed to follow all laws and rules, including those for workplace safety.

Deportations Renew Attention to Visa Policy

In Georgia, many contract workers had arrived on six-month B-1 visas issued for business travel, or through a visa-waiver program that allows stays of up to 90 days. Some companies, experts say, have played fast-and-loose with visa rules, in part because H-1B visas, which allow six-year stays for employees, are expensive and in short supply. Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.

“Previous U.S. administrations had largely turned a blind eye to” the visa abuses, according to The Guardian.

The Trump administration now faces criticism for its new policy to charge $100,000 for those coveted H-1B visas, which some companies say would be counterproductive, unaffordable and potentially illegal. In Georgia, some local union workers said they had been unfairly bypassed for work in the battery plant.

“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says. “So what does that knowledge-transfer need to look like? How do we pivot from foreign workers and train up a U.S. workforce that has enough specialized skills to do those jobs?”

As General Motors pivoted to EVs, it struggled to scale up battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee, in a joint venture with LG Energy to manufacture a new line of batteries called Ultium Cells. The automaker’s “Factory Zero” in Detroit — where President Biden lauded GM CEO Mary Barra in 2021, and test-drove a GMC Hummer EV in a parking lot — also suffered glitches as GM sought to rush its batteries and EVs into production. That included an incident in which a forklift pierced a stack of robotically-assembled batteries at Factory Zero, starting a fire that shut down production for a day.

The Detroit factory was the American industry’s first attempt to scale up a fully automated assembly line to make pouch-style batteries (which have since been partially supplanted by prismatic cells). GM raced to bring in outside battery consultants and executives to fix battery and assembly issues, finally hiring former Tesla battery chief Kurt Kelty to run its battery operations. It paid off: after those frustrating growing pains, GM began cranking out Ultium batteries, and is now America’s leading producer of lithium-ion cells among automakers.

Videos of the Sept. 19 incident, which circulated widely Wednesday on social media, showed the Rev. David Black of the First Presbyterian Church being struck in the head by an officer outside an ICE processing facility in a Chicago suburb. It stoked anger toward federal officers who have been deployed to the city by President Trump.

“What this clipped video doesn’t show is that these agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility—impeding operations,” McLaughlin wrote in a lengthy statement on social platform X.

“Over and over again, law enforcement ordered these agitators to move off of federal property so the vehicle could move. Law enforcement verbally warned these agitators that they would use force if they did not move and stop impeding operations. They did not comply,” she added.

McLaughlin accused demonstrators of throwing rocks, bottles and launching fireworks at the law enforcement agents on the roof. However, in the recorded clip, Black could be seen gazing at officers with open hands prior to being shot by a pepper ball.

“I invited them to repentance,” Black told Religion News Service in an interview. “I basically offered an altar call. I invited them to come and receive that salvation, and be part of the kingdom that is coming.”

“He was praying to them and they just ended up shooting him. It was like casual to them,” bystander Amanda Tovar told CNN.

“They [demonstrators] weren’t scaling a fence. They weren’t throwing any items. They weren’t even saying anything in the least that would be threatening. And that’s when they [ICE officers] just started opening fire at them,” she added.

Later in the evening, Black was again shoved and sprayed with pepper spray outside the ICE facility in Broadview, a village outside Chicago.

His treatment has been decried by residents and journalists alike who say federal officials have been threatening citizens’ safety and First Amendment rights.

The Chicago News Guild and other news organizations sued DHS and ICE on Monday in connection with allegations of excessive force used on journalists at recent protests in the area.

“Never in modern times has the federal government undermined bedrock constitutional protections on this scale, or usurped states’ police power by directing federal agents to carry out an illegal mission against the people for the government’s own benefit,” the complaint states.

Broadview officials have also sued the Trump administration for erecting an 8-foot fence around an ICE processing facility, alleging that the barrier blocks emergency services and patrons from accessing the site and surrounding businesses.

In a statement sent to NBC Chicago, the Village of Broadview confirmed that three vans carrying 45 members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the federal building late Wednesday night.

""During their patrols, Broadview police officers observed the vans parked in the rear of 2000 25th Ave. and all of the guards were sleeping,"" the statement said. ""We let them sleep undisturbed. We hope that they will extend the same courtesy in the coming days to Broadview residents who deserve a good night’s sleep, too.""

The new images come after the U.S Northern Command confirmed that approximately 500 soldiers from various units of the Texas and Illinois National Guards were activated in the Chicago area on a 60-day mission to protect federal agents and facilities.

""These soldiers are employed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,"" the U.S. Northern Command said in mission update.

Later Thursday morning, photos and video captured by NBC Chicago photographer George Mycyk captured Texas National Guard member on the roof of the facility, identified by a patch on the uniform's right arm.

City officials in Joliet told NBC Chicago they were notified Tuesday that the Texas National Guard would be stationed at the Army Reserve in Elwood, about 50 miles outside Chicago. Footage captured by NBC 5 and Telemundo Tuesday and Wednesday showed uniformed troops on the ground at the facility, along with dozens of trucks and what appeared to be fencing and mobile housing.

Local

Court filings said there are approximately 200 federalized National Guardsmen in the State of Illinois, and that the Illinois Army National Guard has been authorized to ""mobilize 300 members of the Army National Guard, who are currently mustering to ensure readiness.""

The filings, which cited a declaration signed by Deputy Commanding General for Operations for the United States Army North Command (ARNORTH), Major General Niave Knel, went on to say that Federal Protective Services requested National Guard members to support the protection of federal property in Broadview, and the Dirksen Federal Building in Chicago ""due to two high profile cases"" involving Department of Homeland Security activities.

The Broadview facility has been the site of numerous protests and tensions between activists and masked, armed federal agents, with rubber bullets and chemical agents like tear gas deployed and barricades erected.

Wednesday, federal Judge Sara Ellis said sufficient evidence exists to suggest that protesters and the press are ""at risk of injury"" because government agents had acted indiscriminately in the past.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and President Donald Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

“(We’re doing this to) keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe, (and) we’re not gonna have it any more from these thugs,” Bondi said.

Could courts block National Guard deployment in Chicago? Where things stand

Monday, Illinois filed a lawsuit hoping to block the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Chicago. The lawsuit asks a federal judge to declare the Trump administration's federalization and deployment ""unconstitutional and/or unlawful"" saying it violated the Administrative Procedures Act, a law governing how federal agencies develop and issue regulations, and ""is contrary to the Constitution of the United States.""

A similar deployment was halted by a federal judge in Oregon, as the Trump administration sought to put National Guard members on the ground in Portland.

A hearing is set for 11 a.m. Thursday Central Time.

“We’re looking for the courts to do the right thing,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker told reporters Wednesday.

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said President Donald Trump ""has exercised his lawful authority.""

The White House has maintained that Trump is trying to keep American cities and federal personnel safe. Trump said this week that if the courts wind up derailing his efforts to use the National Guard, he could invoke the Insurrection Act, which would empower him to use the U.S. military domestically, NBC News reported.

This week, a judge ordered ICE to dial back arrest tactics in Chicago, coming on the heels of a grand jury refusing to indict a Chicago couple arrested by ICE agents. In a blistering ruling Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Jeffrey Cummings said ICE has been repeatedly violating a court agreement made in 2022 in which the agency agreed to not make warrantless arrests without probable cause.

The court order in which ICE agreed to warrantless arrests with no probable cause was skirted, according to Cummings, by agents carrying blank warrant forms and filling them in on the spot. That practice was also ordered stopped on Tuesday, with Cummings extending “the agreement until February 2, 2026, which corresponds to the number of days between the date that ice unequivocally ceased its compliance.”

But some doubt ICE will follow their own agreed rules.

“Unfortunately, the Trump administration and its agencies have a record of defying court orders. We can't take anything for granted,” Sen. Dick Durbin said. “I think that clearly the President has overstepped his authority, and he is creating a chaotic and dangerous situation in Chicago and in my home state of Illinois. I hope the courts will try to stop him.""

Texas requested the Court convert its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction to preclude CMS’s enforcement of the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin.","On September 24, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas invalidated a Final Rule and accompanying 2024 Bulletin issued by CMS concerning Medicaid financing and health care provider taxes. In State of Texas, et al. v. CMS, Case No. 6:23-cv-161-JDK, Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle granted summary judgment in part for Texas, concluding that CMS’s Final Rule violated the Administrative Procedure Act because it exceeded CMS’s delegated authority under the Social Security Act.

Background

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program in which the federal government matches state contributions for medical care provided to low-income individuals. While states may impose health-care provider taxes to raise their share of Medicaid funding, those taxes cannot include a “hold harmless” provision that guarantees providers a reimbursement equal to their tax burden. This safeguard was enacted by Congress in 1991 after states developed financing mechanisms that maximized federal matching funds without additional state contributions.

Texas operates a Medicaid financing mechanism through Local Provider Participation Funds (LPPFs), which collect mandatory payments from hospitals to help finance the non-federal share of Medicaid supplemental payments. In 2023, CMS issued a Bulletin that sought to expand the interpretation of what constitutes a prohibited “hold harmless” arrangement under the Social Security Act to also include guarantees by private parties in private agreements (2023 Bulletin). In Texas v. Brooks-LaSure, 680 F. Supp. 3d 791 (E.D. Tex. 2023), Texas challenged that 2023 Bulletin, and the Eastern District of Texas issued a preliminary injunction, holding that the 2023 Bulletin violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding CMS’s statutory authority under the Social Security Act.

Despite that ruling, CMS proceeded in 2024 to publish a Final Rule and new Bulletin (2024 Final Rule and Bulletin) that largely adopted the same interpretation as the 2023 Bulletin previously rejected by the Court. The 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin implemented changes to 42 C.F.R. § 433.6, including expanding the “hold harmless” definition to cover private arrangements, and 42 C.F.R. § 430.3, requiring appeals of CMS disapprovals for State directed payments to be filed with the Departmental Appeals Board. Texas amended its complaint to challenge the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin on the same grounds raised in Texas’s challenge to 2023 Bulletin, arguing that CMS’s actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding its statutory authority under the Social Security Act. Texas requested the Court convert its preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction to preclude CMS’s enforcement of the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin.

The Court’s Decision

Similar to the Court’s previous decision regarding the 2023 Bulletin, the Court concluded that the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act. The Court held that “the Final Rule and the 2023 and 2024 Bulletins exceed CMS’s statutory authority by expanding the meaning of ‘hold-harmless provision’ to include guarantees by private parties in private agreements and by attempting to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over certain disputes.” The Court explained that the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin attempted to broaden the definition of “hold harmless” in a manner inconsistent with the statutory text.

The Court also distinguished CMS’s current interpretation from prior regulations, concluding that the agency had attempted to impose new obligations without proper statutory basis. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed its prior 2023 injunction analysis, again citing Fifth Circuit precedent that CMS may not “rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.”

As a result, the Court vacated 42 C.F.R §§ 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(G), 42 C.F.R § 438.6(c)(2)(ii)(H), and 42 C.F.R § 430.3(e), along with the 2023 and 2024 Bulletins, and enjoined CMS from enforcing the 2024 Final Rule and Bulletin. By striking down CMS’s expanded interpretation of the “hold harmless” provision, the Court preserves Texas’s current Medicaid financing structure through LPPFs.

Ochab",,,,,https://www.lemkininstitute.com/single-post/un-experts-concerned-about-mass-forced-returns-of-afghan-nationals,"More than 300,000 people have returned from Pakistan and over a 1.5 million from Iran, including 410,000 who have been deported from Iran since June 24.
Following the Iran-Israel conflict, forced returns of Afghan nationals have escalated, including those with valid documentation.
Gross human rights violations became a common occurrence yet again with atrocity crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, gender persecution and gender apartheid, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, and much more.
The Taliban have been resorting to inhumane punishments, including capital and corporal punishments, often enforced in public to terrorize Afghan population.
No government should ignore these very real dangers in Afghanistan – doing so would constitute an abandonment of their moral and legal responsibility.” The forced returns may violate the principle of non-refoulement.","On July 18, 2025, several United Nations experts, including Richard Bennett, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, Mai Sato, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Gehad Madi, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, and Paula Gaviria Betancur, Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, published a statement condemning ongoing deportations and mass forced returns of Afghan nationals from Iran and Pakistan, and other countries. As the statement indicated, “More than 1.9 million Afghans have returned or been forced to return to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan so far in 2025. More than 300,000 people have returned from Pakistan and over a 1.5 million from Iran, including 410,000 who have been deported from Iran since June 24. Thousands of the returnees are unaccompanied children. Following the Iran-Israel conflict, forced returns of Afghan nationals have escalated, including those with valid documentation. Security-related discourse has intensified anti-Afghan sentiment.” As the statement added, “Returns must be halted immediately. Afghanistan is not a safe country for returnees, given the constantly deteriorating human rights situation since the Taliban seized control, nearly four years ago.”

In August 2025, it will be four years since the Taliban took over power (on August 15, 2021). What followed the takeover can only be described as a total reversal of the progress made in the country during the twenty years of the Afghan Republic, and the return of terror. Gross human rights violations became a common occurrence yet again with atrocity crimes against ethnic and religious minorities, gender persecution and gender apartheid, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, attacks on journalists and human rights defenders, and much more. Women and girls are systematically deprived of their fundamental rights to the point that they are effectively confined to the four walls of their homes. Former security and government officials, including judges and prosecutors, those critical of Taliban policies, such as human rights defenders and journalists, as well as religious and ethnic minorities are at particular risk of reprisals and serious harms in the country, and even more so - if they are returned.

With every decision taken so far, the de facto authorities in Afghanistan ensure that there is no human rights and no viable opposition to the Taliban - so that their reign could continue without even the slightest criticism. The Taliban have been resorting to inhumane punishments, including capital and corporal punishments, often enforced in public to terrorize Afghan population. Among others, in April 2025, four men had been publicly executed as part of the Taliban’s Qisas (retribution in kind –in reference to religious law) - bringing the total number of reported public executions carried out since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021 to at least 10. Furthermore, the Taliban has been using corporal punishment, mostly lashings, often for such acts as sodomy, running away from home, and “illicit relationships.” The U.N. reported at least 213 such punishments (169 males and 44 females) since the beginning of 2025.

Afghanistan is not a safe country, and Russia formally recognizing the Taliban as Afghanistan’s government will not change this. As the U.N. experts emphasized, “Those forced to return have genuine fears for their safety and security and face very real risks of persecution, threats, and violent reprisals. No government should ignore these very real dangers in Afghanistan – doing so would constitute an abandonment of their moral and legal responsibility.”

The forced returns may violate the principle of non-refoulement. Furthermore, as the U.N. experts warned, “States, due to the sheer quantity and forceful nature of returns, cannot ensure that Afghan nationals have access to fair procedures where their individual protection needs are fully assessed. Many Afghans have experienced discrimination, mistreatment, arbitrary arrest and detention, raising serious concerns under international refugee and human rights law.”

The dire situation in Afghanistan calls for an increased humanitarian response for Afghanistan and host countries to address the international protection needs - not the opposite as recently seen. As the world is dealing with one of the worst refugee crisis in years, as exacerbated with every new conflict and situation of concerns, we cannot abandon the rules-based order designed to ensure humane responses to such situations.

The office space moves come as federal immigration enforcement operations become more visible across the state.","More than three weeks after the federal government sought offers for office space for immigration enforcement staff in Milwaukee and 18 other cities, there continues to be little information on whether a lease has been signed here and what the office's purpose would be.

The expansion comes as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement begins to make use of an unprecedented infusion of funds from Congress to carry out President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agenda. ICE's annual budget is now nearly $30 billion, and the administration plans to hire 10,000 more agents.

An online post on a federal government contracting website Sept. 16 indicated it was accepting offers for a brief time period for furnished office spaces with about 70 desks ""in support of administrative operations for law enforcement."" National Public Radio and the Washington Post reported the spaces would be used by ICE.

Spokespeople from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration, which handles real estate for the federal government, have been tight-lipped on what's happening in Milwaukee.

They did not answer questions about whether a lease has been signed, where the office would be, what the office space would be used for, or a projected timeline for opening. Local real estate brokers said it's their understanding that ICE attorneys would work in the office, although government spokespeople did not answer questions seeking to confirm that detail.

“GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration’s goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission,"" a General Services Administration spokesperson said in a statement.

A Homeland Security official responded to a reporter's questions with the following statement, and did not answer follow-up questions:

“Is it really news that when a federal agency hires more personnel that they need more space? Thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, ICE will be adding 10,000 new law enforcement professionals to our ranks, thus the need for more infrastructure to continue to Make America Safe Again.”

It is not clear whether the new office space would hold detainees, although the government's list of requirements asked for ""as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space."" It did not include any specifications that would indicate people could be held on the premises, such as secure jail cells or a secure entryway to transport detainees.

Operating hours would be 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday, with possible extensions until 8 p.m., according to the online post, indicating if detainees were to be on the premises, they would not be held overnight.

The request also calls for at least one conference room, a server room and a minimum of 11,500 square feet of office space.

Milwaukee's main ICE office, at 310 E. Knapp St. downtown, also does not commonly hold people overnight. In general in Wisconsin, ICE detainees are held at Dodge County Detention Center. Some local sheriff's offices agree to hold inmates in their jails for a handful of days while they wait for ICE agents to pick up the inmates.

ICE office on northwest side nearly ready to open

Meanwhile, a new ICE office on Milwaukee's northwest side appears nearly ready to open. Renovations had been underway for several months at the office park site at 11925 W. Lake Park Dr., which was the subject of protests in January. It had been meant to replace its Knapp Street office building, which is owned by the Milwaukee School of Engineering. Developers filed an occupancy permit application with the city, a step that means the building could be cleared to open ICE's occupancy after a city inspection.

It has not been clear whether ICE intends to operate out of both the downtown and northwest side buildings at the same time. But an MSOE spokeswoman previously said that ICE signed a one-year extension to the current downtown office lease in April 2025 as opposed to a long-term lease contract.

The office space moves come as federal immigration enforcement operations become more visible across the state. Immigrant advocates called attention to arrests of seven people Oct. 2 at one house in northeast Madison. Those arrested were construction workers, said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. Her understanding was that ICE was targeting one person and the others in the house were picked up too.

And much remains unclear about 24 people arrested by ICE and the FBI Sept. 26 in Manitowoc. Immigrants rights advocates said some agreed to be deported after they were detained. Of the six people named in a news release by the Department of Homeland Security, three were still listed online as being in custody as of midday Oct. 8.

Their connection to what the Trump administration called a ""transnational human trafficking and drug trafficking ring"" remains unclear. Advocates have said many of those arrested were dairy workers on their way to work. Most have not been charged with sexual assault or human trafficking.

One person listed as being arrested in the news release, Jose Hilario Moreno Portillo, apparently was already in jail at the time of the ICE operation, according to online court records.

The other five named individuals were listed as having convictions including identity theft, hit-and-run, disorderly conduct, driving under the influence and possession of narcotic equipment, as well as traffic offenses and a failure to appear charge. The Journal Sentinel is not naming them because they have not been charged with sexual assault or human trafficking.

Although one man is listed as having an identity theft conviction, court records in Wisconsin and Iowa do not reflect that and only list a ticket for driving without insurance in 2009, according to Wisconsin Watch.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/05/30/PMJS/83949157007-250530-local-mjsdeporthearingp-11.jpg?crop=5966,3357,x0,y700&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 11:59:29.984986

Despite expected record-high corn and soybean yields, farmers report they expect weaker financial performance in 2025 than in 2024 and have a weaker capital investment outlook.

Yet even as optimism about the farm economy is fading, support for Trump among farmers remains strong.

Back in March, 70% of farmers who answered the Purdue survey said they believed tariffs would strengthen the agricultural economy in the long run. That number dropped steeply to 51% by September. Still a large majority — 71% – continue to believe the country as a whole is moving in the right direction, and 80% believe the Trump administration is likely or very likely to give them an aid package to compensate for the damage done by tariffs and trade wars.

U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany (R-Wisconsin) reinforced this hope on the WRDN radio podcast from the World Dairy Expo in Madison last week. Tiffany, who is running for governor, was asked what he says to farmers who are “fed up” with Trump’s tariffs. He replied that Trump tariffs are not going away, but, he said of the administration, “they’re gonna use some of that tariff revenue, which is significant, to help farmers out. Because they know, I mean, President Trump has no better friends than the farmers of America.”

Trump has suggested he will unveil another farm bailout as he did during his first administration, when China responded to steep tariffs by scaling back purchases of U.S. agricultural products.

The problem with the bailout solution, says Gbenga Ajilore, chief economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and former senior adviser for rural development at USDA, is that the revenue generated by tariffs that Trump proposes to convert into handouts to farmers comes directly from the farmers themselves.

“It’s not even like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It’s like robbing Peter to pay Peter,” Ajilore said in a phone interview Wednesday. “What’s happening is that there are tariffs on a lot of goods — looking at steel, aluminum, looking at fertilizers. So farmers are paying more for their inputs. We’re seeing this impacting these companies like Caterpillar, John Deere. And so you can say there’s a lot of revenue, but it’s coming out of the pockets of consumers, businesses and farmers.”

If farmers are not already feeling seasick as the Trump administration spins the ag economy around on a cycle of tariffs and bailouts, the administration’s immigration crackdown is also making them queasy.

A panel discussion at last week’s World Dairy Expo focused on a labor shortage made worse by a Trump administration that seems hell-bent on deporting the agricultural workforce.

The recent ICE action that scooped up 24 dairy workers in Manitowoc, most of whom had no criminal records, and deportations of entire crews of legally present H2A workers in Texas had farmers who attended the discussion worried.

“Taking hard-working employees off farms does not make communities safer,” said Brain Rexing, a dairy farmer from Indiana. He described the Hispanic workers on his farm as “way more than employees. — they work together with me and my family side to side.”

Like other farmers, he said, he goes to bed at night worrying about his workers and wakes up in the morning worrying about them. Instead of threatening farmworkers with deportation, Rexing and other farmers at the Expo said, Congress should finally get around to creating a year-round visa that recognizes their essential contributions to the U.S. economy.

U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wisconsin) spoke to the group and assured them that the Trump administration has their back. He had personally spoken with Elon Musk he said. “I was like, hey, Elon, there’s two groups of people in the United States that we need to really watch out for. One of them are service members and veterans, because they gave us our freedom and keep us free. And the second one are our farmers, because they feed us. .. So he really zoned in on that and grasped it,” Van Orden said.

Another “incredibly, incredibly strong proponent of the dairy industry,” he added, “is Tom Homan.” Homan is Trump’s border czar and the architect of the family separation policy during the first Trump administration. “He was raised on a dairy farm,” Van Orden said. “So keep that in mind. There are some people in D.C. that understand what’s going on. We’re trying our best to help you. So I would just ask that you stay in the business and that God will bless you.”

It was not the most reassuring speech. But Van Orden also asked the dairy farmers in the room to support his proposal for a new system to make their workforce legal, which would impose a fine on employers and dairy workers and then require the workers to self-deport before returning to the country under a new federal program that would allow them to do their jobs legally. He introduced the bill in July and it was referred to the House Agriculture Committee, of which he is a member.

The farmers, understandably, had a lot of questions.

What was their workers’ incentive to participate? How long would it take the government to process their paperwork, remove them from the country and let them back in again? How do they know they won’t be deported as soon as they come back?

These are reasonable fears, given the terrifying scenes of ICE grabbing people off the street, busting down doors and zip-tying parents and children, sweeping up people with and without legal authorization to be in the country, whether or not they have committed any crime.

Recently, even the Trump administration’s Labor Department declared that the nation’s food system faces an emergency due to the administration’s aggressive mass deportation program, warning in a federal filing uncovered by the American Prospect that the immigration crackdown on agricultural workers has created a significant “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”

“The Department does not believe American workers currently unemployed or marginally employed will make themselves readily available in sufficient numbers to replace large numbers of aliens,” the filing states, contradicting Trump administration rhetoric about immigrants stealing American jobs.

The solution proposed by Trump’s labor department is to pay H2A seasonal agricultural workers even less — offsetting the cost to employers of a terrified workforce that is disinclined to show up to work after ICE raids.

It seems like a weird solution, as David Dayen of the American Prospect observed, “since cutting wages across the sector will likely drive existing workers to look elsewhere for jobs.”

But there is a dark logic behind the move to slash wages for agricultural workers in the midst of the moral panic over immigration. Dayen quotes Antonio De Loera-Brust of the United Farm Workers, who sees a government threatening mass deportations working hand in glove with employers who benefit from a powerless immigrant workforce.

“We call it the ‘Deport and Replace’ strategy,” De Loera-Brust said, “which is defined above all to make it easier for corporate agribusiness to exploit its workers, whether terrified undocumented residents or an unlimited pool of cheap foreign guest workers … The Trump administration would rather expand the abusive H-2A program than do right by the workers who are already here, feeding America for decades.”

This situation does not directly apply to Wisconsin dairy farms, since dairy workers are not eligible for H2A visas. But it was not at all clear from Van Orden’s remarks at the World Dairy Expo that he understands that fact.

“The H2A program is broken and it sucks. There you go. That’s the whole press conference,” he said after he was introduced. Later, he referred to “all this garbage you’ve been dealing with, these H2As and H2Bs” insisting his own proposal for a new visa system would work better. In fact, dairy farmers are not dealing with the H2A (seasonal) or H2B (non-agricultural) visa systems at all.

Van Orden did acknowledge the difficult situation for the dairy industry, which depends on a labor force 60% to 90% of which is made up of immigrants who lack any sort of legal authorization to be in the country, since there is no such thing as a year-round visa for low-skilled work.

“Rocks are heavy. Trees are made of wood. Gravity is real. If we deport every single person that is working in the agriculture industry, the hospitality industry and the construction industry, all of those industries will shutter in a moment’s notice,” Van Orden declared.

But it’s unclear if his plan, the Agricultural Workforce Reform Act of 2025, will help.

One farmer asked if his workers would be barred from returning to the U.S. if they committed a traffic violation (a common concern in Wisconsin, where immigrants without legal papers cannot get a driver’s license). Van Orden fobbed him off, saying that would be a question for the executive branch to resolve through its rule-making process.

Several farmers listening to Van Orden affirmed that they supported Trump’s goal of securing the border, but added that they thought that mission had been accomplished. Now they hoped the administration would turn its attention to a new public safety issue — the threat mass deportations pose to the U.S. food supply.

Farmers across the country seem inclined to give the Trump administration the benefit of the doubt. But the doubt is growing.

“Farmers are getting it in so many ways; their exports are down, their costs are up, and they’re losing their workforce,” said Ajilore, the former USDA economist. Given all that, farmer sentiment “actually hasn’t really moved as much as you would expect, given what’s happening,” he said. He attributes it to a wait-and-see attitude among farmers who have faithfully supported Trump for years. But now, he added, “the impact is starting to really hit home.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_8884-2048x1536.jpeg,N,,2025-10-09 11:59:36.245021

She estimates the number of detainees in ICE custody at the facility has risen from about 60 in July to more than 100 as of Wednesday.","A second man has died in Missouri while in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Leo Cruz-Silva, 34, originally from Mexico, was being detained by Festus police after his Sept. 30 arrest for public intoxication, according to a statement released late Wednesday by the federal agency. He was transferred to ICE custody on Oct. 1 and sent to the Ste. Genevieve Detention Center two days later.

After one day in the jail, Cruz-Silva was dead.

He was found unresponsive in his cell on Oct. 4 in what ICE said appeared to be a suicide. Jail staff attempted CPR until paramedics arrived, but neither group was able to revive him. The Missouri State Highway Patrol is investigating the death. The Ste. Genevieve County Sheriff’s Office, which operates the jail, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Cruz-Silva’s death marks the second reported suicide in ICE custody in Missouri in recent months — and is at least the 15th detainee death nationwide so far in 2025, according to data on the agency’s website.

In April, Brayan Garzón-Rayo, a 27-year-old Colombian man living in St. Louis, was found unresponsive in his Phelps County Jail cell. His mother said it appeared to be a suicide. Records later showed ICE had not followed its own medical protocols before Garzón-Rayo attempted to take his own life.

Like Garzón-Rayo, Cruz-Silva did not have legal status in the United States and had already been deported twice — in 2010 and 2020.

“I'm very disappointed that we weren't able to assist him,” said Susie Johnson, a board member with Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve. The volunteer group helps ICE detainees contact family members and obtain basic toiletries. The group noticed Cruz-Silva’s name in the jail’s online communication system but hadn’t yet been in contact with him.

“We have to do a lot of work to identify who was in our jail as an ICE detainee, and sometimes that takes a couple days,” Johnson said. ”It’s just a tragedy for our community.”

Abide in Love-Ste. Genevieve will hold a vigil for Cruz-Silva at 7 p.m. Sunday in front of the Ste. Genevieve County Detention Center.

Heightened enforcement

Johnson said she is concerned about the growing number of ICE detainees being held in Ste. Genevieve under a contract as part of the Trump administration’s intensified immigration enforcement efforts. She estimates the number of detainees in ICE custody at the facility has risen from about 60 in July to more than 100 as of Wednesday.

Trump’s immigration crackdown has drawn widespread attention for the federal government’s forceful actions in Democratic-led cities such as Chicago and Portland. On Wednesday, the president called for the jailing of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for “failing to protect ICE.” Speaking to reporters, Pritzker responded, “Come and get me.”

In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe activated the state’s National Guard late last month to assist ICE agents with administrative, clerical and logistical support through September 2026 after weeks of speculation. Fifteen volunteers signed up for the mission, but hours after Kehoe’s announcement, the federal government shut down.

The Missouri National Guard volunteers will continue working with ICE facilities across the state without pay.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deployed armed agents supported by Blackhawk helicopters and several unmarked trucks to raid an apartment building in the South Shore area of Chicago last week.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that ICE agents collaborated with several other law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). A total of 37 individuals were arrested. DHS accused them of being involved in drug trafficking, armed crimes, and immigration violations.

Separate lawsuits, filed Oct. 8 in federal court, allege Isaac Elias and Katherine Melson were arrested without probable cause and without being read their Miranda rights, subjected to excessive force and denied legal counsel before being arraigned. The lawsuits also claim the arrests, made as Elias and Melson protested police activity, violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly.

Joe Askar, solicitor for the borough, said he is reviewing the filings and declined to comment.

Aftermath of an ‘intense’ operation

Interviewed over the summer, Ambridge Police Chief John DeLuca referred to the operation as a “saturation patrol,” involving multiple local and federal forces, and “not an ICE detention roundup.” He said the department would work with ICE when asked, though it doesn’t have a formal contractual agreement.

ICE agents, aided by Ambridge police, the Beaver County Sheriff’s office and at least one Pennsylvania State Police officer, arrested individuals across town over the course of several hours the night of July 31. Observers and response volunteers crowded outside the police station.

Elias witnessed 12 arrests targeting suspected immigrants and, according to the complaint, began marching the perimeter of the Ambridge police station holding a homemade sign that read “No Justice, No Peace” and chanting “Shame!”

The Ambridge operation followed protests across the country as immigrant communities and advocates denounced ICE’s increasingly forceful tactics under President Donald Trump. In the Pittsburgh area, immigration-related arrests soared in the first six months of his administration

Observers in Ambridge said the arrests disrupted the Beaver County river town that’s home to a growing Latino community. Some suspected racial profiling, pointing to a traffic stop of a young Latino couple earlier in the night.

Jaime Martinez, community defense organizer at Casa San José, said at the time, “This is the most intense thing we have ever seen.” Martinez leads a network of volunteers trained to respond in real time to ICE sightings, arrests and raids in an effort to document federal agents and deter a reported increase in civil rights violations under the Trump administration.

Melson and Elias told Public Source that their lawsuits help give voice to those arrested by ICE and draw attention to how a national issue is affecting the local community.

“The people who were taken that night aren’t afforded the ability to hold police and elected officials accountable,” Melson said.

Forceful arrests alleged

Elias was arrested around 10:40 p.m. and later charged with disorderly conduct, unreasonable noise and resisting arrest. A magisterial judge dismissed the charges for both Elias and Melson after they completed 25 hours of community service.

Melson and her wife joined observers outside the police department shortly before Elias’ arrest. The complaint states, after arresting Elias, officers directed Melson and others to step back another 10 to 15 feet because officers were taking someone into custody.

Less than a minute later, officers Michael Longo and John Chickos arrested her, according to the filing. She claims no other bystanders around her were arrested, despite also not stepping back after police orders.

While in custody, the filing states, Chickos used repeated force by “throwing her around” and pinching under her arms, leaving bruises. Another unidentified officer kicked her, according to the suit, and she was strip-searched at the Beaver County Jail.

She claims she repeatedly asked for legal counsel, but was not permitted to contact a lawyer. Later, according to the lawsuit, an attorney representing Melson called the police department, and was told by an officer she could not speak with her client. He said Melson’s charges were “not just disorderly,” though he refused to tell her what the charges were, according to the lawsuit.

Melson was ultimately charged with obstruction of administrative law, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and harassment.

Elias’ lawsuit states Ambridge Sgt. Sokheng Seng pulled Elias’ arm outside the normal range of motion, causing an “involuntary jerking” during the arrest. Elias claims he suffered physical injury, pain and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit.

Protecting the right to protest

Especially in a small town, Elias said, people should be able to trust that police will protect them.

“It’s important that somebody helps to keep the law enforcement folks within the law,” he said. “People that do [go to protests] should be able to exercise their rights.”

According to the lawsuit, Elias was also not given a reason for his arrest and was told by jail officials he was not “permitted” to have an attorney present at the arraignment per “jail policy.”

The lawsuit also states that Elias’ sign was confiscated and that he was arrested for the “purpose of chilling his First Amendment rights and in retaliation for his exercise of those rights.”

Christine Elzer, the attorney representing Melson and Elias, said peaceful protest is one of the most “fundamental” rights in the United States and that arrests like theirs are a “threat to free speech everywhere.”

Zia Yusuf (Head of Policy at Reform UK) addressed the same question, but his response appeared to have a somewhat different emphasis.
I mean, look, will we get legal challenges to Nigel’s entire agenda.
The Devolution (Immigration) (Scotland) Bill 2024 – 2025 provides a recent precedent for such a challenge.
Conclusion As we have seen, various legal challenges could arise against a Reform UK government’s immigration plans in the context of devolution.","Reform UK’s announcements on immigration and asylum have generated a lot of attention of late. While challenges and objections are expected, little has yet been written on what these challenges might be. This post considers some hypothetical scenarios in the context of devolution, reflecting on some recent examples. A point central to this analysis is that while immigration law and policy is fast-moving and complex, so too is devolution. And the two are intertwined.

Reform UK recently revealed their plans in a series of press conferences, building on their 2024 manifesto. On 26 August 2025, the party unveiled ‘Operation Restoring Justice’. Their plans were reiterated at The Next Step conference on 5 September and on 22 September, the party announced their latest policy, ‘Prioritising UK Citizens’. Among other plans, Reform UK proposed abolishing the right to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (‘ILR’) under the current system. The system is made up of numerous sources, including a ‘labyrinthine’ set of Immigration Rules (which there has been a call to simplify), numerous statutes, as well as a large volume of secondary legislation and case law. Indefinite Leave to Remain is a status within the system laid out in section 33(1) of the Immigration Act 1971. The routes to, and qualifying period for, ILR can vary. Simply put, where someone is granted ILR, they have a permanent right to reside in the UK after 5 years of residency (though Labour has recently proposed changes to this timeframe). This right is generally without restriction as to the time on a person’s stay or employment in the UK, and a person has access to the same welfare benefits as UK citizens, such as access to the NHS. Revoking ILR would represent a significant change to current immigration law and policy across the UK.

During the Conference on 22 September, Nigel Farage MP (Leader of Reform UK), responded to a question about the possible legal challenges which might emerge from this. He said:

Will we be free from legal challenges, well, of course, having cut out the HRA and the European Court in Strasbourg, British Courts will be free to make judgments that are the right judgments, which they are not at the moment. We are not for a minute pretending that going back through the backlog is an easy thing to do. It will be complex, it’ll come in many forms, but we do intend to address it.

Nigel Farage stressed the scale and complexity of the plans being proposed. Zia Yusuf (Head of Policy at Reform UK) addressed the same question, but his response appeared to have a somewhat different emphasis. Acknowledging the likelihood of legal challenges, he said “Completely agree. I mean, look, will we get legal challenges to Nigel’s entire agenda. Yes…”.

But what are likely to be the location or nature of potential challenges, both legal and political?

Scenario 1

A devolved government could request a transfer from a Reform UK government of powers relating to immigration, which is a reserved or (as the devolution settlement applies in Northern Ireland) excepted matter. In the Scottish example, Devolution Guidance Note 14 states this could be achieved via primary legislation or a Section 30 Order.

The Devolution (Immigration) (Scotland) Bill 2024 – 2025 provides a recent precedent for such a challenge. This was a Private Members Bill introduced by a member of the SNP in April 2025 into the UK Parliament. The Bill proposes to amend the Scotland Act 1998 to grant legislative competence to the Scottish Parliament regarding immigration. Indeed, in July 2025, the Scottish Government signalled its desire that immigration be devolved in response to the UK Immigration White Paper 2025: “…the only way for Scotland and other devolved governments to ensure that the immigration system is reflective of their needs would ultimately be through the devolution of those powers.”

However, the current UK government does not appear likely to consent to such a position. It has also very recently been reported the Scottish Government’s position has changed (see this release following a Freedom of Information Request). The Bill might, therefore, be ‘dropped’ unless it’s carried over to the next Parliamentary session. While the most significant and long term changes to the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament have been made through primary legislation, it must be remembered only a minority of Private Members Bills become law in any case. Far fewer still do so without the support of the government.

There have also been a number of requests for, and examples of, Section 30 Orders being granted by the UK Government/Parliament which change whether a matter is reserved. However, this process does not reserve specific functions, but instead describes subjects in broad terms, where legislative competence has been reserved by the UK Parliament. The transfer of responsibility for the entire immigration system therefore seems unlikely in practice (as recently debated in Parliament). The procedure is also uncertain, requiring collaboration between the devolved and UK governments and, ultimately, political will. A Reform UK government would be under no legal obligation to grant a Section 30 Order. Whilst modifications via primary legislation only require approval from both Houses of the UK Parliament, a Section 30 Order would additionally require the consent of the Scottish Parliament, with either having a ‘veto’.

For these reasons, this scenario seems unlikely to materialise if a Reform UK government were to gain power.

Scenario 2

We could see a devolution and immigration issue being tested at the Supreme Court if Reform UK were to gain power. A ‘Bill Reference’ could be made to the Court under its devolution jurisdiction by either the UK or one of the devolved government’s law officers under sections 32A and 33 of the Scotland Act 1998. A recent example of this phenomenon was Reference by the Lord Advocate [2022] UKSC 31. In this case the Scottish government in effect asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the Scottish Parliament could legislate for another independence referendum independently of Westminster. The Court ultimately ruled it could not. Consequently, a similar reference could be made if any legislation proposed by a Reform UK or devolved government fell within either the competence of a devolved legislature or was related to a reserved matter. As the Devolution (Immigration) (Scotland) Bill 2024 – 2025 is in its early stages, a Bill Reference is currently precluded as a Bill must have passed all stages short of royal assent. However, this is an example of the kind of Bill we might see challenged. Indeed, any kind of Bill from any one of the devolved governments seeking control or influence over immigration policy might be subject to a challenge. Perhaps, more feasibly, devolved governments politically opposed to a Reform UK government at Westminster might seek to extend the legislative competence of a legislature or clarify the scope of a reserved power of the UK Parliament around the edges of immigration policy with regard to human rights. In this case, we might well expect challenges through the courts to ensue.

Scenario 3

According to the Sewel Convention, the UK Parliament will not normally legislate on a devolved matter without the consent of the devolved legislature. Here, it is important to keep in mind what areas are reserved and devolved. If a Reform UK government introduced draft legislation which made provision for devolved purposes, the consent of a devolved legislature is required. It is unclear, though, whether consent would be required if draft legislation put forward by a Reform UK government related to a reserved matter (immigration) that applied to the whole of the UK (the geographical extent of a Bill), but that also had major practical effects on areas which the devolved parliaments are responsible for (its territorial application).

If a devolved government objected to such a Bill, it would be expected to lodge a legislative consent memorandum declining consent. This can be seen in examples of legislative consent motions from Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland in the context of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill 2025 proposed by the UK Government.

However, even assuming any ambiguities around devolved and reserved matters are resolved, the Sewel Convention is only a political convention (R v Miller [2017]). A Reform UK Government could therefore, in the absence of consent, fall back on the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty if it were to attempt to, for example, repeal the Human Rights Act 1998. Indeed, when responding to a question during annual party conference this year on the legal basis for Reform UK’s plans, Zia Yusuf stressed, “Parliament is sovereign…and with primary legislation that will be the legal basis”.

While the Sewell Convention appears to be on a stronger footing now than it was under previous governments, it seems unlikely the Convention alone would be enough to hold back Reform UK’s immigration plans as they might apply to devolved areas.

Conclusion

As we have seen, various legal challenges could arise against a Reform UK government’s immigration plans in the context of devolution. Legally speaking, the position seems clear – the balance of power in the UK’s constitutional arrangements means any such challenges are ultimately likely to be unsuccessful. However, despite claims to the contrary by party leaders at Reform UK, implementing their immigration plans in the face of opposition from devolved governments is likely to prove anything but straightforward.

Trump is now staffing the agency with armed law enforcement agents to make arrests.

(Originally published by the ACLU)

In an effort to weaponize an agency that provides pathways to legal immigration, the Trump administration is arming the United States Citizenship Immigration Services (USCIS) for the first time since the agency was created.

Under new regulations published in September, USCIS special agents will be allowed to make arrests, carry firearms, and execute search and arrest warrants. This is the latest effort in Donald Trump’s agenda to systematically restrict legal immigration and strip people of their legal status. The administration’s goal is to redeploy as many parts of the federal government as possible to serve a mass deportation system that will detain and remove as many people as possible.

USCIS Is Not an Immigration Enforcement Agency

USCIS is a federal agency that oversees lawful immigration. It decides whether to grant immigration applications and petitions, including applications for green cards, work authorization, asylum, citizenship, and more.

Before USCIS was created, one agency was responsible for most aspects of U.S. immigration law, including carrying out immigration enforcement and deciding immigration benefits. When Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, it separated these duties into three separate agencies: USCIS was created to focus exclusively on deciding immigration benefits, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were charged with law enforcement duties. Congress deliberately separated these functions to allow USCIS to more efficiently and effectively adjudicate immigration benefits, stating that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could not recombine these functions in one agency.

Keeping USCIS separate from ICE and CBP also helped to ensure that people felt comfortable coming forward and applying for immigration benefits. By blurring these lines, the Trump administration is hoping to make it harder and more intimidating for people to apply for and obtain benefits that they are eligible for under U.S. law. This move will also redirect USCIS resources away from deciding whether to grant immigration benefits, and towards supporting ICE. Applications and petitions will languish and processing times will increase. All of this is by design—this administration intentionally keeps immigrants in more vulnerable immigration statuses to limit their rights and make it easier to deport them.

Trump Weaponizes Federal Agencies for Mass Deportations

The Trump administration is using this new rule to bypass Congress and turn USCIS into another arm of ICE. It goes hand-in-hand with other recently announced USCIS policies that seek to restrict access to immigration benefits and undermine legal immigration. For example, USCIS has announced several new policies that, if implemented, will make it harder for qualified immigrants to access citizenship and may stall naturalizations on a large scale. The agency has also instituted hurdles for naturalized citizens seeking to register to vote. Under another new policy, USCIS will deny benefits to people it decides may support “anti-American” ideologies or activities.

Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller has weaponized agency after agency to carry out his mass deportation agenda. For example, the Department of Justice stated it would prioritize stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans. The administration has co-opted the military: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has deployed members of the military and used Department of Defense resources for immigration enforcement. ICE has aggressively recruited local police and sheriffs, convincing over one thousand department leaders to forgo local safety priorities and become an arm of its deportation machine. DHS has even deputized Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officers to help immigration enforcement, and attempted to force the IRS as well as Medicare and Medicaid to share information with DHS for immigration enforcement purposes.

USCIS Policy Changes Undermines Citizenship and Silences Immigrants

Turning USCIS into an enforcement agency is another blatant attempt to stigmatize and harm people who are immigrants—including long-time residents who are American, in every way but on paper. USCIS’s recent policy changes undermine the very bedrock of our democracy by keeping people from seeking legal status and citizenship. If immigrants cannot access citizenship and other immigration benefits, we risk having an underclass of people subject to the whims of this administration’s loyalty tests and able to be exploited. Just look at Miller’s plans to deprive noncitizen children of education and deny citizenship to American-born children.

The Trump administration is erasing our history as a nation of immigrants and attempting to rewrite what it means to be an American by intimidating immigrants, pushing them into the shadows, and silencing dissenters.

These attacks are a reminder that our undocumented neighbors and loved ones deserve a path to citizenship. They are raising families, paying taxes, and working to make our nation thrive. They should not have to live in fear of deportation.

Since taking office on January 20, 2025, the Trump administration has pursued an unprecedented mass deportation agenda. U.S. officials have adopted a range of new tactics to achieve this objective, including expanding the use of expedited removal, sending people from the United States to offshore detention facilities in the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo, terminating protected legal statuses, disappearing people without due process – including to a high security prison in El Salvador, and forcibly transferring individuals to other countries of which they are not citizens. These actions, many of which have been determined to be unlawful by federal courts, have been carried out with little to no transparency, while thousands of peoples’ lives are uprooted from communities across the country, families separated, and their rights are systematically violated.

ICE Flight Monitor responds to this lawlessness and lack of information by using publicly available aviation data to monitor and document flights conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), including deportation flights and domestic transfers between U.S. detention centers and deportation staging facilities. The methodology is grounded in Tom Cartwright’s nearly six years of independent work that tracked tens of thousands of ICE flights. To ensure the accuracy and integrity of the findings, ICE Flight Monitor cross-references flight data with public records, media reports, and observations from trusted partner organizations. The project also tracks other relevant air operations—such as military planes involved in immigration enforcement and Mexican and Panamanian government deportation flights. ICE routinely carries out a small number of additional removals on commercial flights, which ICE Flight Monitor is unable to track.

ICE Flight Monitor reports the following top findings for September 2025:

Record Number of Total U.S. Immigration Enforcement Flights Under the Trump Administration Amid Increased Number of ICE Air Planes. U.S. immigration enforcement flights continue to increase significantly under the second Trump administration. From January 20 to September 30, 2025, the administration conducted at least 8,877 total U.S. immigration enforcement flights. These include removal flights, removal-related flights, and domestic transfer (“shuffle”) flights. The majority of these flights are carried out by ICE Air charter planes, but a small number are carried out on Air Force cargo planes, Coast Guard aircraft, or airline carriers operated by other countries. The 8,877 total is the largest number of immigration enforcement flights for the period of January 20 – September 30 since tracking began in 2020, and constitutes a 62 percent increase over the same time period in 2024 (see Figure 1).

In September 2025 alone, ICE Flight Monitor recorded at least 1,464 U.S. immigration enforcement flights—the highest monthly total to date, averaging 49 flights per day. As Trump escalates his deportation campaign, the number of these related enforcement flights continues to surge, raising significant due process concerns regarding the underlying legality of these mass enforcement actions. During the first three months of his administration (January 20 to April 20), there was a monthly average of 723 flights. This contrasts sharply with the recent average of 1,371 flights per month between July and September 2025. On U.S. immigration enforcement flights, individuals are nearly always restrained by handcuffs, waist chains and leg irons, including during any layovers and fuel stops. The harsh conditions during enforcement flights raise serious human rights concerns.

As ICE Air Continues to Expand Its Operations, Domestic Transfer Flights Hit Record in September, Alongside Heightened Interior Enforcement and Detention Rates. A significant portion of U.S. immigration enforcement flights include domestic transfer (or “shuffle”) flights, which move individuals between detention centers and deportation staging facilities across the United States. The Trump administration has sharply increased domestic transfer flights as part of ramped-up interior enforcement—a shift from the Biden administration’s focus on removing individuals who recently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border. From January 20 to September 30, 2025, the administration has carried out 5,322 shuffle flights—a 53 percent increase from the same period in 2024—including a record 969 flights in September. Notably, there was a monthly average of 851 domestic “shuffle” flights between July and September 2025, compared to a monthly average of 437 flights during the first three months of the Trump administration (January 20 to April 20)—an increase of 95 percent. The rise in flights in September is enabled by ICE Air expanding its operations by adding a new subcontracted charter carrier and beginning to use new planes through existing carriers– such as Avelo Airlines and Eastern– starting in mid-September.

September Marks Monthly Record Number of Removal Destination Countries. In September, removal flights remained high, with at least 223 flights to 48 countries—the highest number of destination countries recorded in a single month (See Figure 2). Flights to Mexico dropped sharply to just nine in September, down from a record high of 72 in August, an outlier month when flights to Mexico accounted for 30 percent of the 240 total removal flights for the month. Removal flights to countries other than Mexico reached a record 214 in September—up from 168 in August—reflecting a 27 percent surge in flights. This had to do with an increase in multi-country routes, where a single flight carries out removals to various countries. Within Latin America, this included 55 flights to Guatemala, 55 flights to Honduras (a record high), and 10 to Nicaragua (another record high). In addition, there were an unprecedented high number of flights to Sub-Saharan Africa (18 flights) and East, Central, and South Asian countries (11 flights). In contrast, military removal flights dropped significantly from 17 in August to just three in September, indicating greater reliance on ICE Air aircraft for removals.

First Removal Flight to Iran Via Transfer in Qatar Marks Expansion of Effort to Carry Out “Layover Transfer” Removal Flights to Countries with Strained Diplomatic Ties. On September 30, ICE Flight Monitor tracked an ICE Air removal flight reportedly carrying 55 Iranians to Qatar, where they were transferred by authorities to the custody of Iranian authorities. They were then put on a chartered Qatar Air flight—also monitored by ICE Flight Monitor—and subsequently deported to Iran. The flight is said to be part of a broader U.S.-Iran agreement to deport up to 400 Iranian nationals in the coming months. The agreement reflects a growing effort by the Trump administration to facilitate removal flights to countries where the United States lacks diplomatic relations and where serious human rights concerns persist. The group of individuals on this deportation flight was reported to include political dissidents, a Christian convert, and others who had sought and been either denied or prevented from seeking asylum in the United States due to the range of asylum restrictions implemented by the Trump administration.

ICE Flight Monitor also tracked two flights in June and August 2025 that involved the transfer of detained Russian nationals from the U.S. government to Egyptian government custody in Cairo, Egypt. Recent reports indicate that Russian nationals aboard those two flights were subsequently forcibly returned by Egyptian authorities to Russia, including individuals who had been detained in the United States for over a year after seeking asylum. In addition, from February to August, ICE Flight Monitor has also tracked 20 U.S. removal flights to Venezuela that included a transfer to a Venezuelan carrier in Honduras, which accounted for 40 percent of total removal flights to Venezuela in that period.

Forced Third-Country Transfers Continue with First Flight Carrying non-Ghanaians to Ghana. On September 5, ICE Flight Monitor tracked the first third-country removal flight to Ghana–which took place on a C-17 military cargo plane. This flight occurred due to a bilateral agreement in which Ghana agreed to accept third-country nationals—primarily West Africans—removed from the United States. This is part of the Trump administration’s effort to pursue agreements with countries to facilitate forced third-country transfers—which send individuals to countries of which they are not citizens and often have no ties. In previous months, third-country removal flights were carried out to Rwanda, Eswatini, South Sudan, Uzbekistan, El Salvador, Panama, and Costa Rica. The legality of these transfers—particularly without notice or an opportunity to contest the transfer based on fear of persecution—is currently being challenged in U.S. federal courts.

As of October 1st, No Migrants or Asylum Seekers Remain Detained at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Offshore Detention Facilities. Notably, as of October 1, 2025, no migrants and asylum seekers remain at the offshore detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base (GTMO), where the Trump administration first began to transfer individuals from detention centers in U.S. territory in February 2025. Since then, there have been a total of 89 flights to GTMO, a number of the flights continued on to removal destinations while other flights transferred individuals to and from U.S. territory. In the past two months, there has been a decreasing number of migrants and asylum seekers detained at the base, which is reflected in the flight patterns. Only six flights took place in August and five flights in September, a significant decrease from the record high of 19 flights that occurred in July, which all carried individuals from U.S. territory-based detention centers to be detained at GTMO. A flight on October 1 returned the final remaining 18 individuals to the Alexandria, Louisiana ICE hub.

These findings make clear that the Trump administration’s current deportation campaign is unprecedented and dangerous—not only to the rights of those it targets, but also to our democracy.

Since Jan. 20, 2025, immigrants in Los Angeles, Boston, and other major United States cities have faced a sharply altered law enforcement landscape as the Trump administration and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement expand interior operations and detention. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court’s emergency orders have narrowed relief timelines and expanded the powers of the executive branch.

Immigration attorneys and immigrant families reported to the Harvard Independent that ICE’s presence has become invasive, with families fearing separation from their children, unfair arrest, and even leaving the house as federal lawsuits against “sanctuary” policies and a broader detention footprint reshape daily life.

“There’s a sense of panic right now,” a Harvard Law student who works at the Harvard Law School Immigration & Refugee Clinic said. “It’s causing so much downstream distress.”

Due to new orders from the Supreme Court, immigration lawyers have been forced to change their practices since the start of Trump’s second term. Under the revised practice, the Court dictates whether individuals can remain with their families during their proceedings. Recent emergency orders have shortened windows and broadened enforcement discretion. This has made litigation feel like a race against the clock, especially for clinics juggling dozens of clients across multiple courts.

“Our work has been defined by uncertainty and fear,” an immigration attorney from Massachusetts who requested anonymity due to sensitive client information said. “It’s very difficult for folks to wrap their heads around what’s happening when everything is moving so quickly, and it kind of seems like there’s a new policy to grapple with every week, if not every day.”

The American Immigration Council explains how state and city sanctuary policies are rooted in “the idea that the federal government cannot force jurisdictions to take part in immigration enforcement.” On the ground in Los Angeles and Boston, legal battles are increasingly over how much power sanctuary policies hold. The United States Department of Justice sued both cities in June and September 2025, arguing that local limits on cooperation with civil immigration enforcement obstruct federal power.

California went through this same legal battle in 2018.

“The Trump administration has sued California already for its sanctuary policies in the first Trump administration,” Professor Jean Reisz, the Co-Director of the University of Southern California Immigration Clinic and Clinical Associate Professor of Law, said. Eventually, these policies were “held by the court of appeals to not be in violation of federal law,” she continued.

While legally these cases have shown that Washington D.C. can’t force local officers into federal programs, they also reflect how local governments cannot obstruct ICE.

“Sanctuary is a bit of a misnomer, because you can’t really protect somebody in your community who you know is subject to arrest by ICE,” Reisz explained. “ICE has the ability to go into places and arrest people and you can’t obstruct it, but you don’t have to help, and you can make it difficult.”

These policies have directly impacted Massachusetts. “ICE raids have definitely picked up in Boston a lot,” the student at the HLS Clinic said.

“Massachusetts is one of the places that’s been most heavily targeted for enforcement, and that’s been happening since at least May of this year,” the immigration attorney added.

The effects of these operations are reflected in an increase in arrests throughout the country. As of September 2025, over 60,000 people were in ICE custody, with roughly 70% having no criminal convictions. ICE’s recent annual report put the average stay at 46.9 days. Yet clinics routinely report clients held for months, some for even more than a year. These timelines impact everything from keeping separated parents from their children to halting a detained immigrant’s necessary medical care while their bond request sits unheard.

“In the beginning, when the raids started happening in Los Angeles, I think that a lot of the detention facilities weren’t prepared for the influx of people, and there were issues with getting medication, food, water,” Reisz said.

Conditions in custody are not uniform, and that variability has become a central point of contention. Watchdog reports, lawsuits, and medical workers have described serious gaps in some facilities, such as delays in medication, shortages of clean water, sleep deprivation, and limited access to counsel.

“[Detention facilities] aren’t prisons that have programming and other kinds of opportunities for inmates—which I know that sounds crazy. It’s like the prisons might have better conditions than the detention facilities,” Reisz said.

The picture that emerges is uneven and hard to verify, especially as people are moved among facilities or out of state with little notice to families.

“Something that’s become more and more common in recent months is that when someone gets detained, often their family doesn’t have any information about where they are or if they’re okay for days, because the ICE online locator doesn’t get updated and the person isn’t given a phone call at the ICE field office,” the immigration lawyer from Massachusetts explained.

“You’ll hear about people going out to work in the morning and just not coming home at the end of the day. Maybe their family finds someone who saw or heard what happened, or maybe they find the person’s car on the side of the road, but apart from that, they have no information,” the lawyer continued.

“It’s like their loved one has just disappeared. Then, after a few days, the person pops up in the system, and they’re in a detention center halfway across the country. Can you imagine that happening to your dad or your brother, or your partner? You can’t put into words the devastation families are facing every day in Massachusetts.”

Meanwhile, the geography of custody has stretched internationally. On Oct. 2, ICE transferred the last migrants out of a detention center in the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay. The administration initially intended to hold tens of thousands of detainees at the site, drawing scrutiny from rights groups that reported abusive conditions during short-term holds before deportation. It totaled 700 migrants before they were relocated to other sites.

Venezuelan men described being sexually assaulted and forced into sexual acts after the administration sent them to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, telling NBC News they experienced physical and psychological torture. Clinic lawyers now prepare clients for a wider range of possibilities and brace families for the unexpected.

“They’re often classified foreign relations information that isn’t publicly available. So I can’t say much about whether or not I would even call CECOT an international detention facility,” Reisz said.

New policies are also changing how families engage with healthcare. In a nationally representative Urban Institute survey, 38% of mixed-status families reported taking “protective steps” like seeking legal advice or making a detention plan because of anticipated enforcement.

Doctors are finding that people who have been assaulted, or who have serious conditions like diabetes or a high-risk pregnancy, are skipping or delaying care out of fear of ICE. In the KFF/LA Times “Survey of Immigrants,” 22% of immigrant adults reported skipping or postponing care in the prior year. A parent who hears of a potential ICE raid must weigh symptoms against the possibility of being detained for weeks if something goes wrong.

For now, clinics in Los Angeles, Boston, and beyond will keep doing what they have always done under pressure. Policy debates will continue in Washington and in federal courts from California to Massachusetts. But the stakes are in the lives these lawmakers touch.

“It’s really important not to look away [from] what is happening. This is something that is happening every single day,” the immigration attorney said.",https://i0.wp.com/harvardindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICE-scaled-e1759987068660.png?fit=1267%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-09 10:57:31.488254

Israel and Hamas overnight agreed on the initial terms of a deal to exchange the Israeli hostages and around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Gazans detained by Israeli forces in the coming days. Hamas has confirmed the deal, but a Palestinian source told BBC News that they have yet to receive a list of Palestinian prisoners Israel would free in the exchange. An Israeli official said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his cabinet today to sign the agreement, which would then mark the start of the formal ceasefire.

The IDF told CNN that the tanks were firing “smoke bombs to keep people away from our forces.” The Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry in Gaza urged people “to exercise caution in the final hours before the ceasefire goes into effect in order to ensure their safety.” Ibrahim Dahman and Eyad Kourdi report.

A “formal declaration” ending the war in Gaza must be made in order for the hostage exchange to take place in the coming days, a senior Hamas official said today. “This is what the Israelis have signed up to,” he said. “This is not a ceasefire. It is a declaration to end the war.” Mostafa Salem, Abbas Al Lawati, and Eyad Kourdi report for CNN.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Shortly after announcing the Israel-Hamas deal, President Trump told Axios that he is “likely going to Israel in the coming days,” to speak to the Knesset. Trump said he had a “great” call with Netanyahu yesterday, adding “[Netanyahu] is so happy. He should be. It is a great achievement.” Trump also said that under the deal, the hostages would “likely” be released on Monday, and that his administration is “forming a council of peace” to maintain a lasting end to the conflict. Barak Ravid reports; Kaanita Iyer report for CNN.

The U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Tom Fletcher, today called for the immediate delivery of 170,000 tonnes of food, medicine, shelter, and other supplies to Gaza. “Let’s get the hostages out and surge aid in – fast,” Fletcher said. Nick Cumming-Bruce reports for the New York Times.

More than 54,600 children under the age of 5 in Gaza may be acutely malnourished, according to an UNRWA-funded study published in The Lancet yesterday. “Tens of thousands of preschool aged children in the Gaza strip are now suffering from preventable acute malnutrition and face an increased risk of mortality,” Dr Masako Harino, the study’s lead scientist, said. Jonel Aleccia and Sarah El Deeb report for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

A bipartisan War Powers Act measure to stop Trump’s strikes on alleged drug vessels in the Caribbean failed 48-51 in the Senate yesterday, despite Republican Sens. Rand Paul (KY) and Lisa Murkowski (AK) joining Democrats in supporting the measure. “The U.S. should not be blowing up boats without even knowing who’s on them. There’s no due process in that – no names, no evidence, no oversight,” Paul said yesterday on social media. Stephen Neukam and Stef W. Kight report for Axios.

“Indications show that the last boat bombed” by the United States in the Caribbean sea “was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside of it,” Colombian President Gustavo Petro said yesterday on social media. He did not provide evidence backing the claim. A White House official told Reuters that “the United States looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement.” Nelson Bocanegra and Alexander Villegas reports.

Qatar is trying to act as a mediator in the conflict between the United States and Venezuela, according to three sources. The sources said that Qatar’s efforts have been welcomed by the Venezuelan government, but that the Trump administration is more focussed on military operations than diplomacy.

U.S. officials have yet to comment. AP News reports.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

White House officials have held meetings this week that increasingly seriously considered whether Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops inside the United States, five sources told NBC News. A senior official said that a decision to invoke the act is not imminent and that the broad consensus among Trump’s aides is to exhaust all other options first. Two other sources said the debate has shifted from whether to invoke the act to when and how to invoke it. Courtney Kube, Katherine Doyle, Carol E. Lee, and Garrett Haake report.

Trump yesterday called for Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D) to be imprisoned for failing to protect ICE agents. “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a black man unjustly arrested,” Johnson responded on social media. “I’m not going anywhere.” Pritzker said in an interview, “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.” Joseph De Avilia, Mariah Timms, and Bob Tita report for the Wall Street Journal.

Texas National Guard Troops started “actively protecting federal personnel and property,” in the Chicago area yesterday evening, according to a U.S. Northern Command spokesperson. Several hundred people marched in Chicago yesterday protesting the deployment of the troops. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times; Emily Schmall, Susan Heavey, and Daniel Trotta report for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

The Internal Revenue Service said yesterday in an internal memo that federal workers are required by law to be paid for the furlough period during a government shutdown. The letter from Acting IRS Human Capital Officer David Traynor to IRS employees confirms that they will be paid on “the earliest date possible.” Avery Lotz reports for Axios.

FBI Director Kash Patel this week fired two agents who were identified as having worked with Jack Smith, the special counsel who led the federal investigation into Trump, according to two sources. The sources said that the two agents had not been formally accused of misconduct, nor were they subject to investigation. Patel cited Article II of the Constitution and his right to fire anyone without cause. Gleen Thrush and Alan Feuer report for the New York Times.

The Defense Department plans to enforce new policies that “appear designed to stifle a free press,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement yesterday. “The policy conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone” within the DoD, “even suggesting it’s criminal to speak without express permission,” the press association said. Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Pope Leo XIV yesterday told U.S. bishops that they should firmly address how immigrants are being treated as a result of the Trump administration’s policies, according to attendees at the meeting in the Vatican. Pope Leo “expressed his desire that the U.S. Bishops’ Conference would speak strongly on this issue,” El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz told Reuters. Joshua McElwee reports.

A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that ICE’s use of blank warrants for making arrests can only be used as a basis to arrest someone who has already been given notice to appear before an immigration judge. The ruling, which stems from a consent decree struck by the Biden administration in 2022, is confined to Chicago and will expire in February. Matthias Schwartz reports for the New York Times.

A federal grand jury yesterday elected not to indict two individuals charged with assaulting federal law enforcement officers at a protest outside an immigration facility in Chicago last month. “Obviously they didn’t have enough for a ham sandwich here,” said a lawyer representing one of the protestors, adding that the failure to secure an indictment was “highly unusual.” Ernesto Londoño reports for the New York Times.

The majority of people ICE has arrested nationwide do not possess criminal convictions, according to Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University.","WASHINGTON — Agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have arrested more than 3,000 people in New Jersey since President Donald Trump took office, the ninth-highest total of any state in the country.

Flush with about $170 billion in new funding from a Republican-written budget law, the Department of Homeland Security has set a goal of deporting 1 million immigrants annually.

From Jan. 21, the administration’s first full day in power, through July, ICE agents have arrested 137,944 people, according to data from the Immigration Enforcement Dashboard, an independent research project.

Of that national total, 3,201 people were arrested during that period in New Jersey. ICE arrests peaked in June at 802 before slowing to 727 in July.

In all of 2024, ICE arrested 2,959 people in New Jersey.

These figures, obtained by a separate group called the Deportation Data Project, provide a glimpse into day-to-day operations at DHS, which does not provide updated arrest statistics.

Asked for comment Wednesday, Chrissy Cuttita, a spokesperson for ICE’s Newark field office, referred to a webpage of arrest data that had not been updated since last year.

The Deportation Data Project, a group of academics and lawyers, obtains immigration data, often through the Freedom of Information Act, a federal law that allows the public to request government files and sue for them, too.

Texas, where the administration has expanded its immigration detention footprint, is the state with the most ICE arrests to date, 28,214, as of July.

Two populous states, Florida and California, follow with 12,877 and 10,120 ICE arrests respectively.

New York and Pennsylvania also rank in the top 10 states for ICE arrests from Trump’s first full day in office until July: 4,576 and 2,951.

Nationally, arrests peaked at 30,390 in June, before dropping to 23,617.

The majority of people ICE has arrested nationwide do not possess criminal convictions, according to Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University.

As of Sept. 21, about a third — 34% — of people ICE had arrested and detained had been convicted for criminal charges.

“For the first time since the start of the current Trump administration, immigrants with no criminal convictions make up the objectively largest group of people arrested and detained by ICE,” Kocher said in an analysis of immigration statistics.

“According to the latest data, 16,523 immigrants in detention have no criminal charges or convictions, now the largest of these groups—a significant increase since the previous data points, while those with charges and convictions remained static,” Kocher said. “By contrast, the number of people in detention with criminal charges and convictions is actually down over the past month.

The ongoing federal government shutdown has not halted arrests by ICE or other DHS agents. The overall department has roughly $170 billion it can access, thanks to a new federal law that cut domestic health, food and climate programs and increased spending on the military and hardline immigration policy.

In writing that law, Republicans in Congress also capped the number of judges who can hear immigration cases at a given time at 800, who already face a mountainous backlog of about 4 million cases.

The Pentagon is targeting Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Burlington County for immigration agents to hold then deport, by airplane, a minimum of 1,000 to as many as 3,000 undocumented immigrants.

Donald Norcross (D-1st) and Herb Conaway (D-3rd), have told NJ Spotlight News they have received minimal information on specific plans to use the base for immigration purposes.",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2025/10/AP25164253655668-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 11:59:45.708129

The UK unequivocally condemns all forms of racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia, and remains steadfast in its commitment to tackling these injustices.

Regarding resolution L28. Rev 1, whilst we appreciate the efforts of the resolution’s sponsors, the UK wishes to place on record that, had it been a member of the Human Rights Council, it would not have been able to support the resolution.

The UK reaffirms our commitment to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action (or “DDPA”). Yet, its provisions do not alter the established legal principle against retroactive application of international law in matters of State responsibility. The resolution’s language must remain within the scope of the DDPA.

The UK fully acknowledges the profound and enduring legacy of historical injustices, including colonialism, slavery, and the transatlantic slave trade. The UK remains committed to constructive engagement and continued dialogue.

The UK also commends the OHCHR’s support to the DRC. However, references in both DRC resolutions to “hate speech” and Article 20.2 of the ICCPR are problematic.

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) prohibits the incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. For accuracy, therefore, we ask that the Secretariat corrects the translation of “discours d’incitation a la haine” to “incitement to hatred” in the resolutions.

Rather than the merits of the case, Wednesday’s Supreme Court arguments focused on whether that lawsuit was filed in time.
The state Supreme Court will now decide what happens next.
But it’s not a wrong committed against MIRC, giving rise to independent cause of action for MIRC,” Fish told Supreme Court justices.
That would likely come up if MIRC wins at the Supreme Court on Wednesday’s arguments over timing.","An immigrant workers’ compensation lawsuit against the governor went before the Michigan Supreme Court Wednesday.

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center claims the state is creating more work for it by wrongly denying workers’ comp claims for people without legal status. The nonprofit says that’s because private-practice firms will no longer take on those cases, and so they filter to MIRC.

“We receive call after call from injured undocumented workers who are tremendously suffering, struggling to make ends meet to feed themselves and their families because they can’t access this basic assistance for wage loss after they’ve been severely injured at work,” MIRC attorney Anna Hill Galendez said.

The group claims the burden caused it to hire another employee in 2019. MIRC sued over the matter in 2021.

Rather than the merits of the case, Wednesday’s Supreme Court arguments focused on whether that lawsuit was filed in time. State law provides a one-year period to sue the state in most cases.

Speaking before the court, Assistant Attorney General Gallant Fish said even though the denial policy continues, the lawsuit is too late since the harm happened in 2019.

“MIRC has not alleged ongoing series of wrongs committed against MIRC, giving rise to independent causes of action for MIRC,” Fish said.

MIRC rejected that argument, its lawyers claiming instead that the harm is ongoing since the workers’ comp denials continue to increase the group’s call volume.

Speaking in the lobby outside the court after oral arguments, attorney David Muraskin, representing the immigrant rights center, said the governor is avoiding the substance of the case.

“She has delayed for years … by claiming immunity. And what she has done before this court is try to skirt that issue and say, ‘Well this is really an issue of procedure,’ and dodge the implications of all her arguments"" in lower courts,” Muraskin said.

The trial court that first heard the case decided it could go forward. The state Court of Appeals decided it should have been dismissed.

The state Supreme Court will now decide what happens next. If MIRC prevails, the case would go back to the lower court for further proceedings.

“Our hope is that we immediately go from the Court of Appeals to the trial court, the Court of Claims, to get the merits decided and then can, hopefully, vindicate the rights of undocumented workers which then would have to proceed back up. But with those rights protected,” Muraskin said.

The merits of the case that still need to be worked out in court include whether the state is properly using the 2003 state Supreme Court decision Sanchez v. Eagle Alloy, Inc., to deny claims.

MIRC argues the state is not because of federal and state decisions that have come later. It likens the situation to the state attempting to enforce defunct anti-sodomy laws even though the U.S. Supreme Court has declared them unconstitutional.

The state, however, argues MIRC doesn’t have standing to sue.

“There might be wrongs in the general sense that MIRC has alleged. If Sanchez was wrongly decided, then that’d mean denial of benefits under Sanchez would be, in some sense, a wrong. But it’s not a wrong committed against MIRC, giving rise to independent cause of action for MIRC,” Fish told Supreme Court justices.

The Court of Appeals never addressed the standing question in its opinion. That would likely come up if MIRC wins at the Supreme Court on Wednesday’s arguments over timing.

Summary

This week’s Parsing Immigration Policy podcast examines the Trump administration’s initiative to temporarily detail military lawyers -- Judge Advocates General (JAGs) -- to serve as temporary immigration judges, with the first group beginning training this week.

Host Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, is joined by Andrew Arthur, the Center’s fellow in law and policy and a former immigration judge, to discuss the legal, practical, and political implications of the move.

Key points include:

The U.S. immigration court system currently has about 650 permanent judges; the addition of 100 JAGs as temporary judges could significantly expand capacity, with the administration aiming to add hundreds more.

The Department of Justice has had mechanisms since 2014 to appoint temporary immigration judges.

Most JAGs lack immigration law experience, but Arthur notes that immigration courts often focus on determinations of removability and eligibility for relief -- areas where experienced litigators can adapt quickly.

New judges receive a week of formal training and two weeks of supervised hearings, similar to what Arthur himself received.

The episode also addresses the multiple due process safeguards, the backlog impact, and whether the move raises concerns under the Posse Comitatus Act.

In his closing commentary, Krikorian discusses the government shutdown and the debate over healthcare for illegal immigrants, referencing a recent CIS blog post by Jason Richwine, “Of Course Illegal Immigrants Access Public Health Benefits”. He notes that the budget dispute is real but distracts from a broader truth: Illegal immigrants access public health programs through multiple channels, benefits that will continue regardless of how the shutdown is resolved.

Host

Mark Krikorian is the Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

Guest

Andrew Arthur is a Fellow in Law and Policy at the Center for Immigration Studies.

The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce “hard evidence” that the vessels were carrying drugs.

The administration has not explained why it has blown up vessels in some cases, while carrying out the typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs at other times, one of the officials said.

The Republican administration, in a retroactive memo justifying one of the strikes last month, declared drug cartels to be “unlawful combatants” and said the United States is now in an “armed conflict” with them.

The declaration has raised stark questions about how Trump intends to use his war powers. It also has been perceived by several senators as pursuing a new legal framework to carry out lethal action and has raised questions about the role of Congress in authorizing any such action.

Trump administration points to videos as proof

Asked about the lack of underlying evidence provided to Congress, the Pentagon on Wednesday pointed to videos of the strikes, which do not confirm the presence of drugs.

The Pentagon also noted public statements by Hegseth, including a social media post following the latest fatal strike in which he said, “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”

Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or even detailing which criminal organizations it claims as “unlawful combatants.”

Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said Wednesday that he and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in a classified briefing this week, were denied access to the Pentagon’s legal opinion about whether the boat strikes adhered to U.S. law.

His comments came at a confirmation hearing for Joshua Simmons, a top legal adviser to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to be the CIA’s next general counsel. At the hearing, Simmons refused to say whether he had partaken in any deliberations over the targeting of cartels in the Caribbean, saying any legal advice he gave Rubio or other U.S. officials would’ve been confidential.

Attorney General Pam Bondi was pressed at a Senate hearing Tuesday about what advice she's provided Trump to legally justify the strikes. She said, “I’m not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may or may not have given or issued at the direction of the president.”

A White House official suggested that lawmakers were being disingenuous with their criticism and that the Trump administration has been “much more forthcoming” with the legal rationale than Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration was when it carried out strikes targeting militants in the Middle East.

The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Pentagon officials have held six separate classified briefings to Congress on the operations.

Trump administration officials have argued that the strikes are necessary acts of self-defense as cartels funnel drugs into the United States that they say are leading to thousands of U.S. deaths. While Venezuela produces cocaine, the bulk of it is sent to Europe.

A few in the administration are said to be driving the push for strikes

Trump has largely bypassed traditional interagency processes in formulating his strategy to carry out strikes against drug cartels, according to the U.S. officials and a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

A small group of top administration officials — including Rubio, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Trump aide Stephen Miller — has driven the push to carry out the fatal strikes, officials said.

Rubio, dating back to his days in the Senate, has advocated for taking a harder line on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.”

Trump has focused attention on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which he claims is serving as “front” for Maduro, and said members of the gang were in the first boat targeted last month. No details on alleged affiliations have been released in the three other strikes.

Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term in January despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won by more than a two-to-one margin.

A pause in diplomacy

Early in his term, however, Trump dispatched special envoy Richard Grenell to Caracas to meet with Maduro. Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed by Maduro's government during Grenell's visit.

But diplomatic efforts with Caracas have been largely paused in recent months, with Grenell mostly sidelined, said the person familiar with the matter and a congressional aide, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Maduro says the boat strikes are an attempt to undercut his authority and try to foment unrest that would lead to his ouster from power.

The State Department pushed back against the notion that the administration had been involved in anything other than an operation targeting drug traffickers.

“Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans and we want to see him brought to justice,” said Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman. “The U.S. is engaged in a counter-drug cartel operation and any claim that we are coordinating with anyone on anything other than this targeted effort is completely false.”

Just blocks away, Portlanders who spoke with KGW on Tuesday were completely unfazed.

Streets around the ICE facility remained taped off Wednesday morning following the visit of U.S. Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. Alongside Portland police, city contractors removed the camp where protesters like Lillian had been staying for weeks, keeping up their presence outside.

""This is not fair,"" Lillian said. ""Now they took all our stuff, and all our stuff is missing.""

The encampment was cleared due to ongoing public safety concerns in the area, according to a spokesperson for Portland police. They said that criminal activity has been associated with the site, and it was blocking the public right-of-way.

""We take really good care of this place; we pick up our garbage,"" Lillian countered.

Just around the corner, the Portland Bureau of Transportation spent Wednesday morning turning South Bond Avenue into a two-way street, allowing drivers a way to skirt the ICE building.

""The hardest thing we've dealt with is the fact that people are having a hard time getting to the Spaghetti Factory to come enjoy a meal,"" said Gary Sheperd, senior general manager at the Old Spaghetti Factory, just down the street from the ICE facility.

Between the protests and the police blocking off streets around the ICE building, Sheperd said it's been hard for the longtime Portland restaurant to do business.

""It made it very difficult to serve lunch; we were very slow for our lunch business — ended up yesterday for dinner closing early because of it,"" Sheperd said.

Some who work at businesses near the ICE building said they didn't want to go on camera for fear of retaliation but said they've experienced repeat vandalism since the protest begin.

In the windows of an apartment building just across the street from the ICE building, signs declare that they aren't associated with ICE and plead against vandalism.

""It's just tragic that the whole thing is happening,"" said David Vala, who lives across from the ICE facility, in that same affordable housing complex.

With the protest camp cleared and Portland police cordoning off the block immediately in front of the ICE building, protesters have been pushed right underneath Vala's balcony, he said.

""Before Kristi Noem showed up, all the protestors were right at the ICE building,"" he said.

""Yeah, we're just going to post up over here, and we're going to spread like wildfire,"" said Lillian. ""We're going to try and get more people over here because we're mad.""

The situation here has made life difficult for people like Vala in the day-to-day.

""The sound, the anger, the people with the bullhorns, they just shout profanities,"" said Vala. ""Sleep, rest, pretty much anything — I'm impacted day and night. ... It's just kind of a sadness, what our country has fallen into.""

REACH Community Development, which operates the apartment building with the signs in the windows, responded to KGW's inquiry with a statement.

""Law-abiding residents of Gray's Landing are directly in harm's way and are suffering the consequences of tactics used by federal agents around the ICE building,"" a spokesperson said, in part. ""Recent events, including tear gas and late-night altercations, have been deeply stressful for our community, and the signage reflects our efforts to maintain calm, prevent harm, and preserve a sense of security.""

Mayor Rory Hoskins told the Review that the village’s Oct. 8 statement reporting the update comes at a time when the number and intensity of incidents at the Broadview ICE detention facility are increasing.

“There’s a lot of confusion about what’s happening,” Hoskins said. “We wanted to show the residents that were cognizant of their concerns and that we’re closely monitoring the situation.”

Hoskins said there may have been a recent incident involving ICE at Rush Oak Park Hospital and local officials are trying to confirm if federal agents detained a worker at Concordia Cemetery on Oct. 7.

In the village statement, Forest Park officials said that, under the Illinois TRUST Act, village police are prohibited from helping with federal immigration enforcement. Police are trained in the requirements of the act.

“Our officers are here to protect and serve the community, not to enforce federal immigration laws,” officials said in the Oct. 8 statement. They added that, when residents call 911, village police respond without ICE involvement and will not ask about immigration status or detain a resident because of that.

According to the statement, village officials are collaborating with neighboring communities to ensure that their communities are informed about the nearby presence of ICE.

Hoskins said that, though he hasn’t yet been to the Broadview ICE facility, he recently stood at a press conference with Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson. He said he’s a part of an active group chat with other local mayors, where they discuss reports of ICE activity and their veracity.

Hoskins said Forest Park police officers have, on about four occasions over the past couple weeks, responded to Broadview mutual aid requests to provide help with traffic or crowd control measures around the nearby ICE facility.

Though there was activity at the long vacant, former Armed Forces Reserve Center building at 7402 Roosevelt Rd. last month, the property is just undergoing construction before the Illinois National Guard moves in, likely next year.

Hoskins said the village has reached out to the Illinois National Guard to see whether the building will be used as the National Guard is reportedly deployed to the Chicagoland area.

“They tell us that, as of now, there are no plans to use that for the current National Guard call-up, but those things can change in a heartbeat,” Hoskins said. “We’re closely monitoring what happens there and we have a plan in case there’s activity in Forest Park.”

Hoskins added that the village’s emergency operations team is in the loop about the locations of federal agents and has close contact with local law enforcement agencies and the Cook County Office of Emergency Management and Regional Security.

U.S. District Judge April Perry will hear arguments over a request to block the deployment of Illinois and Texas Guard members. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and local officials strongly oppose use of the Guard.

An “element” of the 200 Texas Guard troops sent to Illinois started working in the Chicago area on Wednesday, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Northern Command, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity in order to discuss operational details not been made public. The spokesperson did not say where specifically the troops were sent.

The troops, along with about 300 from Illinois, arrived this week at a U.S. Army Reserve Center in Elwood, southwest of Chicago. All 500 troops are under the Northern Command and have been activated for 60 days.

The Guard members are in the city to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings and other federal facilities and law enforcement personnel, according to Northern Command. Trump earlier sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington, and a small number this week started assisting law enforcement in Memphis.

Those troops are part of the Memphis Safe Task Force, a collection of about a dozen federal law enforcement agencies ordered by Trump to fight crime in the city. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee supports using the Guard.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

Chicago and Illinois have filed a lawsuit to stop the deployments, calling them unnecessary and illegal. Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime, though statistics show a significant recent drop in crime.

The Republican president said Wednesday that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Pritzker, both Democrats, should be jailed for failing to protect federal agents during immigration enforcement crackdowns.

In a court filing in the lawsuit, the city and state say protests at a temporary ICE detention facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview have “never come close to stopping federal immigration enforcement.”

“The President is using the Broadview protests as a pretext,” they wrote. “The impending federal troop deployment in Illinois is the latest episode in a broader campaign by the President’s administration to target jurisdictions the President dislikes.”

Also Thursday, a panel of judges in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was scheduled to hear arguments over whether Trump had the authority to take control of 200 Oregon National Guard troops. The president had planned to deploy them in Portland, where there have been mostly small nightly protests outside an ICE building. State and city leaders insist troops are neither wanted nor needed there.

U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut on Sunday granted Oregon and California a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment of Guard troops to Portland. Trump had mobilized California troops for Portland just hours after Immergut first blocked him from using Oregon's Guard.

The administration has yet to appeal that order to the 9th Circuit.

Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term, rejected the president's assertions that troops were needed to protect Portland and immigration facilities, saying ""it had been months since there was any sustained level of violent or disruptive protest activity in the city.”

Protesters gathered at Congress Plaza, 520 S. Michigan Ave., on Wednesday before marching north on Michigan Avenue and eventually turning back toward the Loop at Trump Tower, 401 N. Wabash Ave. Elected officials and activists spoke to a crowd frustrated with how federal officials have — against the wishes of local elected officials and many residents — increased immigration enforcement activity in the area and worked to deploy National Guard troops.

Ald. Jesse Fuentes (26th), who a federal agent handcuffed Friday at a hospital, spoke at the rally to cheers.

“As your alderperson, not just of the 26th Ward because every Chicagoan matters, I will make sure that we utilize every legislative tool at our disposal to slow ICE down to protect our neighbors,” Fuentes told the crowd.

Jason, a teacher in a predominantly Latin-American community who declined to share his last name for safety reasons, turned out for Wednesday’s march and said he personally knows U.S. citizens who ICE agents have detained.

“In my community where I teach, there’s kids not coming to school for a month at a time because they’re scared of what can happen to them,” he said. “I’m overwhelmed with blinding anger and depression for the people who are being affected.”

Jason said he also attended a protest at the ICE facility in suburban Broadview and knows several people who federal agents brutalized there.

“They shot my friend in the face,” he said, referring to the non-lethal rounds and chemical agents that have regularly been used by immigration authorities in Broadview. “Luckily, they were wearing goggles — but I can’t imagine what would’ve happened if they weren’t. I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Protesters chanted, “Donald Trump, you stupid clown; ICE ain’t welcome in this town.”

Bicycle convoys of police officers accompanied the crowd as protesters marched.

The march was organized by a broad alliance of progressive organizations under the Coalition Against the Trump Agenda, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, the Chicago Teachers Union and United Working Families.

The protest was the latest way Chicagoans have rallied against the immigration enforcement operations.

In September, ICE and Border Patrol launched operations Midway Blitz and At Large, which are supposed to focus on arresting and removing undocumented immigrants with serious criminal histories.

But over the past month, federal agents have shot at least two people, killing one; repeatedly tear-gassed protesters and first responders; shot rubber bullets at protesters; detained U.S. citizens, including children; handcuffed a Chicago alderperson in a hospital; smoke bombed and tear-gassed a Chicago street; fired a chemical weapon at a TV reporter and detained a journalist, among other incidents.

Many local protests have been centered around the Broadview facility. Trump’s administration has said National Guard troops are needed to protect ICE officials and facilities.

But officials have expressed concerns about the Trump administration taking control of the National Guard — deployments are typically only done at the request of a state’s governor — and forcing federal troops into Illinois against the wishes of elected leaders and residents.

Chris Purdy is an Army National Guard veteran who now heads up the Chamberlain Network, which organizes veterans around issues of democracy and human rights. He said it’s “incredibly uncommon is for guards to be federalized over the objections of a state governor.”

“These are school teachers, mechanics, firefighters,” Purdy said of the guardsmen. “They are not federal law enforcement. If they wanted to do that, they would have.”

And without any meaningful guidance, how is anyone on either side of the immigration process supposed to identify it?
Because if they have it vague, then they can say that somebody can be disqualified for any reason they want,” said Pittsburgh-based immigration lawyer Adam S. Greenberg.
“The anti-Americanism policy really kind of flows from the antisemitism policy.” Mehta said he’d attended multiple naturalization interviews since the announcement and had not seen it come up.
The guidance does not specify how exactly government adjudicators would assess applicants for “anti-American” sentiment, though there are some concerning clues in other recent immigration actions.","In August, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that adjudicates and grants immigration benefits like visas, residency, and naturalization, put out a bizarre three-page policy alert. Among other things, it noted vaguely that the agency would scrutinize applicants who “support or promote anti-American ideologies or activities” and “enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, including the use of discretion, to deny the benefit request.” Effectively, it instructed evaluators to deny people engaged in anti-Americanism, which it did not define there or elsewhere.

What is anti-Americanism? What are those “ideologies or activities,” exactly? And without any meaningful guidance, how is anyone on either side of the immigration process supposed to identify it? Maybe the imprecision is the point. Three weeks on, practitioners tell The Verge that it is almost impossible to figure out how to advise clients on this standard or properly prepare for it. “The problem that I have been stating is that it’s entirely pretextual anyway, that having something be this vague is not a bug, it’s not a problem, it’s exactly what they’re going for. Because if they have it vague, then they can say that somebody can be disqualified for any reason they want,” said Pittsburgh-based immigration lawyer Adam S. Greenberg.

In one potential indication of where the administration could draw the line, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that people “praising, rationalizing, or making light of” Charlie Kirk’s assassination could be denied visas or stripped of status without pointing to any specific authority. The uncertainty “creates an environment of self-censorship where people delete their accounts or delete their posts or simply do not post things because they’re worried that they will have to report them to the government and that the government may read them and it might influence their immigration status in the future,” said Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“Fear about whether this would impact applications has been around for a while, since March or even earlier, with the administration’s antisemitism policy,” said New York-based immigration attorney and scholar Cyrus Mehta, referencing the administration’s earlier announcement that it would screen applicants’ social media for supposedly antisemitic content. “The anti-Americanism policy really kind of flows from the antisemitism policy.”

Mehta said he’d attended multiple naturalization interviews since the announcement and had not seen it come up. Still, clients remain on edge and lawyers bewildered. “I don’t know how it’s going to be applied. It might be applied more vigorously, and I think it’s far more insidious than the antisemitism … It’s really vague, it’s really broad.” He said that his and many other attorneys’ belief in free speech “is totally antithetical to the advice that one may have to give to clients.”

Keeping immigration policies broad and discretionary to confuse applicants has been a penchant of Donald Trump’s going back to his first term. The public charge rule, for example, threatened immigrants with status denial over extraordinarily subjective analyses of their risk of becoming dependent on public assistance, which could take into account not just existing but hypothetical future use of benefits like food stamps. Ultimately, I’ve never heard of anyone denied status specifically on the basis of the expanded public charge analysis, at least in part because it was only briefly in effect before it was blocked by a federal judge during covid. Nonetheless, a 2024 report by the Urban Institute found widespread reluctance among immigrant and mixed-status families to use safety net benefits they were entitled to, including some that were state and local and would not have been part of the public charge calculus.

The idea at least in part was for people to overcorrect, and overcorrect they did. Now, Trump officials are doing the same but for speech. This is not the first immigration effort targeting what very much seems like protected speech, following the now-notorious detention of former Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil and others involved in campus protest and activism, which shocked observers earlier this year. This does, however, seem far more expansive, and comes on the heels of Homeland Security and the State Department announcing that visa adjudications would require applicants to both share all their social media handles and set their accounts to be publicly visible, which together suggest that online criticism of the administration could now effectively be an obstacle to status. “It has clearly altered behavior. A lot of people say, ‘Well, I make sure that I don’t post anything.’ I’ve never really had that reaction before,” said Mehta.

The guidance does not specify how exactly government adjudicators would assess applicants for “anti-American” sentiment, though there are some concerning clues in other recent immigration actions. In April, the administration abruptly began mass-terminating thousands of student visas across the country before just as abruptly reversing course as it faced dozens of lawsuits and court losses. It soon emerged in court that administration officials had simply run international student information data through a federal crime information database and then directed the terminations without ever confirming if the data was accurate or if identified students had actually committed offenses that could trigger loss of status. Activists and lawyers worry that a similar approach could be used to identify supposed anti-American ideology.

“We can make guesses based on the half-assed technical implementations that the Trump administration has made since February. Especially the behavior of DOGE is usually to essentially create enormous troves of data and merge them all together in a deeply undifferentiated way,” said Galperin. “You get a lot of extremely inaccurate or useless data, and then either just do a search for incendiary keywords — which is how you end up getting funding pulled for talking about transitions or transgenic mice — and then there’s just feeding the entire thing into AI and having AI make the determination, or have AI write a summary, which, again, you are feeding garbage into a garbage machine that will then spit out more garbage.”

USCIS did not respond to a list of detailed questions, including how it defined anti-Americanism, what criteria it was giving its adjudicators, and if it would use any automated tools to evaluate applicants.

At least the students with canceled visas were able to pursue legal action on the basis that the government obviously lacked any real rationale to attempt to terminate their status. When it comes to the initial issuance of benefits like work and student visas or even permanent residency, the government under the law gets quite a fair bit of leeway, and doesn’t always have to explicitly lay out the reason for a denial. That opens up the possibility that applicants could be denied on this anti-American basis and not even know it.

“Adjustment [to permanent residency] is discretionary. Extensions of status are discretionary. Waivers are discretionary. They don’t have to provide their reasoning,” said Greenberg. While a federal court could in theory point out that a denial violates the First Amendment, there are limited avenues for people to actually appeal these decisions or get clarity on why they were denied, especially at consulates abroad.

On March 13, 2025, Leqaa Kordia, a 32-year-old Muslim Palestinian woman, voluntarily met with Department of Homeland Security agents after she learned she was being investigated by immigration authorities. She was immediately detained and transferred from New Jersey to Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, far from her family.

Ms. Kordia was in the process of obtaining legal permanent residency in the USA. She came to the attention of immigration authorities after her arrest at a protest in 2024 outside of Columbia University against Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip. The charges were later dismissed in the interests of justice.

Ms. Kordia’s arrest and ongoing arbitrary detention are a part of the continued attacks on human rights by the Trump administration. Targeting peaceful protesters and threatening their immigration status for the content of their protest, such as advocating for the human rights of Palestinians, is a violation of the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. This targeting sends a chilling message to people across the country that anyone exercising their human rights will be subject to repression, detention, and possible deportation. For immigrant communities already living in fear throughout the U.S., they are now only further pushed into the shadows with fear that they could be deported for speaking out.

Leqaa Kordia has suffered violations of her rights to practice her religion while detained in Texas. She poses no threat to the public or flight risk and is a caregiver for family members in New Jersey. She should be released immediately to her family.

Cummings also imposed reporting requirements for ICE to share how many people are being arrested in the Chicago area without a warrant.

""Collateral arrests"" or people arrested while ICE agents are patrolling the street, often without a previously signed warrant, have been a major tactic deployed during the local immigration enforcement crackdown branded ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

Now, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings has imposed limits on when agents can make those kinds of arrests as part of an extended consent decree that will last until Feb. 2, 2026.

Cummings also imposed reporting requirements for ICE to share how many people are being arrested in the Chicago area without a warrant.

In an emailed statement, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, ""DHS complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.""

The ABC7 I-Team has been following this case closely after attorneys with the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC) and the ACLU of Illinois accused DHS and ICE in March of violating the 2022 Castañon Nava settlement after the warrantless arrest of 26 individuals during the first weeks of President Donald Trump's second administration.

Those kinds of arrests have ramped up significantly in the last month, said NIJC attorney Mark Fleming.

""What we have seen now to a much larger scale is federal agents indiscriminately stopping and arresting people without warrants and without probable cause required by federal immigration laws,"" Fleming said on Wednesday.

The Castañon Nava consent decree or settlement applies to ICE arrests in Illinois and five neighboring states. It was named after the original plaintiff in the 2022 lawsuit, Margarito Castañon Nava.

While the remedies ordered by Cummings apply only to the six-state region of the Chicago Field Office, the NIJC said the consent decree's policy applies nationwide.

According to the Castañon Nava settlement, ICE agreed to certain conditions for arresting someone in the Chicago area without a warrant, including pre-determining whether there is probable cause to believe the person is in the country illegally, and whether they are also a flight risk; two requirements that immigrant advocates say have been flouted in at least 200 documented cases, according to Fleming.

Among the plaintiffs arrested unlawfully by ICE this year and cited in the NIJC's case is 47-year-old Abel Orozco-Ortega, a father who was arrested on Jan. 26 after living in the U.S. for nearly 30 years, his family previously shared with the I-Team.

Orozco-Ortega has no criminal history, his attorneys told the I-Team, only a removal order from 2004 after he visited his father in Mexico and returned to the country without applying for asylum or citizenship.

""He was the main provider,"" said Eduardo Orozco, Abel's son, earlier this year. ""He was the one who paid all of the bills and bought all of the food and everything. So having him gone, it's hard.""

As the I-Team previously reported, according to ICE's arrest report for Orozco, which was provided to the I-Team by his attorney, agents did not have a warrant for him at the time he was detained.

In fact, after pulling Orozco over and detaining him, agents eventually realized they had the wrong person.

Agents ""reviewed the [ original ] target's case and observed that the date of birth was not consistent with the [ driver's license Orozco ] provided,"" the report states.

The ICE agents' warrant was not for Abel Orozco, it was for his oldest son, the report notes. But after checking DHS systems and finding a decades-old removal order for the father, agents prepared a new warrant on the spot after carrying blank warrant forms for such an occasion.

ICE agents were taught how to do this at the ICE Academy, according to attorneys for the NIJC and as seen in training materials shared with the I-Team.

An attorney representing DHS had previously argued this training was lawful, and that even though agents carried blank warrants, an agent supervisor was required to sign it.

In his order, Judge Cummings noted ICE's legal arguments for carrying blank warrant forms for collateral arrests are ""meritless,"" and in the case of Orozco's arrest, the warrant issued after he was detained was ""invalid.""

ICE records show Orozco remains in federal custody at a detention facility in Kentucky.

The NIJC says it will seek the release of hundreds of people they claim were unlawfully arrested, including men arrested during a raid in Elgin where Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was present, and a family detained in Millennium Park last month.

All those arrests are examples of what Cummings ruled is an ongoing pattern of ICE violating the terms of the consent decree.

""If they [ ICE ] made a warrantless arrest, they need to justify and document the specific information justifying that warrantless arrest,"" Fleming said during a Wednesday news conference.

ABC7 Chief Legal Analyst Gil Soffer says the government is likely to appeal the ruling.

""We'll see if it changes operations on the ground. [ Cummings ] is certainly sending a shot across the bow,"" Soffer said. ""If it's going to be abided by... that's going to slow things down and really impose rigor around the process.""

The order requires all immigration officers who violated the consent decree to be retrained, and for DHS to share with the court the ""names, A-numbers, and arrest documents for all individuals arrested without warrants since June in the Northern District of Illinois, and to provide that same reporting monthly going forward,"" the NIJC said.

During a Wednesday news conference on the order, immigrant advocates were intensely emotional over the ruling win.

Fighting back tears, Xanat Sobrevilla with Organized Communities Against Deportation said the ruling has raised spirits.

""To our Black and Brown people and immigrants, it does not always seem like this Earth wants us,"" Sobrevilla said. ""But we want us, and that can be enough.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17967178_100825-wls-rivera-iteam-ice-arrests-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-09 00:56:46.474962

Hegseth issued a memo over the weekend federalizing hundreds of Texas National Guard troops for deployment in Chicago over the repeated objections of Illinois Gov.
Hundreds of Illinois Guard troops were also called up in Hegseth’s memo.","A three-judge panel for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday unanimously lifted a lower court order that blocked President Donald Trump’s attempt to federalize 200 Oregon National Guard troops for deployment in Portland.

For now, the Ninth Circuit’s decision to lift U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut’s order from over the weekend is unlikely to allow the Trump administration to deploy soldiers to Portland.

Immergut issued a second order earlier this week flatly barring the government from sending federalized Guard troops to the state.

In its four-page order, the panel noted that since the Trump administration did not appeal Immergut’s second order, it remains in effect.

“Thus, the effect of granting an administrative stay preserves the status quo in which National Guard members have been federalized but not deployed,” the panel wrote. “Defendants have not appealed or challenged the second temporary restraining order, and it is not before us.”

The panel was composed of two judges appointed by Trump and a third appointed by former President Bill Clinton.

The panel is set to hear formal arguments Thursday on the Trump administration’s appeal of Immergut’s first order. The hearing could include arguments against Immergut’s second ruling if the Trump administration appeals that, too.

Late last month, Trump claimed to deploy troops to Portland, asserting that “domestic terrorists” had an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in the “War ravaged” city “under siege.” He also authorized troops to use “Full Force, if necessary.”

Local and state law enforcement officials through court declarations refuted Trump’s account of conditions in Portland.

In response to Trump’s social media posts, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a memo federalizing the Oregon Guard for at least 60 days to protect federal personnel and property in Portland.

The state quickly sued, arguing that Trump’s assertions were false and that the federalization undermined its sovereignty.

In her first order, Immergut, who Trump appointed in his first term, found that Trump did not have the authority to call up Oregon troops based on false claims.

The Trump administration responded to Immergut’s initial order by redirecting California Guard troops who were federalized earlier this year to Portland. California joined Oregon’s lawsuit and both states asked Immergut for a second order halting outside troops being deployed to Oregon.

The judge granted the second order and warned Department of Justice attorneys that the government’s attempt to use California troops in Oregon was “in direct contravention” of her earlier decision.

Immergut’s second order headed off the severe state sovereignty issues stemming from the president using one state’s militia against a nonconsenting state, but it was only temporary.

Hegseth issued a memo over the weekend federalizing hundreds of Texas National Guard troops for deployment in Chicago over the repeated objections of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D). Hundreds of Illinois Guard troops were also called up in Hegseth’s memo.

Chicago and Illinois filed their own lawsuit, and a federal judge is set to hear arguments Thursday on their request for a temporary injunction halting the Windy City deployment.

Even as the Trump administration continues to insist that its immigration policies are only targeting the worst of the worst, many other immigrants in America are being detained as well.

William Brangham speaks with the wife of one.

William Brangham:

Several weeks ago, Hernan Escobar on his way to his construction job outside of Boston when he was stopped by masked immigration agents. His car window was shattered and he was arrested.

Escobar came to the U.S. seven years ago from El Salvador and met his wife, who's a U.S. citizen. They settled in Massachusetts and began building a life there. Their marriage paperwork, which would grant him legal rights to stay in the U.S., was just being finalized when he was arrested.

Escobar's wife, Leslie Gonzalez, who's a legal aide attorney, joins us now.

Leslie, thank you so much for talking with us. I know this has got to be a very fraught period for you.

Can you just tell us a little bit about the day that Hernan was arrested? What happened, as far as you know?

Leslie Gonzalez, Wife of Hernan Escobar: First of all, thank you so much for having me.

That day changed everything. Hernan was on his way to work. He's a roofer. He's typically up before the sun. He was two minutes from our apartment complex when he was stopped by ICE agents in masks and an unmarked vehicle. He called me in a panic. It was 5:27 a.m. I heard shouting, glass shattering.

And then I heard him say: ""Ow, you're hurting me.""

When I arrived on the scene, there were multiple officers there. The ICE agents had smashed his window and had attempted to forcibly remove him from his car. The first thing I was asked when I got there was my cooperation in de-escalating the situation. I pointed out that there was a Taser in his face. They lowered the Taser.

And I went immediately to him to try to reassure him and let him know everything was going to be OK. But, of course, it was not. I remember standing there holding my phone just not understanding how this could have happened. My husband, he's a man with no criminal record. He's married to a U.S. citizen. He's doing everything right.

I was completely at a loss.

William Brangham:

So you have no idea why he was targeted that morning?

Leslie Gonzalez:

I do not. All I know is that he's not the only person in the situation that has no criminal record that is being detained.

William Brangham:

We asked DHS for a statement about his arrest, and they said that your husband — quote — ""refused to comply with officer commands to roll down his window. The officers took appropriate action and followed their training to use the minimum amount to force necessary to resolve the situation.""

Can you give me a response to that? What — they're saying basically that he didn't comply with their instructions.

Leslie Gonzalez:

I can only speak from my perspective. I was on the scene almost immediately, and I heard what was happening as I was on my way there.

I was on the phone with Hernan as he was being detained. He called me immediately. And I remember hearing him plead with the officers: ""Please just wait for my wife. Please just wait for my wife.""

He had rolled down his window enough to be able to give them his identification, his dress license. He told me that they didn't even look at his license. He was asking them to identify themselves because they were masked. They did not have typical police gear on. They were in a gray vehicle with New York license plates, and my husband did not know what was going on.

He did not know why he was being stopped and especially why he had been hit by the other vehicle. When I arrived, I immediately went to his side. He opened the door. He complied with every request that the ICE officers made of him, and he was taken away on a stretcher.

William Brangham:

What do you know about the conditions that he's in?

Leslie Gonzalez:

My husband is being held in Plymouth County. I know that initially he was in a different patio. He said the conditions were terrible. He has since been transferred to another patio, where he sleeps in a cell with four other people.

It is extremely noisy. He's not able to sleep much at night. He is limited in terms of when he can use the bathroom. Hernan is not one to complain in general, but he is also extremely protective of me. I know he is being strong for me. Whenever I speak with him, he tries to keep it light. When I saw him, he was cracking jokes left and right, telling me he had been working out every day, showing me his muscles.

He is an extremely positive person, and he is the light in my life.

William Brangham:

I know that you're in the middle of this big legal fight, but there are still many people, supporters of the administration, who argue that, if you came to the country illegally, that you don't have a right to be here.

And I wonder, even in the midst of this fraught period that you're in, how you would respond to people like that.

Leslie Gonzalez:

I would just ask that they look beyond the paperwork to the person to consider the family.

My husband is not a threat. He is a hard worker. He is a son. He is a future father, I hope. And I'm an attorney myself. I know what accountability looks like. I just don't think that this is what justice looks like. My husband deserves compassion, not cruelty.

William Brangham:

All right, Leslie Gonzalez, wife of Hernan Escobar, thank you so much for talking with us.

She was there with her husband, Richard Eckman, a veteran of the Vietnam War. Both are 84.

The two were part of a peaceful crowd that had walked from a park in the Eckmans’ neighborhood to the nearby ICE facility to stand in protest, according to a text message sent by Eckman to her sister, Marjorie Sanders, who posted that message on Facebook.

In it, Eckman said that about an hour after the group began standing in protest, federal officers rushed out “in a phalanx” and knocked people to the ground, including the two of them. She also was hit in the head by a projectile. “Bleeding all over,” she told her sister, sending photos of a wound on her temple and a blood-stained blouse. The officials also sprayed the group with some kind of chemical, and because of the fog it created, she temporarily lost sight of her husband, who uses a walker.

Bystanders, including a medical professional, rushed to their aid, Eckman told Sanders.

According to an interview Eckman gave to OregonLive, after the couple walked home, they were approached by four Portland police officers who expressed their concern for her. They also said they had orders not to verbally engage with federal officers and to stay a block away from the facility.

The couple later went to a local emergency room to have her injuries checked, and while there she was told she had a concussion.

Her text message to her sister ended with these words: “This was so unprovoked. SO UNPROVOKED.”

Eckman told OregonLive that the couple had stayed away from previous protests at the ICE facility, which they knew from walking their dog past it every day. But they decided to join this one because the group “looked so benign, so peaceful.”

She also said she wanted people to know how unjustified the officers’ actions were. “I never thought federal officers could behave this way. I really didn’t,” she said. “I always thought people must be provoking them or something, that they would never do this unprovoked. Obviously, I was wrong.”

She also said it was important for people to know that people who are protesting in Portland are not Antifa, a term that stands for anti-fascist and is often misapplied to include all protesters against government actions, according to the Anti-Defamation League.

“We’re just regular Portlanders who love our city, and my husband, being a Vietnam veteran, is incensed that we’re talking about war within our own country. This is outrageous, really.”

The TRO is being sought by the Chicago Headline Club, the NABET broadcast union and a number of independent journalists in the wake of a series of reported attacks on protesters and the media by agents firing tear gas and pepper balls. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump are among those named in the filing.

One reporter claims her car was targeted with a chemical agent while she was simply sitting outside the ICE processing center in Broadview. A spokesperson for ICE denies that any journalist was ever targeted outside that facility.

Ellis indicated that she plans to grant the TRO but that numerous details and language remain to be hammered out between the parties. That language would govern ICE and CBP behavior in specific situations, including when people are ""actively resisting"" and ""assaultively resisting.""

The Trump administration has asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants threatening the United States, creating justification to use military force.
Wednesday’s vote was brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war.
However, Republican leaders stridently argued against the resolution on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling it a political ploy from Democrats.
“Fortunately most of those drugs are now at the bottom of the ocean.” Risch thanked Trump for his actions and added that he hoped the military strikes would continue.","Senate Republicans voted down legislation Wednesday that would have put a check on Donald Trump’s ability to use deadly military force against drug cartels after Democrats tried to counter the administration’s extraordinary assertion of presidential war powers to destroy vessels in the Caribbean.

The vote fell mostly along party lines, 48-51, with two Republicans, Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski, voting in favor and the Democrat John Fetterman voting against.

It was the first vote in Congress on Trump’s military campaign, which according to the White House has so far destroyed four vessels, killed at least 21 people and stopped narcotics from reaching the US. The war powers resolution would have required the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.

The Trump administration has asserted that drug traffickers are armed combatants threatening the United States, creating justification to use military force. But that assertion has been met with some unease on Capitol Hill.

Some Republicans are asking the White House for more clarification on its legal justification and specifics on how the strikes are conducted, while Democrats insist they are violations of US and international law. It’s a clash that could redefine how the world’s most powerful military uses lethal force and set the tone for future global conflict.

The White House had indicated Trump would veto the legislation, and even though the Senate vote failed, it gave lawmakers an opportunity to go on the record with their objections to Trump’s declaration that the US is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels.

“It sends a message when a significant number of legislators say: ‘Hey, this is a bad idea,’” said the senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat who pushed the resolution alongside Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California.

Wednesday’s vote was brought under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, which was intended to reassert congressional power over the declaration of war.

“Congress must not allow the executive branch to become judge, jury and executioner,” Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has long pushed for greater congressional oversight of war powers, said during a floor speech.

Paul was the only Republican to publicly speak in favor of the resolution before the vote, but a number of Republican senators have questioned the strikes on vessels and said they are not receiving enough information from the administration.

The senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, acknowledged “there may be some concern” in the Republican conference about the strikes. However, Republican leaders stridently argued against the resolution on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling it a political ploy from Democrats.

“People were attacking our country by bringing in poisonous substances to deposit into our country that would have killed Americans,” said the senator Jim Risch, the chair of the Senate foreign relations committee. “Fortunately most of those drugs are now at the bottom of the ocean.”

Risch thanked Trump for his actions and added that he hoped the military strikes would continue.

Members of the Senate armed services committee received a classified briefing last week on the strikes, and Cramer said he was “comfortable with at least the plausibility of their legal argument”. But, he added, no one representing intelligence agencies or the military command structure for Central and South America was present for the briefing.

“I’d be more comfortable defending the administration if they shared the information,” he said.

Kaine also said the briefing did not include any information on why the military chose to destroy the vessels rather than interdict them or get into the specifics of how the military was so confident the vessels were carrying drugs.

“Maybe they were engaged in human trafficking, or maybe it was the wrong ship,” Schiff said. “We just have little or no information about who was onboard these ships or what intelligence was used or what the rationale was and how certain we could be that everyone on that ship deserved to die.”

The Democrats also said the administration has told them it is adding cartels to a list of organizations deemed “narco-terrorists” that are targets for military strikes, but it has not shown the lawmakers a complete list.

“The slow erosion of congressional oversight is not an abstract debate about process,” the senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said in a floor speech. “It is a real and present threat to our democracy.”

The secretary of state Marco Rubio visited the Republican conference for lunch Wednesday to emphasize to senators that they should vote against the legislation. He told the senators that the administration was treating cartels like governmental entities because they had seized control of large portions of some Caribbean nations, according to the senator John Hoeven of North Dakota.

Rubio told reporters at the Capitol: “These drug-trafficking organizations are a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States to unleash violence and criminality on our streets, fueled by the drugs and the drug profits that they make. … And the president, as the commander in chief, has an obligation to keep our country safe.”

Still, Democrats said the recent buildup of US maritime forces in the Caribbean was a sign of shifting US priorities and tactics that could have grave repercussions. They worried that further military strikes could set off a conflict with Venezuela and argued that Congress should be actively deliberating whenever American troops are sent to war.

Schiff said, “This is the kind of thing that leads a country, unexpectedly and unintentionally, into war.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29826de71a1fb02d9155f427faeedcb10f739382/268_0_2350_1880/master/2350.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7cdf939d55a029fbd5eb381f445b7ba0",N,,2025-10-08 23:56:21.887622

But on Wednesday Pope Leo made some of his strongest comments yet, urging U.S. bishops to strongly support immigrants as President Trump escalated his deportation campaign, including in Chicago, the pope’s hometown.

With National Guard troops expected to arrive in Chicago, Pope Leo met with a group of Catholics from El Paso. The group gave the pope more than 100 handwritten letters, written by immigrants — mostly undocumented individuals but also mixed families — living in Catholic communities across the United States.

The letters were tied together with twine and included a small yellow note that read, in Spanish, “Pope Leo, please listen to the clamor of those who are being marginalized.”

Pope Leo did not specifically mention Mr. Trump, Bishop Seitz said, or Chicago. But the crisis unfolding in the church in America — where a third of the church is Hispanic and families have told priests they are uneasy about going to Mass for fear of being apprehended by officials with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — was the obvious backdrop.

The group and the pope discussed the challenge of wanting to avoid the political fray while still speaking boldly for their beliefs, and how to translate that to action, Bishop Seitz said.

“To have the United States changing so radically is something that calls for attention,” he said.

Pope Leo said “that he would love to see a statement from the conference of bishops,” Bishop Seitz said, adding that one was already in progress. The bishops are scheduled to meet in Baltimore next month for their annual conference, where the issue is expected to be a central focus.

Pope Leo told the group it was critical that the church speak “forcefully and in unity” about these issues, said Dylan Corbett, the founding executive director of the Hope Border Institute, who attended the meeting with the pope.

The Trump administration has said its tactics on immigration are necessary to protect public safety because some illegal immigrants are violent criminals. Some conservative Catholics support the president’s position despite church teaching on immigration, similar to how some progressive Catholics support abortion rights, which also contradicts church teaching.

Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism six years ago, said in an interview shortly after Pope Leo’s election that immigration “at the levels and at the pace that we’ve seen over the last few years” has destroyed “social solidarity.”

“That’s not because I hate the migrants or I’m motivated by grievance,” he said. “That’s because I’m trying to preserve something in my own country where we are a unified nation.”

The meeting at the Vatican on Wednesday had been requested to present to the pope “the pain and the anxiety that’s felt by the immigrant community in the United States right now,” said Mr. Corbett, whose group does research and advocacy on social justice issues at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The pope agreed to watch a four-minute video with the delegation. Titled “Letter to Pope Leo XIV and the Catholic Church in the United States,” it highlighted the concerns, as well as the resilience, of the nation’s immigrant communities, Mr. Corbett said. They all huddled around the screen and watched together.

The El Paso delegation also included the Auxiliary Bishop Anthony C. Celino; Msgr. Arturo Bañuelas; and Lorena Andrade, a civil rights and labor activist.

Catholic bishops in the United States have worked for months to rally opposition to Mr. Trump’s mass deportation efforts, protesting bills in Congress, supporting migrants at immigration courts and condemning ICE raids and arrests.

Archbishop Timothy Broglio, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, is expected to meet with Pope Leo in the coming days for an annual meeting about the state of church in America.

Pope Leo has so far adopted a more reserved political tone than his predecessor, Pope Francis, who frequently criticized Mr. Trump’s positions, even suggesting that Mr. Trump was “not Christian” for his promise to deport immigrants and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.

But Pope Leo has also consistently made his support for migrants clear. In May, his brother John Prevost said that Leo was “not happy with what’s going on with immigration. I know that for a fact.”

Last weekend, Pope Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, in which he called on people to welcome and care for migrants fleeing from poverty, violence and suffering. They “cannot and must not find the coldness of indifference or the stigma of discrimination,” Pope Leo said.

Last week, he wrote to the Catholic Charities USA network, thanking them for being “agents of hope” for the “most vulnerable, including migrants and refugees.”

He also commented after some conservative bishops in the United States vehemently protested the decision by Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago to give Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, an award for his commitment to immigration reform. They objected because Mr. Durbin also supported abortion rights.

Pope Leo weighed in from the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo, noting the complexity.

“Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion but says I’m in favor of the death penalty’ is not really pro-life. So someone who says that ‘I’m against abortion, but I’m in agreement with the inhumane treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life,” he said.

He asked “that we search together — both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics — to say we need to really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward as church. The church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08NAT-POPE-IMMIGRATION-sub-cpmb/08NAT-POPE-IMMIGRATION-sub-cpmb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:57:22.858472

The Texas Tribune reported in mid-September that Texas Department of Public Safety officers have helped arrest more than 3,000 undocumented immigrants across the state this year at the direction of Governor Greg Abbott. “Among them was a Honduran man in Austin who was riding in the passenger seat of a car stopped for an expired registration after DPS apparently staked out his home,” the story stated. In addition, authorities raided a party in Hays County and arrested almost four dozen people, including children.

According to a CBS analysis in July, of the 109,000 arrests over the previous five months, nearly one-quarter occurred in Texas. The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a data gathering, research and distribution organization based at Syracuse University, lists the number of detainees in Texas in 2025 at 13,415 through September 15th, which is almost twice as many as Louisiana and nearly four times as many as California. TLAC data also notes that 70.3 percent of those detainees had no criminal convictions; instead their offenses were minor infractions such as traffic violations.

Law enforcement officials in Travis County have been vocal and public about their positions. While Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez has stated she does not favor turning over undocumented detainees to federal agents, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis went a step further stating in an interview with KUT in late-January, “It is not the function of the local police department, and my function is to keep Austin safe. So that, to me, means it’s a sanctuary city.” In a separate interview, Hernandez told KUT that an increased presence of ICE enforcement makes her job more difficult, as people pull back from police and emergency services. “We want victims to run to our agency in a crisis, not run away.”

New law requires sheriffs to aid ICE

On June 20th, Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) into law. The new legislation requires counties to participate with ICE by assigning certain federal immigration functions to local and state officers. Specifically, it requires sheriffs in 43 counties with populations of more than 100,000 to enter into 287(g) agreements with ICE. This refers to a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate formal agreements between ICE and state and local law enforcement agencies. The federal government provides funding to train and authorize local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions—essentially deputizing them as ICE agents.

Supporters of SB 8 described it as a “safety bill” that makes it easier to locate criminals already incarcerated and hand them over to ICE. State Representative David Spiller (R-Jacksboro) was not subtle when describing the target of the legislation to CBS: “There has been an unprecedented number of illegal aliens that have come across that either are convicted felons, rapists, murderers, child molesters, terrorists, that have come into our community and they are among us.”

In terms of what types of participation will be required by SB 8, counties must select one of three choices attached to the 287(g) agreements:

Warrant Service Officer—This gives local law enforcement the authority to serve and execute administrative warrants to undocumented inmates in their agency’s jail and then hold the individuals until ICE can detain and process them. As of March 20th, 35 counties and one city police department in Texas already had warrant service agreements with ICE.

Jail Enforcement Model—This deputizes jail officers to screen for immigration status, issue immigration detainers, and start removal paperwork before ICE picks up the inmates.

Task Force Officer—Deputized officers can enforce immigration law in field situations such as traffic stops and “community patrols.” This model has been largely phased out due to criticisms that, when previously implemented, it led to racial profiling. Still, it remains an option within the 287(g) agreements.

SB8 a response to earlier efforts?

SB 4 passed in 2017, forcing local jurisdictions to assist in federal immigration enforcement while overriding local discretion. The legislation banned sanctuary policies and empowered local law enforcement to inquire about immigration status of inmates in lawful detention.

Both the City of Austin and Travis County resisted SB 4, even joining a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the bill. Just days before the law was set to go into effect, U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia, based in San Antonio, granted a preliminary injunction. His order stated that the requirement for jail officials to honor all ICE detainers violated the Fourth Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.

“If during a lawful detention or arrest an officer obtains information that a detained or arrested individual is undocumented, he may not arrest that individual on this basis,” Judge Garcia wrote in a 94-page ruling. “SB 4 gives local officers discretion to inquire and share information, but it does not provide them with discretion to act upon the information they may obtain.”

SB 8 removes discretion by mandating federal partnerships and deputizes officers to begin processing the inmates. It’s unclear whether this new law could see similar legal challenges.

“The way they were doing it in SB 4 clearly violated longstanding constitutional precedent by allowing the state police to essentially deport immigrants without going through any type of federal process or judicial process,” said Luis Figueroa, senior director of legislative affairs at the advocacy organization Every Texan. He testified against SB 8 during legislative hearings. “SB 8 certainly has problems and undermines community trust but, in my opinion, the ways they’re doing it are very different. SB 4 was much more problematic from a constitutional prospective.”

Figueroa was initially supportive of SB 8 when the Warrant Service Officer model was the only 287(g) mandate, targeting immigrants already in jail to turn them over to ICE. He believed having the warrant service model as the sole mandate was a reasonable compromise and, essentially, already in practice in the jails. “It’s a common sense approach to just say, yeah we can have somebody trained that is designated as the liaison to ICE at the local jail,” he said.

Figueroa claims that, although the Senate version of the bill included all three models in the mandate, many Republicans in the House were supportive of only mandating the warrant service model.

On May 30th, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that SB 8 should be passed “as written” in the Senate and that he was “watching closely.” Figueroa says this led to the House eventually adopting the Senate language.

Representative Spiller dismisses this characterization, stating that the actual language of the bill never changed. Even though he and other Republicans did see the Warrant Service Model as easiest to operate and the least expensive, Spiller emphasizes that sheriffs’ offices still only have to choose one of the three models. “I was encouraging and stressing the warrant service model program,” he said. “But, even under our bill, you could choose any of the three and be in complete compliance.”

Currently, when inmates enter the Travis County jail they are processed and their fingerprints are taken. Those prints are sent to ICE and if the individuals do not have legal status, ICE issues detainers to hold them in the jail. If ICE does not pick up the inmates within 48 hours, they are released. In late August The Austin Bulldog filed a public information request to get copies of ICE detainer forms received by the Travis County Sheriff’s Office. Travis County declined to provide those documents and instead filed a request for an attorney general’s ruling, which is still pending.

“Some of these larger counties want to turn a blind eye and ignore and treat these folks as though they’re not here illegally, and just release them out onto the street,” Spiller said. “What SB 8 does is prevent that from happening.”

Although Sheriff Hernandez has not publically made a decision about which model will be enforced in Travis County, she believes the Warrant Service Officer model would not require as many officers and would have “less impact on our community.”

Regarding cost, a preliminary evaluation by the Sheriff’s Office provides estimates for the Jail Service and Task Force models only. Staffing alone for the Jail Service model could reach $1.3 million for the first year (2026) and $1.2 million in ongoing annual salary expenses. Training is also involved for this model, and is not included in those numbers. The Task Force model would be, by far, the most costly with estimates of $4.2 million for personnel and $5.5 million for equipment including uniforms, computers, vehicles, and a body camera system. Training costs are also not included for this model.

Hays County Sheriff Anthony Hipolito has yet to enter into a 287(g) agreement. Williamson County has been using the Jail Enforcement Model since 2020, with the former Sheriff Robert Chody stating that the program “cuts out the middle man.” Current Williamson County Sheriff Matthew Lindemann has not commented publically on his office’s continuing collaboration with ICE.

Sheriff Hernandez sees SB 8 as a continuation of SB 4 and laments how the legislation could distract her office from other priories and stretch the budget thin. “They’re wanting to get county sheriff’s offices, to force us to help them with their mission,” she said, “whether we have resources or not.”

ICE cooperation costs reimbursed

An ICE fact sheet lists the benefits to counties that participate in a 287(g) agreement as “Enhanced public safety, free training, and possible eligibility for federal payments through a DOJ program.” Another page states: “ICE bears the cost of 287(g) training for law enforcement agencies.”

Additionally, the Department of Justice will reimburse counties for correctional officer salaries incurred while incarcerating undocumented inmates through a program known as the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Administered through the Bureau of Justice Assistance, Texas has historically been one of the largest recipients of this funding because of its high population of inmates without legal status. In 2024, Travis County received $273,127 in SCAAP funding while the Texas Department of Criminal Justice took in more than $11 million.

SB 8 also provides for $20 million in grants to counties with populations of fewer than 1 million, to be administered by the Texas Comptroller’s Office. Grants will range from $80,000 to $140,000, depending on the size of the county. These grants are meant to cover costs over a two-year period that aren’t paid for by the federal government, such as officer salaries and overtime, travel and lodging during training, and other administrative costs. The grant money may also be needed to cover legal costs for lawsuits covering cases such as wrongful detainment and for violations of jail standards.

Harris County already tried this

In 2008, then-Harris County Sheriff Tommy Thomas entered into a 287(g) agreement, which was carried over by the succeeding sheriffs through 2016. Over the course of that time, Harris County paid out $675,000 per year in salaries for 10 deputies and 7 detention officers and faced challenges such as overcrowding in the jail, staffing shortages, and further financial strain due to overtime pay costs of $2 million per month.

By 2017, newly elected Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez made good on a campaign promise by ending the agreement with ICE. In addition to the costs, Sheriff Gonzalez cited the need to allocate resources to other aspects of policing such as investigating violent crimes, increasing overall patrol presence around the city, and tackling a backlog in investigations. In step with Travis County Sheriff Hernandez’s concerns, Gonzalez hoped the move would help restore trust with immigrant communities.

Although Sheriff Gonzalez declined to be interviewed, Harris County Senior Policy and Communications Advisor Jason Spencer issued this statement: “When Sheriff Gonzalez withdrew from the 287(g) program, he granted ICE access to the jail to perform that agency’s federal immigration law enforcement duties directly, which they have been doing ever since. Regarding SB 8, it is our intent to comply with the law.”

Around the state

More than 70 counties in Texas have already entered into 287(g) agreements with ICE, most of which have chosen the Jail Enforcement Model. While it seems the vast majority of counties will not be using the Task Force Model for their compliance, at least four counties (Caldwell, Goliad, Jefferson, and Smith) have used that option as part of their enforcement approach. This represents a combined population of more than a half-million people.

With such an influx of inmates, there have been concerns that overcrowding in jails could lead to poor conditions within those facilities and result in lawsuits. In February, Bexar County exceeded its jail capacity, with more 2,900 inmates awaiting indictment. Eventually, the inmates were housed in neighboring counties at a monthly cost of $300,000. In February, the overall population of prisoners in Texas was 2.5-percent higher than at the same time the previous year and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice has projected a 10.2-percent increase in the incarceration population over the next five years.

“I mean, we’re trying to handle our own issues here in Travis County,” said Commissioner Margaret Gomez. “Every time that the jail population grows, the cost for it grows, so the taxpayers have to handle that.” Gomez also warned that a shift in priorities toward ICE detainment could force the county to take a more lax approach toward punishment for other inmates to free up space in the jail, “making the community more dangerous.”

Austin attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch runs a virtual immigration law firm and just celebrated her 10-year anniversary. Lincoln-Goldfinch, who is Mayor Kirk Watson’s appointee to the City’s Commission on Immigrant Affairs, says that before President Trump began increasing ICE activities in Texas, she would have maybe one client a month detained after a criminal incident. Now, that caseload has risen to around 10 per month. She added that, formerly, most of her clients were detained after criminal events. Now, they are being picked up without any charges.

Florida litigation

In late April, ICE pulled off the largest single-state immigration enforcement sweep in the department’s history. Operation Tidal Wave used 287(g) agreements with all 67 counties in Florida and is described on ICE’s website as “a first-of-its-kind statewide operation that netted 1,120 criminal illegal alien arrests.” Governor Ron DeSantis used warrior language by describing the push as the “tip of the spear.”

In April a coalition of civil rights organizations sued over Florida Senate Bill 4-C, arguing several concerns such as the lack of due process, civil rights violations, and the fact that immigration is described in the constitution as a federal responsibility. In July, a federal district court blocked enforcement of the bill and the Supreme Court declined to lift the injunction. The law currently remains unenforceable.

“After this law (Texas SB 8) comes online and after counties become compliant with it, we could see Texas unleash its own form of Operation Tidal Wave, where the state is working with local law enforcement to pop up operations in different parts of the state and arrest vast numbers of people,” said Roberto Lopez, a senior advocacy manager in the Beyond Borders program at the Texas Civil Rights Project.

Although SB 8 doesn’t create any new state crimes tied to immigration status—as Florida attempted to do—the legislation is still very likely to face lawsuits based on the separation of enforcement powers between state and federal authorities and the unfunded mandate that counties must provide training and additional space in jail facilities. Civil rights groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have already signaled their opposition and have outlined plans to challenge the law based on federal anti-commandeering statutes and coercion. Congress allowed for, but didn’t require, local participation with the 287(g) program. Civil rights groups could argue that SB 8 upsets that voluntary structure by making those agreements mandatory, thereby setting up a supremacy clause conflict and interfering with the intended permissiveness of the federal program.

“SB 8 will not make our communities safer, but it will force sheriffs to do the work of ICE in support of the federal government’s shameful mass deportation efforts,” said Sarah Cruz, ACLU policy and advocacy strategist. “The legislature should not strip local communities of their ability to make decisions about what keeps them safe.”

Sheriff Hernandez also didn’t rule out potentially joining litigation, saying “That would all depend on impacts.”

Racial profiling, civil rights

In April 2022, the ACLU released a report, “License to Abuse: How ICE’s 287(g) Program Empowers Racist Sheriffs and Civil Rights Violations,” a 63-page review of 142 participating law enforcement agencies. The report concluded that 287(g) agreements enabled or exacerbated racial profiling, civil rights abuses, and discriminatory enforcement by sheriffs and local agencies. The study also argues that local law enforcement agencies are given the pretense of legal authority to engage in immigration enforcement that, in practice, leans into bias.

Although Representative Spiller admits that the Trump administration is “actively trying to locate people” who have detainers or arrest warrants, he dismisses concerns over civil rights violations saying they are “just not happening.”

“As far as a law enforcement officer just stopping someone on the street, just hauling people in because of your skin color, that’s not happening,” he said.

The ACLU study completely contradicts Spiller’s assessment, providing examples around the country where individuals were targeted for their skin color or perceived ethnicity. Under Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in Arizona, federal courts determined that deputies “systematically targeted Latino drivers for traffic stops and prolonged detentions based solely on their appearance or Spanish accents, not on evidence of criminal activity.” Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt of court in July 2017 and was pardoned by President Trump in August 2017. Sheriff Terry Johnson in Alamance County, North Carolina, was investigated by the Department of Justice for instructing his deputies to “go out there and get me some Mexicans,” while avoiding white neighborhoods. Johnson is seeking his seventh term in 2026.

In Corpus Christi in 2019, Nueces County entered a 287(g) jail enforcement model agreement, with local media reporting described fears and allegations that deputies conducted “sweeps” in Latino neighborhoods, worrying the community that the program increased the risk of racial profiling. In Montgomery County Texas in 2020, The Courier covered a $2 million lawsuit alleging that deputies engaged in discriminatory policing practices that led to the prosecution of innocent people. Although the latter case is not related directly to immigration policy, it highlights a pattern of overreach by law enforcement and indicates that empowerment and bias lead to racial discrimination.

Forcing sheriffs to aid ICE could bring even more expenses to taxpayers, said the Texas Civil Rights Project’s Lopez, as there are always costs associated with lawsuits for racial profiling. Although reimbursements from the federal government could cover some of those expenses, it’s not clear at this point whether that will be enough.

“When an officer who is only lightly trained in immigration sticks someone in jail for a while and there’s a civil lawsuit as a result of that,” Lopez said, “it’s just more expenditures to the county. There are going to be a lot of costs that come from this law that aren’t baked into it.”

What’s next for Texas

As the Trump administration and Governor Abbott continue to step up ICE raids and incursions within immigrant communities, the 287(g) agreements will continue to play more of a role in terms of local law enforcement collaboration with federal agencies. Although some sheriffs may complain about losing trust and feeling hamstrung by mandated actions, they will be forced to comply by threat of Attorney General Ken Paxton, who could issue fines, seek injunctions through a lawsuit or, potentially remove the sheriff from office. In March, Paxton, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by John Cornyn, opened an investigation into the City of Dallas, accusing its police department of refusing to assist ICE and alleging “sanctuary city” policies.

Interim Dallas Police Chief Michael Igo stated during a meeting with members of the community that his department “is not assisting any federal agency on detaining people that are either documented or undocumented in the city of Dallas.” In April, Igo resigned after 33 years in law enforcement. Although he was one of five candidates for the position of the new chief, the city chose Daniel Comeaux—a former Houston Police Officer and special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration.

“The law is not optional,” Paxton said in a public statement. “My office will take all necessary legal actions to ensure compliance with state law and hold accountable any local entity that defies its legal obligations.”

And what happens when those obligations change? The models that sheriffs must choose from are set by ICE and the Trump Administration, and could change at any time. That instability could further complicate the effectiveness and legacy of SB 8, as Texas law enforcement participation would still be at the whim of the federal process.

”That seemed to get missed a little bit in the political debate,” said the Texas Civil Rights Project’s Lopez, adding that he is hopeful local law enforcement won’t be forced to act fully as ICE agents in the streets. “There is always that fear that one day they could change up the models and force sheriffs to enter into the worst form.”

“There’s no stopgap. There’s still a requirement that they have to join one of these models,” Every Texan’s Figueroa said. “The models go away or there’s less models, and maybe there’d be some litigation involved in that but it’s unclear at this moment.”

Attorney Lincoln-Goldfinch believes it could be the legislation itself that has kept Central Texas out of the Trump Administration’s crosshairs. ” No one can be a sanctuary under a law like this and so, to the extent that the administration is setting their sites on the sanctuary places then they’re going to leave Texas alone,” she said. “But, it doesn’t really matter because all the police are enforcing the laws so, at the end of the day, you’ll probably have more enforcement than you would anyway.

As bipartisan frustration with the strikes mounts, the Senate was voting Wednesday on a war powers resolution that would require the president to seek authorization from Congress before further military strikes on the cartels.

The military has carried out at least four strikes on boats that the White House said were carrying drugs, including three it said originated from Venezuela. It said 21 people were killed in the strikes.

The officials, who were not authorized to comment publicly about the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the administration has only pointed to unclassified video clips of the strikes posted on social media by President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and has yet to produce “hard evidence"" that the vessels were carrying drugs.

The administration has not explained why it has blown up vessels in some cases, while carrying out the typical practice of stopping boats and seizing drugs at other times, one of the officials said.

The Republican administration in a retroactive memo justifying one of the strikes last month declared drug cartels to be “unlawful combatants” and said the United States is now in an “armed conflict” with them.

The declaration has raised stark questions about how Trump intends to use his war powers. It also has been perceived by several senators as pursuing a new legal framework to carry out lethal action and has raised questions about the role of Congress in authorizing any such action.

Trump Administration Points to Videos as Proof

Asked about the lack of underlying evidence provided to Congress, the Pentagon on Wednesday pointed to videos of the strikes, which do not confirm the presence of drugs.

The Pentagon also noted public statements by Hegseth, including a social media post following the latest fatal strike in which he said, “Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route.”

Lawmakers have expressed frustration that the administration is offering little detail about how it came to decide the U.S. is in armed conflict with cartels or even detailing which criminal organizations it claims as “unlawful combatants.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi was pressed at a Senate hearing Tuesday about what advice she's provided Trump to legally justify the strikes. She said, “I’m not going to discuss any legal advice that my department may or may not have given or issued at the direction of the president.""

A White House official suggested that lawmakers were being disingenuous with their criticism and that the Trump administration has been “much more forthcoming” with the legal rationale than Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration was when it carried out strikes targeting militants in the Middle East.

The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Pentagon officials have held six separate classified briefings to Congress on the operations.

Trump administration officials have argued that the strikes are necessary acts of self-defense as cartels funnel drugs into the United States that they say are leading to thousands of U.S. deaths. While Venezuela produces cocaine, the bulk of it is sent to Europe.

A Few in the Administration Are Said to Be Driving the Push for Strikes

Trump has largely bypassed traditional interagency processes in formulating his strategy to carry out strikes against drug cartels, according to the U.S. officials and a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.

A small group of top administration officials — including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Trump aide Stephen Miller — has driven the push to carry out the fatal strikes, officials said.

Rubio, dating back to his days in the Senate, has advocated for taking a harder line on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

During Trump’s first term, Maduro was indicted on U.S. federal drug charges, including narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. This year, the Justice Department doubled a reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million, accusing him of being “one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world.""

Trump has focused attention on the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which he claims is serving as “front” for Maduro, and said members of the gang were in the first boat targeted last month. No details on alleged affiliations have been released in the three other strikes.

Maduro was sworn in for a third six-year term in January despite credible evidence that he lost last year's election. The U.S. government, along with several other Western nations, does not recognize Maduro’s claim to victory and instead points to tally sheets collected by the opposition coalition showing that its candidate, Edmundo González, won by more than a two-to-one margin.

A Pause in Diplomacy

Early in his term, however, Trump dispatched special envoy Richard Grenell to Caracas to meet with Maduro. Six Americans who had been detained in Venezuela were freed by Maduro's government during Grenell's visit.

But diplomatic efforts with Caracas have been largely paused in recent months, with Grenell mostly sidelined, said the person familiar with the matter and a congressional aide, who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Maduro says the boat strikes are an attempt to undercut his authority and try to foment unrest that would lead to his ouster from power.

The State Department pushed back against the notion that the administration had been involved in anything other than an operation targeting drug traffickers.

“Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela; he’s a fugitive of American justice who undermines regional security and poisons Americans and we want to see him brought to justice,"" said Tommy Pigott, a State Department spokesman. ""The U.S. is engaged in a counter-drug cartel operation and any claim that we are coordinating with anyone on anything other than this targeted effort is completely false.”

Federal officers are firing so much tear gas at protesters outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, that some nearby community members who aren’t even protesting are struggling to breathe when they leave their homes to run errands.

That’s according to a lawsuit filed this week by journalists and demonstrators who accuse the Department of Homeland Security of using “extreme brutality” to “intimidate and silence” them while they protest or report on protests outside the facility, about 12 miles west of downtown Chicago.

“Snipers with guns loaded with pepper balls, paintballs, and rubber bullets are stationed on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility with their weapons trained on the press and civilians,” the lawsuit states. “Federal agents have tackled and slammed people to the ground; they have lobbed flash grenades and tear gas canisters indiscriminately into the crowd.”

It continues: “No legitimate purpose exists for this brutality or for these arrests. The officers are not physically threatened. No government property is threatened.”

Broadview’s ICE facility is the main processing center for immigrants who are arrested throughout the Chicago area, and protests sprang up over the summer amid reports that it was holding people for longer than allowed in cramped and uncomfortable conditions; some protesters tried to block federal vehicles from driving out of the facility with detained immigrants.

In September, after the Trump administration expanded immigration enforcement in the Chicago area with “Operation Midway Blitz”—an operation that has since led to hundreds of arrests and a militarized overnight raid of an entire apartment building, terrorizing residents—protests intensified. The lawsuit is filled with examples of people who injured by federal officers outside the Broadview facility. Here are a few from last month:

The Reverend David Black, a protester and pastor with the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, was struck repeatedly by chemical pellets after he extended his arms, palms outstretched, toward ICE officers in a posture of prayer, he said: “It was clear to me that the officers were aiming for my head, which they struck twice.”

Raven Geary, a co-founder of Unraveled Press, a local media outlet covering the protests, was wearing press credentials and a helmet that said “PRESS” while standing in a public parking lot and photographing an ICE officer 30 feet away. The officer shot her in the face with a pepper ball.

Leigh Giancreco, a freelance reporter working for Block Club Chicago, was also shot in the head with pepper balls despite her helmet labeled PRESS and her neon yellow vest.

Stephen Held, another co-founder of Unraveled Press, was “tackled, thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and brought inside the Broadview facility,” according to the lawsuit, after he tried to film officers on a public parkway. He was then released without charges.

Federal officers “are acting to intimidate and silence the press and civilians engaged in protected First Amendment activities,” the plaintiffs argue in the suit. Their attorneys are also seeking a temporary restraining order against officers.

On October 2, Illinois State Police used concrete barriers to demarcate a “First Amendment zone” outside the facility, asking protesters to remain inside the area to avoid violence from officers. Many protesters ignored the zone and protested on the other side of the facility. The next day, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who was visiting, commended officers for their “professionalism” and urged them to “hammer” protesters.

“We’re not taking this anymore,” she said. “The president’s sick of it. I’m sick of it. And we’re going to give you guys all the authority that you need to go out there and arrest these individuals who are advocating for violence against you.”

In Broadview, federal immigration officers have also harmed individuals who came to the ICE facility for business, according to the lawsuit:

In late September, officers armed with pepper balls shot a 16-year-old boy who was trying to drop off possessions for his immigrant dad, who was detained inside the building.

Broadview’s own police chief says federal agents “verbally abused” his officers.

“The relentless deployment of tear gas, pepper spray, and mace at the ICE facility is endangering nearby village residents, harming police officers, harming firefighters and American citizens exercising their First Amendment rights,” Mayor Katrina Thompson said in September.

The tear gas has a 200- to 700-foot radius when it’s deployed, but wind carries it farther, the mayor said. The lawsuit cites several Broadview residents who have struggled to breathe because of the noxious fumes, including Jose Juan Alvarado and his wife, who were “sickened and reduced to tears” when they went to the grocery store.

Dimeko Harden, who lives a block from the ICE facility, has been unable to retrieve mail or “engage in normal activities without experiencing pain and difficulty breathing,” the lawsuit adds. “She has been forced to keep her teenage son at home, because he suffers from asthma.”

On Monday, Thompson announced an order limiting protests at the facility from 9 am to 6 pm, citing the “escalation of violence by ICE” and the effect on residents. “People have to go to work, they have to get their children ready for school, our businesses have to serve their customers, and our residents with developmental disabilities, who have sensory issues, have suffered emotional meltdowns because of the chaotic environment when protests get disruptive,” she said.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/8Oct2025teargas2.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-10-08 22:56:40.604868

And so Guevara — whose work primarily documents immigration enforcement actions, which he often livestreams to hundreds of thousands of followers — was kept in ICE detention.
Last month federal prosecutors made good on the threat, issuing an indictment against three activists for doxxing ICE agents in August.
Elsewhere in the city, ICE agents pepper-sprayed a woman who seemed to be filming them on her phone.","Among the earliest signs that the second Trump administration might be precipitously different from the first were the masks. Almost the first thought I had, in watching videos of federal agents snatching campus protesters and opinion writers, among many others seized somewhat violently on camera this year, was about what looked like a new anonymity protocol. There were agents wearing masks and others without visible name tags or badges, many operating in plain clothes. Why were so many of these agents trying to hide their identities?

“ICE goes masked for a single reason — to terrorize Americans into quiescence,” a federal judge, William Young, wrote in a blistering 161-page First Amendment ruling handed down last week. “In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police,” he continued. The judge, a Reagan appointee, compared immigration agents to “cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan” and declared that federal efforts to deport outspoken protesters amounted to a “full-throated assault” on freedom of speech. “Carrying on in this fashion, ICE brings indelible obloquy to this administration and everyone who works in it.”

Is this a true secret police? The term is darkly tempting, though much of what we’ve observed from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection this year has fallen distressingly within the bounds of our brutally capacious immigration law. The National Guard deployments, too, have unfolded in public view. The terroristic sweep of President Trump’s mass deportation program will be repeatedly litigated in the years to come, in courts of both law and public opinion — U.S. citizens arrested by agents apparently uninterested in their immigration status, agents drawing guns on civilian bystanders. And to the extent that many of those officers and their superiors have been not just enforcing laws and executive orders but also engaging in a kind of conspicuous and public cosplay, the costumes they have chosen are those of the enforcement arm of an authoritarian regime. When the masks came on, the mask came off.

The cosplay is now bleeding into state violence, and even for those used to pointing fingers and calling out authoritarianism, the past week has been a precipitous escalation: Trump speaking of the “enemy from within” as a national defense strategy waiting for approval proposes focusing the military on domestic threats and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, compares political opposition to terrorism; a military-style raid on a Chicago apartment complex; local police officers hit with tear gas from ICE agents.

The footage continued through the weekend, much of it horrifying. But at least we saw it.

***

Last Friday, the 48-year-old Emmy-winning reporter Mario Guevara was deported to El Salvador from an ICE detention facility in Folkston, Ga. He was held in detention there for over 100 days. The state’s filings concerning his detention seem to largely focus on the crime of committing journalism.

Guevara was arrested in June at a No Kings rally outside Atlanta, where, while filming the protest for his livestreaming platform MG News, he (clearly wearing a press vest and keeping his distance from both protesters and law enforcement) briefly stepped into a roadway. Within days, the charges against him were dropped. But instead of being released, he was transferred to ICE custody. And although an immigration judge granted him bond, finding him neither dangerous nor a flight risk, the government appealed it, arguing that his recording of law enforcement activity itself constituted a danger. And so Guevara — whose work primarily documents immigration enforcement actions, which he often livestreams to hundreds of thousands of followers — was kept in ICE detention. Meanwhile, his immigration case was reopened, and eventually deportation proceedings commenced.

When the Columbia activist and green card holder Mahmoud Khalil was detained in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued that Khalil’s participation in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza amounted to a deportable threat to American foreign policy. The administration appeared to offer a similar argument about Rumeysa Ozturk — seemingly confirming that she had been detained for activism, namely by being a writer of a campus opinion piece criticizing her university for its response to Israel’s war in Gaza, and that she should be deported for that speech crime.

Both of those First Amendment cases still hang in a kind of judicial limbo, though Khalil and Ozturk are — for now, at least — free. Guevara is not, having been sent from the country in which he raised a family and built a news organization for years back to the one he left fearing persecution for his reporting in 2004. “It’s a real frontal attack on journalism and freedom of the press,” said Jose Zamora of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “I think it also shows you how all these democratic institutions that take hundreds of years to build can be dismantled in a year.”

The immigration side of Guevara’s case is complicated. Technically, authorities are given broad discretion in deciding deportation cases. By contrast, the detention that enabled those deportation proceedings to begin again is not complicated. “There’s no real crime here. It’s just pretext,” said Adam Rose, the press rights chair of the Los Angeles Press Club and the deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “That was totally in retaliation for his reporting,” said the A.C.L.U’s Scarlet Kim, one of Guevara’s lawyers in his recent proceedings. “The government has made that explicitly clear.”

Over the past six months, federal officials have again and again declared that documenting immigration enforcement activities by ICE agents is, by definition, a form of doxxing, which they describe not only as a form of harassment or even effectively an incitement to violence but also as the equivalent of violence. Such activity, they promised, would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Last month federal prosecutors made good on the threat, issuing an indictment against three activists for doxxing ICE agents in August.

Students of political theory sometimes define the state as the entity that exercises a monopoly on violence; under Trump, the state seems to want to claim a monopoly on anonymity, too. Rose called the logic Orwellian. “It’s almost like doublespeak to say that filming is violence,” he said. “That is absurd. What filming does isn’t violence. It documents violence. It actually proves what really happened.”

Of course, there has been real violence against journalists since Trump returned to office, as well, not just arguments about whether Jimmy Kimmel should be on the air. During the protests against ICE raids in Los Angeles this June, more than 30 incidents of police violence against members of the media were documented by the Los Angeles Press Club, which last month won a remarkable injunction in a Federal District Court in California, in which the judge, Hernán Vera, had to detail that law enforcement could not attack or assault members of the press just for documenting a raid or protest. Vera described the attacks during the protests as “savagery.”

And in recent weeks, the violence has seemed to enter a new phase or perhaps merely a more visible one. On Sept. 28 an ICE agent fired a pepper ball at the car of a television journalist surveying a detention facility for signs of protest, of which there were none. On Sept. 30 at 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, ICE agents shoved journalists to the floor, sending one to the hospital, just a week after a similar episode at the same facility led to the suspension of one agent — and only briefly.

And last Thursday in Portland, Ore., the conservative journalist Nick Sortor was arrested while documenting a protest against ICE — producing an immediate wave of right-wing outrage and, reportedly, a promise by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, that her department would surge resources to the city. Elsewhere in the city, ICE agents pepper-sprayed a woman who seemed to be filming them on her phone. In Chicago, ICE agents were accused of making bogus calls to the police, saying that people were tampering with a detention facility’s gate. (Police officers quickly determined the people were there only to observe.) A Chicago City Council member was arrested after asking whether the agents had a warrant for someone they’d detained. “If arresting an elected official for peacefully asking questions isn’t a demonstration of authoritarianism, then what is?” Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois asked. “They seem to feel they can just willy-nilly shoot tear gas canisters at people and shoot them with foam rounds that can permanently maim people,” said Rose. “They’ve done this over and over.”

To a degree, the pattern follows a global trend. The U.N. has been warning about increasing violence and hostility toward the press for many years, with killings of journalists up 38 percent in 2022 and 2023 from the two previous years. More than 200 journalists have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict there — a figure much higher than in previous wars — making it, the Committee to Protect Journalists said, “the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists” that the organization had ever documented. What makes this even more remarkable is that Israel has largely blocked foreign reporters from entering Gaza since the conflict began.

It also reflects an increasing porousness about the term “journalist” and what we even mean by it in 2025, when almost anyone holding a phone can claim to be doing journalism, including many of those superficially indistinguishable from protesters (who, it pains me to have to say, should enjoy robust First Amendment protections in the United States, too). That porousness also means that category distinctions can be made pretty arbitrary — not just between observers and activists but also between the groups the online right likes to distinguish, citing Carl Schmitt, as friend and enemy. “There is an authoritarian playbook, and it has different steps,” said Zamora. “And it has started happening here in a very fast way.”

At various points over the past decade, nervous Americans sometimes told themselves certain calming stories about the threat of Trumpism — that liberal hysteria was a bigger threat to democracy, that the lesson of his first term was that incompetence stymied ideology, that popularity would be a check and that the courts would be trusted to ultimately hold.

ICE’s budget for the 2025 fiscal year is now set to roughly triple from the year before, as is its number of deportation officers, and Stephen Miller, Trump’s top domestic policy adviser, does not appear inclined to defer to surveys of public opinion when it comes to deportations and border enforcement. Democrats have come a long way since “Abolish ICE,” too, with many pivoting pretty hard on immigration in recent years.

In certain moments from certain vantages, the proceedings can look like incompetence, with all the Sturm und Drang of Trump’s policies producing far fewer than his desired one million deportations and a high-profile monthlong operation in Chicago yielding just more than 1,000 arrests. On social media, it can even look like farce — someone flinging a Subway sandwich at Customs and Border Protection officers in D.C., someone else cursing the president and then scooting off on his bike as Border Patrol agents chased on foot in downtown Chicago, a crowd surrounding and shaming two agents as they wrestled a man to the ground on the South Side, eventually getting them to flee.

But these are not the clips we are meant to see. For that, we have a beautiful, high-production-value hype video full of portentous music, documenting an apartment raid, that Noem posted to social media over the weekend. “Chicago, we’re here for you,” she wrote.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/opinion/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image/08wallace-wells-newsletter-image-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:57:51.337222

Throughout Tuesday, Portland police said they monitored activity at the ICE building while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the city.

Just before 4 p.m., police said they made their first arrest of the day for a misdemeanor harassment charge.

Several hours later, police said they made another arrest, Eric Sanchez, 32, for third-degree assault and second-degree robbery related to a fight that happened on Sept. 28, where two other people were arrested.

Shortly thereafter, police said they saw a man running towards the Willamette River, and they learned there was probable cause to arrest him.

The suspect hid in bushes along the river, police said, and as officers approached him, he jumped into the river and swam to Ross Island.

Officers, accompanied by K9 units, were transported to the island by a Portland Fire & Rescue boat, where they tracked the suspect and arrested him just after 1:30 a.m.

The suspect was identified as 36-year-old Nathan V. Kaleel, of Portland, and is accused of using physical force when he stole a tripod from a victim and damaged their cell phone. The tripod was later recovered from the roof of a nearby building.

Kaleel was briefly taken to the hospital for a hand injury he sustained on the shoreline of the river before swimming away from police. He was later found hiding in the foliage of Ross Island and transported to the mainland by a Portland Fire and Rescue boat. After being discharged from the hospital, Kaleel was booked into jail and faces charges that include third-degree robbery and second-degree criminal mischief.

H-1B $100K Fee Sparks Lawsuit and Industry Backlash

Supreme Court Allows Termination of TPS for Venezuelans

USCIS Launches Major Fraud Sweep in Minneapolis-St. Paul

Refugee Admissions Slashed to Record Low for FY2026

H-1B $100K Fee Sparks Lawsuit and Industry Backlash

A coalition of universities, healthcare providers, and nonprofits has sued the Trump administration over the new $100,000 H-1B application fee, calling it unlawful and economically damaging. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also objected, warning the policy would limit access to critical talent and force companies to outsource key functions.

The lawsuit argues the government bypassed required rulemaking and failed to consider the harm to organizations that rely on H-1B professionals, from schools and hospitals to tech and manufacturing firms. The Chamber urged the administration to withdraw the fee and instead pursue reforms that align visa policy with U.S. workforce needs.

Impact: If implemented, the $100K fee could reshape hiring strategies, spike program costs, and accelerate a shift toward alternative visa categories and green card sponsorships.

Supreme Court Allows Termination of TPS for Venezuelans

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelan nationals, affecting hundreds of thousands of individuals currently residing and working in the U.S.

The decision stays a lower court order that had blocked termination while litigation continued. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, warning the ruling overlooks the irreparable harm to families and communities that have relied on TPS stability.

Impact: Employers with Venezuelan nationals under TPS should immediately review work authorization timelines and prepare contingency plans, including transitioning to alternative visa categories or permanent residence options to avoid workforce disruption.

USCIS Launches Major Fraud Sweep in Minneapolis-St. Paul

USCIS, ICE, and the FBI conducted “Operation Twin Shield,” a large-scale fraud detection initiative in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the agency’s first surge of this magnitude in a single region. Over 900 site visits and interviews were conducted, targeting 1,000+ cases with potential fraud or ineligibility indicators.

USCIS reported evidence of noncompliance or fraud in 275 cases, with 42 referrals to ICE and several arrests. Director Joseph Edlow warned this is “the first of many” such operations and advised other cities to prepare for similar enforcement activity.

Impact: Employers should expect heightened scrutiny of immigration filings nationwide, particularly around employment verification, site visit preparedness, and documentation accuracy. Now is the time to audit records, confirm public access files, and reinforce compliance training with HR and managers supporting foreign nationals.

Refugee Admissions Slashed to Record Low for FY2026

The Trump administration plans to cut U.S. refugee admissions to 7,500, down from 125,000 under the Biden administration and reportedly prioritize certain groups, including white Afrikaners from South Africa, citing claims of “unjust discrimination.”

told reporters Monday that he was briefed on the deployment of California and Texas Guard troops.","Republican senators are increasingly uneasy about President Trump’s standoff with Democratic governors over deploying National Guard troops from other states to Portland, Ore., and Chicago.

The conflict between federal and state authorities escalated dramatically over the weekend when Trump moved to send National Guard soldiers to Oregon and Illinois despite opposition from their respective governors, Tina Kotek and JB Pritzker.

Trump’s use of military forces was all the more controversial because a Trump-appointed federal judge for the District of Oregon ruled Saturday that the administration could not federalize Oregon’s National Guard to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Portland.

Senate Republicans want to support Trump’s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, but they said the president’s actions are raising alarming questions about states’ rights, presidential authority and the precedent of deploying National Guard troops across state lines.

“I worry about someday a Democrat president sending troops or National Guard from New York, California, Oregon, Washington state to North Carolina. I think it’s bad precedent,” Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said.

“If you look at this particular issue, I don’t see how you can argue that this comports with any sort of conservative view of states’ rights,” he added.

Tillis told Attorney General Pam Bondi at a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing Wednesday that the cities and states should be handling local crime themselves.

“I’m having a real struggle right now with the National Guard being deployed and masking the abject failure of leaders at the state and local level,” he said.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she’s worried about the precedent of sending National Guard members from one state to another despite the objections of those states’ governors.

“It’s one thing if governors ask and they say, ‘Hey, I need help.’ That’s the way we’ve handled it before,” she said. “I am concerned, I am very apprehensive about the use of our military for policing and, more, the politicization that we’re seeing within the military.”

She said the use of the National Guard to respond to natural disasters when requested by the governor of a state makes perfect sense but warned that Trump is moving into a dangerous new realm.

“This is not the role of our military,” she said.

Murkowski said fellow Republican senators don’t want to clash with the president but are also sympathetic to states’ rights.

“We’re seeing these orders, we’re seeing a directive that is unprecedented, and it should make us all concerned,” she said.

One Republican senator who requested anonymity said Trump’s attempts to circumvent restrictions on his deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic states raises “questions.”

“I don’t know it’s the best way to solve the issue, but it looks like in Portland, the place is on fire, but that could be isolated reports,” the lawmaker said.

“I think he’s just poking his finger in their eye,” the senator added, referring to the firestorm provoked by Trump’s aggressive use of guard troops in Democratic-leaning states.

Oregon District Judge Karin Immergut, appointed by Trump in 2019, accused the administration Sunday night of defying her order blocking it from federalizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect an ICE facility in Southwest Portland after a few dozen protesters showed up there.

Immergut on Saturday rejected the Trump administration’s argument that it needed to federalize Oregon Guard members to protect the ICE facility in Portland and to enforce federal immigration law. She said the administration’s actions risked “blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of the nation.”

When the administration pivoted by attempting to send 200 California Guard troops to Portland despite California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) objection, the judge warned during an emergency hearing Sunday night that the administration risked being “in direct contravention” of her order from Saturday. She also said Trump’s claim that Portland is “burning down” was “untethered to the facts.”

Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden (D), who noted the judge was confirmed with strong bipartisan support, said “there’s no question” that the Trump administration flouted Immergut’s Saturday order.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) said he’s not a “fan” of deploying federal troops into American cities but argued there’s a “supremacy” of federal authority when it comes to protecting federal property.

He criticized Democratic mayors for supporting soft-on-crime policies, which he argued have triggered federal intervention.

“Look at Chicago, the murder capital of the U.S. People live in utter despair and they’ve voted for Democrats for 70 years,” he added. “It’s right for the president to point that out and to try to offer help. I think the Democrats would be better off actually accepting his help.”

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a moderate who is up for reelection next year in a Democratic-leaning state, pointed to Chicago’s “crime problem” and a “sky-high murder rate.”

But she said deploying National Guard troops “works much better when the governor is in concert” with the president.

“I do think the National Guard has an important role to play in natural disasters, in protecting federal personnel and federal sites. In those cases, you can justify nationalizing the guard,” she said. “Generally, this should be a police and law enforcement action. It’s a complicated issue.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) told reporters Monday that he was briefed on the deployment of California and Texas Guard troops.

“It was a request from the Department of Homeland Security and designed to protect law enforcement personnel and federal buildings … which is a justifiable use of executive branch authority there,” Thune said. “If there are federal personnel who are being threatened, then I think the president has a right to protect them.”

But Thune said he expects the Trump administration to follow judges’ rulings, noting district court rulings will be appealed to the appellate courts and perhaps the Supreme Court.

Asked if officials should comply with orders against deploying guard troops, such as Immergut’s ruling handed down over the weekend, Thune said: “My assumption is … when it works its way through the legal process, whatever that decision is will be final.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/NationalGuard_Bolton_AP_EthanSwope.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-08 23:56:29.131552

The chief of the National Guard Bureau, which administers two organizations — the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard — was a job for a three-star general until recent years.
The Army National Guard and the Air National Guard have units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
As of Oct. 1, there were still nearly 2,200 Guard troops deployed in Washington, with more than 950 from the D.C. National Guard.
Late Sunday, a federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. Texas National Guard troops arrived in the Chicago area on Tuesday and were expected to deploy by Wednesday.","Instead, Democratic governors are accusing Republicans, especially Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, of a betrayal, even an “invasion” of their states.

“Greg Abbott is a tool of Donald Trump, he’s his lackey,” said Mr. Pritzker in an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC this week.

Mr. Abbott returned fire, calling Mr. Pritzker “clueless.”

Such animus would once have been considered unusual or out of bounds for governors, who generally have seen themselves as pragmatic politicians, required to balance budgets and find solutions for their states, regardless of party. The governors have hosted “disagree better” road shows in between twice-annual meetings and White House galas marked by bonhomie.

But the deployment of about 200 troops from Texas to the Chicago area, and the threatened movement of Texas troops to Portland, Ore., have ruptured such comity.

“The president wants to call up National Guard troops in a way that we don’t believe is lawful,” Gov. Tina Kotek of Oregon, a Democrat, said in an interview. “That should concern every governor, Republican or Democrat.”

Democratic governors pleaded with Mr. Abbott to rebuff the president’s troop request. The Texan in turn castigated his Democratic colleagues as weak on crime and illegal immigration.

For Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Abbott, the rift over Texas troops is only the latest in an ongoing and bitter public feud that has not been a model of respectful debate.

Beyond calling Mr. Pritzker clueless, Mr. Abbott said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday, “If anybody is shot, if anybody is attacked, I tell you what, Governor Pritzker and the local mayor there in Chicago, they are accomplices to those crimes by stirring up this hate against I.C.E. agents.”

(Mr. Trump said Wednesday that Mr. Pritzker and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, “should be in jail.”)

Playing in the background is the 2028 presidential election, in which many of the big state governors — including Mr. Pritzker, Mr. Newsom and Mr. Abbott — see themselves as prime candidates to be their party’s nominee.

Mr. Abbott said as much about the Illinois and California governors during the Tuesday interview. “They’re hoping to be first in line when it comes to the Democrat nomination for the presidency,” he said. “But it doesn’t matter which one of them may be the winner of that nomination, because they are utter failures for our country.”

Mr. Abbott has previously denied that he himself has presidential aspirations, and a political consultant for the governor said that the Texas governor was focused on his re-election bid next year. But politics are always present: Mr. Abbott’s campaign sent an email on Wednesday soliciting support — and an email and phone number — for the deployment.

“While other states turn their backs on President Trump, elite members of the Texas National Guard are stepping in,” the email read.

Some bipartisanship still exists — with former governors. More than two dozen of them filed a motion on Wednesday afternoon requesting permission to enter a legal brief objecting to the Texas Guard mobilization in Illinois. Among the Republicans were William Weld of Massachusetts, Bill Graves of Kansas, Arne Carlson of Minnesota, Marc Racicot of Montana and Christie Whitman of New Jersey.

“The president’s assertion of authority to deploy military troops on domestic soil based on his unreviewable discretion, and without the cooperation and coordination of state authorities, threatens to upset the delicate balance of state and federal authority that underlies our constitutional order,” more than two dozen former governors wrote.

All of this has put severe strains on the National Governors Association, which since 1908 has sought to create a space for socializing and negotiations between Republican and Democratic states.

The association has so far been silent on the brewing clash between governors and the threats by Mr. Pritzker and Mr. Newsom to quit. Messages and emails to several representatives of the association were not returned.

Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas, the chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association, called the National Guard deployments across state lines ordered by the president “a blatant abuse of power and an attack on state sovereignty.”

But the current chairman of the National Governors Association, Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, a Republican, has not commented publicly. He has previously suggested that the role of the bipartisan association was not to make statements but to find areas of agreement between the two parties. (The Republican Governors Association has also not weighed in.)

“The N.G.A. is to bring people together, and I don’t think America wants people to take their ball and go home,” Mr. Stitt said last month, referring to the departure from the association of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, earlier this year. She cited a lack of bipartisanship as her reason for leaving the group.

Mr. Newsom suggested he would do the same if the association did not position itself against the interstate deployments over the objections of governors.

“If the National Governors Association cannot stand against states LITERALLY INVADING ONE ANOTHER — count me out,” he wrote on social media.

The California governor’s office later responded to a social media posting from Mr. Abbott — which suggested Democratic governors were mad at Mr. Trump for trying to do something about crime in their cities — with a litany of statistics about the high crime in Texas cities.

In recent years, the group has tried to show the country how to “disagree better,” putting out videos in which governors of different parties demonstrate to voters how to air political conflicts face-to-face, rather than to retreat to separate partisan corners. Instead, this week the disagreements got worse, after Mr. Abbott agreed to send his troops north.

The idea of “disagree better,” spearheaded by Gov. Spencer Cox of Utah, a Republican, when he was chair of the organization, was to have governors model productive debate for people around the county in order to try to turn down the political temperature and lessen the nation’s polarization.

The effort appeared to be effective, said Robb Willer, a Stanford University professor and adviser to the initiative who studied its impact. “We found that when we showed that to even far-left and far-right Democrats and Republicans, that they were impressed,” he said, ”and on average tended to view the governors more positively.”

Now, Dr. Willer said, by fighting aggressively in public, the governors may be worsening already-heightened political tension.

“Cues from party leaders are a major factor that influences Americans’ levels of toxic polarization,” he said.

A spokesman for Mr. Cox did not respond to a request for an interview with the governor.

Tension between Mr. Abbott and Mr. Pritzker has been growing over the last few years as each has found ways to insert himself into the affairs of the other’s state.

From 2022 to 2024, the Texas governor sent more than 36,000 migrants from the border to Chicago, part of his aggressive effort to target Democratic cities that had held themselves out as sanctuaries for undocumented immigrants.

Then this summer Mr. Pritzker welcomed dozens of Democratic lawmakers from Texas who left the state in order to thwart a Republican effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts, which was pushed by Mr. Trump and enthusiastically supported by Mr. Abbott. The two state leaders traded frequent barbs during the two weeks that the Texas Democrats were holed up in a hotel outside of Chicago.

The decision, issued on Tuesday, is confined to Chicago and will expire in February, but it could influence the courts’ interpretations of ICE’S legal authorities in similar cases elsewhere.

The 52-page ruling from Magistrate Judge Jeffrey I. Cummings challenges the legal basis for one of ICE’S tools for making arrests — blank warrants that are often filled out by officers in the field. Under Tuesday’s order, those forms can be used only as a basis to arrest someone who has already received a notice to appear before an immigration judge.

That change alone sharply limits ICE’S authority to make “collateral arrests” of unknown individuals who officers encounter in the field, unless the agents have probable cause to believe those people are likely to escape before a warrant can be issued.

“If ICE can’t arrest them without a warrant, that really limits the use of racial profiling,” said Mark Fleming, a lawyer at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which represented the plaintiffs.

Judge Cummings highlighted the importance of probable cause after a recent Supreme Court interim ruling that allowed immigration authorities to continue to stop people and question them based on factors like their ethnicity.

“Citizens, non-citizens with legal status, and foreign nationals are interwoven throughout ICE’S Chicago Area of Responsibility and American society in general,” Judge Cummings wrote. Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, he wrote, U.S. citizens and legal residents could now be questioned or detained for sharing “commonalities” like ethnicity and language with “Latino foreign nationals.”

That, he said, heightens the need for ICE agents to show probable cause.

Mr. Fleming praised the decision. “We’re seeing more people who have deep community ties — families, loved ones, people with jobs, some of them U.S. citizens — being taken into ICE custody,” he said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an email that the department “complies with all lawful court orders and is addressing this matter with the court.”

The order focuses on the arrest of 22 individuals. Eleven of them were working at a restaurant in Liberty, Mo., when ICE took them into custody on Feb. 7, less than a month after Mr. Trump returned to office.

Judge Cummings found that ICE did not have reason to believe that the individuals were “reasonably likely” to escape before the agency could obtain a warrant, in violation of a consent agreement that the agency had entered into in 2022, when President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was still in office.

In the agreement, ICE denied the plaintiffs’ allegations and did not admit to any wrongdoing by its officers.

According to the plaintiffs, another 11 people were arrested in violation of the agreement in the Chicago area and were taken into custody by ICE.

Rather than extend the 2022 agreement for another three years, as the plaintiffs had asked, Judge Cummings extended it by 118 days. None of the 22 arrestees are still in custody, but the order requires ICE to “lift any imposed conditions” of their release. The court also required ICE to again send out a policy statement explaining the legal requirements to make an arrest to all ICE officers nationwide.

Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes dismissed the case against the two protesters, Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo, on Wednesday morning after prosecutors said in a hearing that they had not secured an indictment.

Richard S. Kling, a lawyer who represented Mr. Collins, called the failure to secure an indictment “highly unusual.”

Grand jurors consider evidence presented by prosecutors and the witnesses they choose to present — not from the defense or the people accused — during secret proceedings. Unlike in a criminal trial, where juries must reach a unanimous verdict, only a simple majority of the grand jury is required to issue an indictment.

Mr. Kling cited the legal adage maintaining that the threshold for securing an indictment is so low that a grand jury would readily indict a ham sandwich. “Obviously, they didn’t have enough for a ham sandwich here,” he said.

Other grand juries have also bucked federal prosecutors seeking to crack down on those who have stood in the way of the government’s aggressive immigration enforcement campaign.

In August, a federal grand jury in Washington declined to indict a man who was facing felony assault charges for lobbing a sandwich that struck a federal agent. Days earlier, federal prosecutors in Washington downgraded charges against a woman accused of assaulting an F.B.I. agent during a protest after failing to persuade three grand juries to indict her on felony charges.

The latest case involved the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., a small suburb west of Chicago, which has been the site of protests since the Department of Homeland Security began focusing on the Chicago area about a month ago, in an operation it calls Midway Blitz.

Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo were among those protesting outside the facility on the evening of Sept. 27. According to the criminal complaint, Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo, who are engaged, were part of a group that scuffled with law enforcement officials as they sought to push protesters away from the building.

As agents sought to restrain Mr. Collins, “he resisted, struggling with agents,” which caused an injury to the thumb of a federal agent, according to the complaint. Mr. Collins and Ms. Robledo were both armed during the scuffle, with weapons that they had permits for, according to prosecutors.

Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Chicago, declined to say whether the office would present the case to a new grand jury.

Mr. Kling said he was heartened that grand jurors had reined in prosecutors in cases involving acts of protest.

“I’m gratified the grand jury stood up for the First Amendment in reaction to what is going on in the streets of this country,” he said.

Ms. Noem and other federal leaders have said the situation around the ICE building, where demonstrators typically stand or sit on the sidewalks and sometimes attempt to block cars from entering or leaving, must change.

“We want more security at the building, a bigger buffer zone to keep our officers safe,” she told Fox News Tuesday evening, adding that she didn’t want to “let the anarchists run this city anymore.”

Ms. Noem came to Portland with a list of demands, which were laid out in a letter the U.S. attorney for Oregon gave to Portland’s police chief on Tuesday. Among them: The federal government wants the city police to create a buffer zone of limited access around the building at least one block in radius, establish “free speech zones” to limit where demonstrators can gather, insure that federal agents can enter and leave the building without interference and prioritize responding to “any call for assistance based on threats to federal property or persons.”

Local elected officials acknowledged that their conversations with the secretary, held at Portland International Airport and at the ICE building, were direct and, at times, uncomfortable.

“I’m glad she had time for me,” Tina Kotek, Oregon’s governor, said in an interview. “I think it’s important that she’s here to see what is going on. And, hopefully, she’ll come away with the understanding that this is not an insurrection or a rebellion or whatever else the president is saying.”

Mayor Keith Wilson of Portland responded to Ms. Noem’s demands on Wednesday with a letter to her general counsel. He did not directly address her request for a larger buffer zone around the building or designated areas for protests, but did note that deciding how to handle political demonstrations was the responsibility of the city, not the federal government.

He also raised a point that was not in the U.S. attorney’s letter but came up in conversations between local and federal leaders: The city could take over the lease or outright buy the ICE building, and the processing ICE does there could be relocated.

“Given the operational challenges and expense this facility likely demands, we believe this may be a mutually beneficial solution in the best interests of all parties and stakeholders,” Mr. Wilson wrote.

The governor and mayor also said they also made their own requests: that federal agents abide by Oregon laws regarding how and when law enforcement can use force, including tear gas.

Ms. Noem told Fox News that she was dealing with “a bunch of pansies” in her talks with elected officials in Oregon and was “extremely disappointed” by her conversation with Mr. Wilson.

“I told him that if he did not follow through on some of these security measures for our officers,” she said, “we are going to cover him up with more federal resources and that we were going to send four times the amount of federal officers here so that the people of Portland can have some safety.”

The scene at the ICE building when Ms. Noem visited on Tuesday was calm. About a dozen demonstrators, including a woman in a bear costume and sombrero and a man in a chicken onesie, were outnumbered by journalists. The police had cordoned off a one-block area around the facility, so Ms. Noem’s only view of the protests came when she surveyed the scene from the roof of the building — alongside some federal employees and several conservative influencers — and when her motorcade entered and exited the building.

The Portland police continued to keep a one block radius around the building closed to the public on Wednesday morning, but a department spokesperson said the area would be reopened to the public later in the day. Overnight, the police removed a sidewalk camp that protesters had been using for several months.

A Federal District Court judge, Karin Immergut, has temporarily blocked President Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard soldiers to protect the ICE building. An appeal in that case is underway at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.

Mr. Trump has activated the Guard several times this year in Democratic-led cities, in what he has called a crackdown on crime and as part of his escalating immigration enforcement tactics.

Here is an overview of what the National Guard typically does and how Mr. Trump is currently deploying the force in the United States.

What is the National Guard?

Tracing its history to the Massachusetts militia in 1636, the National Guard is a component of the U.S. military that has state and federal missions and traditionally operates under the jurisdiction of governors under Title 32 of the U.S. Code.

By comparison, the active-duty military operates under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, and the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act makes it a crime to use the regular military as a domestic police force in most circumstances.

Who is in charge of it?

The chief of the National Guard Bureau, which administers two organizations — the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard — was a job for a three-star general until recent years.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress elevated the job to a four-star position in 2008 and made the chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2011.

The current chief of the National Guard Bureau is Gen. Steven S. Nordhaus of the Air Force.

Operationally, the Guard troops currently being sent into U.S. cities are under the command of Gen. Gregory M. Guillot of U.S. Northern Command, a four-star general who takes his orders from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Where are Guard units located?

The Army National Guard and the Air National Guard have units in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

How large is the force, and what does it do?

More than 430,000 soldiers and airmen serve in the National Guard and operate akin to a reserve component of the active-duty force, typically reporting for duty one weekend a month and two weeks a year.

Beyond those obligations, they can be mobilized on active duty for specific periods by a state or territorial governor for support operations such as responding to natural disasters or civil unrest.

The White House can mobilize Guard troops under Title 10 of the U.S. Code for national missions — including overseas deployment to serve in wars — over the objection of state and territorial governors. (The District of Columbia National Guard reports to the federal government, as the capital does not have a governor.)

The Guard also participates in training foreign allies and partners in more than 100 countries under the State Partnership Program, which evolved from a Cold War-era initiative to help former Soviet states operate their own military forces as newly democratic nations. Troops participating in the program often spend their two weeks of active federal service deployed to a partner nation, working with the same units to build relationships over repeat visits.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Ukrainian military leaders often turned to their longtime partners in the California National Guard for assistance.

Has the federal government mobilized Guard troops for domestic missions before?

Yes.

The Guard has been federally mobilized at least 10 times since World War II, according to a recent Guard document.

Five of the mobilizations were in support of racial desegregation efforts and the protection of civil rights: at schools in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957-58; Oxford, Miss., in 1962; twice in Alabama in 1963, and again in 1965 to protect civil rights marchers from Selma to Montgomery. Until this year, the 1965 mobilization was the last time a president federalized a state’s National Guard without the cooperation of a governor.

Three federal Guard mobilizations were in response to riots: in Detroit in 1967; in multiple cities in 1968 after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; and in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers who had assaulted Rodney King, a Black motorist.

Another federal mobilization was in response to a strike by Postal Service workers in New York in 1970, and another was to restore order in the U.S. Virgin Islands after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.

Have domestic deployments gone badly before?

Yes.

In 1970, the mobilization of Guard soldiers by Gov. James A. Rhodes, Republican of Ohio, ended tragically when troops opened fire on students who were peacefully protesting the Vietnam War on the campus of Kent State University. The soldiers killed four students and wounded nine unarmed protesters, who were all in their late teens and early 20s.

Neither the governor nor any of the Guardsmen who shot students were found criminally liable for the shootings.

How many Guard troops are federally mobilized right now?

The exact number is unclear.

According to the National Guard Bureau, its troops can have dozens of federal missions at any given time to include “disaster relief, defense support of civilian authorities, training missions” and “community engagement.”

The bureau on Monday referred questions about the number of troops who are currently deployed on the order of the president to the Army component of U.S. Northern Command, which then referred questions to the defense secretary’s office.

The defense secretary’s press office on Tuesday referred those questions back to the Guard task force in Washington, D.C., and to a U.S. Northern Command website for what it calls the “federal protective mission” in the United States.

Here’s what we do know: In June, 2,000 members of the California National Guard were mobilized to Los Angeles to quell immigration protests. In July, Mr. Trump authorized the deployment of Guard troops to immigration facilities in 20 states.

In August, Mr. Trump federalized the local police in Washington and mobilized troops to fight crime, even though violent crime was falling in the city. Later that month, he directed the Defense Department to create a mobile Guard unit that could be sent anywhere in the country for “ensuring public safety and order.”

In September, the president signed an order authorizing the use of the National Guard in Memphis and said he would consider similar deployments in Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans.

As of Oct. 1, there were still nearly 2,200 Guard troops deployed in Washington, with more than 950 from the D.C. National Guard. A majority of the troops patrolling the capital are normally based in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota and West Virginia.

Late Sunday, a federal judge blocked Mr. Trump from sending California National Guard troops to Portland, Ore. Texas National Guard troops arrived in the Chicago area on Tuesday and were expected to deploy by Wednesday.

Do Guard troops on federal orders still get paid during the government shutdown?

The National Guard receives state and federal funding, but troops are paid by their state legislatures when mobilized by governors. Those on federal orders will not be paid until congressional funding is restored.

Arguments made by Mr. Trump’s Justice Department, she continued, “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”

Hours earlier, after a Friday hearing before Judge Immergut, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who is the architect of Mr. Trump’s push to deploy U.S. soldiers on their own soil, said the problem lay elsewhere. “Far-left Democrat judges,” he said, were obstructing the administration’s attempt to “dismantle terrorism and terror networks.”

But Judge Immergut is anything but a far-left judge. When Mr. Trump first nominated her to the federal bench in 2018, she arrived with strong conservative credentials, and her career shows a willingness to pursue cases no matter which party’s ox is gored. As a lawyer during the 1990s, she served under Ken Starr during his investigation of President Bill Clinton.

She personally questioned Monica Lewinsky about the details of her affair with Mr. Clinton before a grand jury, successfully eliciting fine-grained specifics of their sexual encounters that critics would later call salacious when they appeared in Mr. Starr’s report.

During the next two decades, she built a career as a federal prosecutor, first in California and then in Oregon. She prosecuted white-collar fraudsters, money launderers and drug traffickers. In 2003, she was chosen by President George W. Bush to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, supervising dozens of prosecutors and overseeing high-profile terrorism cases.

As a prosecutor, Judge Immergut was “incredibly hard-working” and “apolitical in her approach,” said Billy J. Williams, who has known her since the 1990s and also went on to lead Oregon’s U.S. Attorney’s Office, first under President Obama and then continuing through Mr. Trump’s first term. “When she’s on the bench, she’s an incredible listener who isn’t afraid, in the moment, to either make a statement or ask deeper questions. She’s always prepared.”

Scott Asphaug, who also worked under Judge Immergut during her time as Oregon’s chief federal prosecutor, said she told her team to “do the right thing, for the right reason.”

“Our job was not simply to win,” he said. “Our job was to act in a judicious and just manner.”

In an emergency hearing on Sunday night, Judge Immergut clarified her restraining order, barring the administration from sending in National Guard troops from any other state. Having already ruled that President Trump lacked a legal basis for sending the military, she warned the administration could be “in direct contravention” of her order, citing reports that troops from Texas and California could soon be on their way.

“Aren’t defendants simply circumventing my order?” she asked. “Why is this appropriate?”

Like Judge Immergut, Mr. Williams was working out of the Mark O. Hatfield Courthouse in downtown Portland in the summer of 2020. That was when Attorney General Bill Barr sent federal agents to Portland to deal with crowds who had gathered around the courthouse to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police.

Mr. Williams said that while parts of downtown Portland did resemble a “war zone” back in 2020, the circumstances of the current protests, which are smaller in scale and concentrated around an ICE building in South Portland, were “vastly different.”

“I don’t fault ICE for doing their work,” he said. “I believe in law and order. And people get to protest it, so long as that’s done in a lawful manner. It’s a careful balance.”

Judge Immergut’s ruling, he said, “was based on the facts of 2025, not 2020; what’s happening now is nothing like what happened then.”

The judge has not yet made a final ruling on the merits of the case. Her temporary restraining order will expire later this month, and a trial is scheduled in Portland for the morning of October 29.

The Trump administration has appealed Judge Immergut’s initial ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. And on social media, Mr. Miller is not letting Judge Immergut’s conservative background interfere with his attacks on the legitimacy of her rulings. Her order, he wrote, amounted to an attempt to “nullify the 2024 election by fiat.” On Monday, he called her a “district court judge with no conceivable authority, whatsoever, to restrict the President,” and an “Oregon judge.”

On Sunday, Mr. Trump addressed his selection of Judge Immergut more directly, telling reporters that “if they put judges like that on, I wasn’t well-served by the people who picked judges.”

But while he seemed to be cognizant of the fact that one of his nominees had ruled against him, his awareness did not extend to that judge’s gender. Mr. Trump repeatedly referred to Judge Immergut as “he” and “him.”

“That judge ought to be ashamed of himself,” he said.

Essential federal employees, including military personnel and ICE agents, must continue to work without pay during the shutdown.

While workers are entitled to back pay after the shutdown ends, President Trump has suggested some furloughed employees may not ""deserve"" it.

One week into the government shutdown and the country has already seen significant impacts on federal agencies. So far, there have been over 750,000 furloughed workers, air travel delays due to an air traffic controller shortage and reduced services at Social Security offices.

Now, military service members may not get paid.

As the ongoing stalemate in Congress lingers, paychecks for military service members and civilian contractors are on the line. Payments set to be issued on Oct. 15 may not be sent out if lawmakers don't reach an agreement. Legislation would have to be passed by Oct. 13 (Columbus Day) to process payments for troops to be paid on time, according to Reuters.

More than 1 million active-duty military, as well as hundreds of thousands of active National Guard members and civilians who work for the Department of Defense (DOD), would be affected. Military personnel still have to work during a government shutdown.

Here's who will and won't get paid during the shutdown.

What happens if military members don't receive Oct. 15 paychecks?

Service members must continue to work during a government shutdown, but that doesn't mean they will get paid during that time.

In many cases, payment is delayed until after the shutdown ends, but service members are entitled to back pay, a move signed into law by President Trump in 2019 to compensate active-duty military members and furloughed employees for back pay once the government reopens. While troops did get paid on Oct. 1, future missed payments may present financial hardships to military families.

However, Trump has since said this week that some furloughed federal workers “don’t deserve” back pay and has threatened mass layoffs and widespread cuts to government programs, USA TODAY reports.

Does ICE get paid during the government shutdown?

The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which operates under the Department of Homeland Security, will also continue working since it is deemed ""essential"" to government operations.

Like DOD military members, ICE agents do not receive paychecks during the shutdown but are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends.

Will the National Guard get paid during the government shutdown?

Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists are expected to remain on duty without pay, Indianapolis Star reports, but will receive back pay after the shutdown.

Who continues working, getting paid in a government shutdown?

Essential workers are still on the clock. They must continue working without pay, and they typically aren't eligible to collect unemployment benefits. Here's who continues working, per the Indianapolis Star:

Active-duty military: Active-duty military, National Guard and reservists remain on duty without pay.

Air travel: Transportation Security Administration agents at airports and air-traffic controllers are required to work without pay.

Border Patrol and ICE: Border Patrol officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, and customs officials will keep working without pay.

Federal law enforcement: The FBI, CIA, DEA and Secret Service stay on the job without pay.

IRS: Employees at the IRS worked during the first five days of the shutdown, according to a contingency plan the agency posted Sept. 30, by tapping into funds already authorized by Congress.

Mail: The U.S. Postal Service remains open. It doesn't depend on Congress for funding, so postal employees will still get paid throughout the government shutdown.

Prisons: Correctional officers at U.S. prisons keep working without pay.

""Non-essential"" staff at national parks, NASA, the Department of Education and other government positions may either be furloughed or laid off in staffing cuts during the government shutdown.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/08/USAT/86580929007-20251008-t-011023-z-278100572-rc-277-hamejkt-rtrmadp-3-usatrumpchicago.JPG?crop=3999,2250,x0,y208&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-08 18:56:41.516676

In a letter written to Congress on Wednesday, the signatories condemned a series of recent US strikes on boats in the Caribbean, including at least three originating from Venezuela, that have killed more than 20 people since September. The strikes are the first lethal US military operations in the Caribbean in decades, part of what the Trump administration calls a fight against “narcoterrorism”.

“The Trump administration has not provided any valid legal justification for these strikes or any evidence to substantiate its claims that the victims were an imminent threat to the security of the United States,” the letter said.

Signed by nearly 60 organisations – including Oxfam America, Human Rights First, Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns and the American Friends Service Committee – the letter called on members of Congress to block what it described as unauthorised and illegal uses of force.

“We fear, barring decisive action by members of Congress, there will be more strikes, more extrajudicial killings, and potentially a full-blown limitless war with one or more countries in the region, with likely devastating humanitarian and geopolitical consequences,” the letter said.

The appeal was issued before a War Powers Resolution introduced by Senators Tim Kaine and Adam Schiff was expected to reach the Senate floor on Wednesday. Schiff said he and Kaine will force a vote to block the government from carrying out lethal strikes against vessels in the Caribbean.

Escalation and legal concerns

The New York Times reported in July that Trump signed a secret directive authorising the possibility of “direct military operations at sea and on foreign soil against cartels”.

Within weeks, US Navy warships and aircraft and more than 4,000 soldiers were deployed to the southern Caribbean. Two weeks later, the first of four strikes occurred.

To justify the escalation, the administration labelled certain regional groups like Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang as “foreign terrorist organisations” and “specially designated global terrorists”. However, legal experts noted these designations do not authorise the use of military force overseas.

Administration officials have defended the escalation as a counternarcotics mission, insisting that the targeted vessels were linked to drug trafficking and “terrorist organisations”.

But according to the Washington Office on Latin America and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, about 90 percent of US-bound cocaine transits the eastern Pacific and western Caribbean, not near Venezuela’s coast. The Drug Enforcement Agency likewise reported that fentanyl entering the US is produced in Mexico using precursor chemicals from China, not Venezuela.

At the Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia this week, Trump told reporters that if traffickers “aren’t coming by sea any more”, US forces might “move the fight onto land”.

Regime change fears

As the administration’s rhetoric has increasingly blurred the line between targeting drug traffickers and targeting the Venezuelan state itself, civil society groups are arguing that the strikes are part of a broader strategy aimed at regime change in Venezuela. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has long advocated for regime change there, has referred to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government as a cartel “masquerading as a government” and branded him a fugitive from US justice, offering up to a $50m reward for his capture.

However, internal documents obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation confirmed that US intelligence agencies acknowledged Maduro’s government is “not directing [Venezuela’s] Tren de Aragua’s operations in the United States”.

Alex Main, director of international policy of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, warned that Trump’s campaign “could soon be directed at Venezuela in an attempt to incite violent regime change” and other countries, such as Mexico or Panama, could also face US intervention with “potentially disastrous consequences” for the region.

Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House of Representatives have also stated that “Trump and Rubio are pushing for regime change in Venezuela,” adding: “The American people don’t want another war – and Congress can’t let any president start one illegally or unilaterally. That’s not how the Constitution works.”

Elizabeth Tregaskis Gordon, senior policy advisor for LAC at Oxfam America, told Al Jazeera that many Venezuelans are already “living through crisis” and warned that an increase in US military would disrupt humanitarian work in the country.

“Many cannot access basic necessities to survive, while they face rising prices for consumer goods and increasing food insecurity,” she said. “Worsening of the humanitarian crisis will only lead to more chaos and disruption; current US military action is unconstitutional, violates the UN charter, and should cease immediately. ”

Faith communities take a stand

“War is always a defeat,” Susan Gunn, director of the Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, told Al Jazeera. “When such killing is aimed at civilians with no due process, it violates the sacredness of human life and undermines basic human rights and the rule of law.”

The letter her group and others wrote to Congress also warns that further escalation could worsen Latin America’s largest modern displacement crisis, deepening the suffering of millions of people who have already fled Venezuela.

The signatories urged Congress to reverse the military build-up, investigate civilian deaths and pursue diplomacy.

The Friends Committee on National Legislation’s general secretary, Bridget Moix, added: “War is not the answer at home or abroad.”

“In these unprecedented times,” the letter concluded, “it is critical that the US Congress reclaim its constitutional powers.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/reuters_68e6a230-1759945264.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-08 18:56:38.084655

“I invited them to repentance,” Black told Religion News Service.
I invited them to come and receive that salvation, and be part of the kingdom that is coming.” Black is not alone, according to the lawsuit.
Hannah Kardon, a United Methodist pastor who leads United Church of Rogers Park in Chicago, told Religion News Service that ICE agents fired several rounds of pepper balls against her, including while she was praying with her eyes closed and hands lifted.
More than 30 agents have been injured during protests, “including multiple hospitalizations,” and more than 50 people were arrested, according to government lawyers.","A Presbyterian minister in Chicago is suing Donald Trump’s administration after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were captured in viral video firing pepper balls at his head during protests against the president’s anti-immigration agenda.

The Rev. David Black joined a lawsuit with Chicago reporters and protesters accusing the administration of unconstitutional threats to their First Amendment rights and religious freedoms with “a pattern of extreme brutality” designed to “silence the press and civilians.”

Last month, Black — dressed in black and wearing a clerical collar while standing with demonstrators — was hit with chemical agents while praying in front of an ICE facility in Broadview, a Chicago suburb that has emerged as a flashpoint for protests against the administration as the president deploys National Guard troops to Illinois.

“I invited them to repentance,” Black told Religion News Service. “I basically offered an altar call. I invited them to come and receive that salvation, and be part of the kingdom that is coming.”

Black is not alone, according to the lawsuit. Agents “dressed in full combat gear” have “indiscriminately” tossed flash grenades and tear gas and fired guns loaded with chemical irritants and rubber bullets against demonstrators in the Chicago area, the complaint says.

Protesters and reporters have faced “serious injuries” and “some are being randomly singled out for arrest” and detained inside the ICE facility where they “are detained incommunicado for hours,” according to the complaint.

“No legitimate purpose exists for this brutality or for these arrests,” lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote. “The officers are not physically threatened. No government property is threatened. Defendants are acting to intimidate and silence the press and civilians engaged in protected First Amendment activities.”

Black, the senior pastor at the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago in Woodlawn, was “offering prayers and urging ICE officers stationed on the roof of the Broadview ICE facility to repent from their unnecessarily brutal enforcement of the immigration laws” before officers fired at him, according to the lawsuit.

In footage from the scene on September 19, a person wearing a helmet moves in front of Black before ICE officers on the roof above them “suddenly and without warning” shot pepper balls that struck the top of Black’s head and exploded into a puff of white powder.

Black then falls to his knees in pain. Moments later, officers on the street sprayed him with tear gas, according to the complaint.

The lawsuit also accuses the Trump administration of violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which states that the government “shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.”

Officers’ practice of targeting Black and other clergy “substantially burdens their exercise of religion,” according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit also cites an incident involving the Rev. Beth Johnson, an ordained minister in the Unitarian Church, who was “fired upon without warning or justification as she and other protesters and clergy members stood on the sidewalk singing ‘We Shall Overcome’ and other traditional songs of protest,” the filing says.

The Rev. Hannah Kardon, a United Methodist pastor who leads United Church of Rogers Park in Chicago, told Religion News Service that ICE agents fired several rounds of pepper balls against her, including while she was praying with her eyes closed and hands lifted.

“We’re a faith of immigrants — Jesus was an immigrant,” she told the outlet. “But to me, this is basic created-being stuff. When you see what is happening here, your whole body and heart resists it because it’s fundamentally wrong.”

A growing number of faith leaders are speaking out against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign and the aggressive law enforcement response to demonstrations against it, including Pope Leo XIV and prominent Catholic leaders across the United States.

Lawyers for the Trump administration have accused the plaintiffs of trying to “dictate crowd-control policy in ways that would tie the hands of federal law enforcement officers … even in circumstances of imminent danger and would risk bogging this court down in micro-management of crowd-control decisions.”

“These inflexible and vague constraints are untenable on their face,” lawyers for Homeland Security wrote Wednesday.

More than 30 agents have been injured during protests, “including multiple hospitalizations,” and more than 50 people were arrested, according to government lawyers.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/08/18/42/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-1-59-29-PM.png?trim=139,0,36,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-08 20:57:42.549809

Chicago, the largest city in Illinois and third-largest in the country, has become the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration’s drive to deport millions of immigrants, which has prompted allegations of rights abuses and myriad lawsuits.

The operation is being led by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose masked agents have surged into several Democratic-led cities to conduct raids, stoking outrage among many residents and protests outside federal facilities.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump posted Wednesday on his Truth Social platform.

Local officials argue that city and state law enforcement are sufficient to handle the protests, but Trump claims the military is needed to keep federal agents safe, heightening concerns among his critics of growing authoritarianism.

After National Guard deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, 200 troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday.

An immigration enforcement building outside Chicago has also been the site of clashes between federal agents and protesters.

“The federal government has not communicated with us in any way about their troop movements,” Pritzker told reporters in Chicago. “I can’t believe I have to say ‘troop movements’ in an American city, but that is what we’re talking about here.”

A judge will have a role in determining how many boots are on the streets: There’s a court hearing Thursday on a request by Illinois and Chicago to declare the National Guard deployment illegal.

‘Stand up and speak out’

Trump’s attacks on Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, both Democrats, follow similar extraordinary public calls by the president for his political opponents to face legal charges.

They come on the same day that former FBI director James Comey was arraigned on charges of lying to Congress – an indictment which came just days after Trump urged his attorney general to take action against him and others.

Pritzker, seen as a potential Democratic candidate in the 2028 presidential election, has become one of Trump’s most fiery critics.

He pledged Wednesday to “not back down,” listing a litany of grievances against Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“Making people feel they need to carry citizenship papers. Invading our state with military troops. Sending in war helicopters in the middle of the night,” he wrote on X.

“What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?” he asked. “We must all stand up and speak out.”

By “war helicopters”, Pritzker was referring to a major raid last week in which Black Hawk helicopters descended on a Chicago housing complex.

Dozens of people were arrested in the surprise operation, according to the Trump administration, but US media reported that American citizens were detained for hours.

Mayor Johnson has since announced “ICE-free zones” where city-owned property will be declared off-limits to federal authorities.

Johnson accused Republicans of wanting “a rematch of the Civil War”.

Trump’s immigration crackdown is aimed at fulfilling a key election pledge to rid the country of what he called waves of foreign “criminals”.

Trump has nonetheless faced some legal setbacks, including a federal judge in Oregon blocking his bid to deploy troops in Portland, saying his descriptions of an emergency there were false and that the US is a “nation of Constitutional law, not martial law”.

Trump says he could invoke the rarely used Insurrection Act to force deployments of troops around the country if courts or local officials are “holding us up”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25280665815461-1759868765.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-08 17:57:58.107312

Lawmakers said Graphite can gain unauthorized access to mobile phone encrypted applications, location data, messages, and photographs.

“Given the Trump Administration’s disregard for constitutional rights and civil liberties in pursuit of rapid mass deportation, we are seriously concerned that ICE will abuse Graphite software to target immigrants, people of color, and individuals who express opposition to ICE’s repeated attacks on the rule of law,” the lawmakers wrote.

Lawmakers noted that while Paragon claims it has safeguards in place to protect against civil liberty and privacy violations, it comes with the ability for “zero-click” access to messaging apps and has been used to spy on journalists and human rights activists.

Allowing ICE officers to use this spyware could threaten Americans’ freedom of speech and movement, lawmakers warned.

“Allowing ICE to utilize spyware raises serious questions about whether ICE will respect Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure for people residing in the U.S.,” stated the letter.

The representatives gave Noem until Oct. 20 to provide details on all ICE records on its use of spyware, including Paragon’s Graphite tool, internal legal justifications for deploying such technology in immigration enforcement, and a list of surveillance targets and ICE’s domestic spying strategy.

They also asked whether the Department of Homeland Security had evaluated how the use of Graphite may violate an executive order that prohibits the operational use of commercial spyware that may pose counterintelligence or security risks to the federal government.

About 200 members from multiple units in the Texas National Guard and 300 members from units in the Illinois National Guard have been activated and sent to the Chicago area, the statement said. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has denounced the deployment as an unconstitutional invasion.

The troops are stationed at the Army Reserve center in Elwood, outside Joliet, about an hour southwest of Chicago.

“These forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,” U.S. Northern Command said in its statement.

On Monday, the state of Illinois and city of Chicago sued to block the Trump administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago.

In a statement Sunday, ahead of the National Guard’s arrival, Pritzker said, “We must now start calling this what it is: Trump’s Invasion.”

“It started with federal agents, it will soon include deploying federalized members of the Illinois National Guard against our wishes, and it will now involve sending in another state’s military troops,” he said.

​“The brave men and women who serve in our national guards must not be used as political props,” he said. “This is a moment where every American must speak up and help stop this madness.”

President Donald Trump said Wednesday on Truth Social that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson “should be in jail” in an escalation of his conflict with the two Democratic officials.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” he said in the post. “Governor Pritzker also!”

Trump has threatened for weeks to send troops to Chicago as part of a crime-fighting and immigration effort, and Democrats have pushed back and said any deployment would be politically motivated against his perceived enemies and an overreach of authority.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.

Pritzker responded to Trump on X, saying, “I will not back down.”

“Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power,” he said. “What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”

Reached for comment, Johnson said, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested.”

“I’m not going anywhere,” he added.

The Trump administration is also seeking to send the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, but a judge granted a temporary restraining order over the weekend to block the move as the case is considered in court.

A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday granted an administrative stay of Judge Karin Immergut’s ruling Saturday and will allow for the federalization of Oregon National Guard members. The ruling did not address the deployment of those members in Portland, which is expected to be addressed at a hearing Thursday.

The emergency administrative ruling stands, while the appeals process in the case continues.

A Pentagon spokesperson said the troops would have worked to support ICE and other federal personnel, as well as protect federal property.

On Tuesday, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek directed U.S. Northern Command to demobilize Oregon’s 200 National Guard troops and return another 200 California National Guard members to their state.

Referring to the judge’s decision temporarily blocking Trump from sending the National Guard into Portland, Kotek said in a statement, “Immergut’s orders are a clear and forceful rebuttal to President Trump’s misuse of states’ National Guard.”

“Thus, I am directing Northern Command to send Oregon’s citizen-soldiers home from Camp Rilea immediately,” she said. “Let’s remember that these Oregonians are our neighbors and friends, who have been unlawfully uprooted from their family and careers — they deserve better than this.”

It was unclear whether Kotek’s letter to U.S. Northern Command would have any effect. The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment about legal standing for directing Northern Command to send troops home. Northern Command also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to block Immergut’s order while the case makes its way through the courts, arguing her ruling “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.” Attorneys for the state contend her order should stay in place. The 9th Circuit court is scheduled to hear both sides’ arguments at a hearing Thursday.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251008-national-guard-gk-914415.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:58:16.022377

Since Trump returned to office in January, federal immigration officers have conducted sweeping raids in communities across the country. According to the latest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, the agency has removed more than 71,405 people this year.

The operations have sparked widespread protests and fears from migrant communities and their supporters. The crackdown has also been met with various legal challenges.

Mark Seitz, the bishop of El Paso, Texas, told Reuters that the pope is “very personally concerned about these matters” and “expressed his desire that the U.S. Bishops’ Conference would speak strongly on this issue.”

The Hill has reached out to the Vatican to confirm the pope’s remarks. The White House referred The Hill to press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s response disputing Leo’s stance from last week.

Last month, Leo said that those who are against abortion but in support of the “inhuman treatment of immigrants” in the U.S. are not “pro-life.”

“Someone who says, ‘I’m against abortion’ but says, ‘I’m in favor of the death penalty,’ is not really pro-life,” the pope told reporters, via EWTN News. “Someone who says that, ‘I’m against abortion but I’m in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,’ I don’t know if that’s pro-life.”

On Tuesday, the Vatican announced that the pope will make the first international trip of his papacy to Turkey and Lebanon from Nov. 27 to Dec. 2.

“Lawful permanent residence was always considered secure — almost unassailable,” Nia said. “To see people who have lived and worked here for years suddenly detained or deported with little to no process is alarming. ICE appears to be acting unlawfully in many of these cases, without proper judicial oversight.""

US media reported this week that two Iranian green card holders were arrested in recent months by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in cases apparently involving minor crimes.

The administration of US President Donald Trump has stepped up efforts to detain and deport some green card holders citing past crimes or political activity at odds with its values. Most of the cases are being contested in courts.

Under US immigration law, green-card holders can only be deported in limited circumstances, such as when they commit certain crimes, falsify immigration documents, or remain outside the country for extended periods.

Nia said what is happening now goes far exceeds those bounds.

“Deporting Iranians who fled repression — or sending them to third countries like Sudan or Somalia — violates both international law and America’s own treaty obligations,” she said.

“This normalization of lawlessness should concern every American.”

In Los Angeles, NBC News reported that Sharareh Moghaddam, a small-business owner who had already passed her citizenship exam, was detained after attending what she thought was a routine immigration appointment. Her husband, Hooshang Aghdassi, said she had entered the country legally and had no record of wrongdoing.

“She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,” Aghdassi told NBC. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.”

ICE rejected that account, telling NBC Los Angeles in a written statement that reports claiming Moghaddam had no criminal history were “completely FALSE.” The agency described her as “an Iranian native and citizen with a documented criminal history dating back to 2015,” citing two theft convictions between 2015 and 2019, and concluded that she was “subject to removal under US immigration law.”

Newseek reported last month Reza Zavvar, a 52-year-old green card holder in Maryland who has lived in the United States for four decades, was detained for seventy-seven days by ICE in a case related to a marijuana charge in the nineties.

Zavvar, who first came to the country as a child, described his treatment as “unnecessary, inhumane, corrupt.”

“Saying that you can stay here as long as you don’t get in trouble, that you stay clean and just stay here, work, pay taxes — and that’s what I was doing,” Zavvar told the news outlet.

Iranians sent back from US without consent, lawyer says

More recently, 120 Iranians — including political dissidents and Christian converts — were deported to Tehran.

This comes after The New York Times reported that the operation followed “months of negotiations” between Washington and Iranian officials, and that the deportees were flown aboard US-chartered aircraft that left from a military airport in Louisiana, stopped in Puerto Rico to collect more passengers, and continued to Doha before their transfer to Iran.

Immigration attorney Ali Herischi, of Herischi & Associates in Maryland, told Iran International that two of his clients were among those deported against their will. “Their belongings — including their files, evidence and cell phones — have been handed to Iranian authorities. That’s very dangerous,” Herischi said.

He added that some detainees were given a stark choice: “ICE would say, ‘either you consent to deportation to Iran, or we send you to Somalia or Sudan.’ It was, ‘pick your poison.’ In the case of my clients, they didn’t even get that. They just said, ‘you’re done, let’s go.’”

Another Iranian national, Erfan Qaneifard, a political activist and writer, has been held for six months at the Prairieland Detention Center in Texas.

His lawyer, Masoud Peyma, told Iran International that ICE contacted Iran’s Interests Section in Washington seeking travel papers to deport him. “The risk is real. If he is sent back, his life will be in danger,” Peyma said. “There is no reason for him to remain in detention after six months.”

Iranian political activist held in Texas faces risk of deportation, lawyer says

For Nia, these cases expose a broader collapse of process and accountability within the immigration system.

“It’s the normalization of a lack of process — the idea that even a green card, or eventually citizenship, could become conditional on political speech,” she said. “That’s authoritarianism creeping into the system.”

Civil-rights groups echoed those concerns, warning that forced returns could endanger vulnerable Iranians.

“Asylum seekers now face the possibility of being returned to a country where they have a well-founded fear of persecution,” the Iranian American Legal Defense Fund, Pars Equality Center, and the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans said in a joint statement.

“This runs against core American values as a nation based on hope, freedom, and liberty that has long welcomed people facing oppression who, in turn, have contributed mightily to America,"" the statement read.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to Iran International requests for comment on these cases.","https://i.iranintl.com/images/rdk9umy0/production/d02fe36364552a6b8e68cf690c36ff9219e2a390-876x642.png?rect=31,99,845,444&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=max&auto=format",N,,2025-10-08 19:57:37.756370

Bier,,,,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ice-agents-assaults-deportations-trump-biden-rcna236023,"According to the Trump administration, ICE agents suffered about 90% fewer assaults under President Joe Biden than under President Donald Trump.

This nearly matches DHS’ claimed 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE agents this year over last year.
DHS agents in masks have been told to “go out on the streets” and detain random people to see whether they are here illegally.
Humane immigration policy, focused on public safety threats, would also increase public support for ICE operations, reducing hostility in the community.","This weekend, Immigration and Customs Enforcement accused me — a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute — of causing assaults on its agents. I’m just the latest in a long line of people — mayors, governors, members of Congress and more — whom ICE has blamed for a rise in violent confrontations with their deportation agents.

In fact, ICE is endangering its own agents. According to the Trump administration, ICE agents suffered about 90% fewer assaults under President Joe Biden than under President Donald Trump. Biden’s ICE better protected agents by adopting interior enforcement policies that reduced chaotic interactions with the public.

This weekend, ICE accused me — a policy scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute — of causing assaults on its agents.

Trump’s Department of Homeland Security is doing the opposite, demanding agents conduct operations in ways they’ve rarely done before. According to my analysis of ICE records, ICE is arresting 1,100% more people on the streets — that is, outside of jails, prisons or police custody — than it did even in 2017 during the first Trump administration. Most of these people have no criminal records.

This nearly matches DHS’ claimed 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE agents this year over last year. DHS agents in masks have been told to “go out on the streets” and detain random people to see whether they are here illegally.

The result is chaos. DHS’ targets don’t know why they’re being approached or what their rights are. Agents don’t know what to expect, either, putting them on edge. Onlookers often believe they are watching masked men abducting their friends and attempt to intervene.

Here’s an example: A U.S. citizen from California named Andrea Velez was on her way to work when an ICE agent ran her over. The agent reported he was chasing someone else because that person didn’t want to talk to him. ICE accused Velez of deliberately stepping in the agent’s way and charged her with assault, but the case was dismissed.

Another U.S. citizen watching Velez get picked up and carried away for seemingly no reason attempted to block ICE from driving away with her. An agent pepper-sprayed him inches away from his eyes, and the man swiped back, knocking off the agent’s baseball hat. He, too, was arrested and charged with assault.

So we ended up with two purported assaults on ICE, both stemming from the decision to “go out on the streets” and grab random people. These interactions never would have happened under Biden because his administration prohibited racial profiling in immigration enforcement and focused enforcement on public safety threats who were usually already secured behind bars.

When Biden’s ICE did target someone on the streets, it was a carefully planned operation with numerous agents working as a team to catch a specific public safety threat — not random, unplanned encounters with unknown people. This intentionally focused on officer safety. ICE has overturned this policy so that it can maximize arrests and meet a 3,000-per-day arrest target set by the White House.

Which brings us to the incident that led ICE to blame me for assaults. In that case, two agents working alone pulled over a Hispanic driver after he dropped off his two young U.S. citizen children at school. ICE officers receive little training in traffic stops, and these two failed to ensure he had turned off his car and removed his keys — a common police practice — before they reached inside.

The result is chaos. DHS’ targets don’t know why they’re being approached or what their rights are.

The driver appears to have panicked when he realized the officers were ICE and started to back up. Video shows that rather than step away from the moving car, one ICE agent pulled a gun, while the other held on to the moving car with his hands. When the driver didn’t stop, the agent who initially held on to the car shot and killed him. Though the seconds just before the shooting were off camera, DHS says the agent was “dragged.”

In its X post, ICE claimed I caused assaults on its officers by spreading “misinformation” about the case. That misinformation? An NBC News report that showed ICE lied about some facts. ICE called the man a “criminal,” but he had no criminal record, just years-old traffic citations. ICE said the officer was “severely injured,” but the officer reported that he had only a few scrapes. “Nothing major,” he said.

But these discrepancies aren’t the most important point: This incident and injury to an ICE agent most likely wouldn’t have happened at all before Trump for several reasons.

First, ICE wouldn’t have targeted a noncriminal living here for decades. Second, it wouldn’t have sent two agents alone. Third, they wouldn’t have gone without a clear plan to arrest him safely.

Fourth, while we can’t know what motivated his attempted flight, many people are now well aware of the inhumanities that befall immigrants in Trump administration ICE custody — everything from months in horrific ICE detention centers away from their families to deportations to random authoritarian countries or even straight to foreign prisons.

By treating immigrants more humanely, Biden took away a reason to flee agents or potentially engage in physical confrontations. Humane immigration policy, focused on public safety threats, would also increase public support for ICE operations, reducing hostility in the community.

Contrary to ICE’s implication, I don’t want ICE officers to be harmed. Indeed, I am more interested in ICE officer safety than ICE itself is.

ICE cares more about running up the deportation numbers than protecting its officers. If ICE returned to Biden’s interior enforcement policies, officers, Americans and immigrants would all be safer.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251005-chicago-ice-vl-502p-c80f2d.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 19:57:28.986266

One order is specifically aimed at preparing for the possibility that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ramps up activity in the Emerald City.

Among multiple other steps to be taken by city departments, Harrell said he has directed the city council to come up with an ordinance that bans law enforcement from wearing face masks, except in limited situations. Agents would also be required to display visible emblems and badges that identify their agency.

“We have all seen photos and videos of masked ICE agents literally kidnapping people from neighborhoods, from our streets and sidewalks with impunity,” Harrell said. “Masked agents operating without clear identification diminish transparency, they erode accountability, and they sow fear in our communities. They are waging a campaign based on fear, and also creating a dangerous possibility for other bad actors.”

When asked how he would enforce this, Harrell suggested that it is the Seattle Police Department’s responsibility to carry out city ordinances, but clarified that specific enforcement structures are to be worked out in the weeks to come. The Seattle Police Department will be trained on how they are to respond should they receive a 911 report that masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people within the city.

Should the ordinance pass, Seattle will become the first major city to enact such a ban. The state of California passed a law in September that bars local and federal law enforcement from concealing their faces with masks.

Harrell plans to propose another piece of legislation that would ban federal immigration employees from staging in city parking lots, or conducting their operations on city property.

Preparing for a potential National Guard deployment

Harrell signed a second executive order Wednesday morning that outlines how the city and its departments will respond if Trump deploys that National Guard to Seattle.

Trump has attempted to deploy the guard to Chicago and Portland, two other sanctuary cities that have pushed back on ICE. Harrell said he has no knowledge of concrete plans by the Trump administration to send the National Guard to Seattle, but it’s being treated as a real possibility.

The order Harrell signed directs the city to proactively evaluate and prepare all legal options to challenge a National Guard deployment in court, and resist any encroachments on the roles and jurisdictions of the Seattle Police Department.

It seems as if the city is also proactively planning to referee between protestors and federal agents, should the National Guard be deployed. Harrell said the city “reaffirms its unwavering support for first amendment activities (and) protests,” but that officials will work directly with organizers in efforts to minimize the potential for conflicts.

""We want people to use their voice, that is part of our power, but we also don’t want to, as some would say, take the bait,” Harrell said Wednesday. “We don't want to see anyone in harm's way when we can't predict the abusive actions taken by our federal government.""",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/c9107680-6a0b-4576-a23d-2afce5fd20ff/20251008T194749/c9107680-6a0b-4576-a23d-2afce5fd20ff_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 16:58:39.830724

That led federal prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois to move to dismiss the charges Wednesday. Immigration officials had touted the arrests in the case last month, writing on social media that the defendants “will be prosecuted and held accountable.”

The first Executive Order protects local communities and control over law enforcement resources in the event that federalized National Guard troops are deployed to Seattle. The second Executive Order strengthens services to immigrant and refugee communities and proposes legislation to prohibit the practice of masked, non-uniformed federal agents conducting immigration enforcement raids within the City, as well as an ordinance to prevent federal law enforcement from staging on or conducting immigration enforcement operations on City property.

“We are in a truly unprecedented time in modern history where the president is talking about using American cities as ‘training grounds’ for the military – a disturbing statement that shows his disrespect for the law and disregard for the collaboration it takes between all levels of government to ensure our country thrives,” said Mayor Harrell. “As I said last week in partnership with Governor Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown, we do not need federal troops in Seattle, and this dangerous strategy will only sow fear, distrust, and confusion in our communities. We cannot be under-prepared at this critical moment when President Trump is escalating his attacks on cities and carrying out his cruel deportation agenda on our immigrant and refugee neighbors with warrantless arrests by masked, un-identifiable officers. These Executive Orders are proactive steps we can take to protect our communities and values.”

Together, the Executive Orders will:

Coordinate legal and intergovernmental actions:

Proactively evaluate and prepare all available legal options, ensuring readiness in the event of unlawful troop deployment.

Establish coordination citywide if federalized troops are deployed, creating a task force so there is a clear process and communication in place.

Ensure clear lines of communication and coordination with the Governor, Attorney General’s Office, City Attorney’s Office, and community.

Increase transparency around immigration enforcement:

Develop an ordinance to ban the use of face masks by law enforcement, with limited exceptions, in the City of Seattle and require law enforcement officials to have visible emblems and badges that identify their agency.

Develop an ordinance that prohibits federal law enforcement from staging on or conducting immigration enforcement operations on City property.

Provide the Seattle Police Department clear guidance on how to respond to 911 calls where masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people in the City.

Maintain local control and accountability of the Seattle Police Department (SPD):

Strengthen policies preventing unconstitutional and unlawful encroachment on the roles, responsibilities, and jurisdiction of SPD by the federal government.

Reaffirm that SPD has no role in federal civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Protect First Amendment activities:

Reaffirm the City’s unwavering support for First Amendment activities, and in the event of unilateral troop deployment, directs the City to work with organizers to keep protests peaceful and minimize the potential for conflict.

So far this year, President Trump has deployed and threatened to deploy National Guard troops to Los Angeles, Washington D.C., Chicago, Memphis, and Portland. Last month, a federal judge ruled that President Trump’s use of military troops in Los Angeles was illegal. Last week, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the state’s National Guard in Portland, finding no legal basis for deployment. The Trump administration attempted to circumvent the order by sending California National Guard to the city, which the judge also blocked over the weekend.

President Trump has justified his deployment of troops in American cities to address crime and restore safety. In Seattle, SPD data shows that violent crime, property crime, and shots fired incidents are down compared to last year, and homicides are down 41% compared to 2024. Additionally, SPD is making record-breaking progress to restore police staffing, with nearly 130 officers hired so far this year.

“True public safety is not something that can be achieved by parachuting federal troops into Seattle. Policing is a profession that demands training, accountability, and a deep understanding of our communities,” said Police Chief Shon Barnes. “Decisions about Seattle’s safety should be based on facts and community feedback — not political talking points from people who do not live here and have no stake in our neighborhoods. The Seattle Police Department remains committed to evidence-based policing and building trust and real partnerships with our diverse communities.”

The City has advanced multiple legal and legislative steps to protect residents from the Trump administration’s unlawful actions and funding cuts, including legislation to strengthens local protections for people seeking gender-affirming and reproductive health care; a lawsuit over DEI and gender ideology Executive Orders and unlawful conditioning of funds; a lawsuit challenging threats to cities with sanctuary policies; and a lawsuit over frozen counterterrorism funds through the Securing the Cities program.

The Mayor’s 2026 proposed budget also includes a $27.6 million investment plan to safeguard essential services threatened by federal funding cuts, including shelter, rental assistance, and food access programs, and a 70% increase in funding for immigrant and refugee services including legal supports, Know Your Rights trainings, and workforce development.

As part of the Executive Order, the Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) is launching a One Seattle Community Resource Fair series for community members and service providers. The events will connect residents with City services and resources from local community-based organizations. The first resource fair was Monday, October 6 and similar resource fairs are planned for the coming months.

“The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will devote resources and expertise to our close coordination with the Mayor’s office and other City departments, as outlined in both executive orders. A connected, fearless approach is what is needed right now to provide trust and safety during any potential deployment of the national guard, an encroachment purely meant to disrupt local control and threaten immigrant and refugee residents,” said OIRA Director Hamdi Mohamed. “Seattle’s immigrant residents are best served when they are empowered and informed about their rights, not targeted and misrepresented. The One Seattle approach outlined in these executive orders, along with coordination between state partners and community organizations, echoes loud and clear that Seattle will remain a Welcoming City.”

Additionally, OIRA will re-launch the Immigrant and Refugee Commission, following a brief hiatus earlier this year and is actively recruiting new members. The Commission advises the Mayor and City Council on issues directly impacting immigrants and refugees living and working in Seattle and supports advocacy and outreach efforts citywide.

What People Are Saying

King County Executive Shannon Braddock

“As public officials, transparency and trust are fundamental to our work, and we must stand by our values and stand up for the law. King County has continually pushed back against the Trump administration’s continued disregard for these principles and its unlawful actions, which only undermine public confidence in government. We stand united with our local and state leaders against this federal overreach in our community.”

Martiza Rivera, Seattle City Councilmember, District 4

“We must stand united in denouncing President Trump’s irrational and authoritarian actions. It is deeply disturbing and wrong that we are in this position – needing to prepare for an unwarranted deployment of Federal troops to our city. Unfortunately, it is essential that we do and do so as One Seattle. I support Mayor Harrell’s EO’s and am at the ready to work with him to protect ALL of our City’s residents.”

Dan Strauss, Seattle City Councilmember, District 6

“The president’s actions in Portland are not just unacceptable, they are unlawful. That’s not just me saying that. It was the ruling of a judge that he, himself appointed. Today’s executive order demonstrates another way we continue to harden our local government to withstand any threat from the Trump administration.”

Bob Kettle, Seattle City Councilmember, District 7

“There is simply no reason for the National Guard to be deployed in our city. We are on the job. As Chair of our Public Safety Committee, we have developed and implemented our Strategic Framework Plan, with nearly 30 pieces of legislation out of council, to help create a safer Seattle. Further, our military defends OUR nation. If it is seen as defending a partisan effort, then that vital concept is undercut with negative consequences long-term. We must continue to push back on such actions and rhetoric – we cannot normalize them.”

Sara Nelson, Seattle City Council President, Position 9 (At-Large)

“Seattle is prepared and ready to respond. If National Guard troops are ordered to Seattle, we will do all we can to prevent unmasked federal agents from intimidating our residents and we’re prepared to use all legal options to protect their rights and safety. We’re in close communication with the Governor, Attorney General’s Office, and City Attorney’s Office and we will support our Seattle Police Department in their mission – to protect and serve every person in our Seattle community – not to participate in the scare tactics of our federal government in uninvited immigration enforcement.”

Vanessa Reyes, Policy Manager, Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network (WAISN)

“As the largest statewide network for immigrant justice in Washington, we welcome the Mayor’s executive actions affirming Seattle’s commitment to safety, dignity and community autonomy. Restricting the use of masks by federal enforcement officers helps protect public trust and safety. When unidentified, armed individuals appear in our neighborhoods, community members understandably call 911, fearing kidnappings or violence. These situations harm not only immigrant communities but also strain local emergency systems and endanger all. Our communities deserve to know who is acting with state or federal authority. Likewise, starting military-style deployments undermines that public safety is rooted in trust, care, and local solutions, not intimidation or fear. These measures reflect Seattle’s dedication to protecting all residents, regardless of immigration status, and to rejecting tactics that threaten civil and constitutional rights as well as community wellbeing.”

Kathleen Carson, Board Member, Seattle Indivisible

“Seattle Indivisible joins this effort because our city must remain a place where no one lives in fear for who they are or where they come from. When federal agencies act outside the bounds of law or humanity, we have a duty to draw a line and defend our neighbors. This executive order is a statement of principle—that Seattle will not collaborate with cruelty. It will not give legitimacy to raids that tear families apart. It will not stand silent while human rights are violated in our streets. We know that words alone will not stop an armored vehicle or a deportation order. But solidarity—spoken clearly and lived out daily—still matters. It tells every person being targeted that they are not alone, and it tells every official planning escalation that we are watching, organizing, and will not yield. Our resolve is simple: whatever comes, Seattle Indivisible will stand with our immigrant and refugee neighbors and all being targeted by our federal government. Seattle will not be intimidated into abandoning its values.”",https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/10/EO-Signing-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:57:51.536783

FIRST ON FOX: The University of Chicago exclusively told Fox News Digital that it condemns violence after a professor at the school was charged with violent felonies during an anti-ICE riot in the city's suburbs, but will not say whether the professor is still teaching classes.

Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi was arrested and charged on Oct. 3 with two counts of aggravated battery to a government employee, a Class 3 felony, and two counts of resisting/obstructing peace, a Class A misdemeanor.

""Safety is a paramount concern at the University of Chicago,"" University of Chicago's director of public affairs Gerald McSwiggan told Fox News Digital. ""Violence runs contrary to the University’s core values of free and open inquiry, dialogue and debate. The University promptly looks into any safety concerns, and takes action if necessary to uphold the safety of the University community.""

FAR-LEFT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PROFESSOR CHARGED WITH VIOLENT FELONIES DURING ANTI-ICE RIOTS IN BROADVIEW

The university stopped short of specifically commenting on Abdelhadi's arrest, and despite multiple requests, would not say whether she is still actively teaching courses. As of Wednesday morning, her biography page on the school's website remained active.

Court records show that Abdelhadi requested a jury trial during an appearance in Cook County on Monday. Her attorney declined to comment.

Hours before her arrest, she posted photos on X of a line of Illinois State Police officers guarding the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, and chastised the state and Gov. J.B. Pritzker for using state resources for that purpose.

Rioters and protesters have clashed with authorities outside the facility for weeks.

OVER A DOZEN ARRESTED AT ANTI-ICE PROTESTS IN CHICAGO SUBURB

Abdelhadi did not return a comment request, but she remained defiant in a post on her Bluesky account Monday.

""Thank you so much everyone for the messages of love and support,"" she said on the platform. ""I feel fortified by your presence in my life and in the world. I keep thinking about all our neighbors and siblings—hundreds in Chicago alone—who’ve been detained into the unknown of horrendous facilities. We owe them resistance.""

Abdelhadi appeared on far-left Truthout's ""Movement Memos"" podcast the day before her arrest, where she spewed menacing messages about ICE and towards fellow left-wingers.

""These people are terrorizing our communities and they’re setting up shop. I mean, in Broadview, ICE has been setting up shop in our backyard. Just brazenly taking up community resources to terrorize this very same community,"" she said.

""At this point, you are either on the side of protecting our neighbors and protecting our community, or you’re on the side of this administration. There is no neutral ground in this moment. There’s no center left. You’re either resisting or you’re complicit,"" she added.

Abdelhadi is also a known far-left entity and anti-Israel activist whose social media accounts often reference a ""genocide"" in Gaza.

She made national headlines when she cursed out her own employer at the Socialism 2025 conference earlier this year.

""F--- the University of Chicago, it’s evil, you know it’s a colonial landlord. Like, why would I put any of my political energy into this space? I kind of had a little bit of disdain for people who spent their time doing that,"" she said.

""Turns out, I work at one of the biggest employers in the city of Chicago. I work at a place that is a landlord, a healthcare provider, a police force, f--- that s---, but, they are, and a place where I have access to thousands of people that I could potentially organize… actually, this is where I need to build power. That’s possible structural leverage,"" she said.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/riot-police-abdelhadi-split.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 18:56:49.452878
