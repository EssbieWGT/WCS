Politics latest: Badenoch slams 'shambles of a government' as second foreign prisoner wrongly released

Another foreign prisoner is on the run after being mistakenly released, Sky News has learnt. The error at HMP Wandsworth in south London happened on 29 October. Responding to the news, Kemi Badenoch said the government is ""a shambles"".

Gonzales spent the next two months at a Tacoma, Washington detention facility — an experience that his attorney, Abby Sullivan Engen, said left him traumatized.

Gonzales — a pseudonym — is a speaker of an indigenous Mayan language, and struggles with a hearing problem. Within the facility, ICE failed to provide an interpreter to explain legal documents or other procedures, leaving him isolated and unsure of what was happening. Gonzales may be legally deaf, according to his attorney.

Before Gonzales was arrested and Sullivan Engen learned of his case through the rapid response hotline, his family had hired a private attorney. That attorney also ignored Gonzales’s specialized needs, conducted the consultation in Spanish, and filed his asylum application in Spanish, although Gonzales’ understanding is limited in that language. As a result, the private attorney failed to capture critical details about Gonzales’s asylum claim as an indigenous person fleeing his home country. “[The claim] doesn’t tell the most important aspects of his story,” said Sullivan Engen, co-director of the immigrants’ rights practice at La Raza Legal Center in Oakland.

Gonzales’s case, though harrowing, is not unique. Translating across language and culture has always been complicated — especially in asylum cases. Sullivan Engen said that language access in legal proceedings is a “huge concern” that must be addressed. But as the Trump administration has escalated threats against immigrants, access to interpretation and translation services has become even harder to secure within detention centers, and throughout the legal process.

On Oct. 28, Gonzales was released from detention after the success of the habeas petition that Sullivan Engen filed on his behalf. While his release is a victory, Gonzales must now grapple with the trauma of his detention while continuing his asylum proceedings with a “terrible asylum application that will follow him,” said Sullivan Engen.

For cases like these, the stakes are high. When an asylum seeker “cannot express themselves fully, it can result in the loss of their asylum case,” said Sullivan Engen.

Non-profits respond to a language-access crisis under Trump

In February, Trump terminated a 2023 Biden-era directive that required immigration judges and local Homeland Security officials to connect immigrants with resources like out-of-court translation services to help them fill out and file asylum-related documents. San Francisco immigration judges still offer asylum-seekers the same list of resources as they did before February — but now with a warning that, most likely, every organization on the list is too busy to take on any new cases. In March, Trump revoked Executive Order 13166, a Clinton-era order that required all federal agencies to provide meaningful language access for people with limited English proficiency.

Despite these rollbacks, immigration courts still have interpreters—in San Francisco, often through in-person SOSi contractors or the remote Lionsbridge service— but there’s less federal funding for interpretation and translation services overall. Furthermore, courts now operate without the guidance they once received from the Executive Office for Immigration Review on how to provide the kind of interpretation that asylum-seekers actually need.

The responsibility to fill in the gaps has fallen on local immigration non-profits and pro-bono interpreters — just as they are facing unprecedented caseloads and budget cuts. Immigration attorneys in the Bay Area often provide in-house translation services to clients— but those who take pro bono cases now have waitlists of six months or more.

“We don’t have the luxury of a waitlist,” said Ariel Koren, who runs Respond Crisis Translation, a non-profit that provides free translation and interpreters for a variety of situations, including asylum cases. Due to the language-access crisis at hand, people frequently contact the organization only moments before their asylum interviews, Koren said.

Miscommunication starts at the border

The problem of interpretation starts at the border, said Sarah Gavigan, a senior immigration attorney for CARACEN S.F., a nonprofit that is part of San Francisco’s Language Access Network, a coalition of non-profits that advocates for access to interpreters and other translation services in city government.

When a person arrives at the U.S. border to seek asylum, if they aren’t able to make themselves understood to the border agents they encounter, they are deported immediately — and that deportation makes it much harder for them to seek asylum in the future.

Even after Trump’s executive orders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is supposed to provide migrants with basic interpretation services after they have been detained at the border. But, said Gavigan, this rarely happens, and didn’t happen even under prior administrations.

When someone claims asylum, CBP gives them a Form M-444 to sign stating that they have been made aware of their upcoming asylum interview, and tells them they have the right to an interpreter they feel comfortable communicating with. Gavigan, who works with unaccompanied minors, has yet to encounter one who has received a Form M-444 in their own language, she said. The forms she’s seen are always in English.

Asylum seekers often rely on interpreters at every stage of the process: from finding free or low-cost legal help to understanding court notices, logistics and the government’s requirements inside and outside the courtroom. Without this support, Gavigan has seen people deported who didn’t even realize they were in proceedings that could end in removal.

Asylum case data analyzed by Syracuse University’s TRAC project found that asylum-seekers with legal representation fare better in court. The Northern California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice found that immigrants are 10.5 times more likely to succeed with representation.

TRAC specifically found that those who spoke less common languages are less likely to have attorneys. For example, Mandarin-speaking asylum-seekers had an attorney 79 percent of the time; speakers of Kekchi only had a lawyer 39 percent of the time.

A study published in the Denver Law Review in 2020 found significant ramifications from the lack of access to interpreters in the asylum process: Longer wait times in detention centers, mistranslated interviews leading to case dismissals, or detentions.

In recent years, San Francisco’s pool of migrants has become even more linguistically diverse, said Jose Ng, who co-leads the Language Access Network. He’s now seeing more requests for interpreters who speak Kazakh and Turkmen, for example, two languages he rarely used to see demand for.

Those who can afford it pay about $20 to $50 a page to certified translation services to translate documents, and about $250 an hour to interpreters for in-person meetings. Those who cannot afford such fees take their chances at submitting documents solely in their native language, which can lead to a case delay or dismissal.

The Bay Area interpreters at the frontlines

Crecencio Ramirez is an interpreter fluent in Mam, a language with 23 recognized dialects spoken by indigenous people in Guatemala and Mexico. He juggles a packed work schedule: Ramirez works for three Bay Area immigration non-profits and runs Radio Ba’lam in Oakland, the only Bay Area radio station dedicated to serving the Mam community. There are an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Mam speakers in Oakland, and the number of Mam asylum-seekers continues to rise.

Many of the Mam speakers who find Ramirez have received a “Notice to Appear” from Homeland Security indicating that they have to appear in court, or face automatic deportation. These notices, Ramirez said, are always written in English.

Ramirez has seen cases, he said, where Mam speakers “couldn’t read the NTA so they shucked it off to collect dust.” He has seen other people miss their hearings because they couldn’t find someone to translate for them quickly enough.

In her rapid response work, Koren said that one of the “most common issues” is asylum-seekers showing up to their merit interviews without an interpreter, because they did not understand the legal process that had been presented only in English.

Unlike court hearings ordered by a Notice to Appear, a merit interview is part of the affirmative asylum pathway conducted by the USCIS. This interview is the final point for an asylum seeker to present their case in front of a USCIS officer, but it does not provide an interpreter for the session. The availability and quality of interpretation is “make or break,” said Koren.

Professional interpreters in San Francisco can charge around $1,000 for an hour-long merit interview, but many interviews extend past three hours, said Koren, and so many asylum-seekers bring a family or community member to avoid the cost.

One man’s asylum case saved by a last-minute language intervention

On a recent Thursday night, Felipe shared the story of his asylum case at a panel event hosted by Respond Crisis Translation.

In 2022, he fled from Colombia to the Bay Area due to mounting threats of violence against him because of his work as a farmworker activist. He was placed in the affirmative asylum process by CBP, but ran into trouble when attempting to understand the process in San Francisco.

He clicked on the USCIS page, where he read about the asylum interview in English, but lost critical details due to the language barrier. As a result, “I showed up to the interview without an interpreter,” he said. The interview was rescheduled, and Felipe found a community member who committed to translating for him.

But, when the day came, the person canceled an hour and a half before the interview.

Felipe said the USCIS officer told him the interview would be canceled entirely if he could not find a substitute interpreter to show up within 15 minutes. “I was blessed with good luck,” Felipe said, when he ran into Sullivan Engen. She quickly connected him with Koren, who successfully interpreted the interview. He later received asylum.

But others have not had the same good fortune.

Attorney Wahida Noorzad, an Afghani lawyer based in Concord, said that some of her clients who have been able to afford an interpreter have still not had luck. In one case, her client had an interpreter who spoke in their language — Pashtun — but in a different dialect. In this case, Noorzad quickly identified active mistranslations and began waving to grab the attention of the USCIS officer who asked, “Why are you jumping?” Noorzad replied, “You’re getting the wrong answers.”

One asylum-seeker’s attempt to receive in-language legal aid services

On a recent morning inside his courtroom at 630 Sansome St., Judge Joseph Park shook his head in frustration and said loudly, for the second time, “Kazakh!”

“Sorry?” replied the operator for Lionsbridge, the remote translation and interpretation service that contracts with the court.

Park redialed the line once more, in hopes of a better connection. In the courtroom, a 41-year-old man from Kazakhstan waited nervously. In the front bench, his wife sat with their two young children.

“I’m afraid that I have no interpreters in that language,” the operator replied.

Judge Park asked the man if he felt comfortable conducting his proceedings in Russian, the man’s second language. “I have command over both languages,” the man replied, and the hearing proceeded with a Russian interpreter on the line.

Mission Local later spoke over the phone with the Kazakh asylum-seeker with the help of a Russian interpreter.

By law, the man must file any documents in his case with a translator who is certified for the job. Since his court date, he said, he had searched in vain for a Kazakh speaker who could help him through the process — ultimately, he would settle for a Russian translator, against the general advice of asylum attorneys. “I looked on Google, on Facebook, on many social networks and I didn’t find a Kazakh translator anywhere.” He paused. “Maybe out of a thousand, one will be found somewhere.”",https://newspack-missionlocal.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9997-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 08:18:29.859885

By ABHINAYA KASAGANI — akasagani@ucdavis.edu

America’s reluctance to admit immigrants into the country stems from their reluctance to acknowledge that their economy has been dependent on immigrant labor for decades. While there has been a recent influx of several half-baked and outdated ideas about how the immigration crisis should be resolved, or whether there’s even a crisis to be resolved to begin with, one fact remains true: America’s economy relies on the contributions of immigrants.

Our economy has, for decades now, remained dependent on immigrant workers — whether in the agricultural sector, construction, healthcare or technology — and yet we, as a nation, refuse to acknowledge how much we depend on this very work. Instead, we hide behind a reluctance to welcome or even acknowledge immigrants, concealing how essential they really are.

While some claim that Donald Trump is playing a game of four-dimensional chess that is beyond the comprehension of the ordinary person, others recognize this lack of dimension and substance for what it is — “the land of the free” once again choosing to be heavily self-congratulatory despite having done nothing to earn that praise. The National Immigration Law Center notes that anti-immigrant policies — in what is ironically referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) — cut “health care, nutrition and tax benefits while expanding detention and enforcement” in an attempt to position immigration as a threat, rather than a resource.

53.3 million immigrants lived in the United States in January 2025 — the largest number ever recorded. However, “in the ensuing months, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived,” according to the Pew Research Center.

While politicians continue to make grandiose claims about securing the border and protecting American jobs, they fail to note the irony of the matter: Very few Americans want the jobs that immigrants are willing to take. Entitled Americans remain resistant to jobs they deem undesirable, resorting to the creation of unfounded claims that immigrant policies allow for job theft.

Out of the roughly 2.6 million people working in the agricultural sector, 1 million workers are primarily noncitizen immigrants. On top of this, roughly 3.3 million immigrants of the total immigrant population work in the construction industry, often underpaid and underprotected. Millions of immigrants also operate within white-collar industries and professional jobs in the tech sector or as business professionals, educators and health services professionals. The American Immigration Council, through new data analysis, confirms the extent to which immigrants are contributing billions of dollars to the U.S. economy.

Despite this dependence, national discourse attempts to claim full ownership of the country’s successes and attribute partial responsibility for their failures to immigrants. The reluctance to admit that the U.S. is dependent on immigrant labor — in an attempt to strengthen their political posturing as a self-sufficient nation — is cause for concern. The social exclusion of immigrants allows the federal government to ensure it profits off of cheap workers, while simultaneously refusing to integrate immigrants into its national identity. Millions of immigrant families live in fear of deportation, poor working conditions, deprivation of basic human rights and lack of access to healthcare and education. To this day, no concrete solutions are being considered on the matter.

The U.S., for whom democracy claims to be built on “liberty and justice for all,” seemingly handpicks who it decides is deserving; excluding the rest by refusing them any extension of justice. This reluctance hasn’t grown overnight, and the country’s persistence is interesting to note — the image of a “self-made” nation, years later, still depends on an invisible collective force that makes individual success possible.

“Go back to where you came from, but please don’t go too far — we need you;” this, as a sentiment, can’t sustain a developed nation built on the labor of others. Only when America stops pretending that immigrants aren’t its backbone, or that they rely on them in order to survive, can they truly deliver on the promise of freedom and fairness they have always stood for. Otherwise, we will be left debating whether or not there is a crisis to be resolved when millions of livelihoods are at stake.

Conclusion The refugee entry suspension under the Trump administration remains one of the most controversial immigration policies in recent U.S. history.","In early 2017, the world watched as the Trump administration made one of its most controversial decisions, the suspension of refugee entry into the United States. The move was part of a broader immigration policy aimed at tightening U.S. borders and limiting the number of people entering from certain countries. For many, it was a shock. For others, it was a promise kept. But for thousands of refugees, it meant uncertainty, fear, and long waits for safety.

The Beginning of the Ban

Shortly after taking office, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order that temporarily stopped refugees from entering the country. It also placed travel restrictions on several Muslim-majority countries, including Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen.

The administration argued that the pause was necessary to strengthen security checks and prevent potential threats. Trump called it a “travel ban” designed to protect Americans from terrorism. His supporters praised the decision, saying the U.S. had a right to control who entered its borders.

But critics called it a “Muslim ban”, saying it unfairly targeted people based on religion and nationality. Protests erupted across airports in the United States. Lawyers rushed to help detained travelers. The images of families separated at arrival gates went viral worldwide.

Impact on Refugees

The ban had a deep impact on refugees who had already gone through years of security screening and background checks. Many had sold their belongings, completed interviews with U.S. immigration officers, and were just waiting for their flights.

Suddenly, they were told they could not enter.

Refugees from war-torn countries like Syria and Somalia faced heartbreaking setbacks. Some were stranded in refugee camps with no clear idea of what would happen next. For many, the U.S. was seen as a safe place, a fresh start after escaping violence and persecution. That hope was suddenly taken away.

Charity groups and human rights organizations called the decision “cruel and unnecessary.” They argued that refugees were already heavily vetted and that the suspension hurt innocent families fleeing danger.

Legal Battles and Court Challenges

Almost immediately, several states and civil rights groups challenged the travel ban in court. Judges in Hawaii, Washington, and other states temporarily blocked the order, calling it unconstitutional.

But the Trump administration didn’t back down. It revised the ban multiple times to make it legally stronger and eventually took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld a revised version of the travel ban, ruling that the president had the authority to restrict entry for national security reasons. It was a major win for the Trump administration, but the debate over the policy continued.

Supporters’ Point of View

Supporters of the ban said it was about safety, not discrimination. They believed that the U.S. needed time to improve its refugee screening process and ensure that people entering the country were not a threat.

Many Americans who supported the policy felt that the government had a responsibility to put citizens’ safety first. Trump often said his goal was to protect the United States from potential terrorists hiding among refugees, even though statistics showed that refugees were already among the most thoroughly vetted entrants to the country.

Opponents’ Viewpoint

Opponents, on the other hand, saw the suspension as a moral and humanitarian failure. They argued that America had always been a nation built by immigrants and that turning away refugees went against those values.

Religious groups, including many Christian and Jewish organizations, spoke out strongly against the policy. They said it was wrong to close the door on people who were running from war, poverty, and persecution.

International leaders also criticized the decision, saying it damaged America’s reputation as a global leader in humanitarian aid.

The Human Side of the Policy

Behind the politics were real human stories.

Families who had waited years for approval suddenly had their dreams put on hold. Children who were ready to start school in America found themselves stuck in refugee camps. Some families were split apart, with one parent allowed in and the other left behind.

One Syrian woman shared her story in an interview: “We were told our papers were ready. We sold everything. Then, overnight, it was gone. My children cried when we told them we couldn’t go.”

Stories like hers showed the emotional and personal cost of the refugee entry suspension.

Changes in Later Years

In 2021, after President Joe Biden took office, he ended the refugee and travel bans introduced by Trump. Biden called the bans “a stain on America’s conscience.” He promised to restore the U.S. refugee program and increase the annual refugee admission cap.

Although the bans were lifted, their effects continued to be felt. Many refugee organizations had reduced staff or funding during the suspension years, and rebuilding those systems took time. Thousands of refugees still faced long waits to enter the country.

Conclusion

The refugee entry suspension under the Trump administration remains one of the most controversial immigration policies in recent U.S. history. Supporters saw it as a necessary step for national security. Opponents saw it as discrimination disguised as safety.

In the end, the policy highlighted one of the biggest questions in modern politics:

How can a country protect itself while also protecting those in need?

The United States continues to wrestle with that question, balancing its traditions of openness and compassion with the realities of a complex, changing world.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/690b16c46cc7f2001e19641d.png",N,,2025-11-05 07:17:07.128107

The commentary focuses on the assessment of risk to former government officials and civil servants. It argues that a conclusive assessment that this profile is generally not at risk of persecution or serious harm is not supported by the country of origin information.

Published alongside the commentary is a country of origin information report focusing on the Taliban’s treatment of individuals who worked for the former government, international forces, or the judiciary under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004 – 2021).

Background

A narrowed assessment of profiles considered at risk within the August 2024 Fear of the Taliban policy note signalled a troubling new approach to Afghan asylum claims, as previously discussed on Free Movement.

A year on, concern about the UK government’s handling of at risk Afghans continues to mount, following the closure of all resettlement routes, and the lifting of a super-injunction revealing a major data breach in 2022 affecting applicants to Afghan relocation schemes. A new version of the Fear of the Taliban policy note was published in August 2025, though with minimal changes to the country information and no updated country information on the profile of former government officials and civil servants.

Analysis of the Home Office’s assessment

Asylos’ commentary considers the profile of former government officials and civil servants, a profile which the UK government has deemed unlikely to be at risk since August 2024. The commentary argues that the country information within the policy note does not support such a conclusive assessment.

The commentary is a reminder that it is always worth checking the country information within the policy note itself, to understand to what extent the it is supportive of the policy note assessment. In this case, multiple sources in the policy note indicate that former government officials and civilian personnel have been subject to arbitrary arrests and detentions, human rights violations, various forms of torture and ill-treatment and extrajudicial killings.

The commentary also highlights that the UK government assessment is currently at odds with the European Union Agency for Asylum’s assessment, which appears to accept that individuals within this profile may be at risk:

‘Acts reported to be committed against individuals under this profile [individuals affiliated with the previous government and members of the judiciary, including court personnel and civil servants] are of such severe nature that they amount to persecution (e.g. summary executions, killing, torture, enforced disappearances). [….]

‘For judges, prosecutors, and former court personnel well-founded fear of persecution would in general be substantiated.

‘For others under this profile, the individual assessment should take into account the institution they were employed by and their role and functions. Being female and possible personal enmities may also constitute risk-impacting circumstances. Family members may also have a well-founded fear of persecution, for example in the context of the Taliban searching for the individual they are related to.’

It also runs counter to the UNHCR’s assessment in its September 2025 guidance note on Afghanistan:

‘…many persons of this profile [Afghans associated with the former government, security forces or allies] —including former government officials, previous members of the ANDSF, former prosecutors or judges and persons who were affiliated with foreign forces—are likely to be in need of international protection. Other persons of this profile may be in need of international protection depending on the individual circumstances of the case…’

The commentary further argues that the strong focus on quantitative assessment of risk distorts the correct legal test for assessing whether there is a reasonable likelihood a person would be persecuted (for a Convention reason). It is argued that this has the effect of raising the evidentiary threshold for proving that people claiming to be former government officials are at risk from the Taliban.

Finally, the commentary raises the policy note’s lack of consideration of limitations on access to information in Afghanistan. It emphasises that a lack of information on any given issue should never lead to an automatic conclusion that it is not occurring. This is particularly important in contexts like Afghanistan, where the information environment is challenging due to factors like severe restrictions on press freedom.

Why considering timely country information is so important

Despite the importance of timely country information for fair and evidence-based decision making, the August 2025 policy note does not include any updated country information on the profile of former government officials and civil servants, instead continuing to rely on country information gathered before August 2024.

Asylos’ country information report, which includes sources published between September 2024 and October 2025, may therefore be a useful resource for lawyers and decision makers.

Sources within the report reveal ongoing human rights violations against individuals against those who worked for the former government, international forces, or the judiciary under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004 – 2021), despite the Taliban’s declared general amnesty. Of particular note, several sources report that the 2022 data leak has led to harmful consequences, including killings of those on the leaked list, or their family members.

A Telegraph report of July 2025 quoted a Taliban official confirming that the Taliban continues to use the data leaked by the UK government to track down those on the list, and that the search had intensified in recent months.

Evidence published by Refugee Legal Support in October 2025 presents information gathered in September and October 2025 from 350 Afghans affected by the data breach. The report captures threats and risks resulting from the breach, including 49 reports of killings of family members or former colleagues, 210 reports of Taliban house searches, and more than 200 incidents of threats to family, friends or individuals on the list.

Conclusion

By engaging with the country information set out in the government’s own policy note, and looking at how other asylum authorities have assessed risk, the commentary is a reminder that the same set of information can be interpreted in different ways. The country information report suggests that the risks still facing those who worked for the former government, international forces, or the judiciary under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004 – 2021) are far from insignificant.

These documents should assist lawyers working on Afghan protection claims, as well as encouraging decision makers to continue to engage with timely country information, give due consideration to limitations on access to information, and to take a cautious approach in assessing ongoing risks.",https://freemovement.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg_.png,N,,2025-11-05 07:17:11.646790

In a series of executive orders issued earlier this year, Trump cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, a 1977 law which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency, as he slapped steep duties on imports into the US.

The supreme court – controlled by a rightwing supermajority that was crafted by Trump – will review whether IEEPA grants the president the authority to levy a tariff, a word not mentioned in the law. Congress is granted sole authority under the constitution to levy taxes. The court has until the end of its term, in July 2026, to issue a ruling on the case.

Lower courts have ruled against Trump’s tariffs, prompting appeals from the Trump administration, setting up this latest test of Trump’s presidential power. The supreme court has largely sided with the administration through its shadow docket to overrule lower courts.

Should the supreme court ultimately rule against Trump’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs, it will force the White House to go back to the drawing board and reconsider how to enforce an aggressive economic policy which has strained global trade ties.

Should the court side with the administration, however, it will embolden a president who has repeatedly claimed – despite warnings over the risk of higher prices – that tariffs will help make America great again, raising “trillions” of dollars for the federal government and revitalizing its industrial heartlands.

Trump himself has argued the court’s decision is immensely important. The case is “one of the most important in the History of the Country”, he wrote on social media over the weekend, claiming that ruling against him would leave the US “defenseless”.

“If we win, we will be the Richest, Most Secure Country anywhere in the World, BY FAR,” Trump claimed. “If we lose, our Country could be reduced to almost Third World status – Pray to God that that doesn’t happen!”

But some of his senior officials have suggested that, if the court rules against their current strategy, they will find another way to impose tariffs. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who plans to attend the oral arguments in the case, has said the administration has “lots of other authorities” to do so.

According to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, Trump’s tariffs amount to an average tax increase per US household of $1,200 in 2025 and $1,600 in 2026.

A coalition of 12 states and small businesses, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont, have sued the Trump administration to block the tariffs.

Several other small businesses also filed suit against the Trump administration to block the tariffs. The cases, Learning Resources, Inc v Trump and Trump v VOS Selections, were consolidated by the court.

“No one person should have the power to impose taxes that have such vast global economic consequences,” Jeffrey Schwab, Liberty Justice Center’s senior counsel, said in a statement on the lawsuit filed on behalf of small businesses against the tariffs. “The Constitution gives the power to set tax rates – including tariffs – to Congress, not the President.”

About 40 legal briefs have been filed in opposition to the tariffs, including from the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business lobby group in the US.

The US Chamber has urged Congress to reclaim its constitutional role in setting tariffs, stating in a letter on 27 October to the US Senate: “American families are facing thousands of dollars in higher prices as a result of these increased taxes. Small businesses, manufacturers, and ranchers are struggling with higher costs, with additional economic pain likely in the coming months.”

The US Senate voted 51 to 47 last week to nullify Trump’s so-called reciprocal tariffs, with four Republicans joining Democrats in the vote, though the House is not expected to take similar action.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0102a4e5aea7ff695040c87ed59e1224e3cb6cc8/358_0_3575_2860/master/3575.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c2c243e997cd81eceb8230843694582",N,,2025-11-05 04:16:58.687882

Instead, as the two sides entered their 36th day at an impasse, the administration signaled it planned to ramp up the pain.

The president threatened on social media on Tuesday to deny food subsidy payments for 42 million Americans until the end of the government shutdown, in apparent defiance of a court order. (The White House press secretary later said the administration would comply with the court.)

Mr. Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, warned he might have to close parts of the national airspace next week because of the potential “mass chaos” with air traffic controller shortages.

And the White House again left open the possibility it might not follow its legal obligation to restore back pay to furloughed workers who have missed paychecks during the shutdown.

Taken together, the administration’s message was simple: Either Democrats back down from their demand to extend expiring health care subsidies, or the fallout of the shutdown will get worse.

On Wednesday after midnight, this year’s fiscal impasse pushed past 35 full days, breaking the ignominious record for the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which was previously set by the 34-day shutdown of Mr. Trump’s first term.

Unlike that standoff, the president has not involved himself in negotiations to end the current dilemma. Instead, the White House is betting that Democrats’ key constituencies will turn on them the longer they continue to refuse to support the G.O.P. plan for a short-term spending extension at current funding levels.

The administration has pointed to the calls by some union leaders for Congress to reopen the government under the Republican plan and then negotiate over health care costs.

“The Democrats obstructionism will break the record for the longest government shutdown in American history tonight,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference. “The Democrats are intentionally hurting American families, workers and businesses with this shutdown.”

When asked what Mr. Trump was doing to end the government shutdown, Ms. Leavitt said he was “pushing Republicans to keep voting” on a funding bill. Mr. Trump has invited all Republican senators for a discussion at the White House Wednesday.

It remains to be seen which party Americans will hold ultimately accountable for the paralysis in Washington. But recent public surveys show a larger share currently put the responsibility on Republicans.

“I really try to avoid making this an issue out of what the polls say, or who’s winning or losing, because nobody wins,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the top Republican in the Senate, told reporters. “Shutdowns are stupid. I’ve been here long enough to have been through a few of them. Nobody wins.”

Democrats say the president’s refusal to engage in discussions means Mr. Trump is responsible for the impact on Americans.

Speaking to reporters, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Democrat in the Senate, said Tuesday that some informal talks were underway and that Democrats were “exploring all the options.”

But he said Mr. Trump has not involved himself.

“The fault of this shutdown falls on his shoulders,” Mr. Schumer said. “He’s refused to discuss anything with us.”

Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the top Democrat in the House, said Democrats would not back down until they secured a deal to improve health care benefits.

“Donald Trump is unlawfully withholding billions of dollars in SNAP benefits from 42 million Americans and 16 million children,” said Mr. Jeffries, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “There’s nothing to be optimistic about relative to the cruelty and the pain that Donald Trump and Republicans continue to inflict on the American people.”

He suggested Democrats could gain more political momentum for their position with wins in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey Tuesday night.

“It’s over for these people,” he said of Republicans before polls closed, “and we’re going to see it today, and we’re going to see it during the midterm elections.”

For weeks the Trump administration has played a game of winners and losers with the shutdown, aiming to mitigate the harm to the military and law enforcement, while ramping up the pressure on Democratic constituencies. Mr. Trump has used the fiscal impasse to halt funding to Democratic jurisdictions, and tried to lay off thousands of federal workers.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the pain would intensify.

In a post on Truth Social, the president said that food stamp benefits under SNAP “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”

Hours after that ultimatum, Ms. Leavitt appeared to walk back the president’s comments. She told reporters at a news briefing that the administration was “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments in November.

The White House declined to elaborate on Mr. Trump’s plans. The Agriculture Department which administers the program, did not respond to a request for comment.

For his part, Mr. Duffy, the transportation secretary, warned of “mass chaos” in the skies.

“You will see mass chaos, you will see mass flight delays, you will see mass cancellations,” he said during a news conference, accusing Democrats of perpetuating what he called a “senseless shutdown.”

“And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it because we don’t have the air traffic controllers,” he said.

The most recent notifications from agencies to federal workers about the shutdown omitted any language that furloughed employees would receive back pay, which is guaranteed under a law that Mr. Trump signed in 2019.

Ms. Leavitt would not commit to the administration complying with the law, saying Tuesday that the matter was the subject of negotiations.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/04/multimedia/04dc-shutdown-ghfz/04dc-shutdown-ghfz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:03.355174

Last updated Nov. 4 at 11:14 a.m.

Attorneys representing Chicago journalists and protesters filed a notice Monday alleging that Department of Homeland Security agents violated a temporary restraining order during immigration enforcement operations in Evanston on Friday.

The notice is a recent development in a suit brought by the Chicago Headline Club, other media organizations and protesters against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump and other top federal administrators. Filed in October, the suit stems from federal responses to protests at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.

Judge Sara Ellis first granted a temporary restraining order Oct. 9. The order places restrictions on federal agents in the Northern District of Illinois, including limiting their use of force and riot control weapons and requiring agents to display visible identification.

In the notice, the plaintiffs’ attorneys allege DHS agents violated the order during operations on Halloween in Evanston by using excessive force against protesters, subjecting protesters to risk and harm, deploying pepper spray on a non-violent crowd without warning, threatening the use of excessive force against non-violent protesters and failing to wear numbers and badges.

On Halloween, Evanston saw significant activity by federal immigration enforcement agencies. The DHS made at least eight arrests across Evanston and Skokie on Friday, including both protesting citizens and those it said lacked legal status, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to The Daily. At least three arrests occurred after a collision involving a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle less than a block from Chute Middle School.

The notice includes signed declarations by three Evanston residents.

In the first declaration, Kerry Littel detailed a confrontation between “more than a dozen” community members and federal immigration agents after the collision involving a Border Patrol vehicle.

According to Littel’s declaration, federal agents sat on top of a man, grabbed his head and bashed it on the street at least twice. Littel claimed that the agent then struck the man on the head at least two times before picking him up and putting him in their vehicle.

Video footage documenting this confrontation — and those recorded by the other residents — is also included in the notice.

On Saturday, before the notice was filed, DHS Assistant Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reposted one of the videos included on X, showing a Border Patrol agent pinning the man on the ground and striking him multiple times.

In the post, McLaughlin claimed the agent’s actions were motivated by self-defense after the man grabbed the agent’s genitals. At the start of the video, one of the man’s hands is clearly behind his back and the other is out of view.

In another declaration, Evanston resident David Brooks alleges that while he was in a crowd of protesters at the scene, an agent pointed a gun directly at him. Brooks wrote that the agent said “step back or I’m going to shoot you,” shown in one of the included videos.

The notice also claims agents “set off either pepper spray or mace” without warning the crowd of protesters and that multiple agents appeared to lack visible identification.

A third declaration, by Evanston resident Kelly Mack, described a separate interaction where she saw a neighbor shoved by an immigration agent without an audible warning.

The court’s temporary restraining order instructs that the defendants are temporarily prohibited from using force against “an individual who poses no immediate threat of physical harm to others, unless necessary and proportional to effectuate an apprehension and arrest.”

It also blocks them from seizing or arresting peaceful protesters who are not resisting lawful crowd dispersal orders, without probable cause to believe they have committed a crime that warrants arrest. The order also contains a provision requiring all federal agents — with some exceptions for those who do not wear uniforms or those who are undercover — to have visible identification prominently displayed.

The notice alleges that the defendants violated each of these provisions.

The lawyers representing the plaintiffs and defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A preliminary injunction hearing for the case is slated for Wednesday morning at Everett McKinley Dirksen Federal Courthouse in Downtown Chicago.

But that is precisely the point; across time and political swings, the concept of due process has not changed.
No one can be labeled without due process, and due process applies to every person.","Recently, I made the mistake of responding on social media to a post about immigration. It is an important topic to me because it’s an important part of what my organization does.

The Center for Victim and Human Rights (CVHR), which I founded almost 18 years ago, provides legal services to victims of crime—some of whom are immigrants.

I use the term ‘mistake’ because, if you’ve ever read an online thread on immigration, you already know how it went. It looked something like this:

Comment: “Get rid of these illegals!”

Me: “They are entitled to due process.”

Response: “[Insert pejorative here]. Due process is for citizens, and besides—they’re illegal.”

I couldn’t help but go down the proverbial ‘rabbit hole.’ What does it mean to label someone ‘illegal’ and ‘who is entitled to due process in an immigration case?’

I want to examine whether it really does apply in immigration cases.

‘They’re illegal.’ Prove it—process matters.

The framers of the Constitution did not invent due process; they inherited it from centuries of English law, most notably the Magna Carta’s promise that no person could be deprived of liberty except by the “law of the land.”

Even in immigration law, the term “illegal” obscures more than it explains. The Immigration and Nationality Act defines “aliens” and specifies offenses like unlawful entry (8 U.S.C. §1325) and reentry after removal (8 U.S.C. §1326), but nowhere does it label a person as “illegal.”

Most immigration violations are civil, not criminal. Overstaying a visa, working without authorization or entering without inspection have been historically addressed through removal proceedings—not crimes. In those proceedings, the government—not the person—bears the burden to prove removability. That is what due process demands.

To reach the decision that someone should not be here, however, requires due process. Similar to a criminal case, the government has the burden of proving that a person has committed specific violations and is subject to deportation.

This has been the law of the land for at least 122 years.

More than a century ago, the Supreme Court affirmed this principle. In Yamataya v. Fisher (1903), the court held that “the liberty of an individual, even though he be an alien, is protected by the Fifth Amendment” and that “no deportation proceeding…shall be taken unless there be an opportunity, appropriate to the case, to be heard.”

The ruling established that before the government may remove someone, it must first provide notice and a fair hearing.

Process comes before punishment.

Half a century later, in Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding (1953), the Court reaffirmed that a lawful permanent resident could not be denied reentry without notice of the charges and a hearing. Justice Frankfurter wrote that a person’s status as a lawful resident “has not been lost by his absence” and that “before his expulsion, he is entitled to notice of the nature of the charge and a hearing at least before an executive or administrative tribunal.”

In other words, once the Constitution calls someone a person, the government must treat them as one.

‘They’re not citizens.’ It does not matter.

The opening phrases of the Fifth and 14th Amendments both begin with the same word: person. The Fifth Amendment states, “No person shall be held…,” and the 14th begins, “All persons…”

This may seem like “lawyer parsing” but it is more than mere semantics. In fact, it may be the most important word in the entire concept of due process.

The idea that due process protections are afforded to persons, not just citizens, has echoed across generations: Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) held that the 14th Amendment’s protections apply to “all persons within the territorial jurisdiction”; Wong Wing v. United States (1896) struck down imprisonment of Chinese laborers without trial; Plyler v. Doe (1982) invalidated a Texas law denying education to undocumented children; and Zadvydas v. Davis (2001) ruled that even those ordered removed cannot be detained indefinitely. Across more than a century of conflict and change, the Supreme Court has said the same thing: due process is not a reward for citizenship, it is a restraint on government. Its strength lies in its universality.

Your politics, not mine.

This discussion as political rhetoric may easily be dismissed as ideological rhetoric. But that is precisely the point; across time and political swings, the concept of due process has not changed.

Due process must always be apolitical because it ensures that the government may never overreach, especially when our identities and politics don’t align.

Consider an important modern test of the same principle: the January 6th prosecutions.

For many of us—including me—our first reaction was outrage. The images of shattered glass, battered officers, and a mob storming the seat of our democracy were seared into the national memory.

As a lawyer, and as someone who has spent much of my career on the side of law and order, I would have volunteered to be on the front lines prosecuting those cases. But outrage does not suspend due process.

Some defendants were charged with serious violent crimes; others faced misdemeanors such as trespass or disorderly conduct. A few spent months in pretrial detention awaiting hearings delayed again and again.

None of that excuses the conduct of that day. But it reminds us that due process does not hinge on our approval of the accused, it depends on whether the government honors the rights of persons, all persons.

We may disagree with immigration policy or the boundaries of enforcement, but the Constitution’s language does not waver. No one can be labeled without due process, and due process applies to every person.

The moment we let fear, politics or prejudice decide who falls outside that circle, we abandon not just others but the rule of law itself.

Due process protects the best of us by ensuring it protects the whole of us. It demands that before liberty or life is taken, the government must answer to law, not impulse. And one day, it may be all that stands between us and the arbitrary exercise of power.•

Fernanda Castorena, the program services coordinator at the UCC, shared that the UCC is a place where students can find academic support, legal counseling, and resources specifically for undocumented students.","For many immigrant students at Skyline College, immigration is not just an act of resilience, but a means of survival.

“If we go back, especially with our background of organizing for our rights, for human rights in Burma, we could literally be arrested or worse, killed. We cannot go back home, and we are not welcome here,” said Martin Tun, a Skyline student.

Tun immigrated to the U.S. as an international student from Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). He reflected on how the current increase in federal immigration enforcement has led to heightened unease and fear around being an immigrant right now in America.

Student refugees from Myanmar are not the only community at Skyline feeling the impact of escalated immigration enforcement. Undocumented students are faced with a similar intersection of challenges and concerns.

Over the summer, the expansion of immigration enforcement was catalyzed when Congress signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” into Law. This bill allocates $170.7 billion to immigration enforcement. It also enables authorization of more detentions and immigration related arrests, expanding upon and building new detention facilities across the country, and expediting ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) capacity for immigration enforcement.

Alexa Moore, a student at Skyline College who is part of the Unlocking Futures Fellowship in the Undocumented Community Center (UCC), shared how fear for safety can make it hard to prioritize school.

“When it comes to the Trump administration, it’s very difficult for students to focus on trying to pursue higher education when thinking of ‘if I go to school, something might happen to me in school,” Moore said. “Something might happen to me in public.’ If I were to be detained, that’s a waste of my time just to be sent back.”

Rebecca Pwint, who came to Skyline College as an international student, reflected on connections she has seen between her experience in Myanmar and now as a resident in the U.S.

“Before, people would be very excited to get their court dates for interviews and stuff. Now everyone is scared because of ICE detaining outside of the courtrooms,” Pwint said. “It’s like reliving the days in Burma, but I would say with more advanced technology…they are tracking your phone, they know where you are, you feel like you are watched all the time.”

In addition to safety concerns, immigrant students at Skyline also shared about the sacrifices their families are facing. ​

Moore explained she is now in a position to transfer to a university, and with that comes further financial strain on her family.

“What’s the point in doing all of this? When something might happen to me or my family, and then we might end up having to go back?” said Moore. “I don’t want it to be a waste of my parents’ time coming here.”

​Pwint shared a similar sentiment to Moore on parents sacrificing their time and resources.

“They have to sell their properties and jewelry to support us, and that burden is so heavy that you can’t help but sometimes feel helpless,” Pwint said.

Pwint explained how she feels there is more context needed to understand the experience of student immigrants from Myanmar.

“For us, I feel like there is another layer to being an immigrant, which is the [military] coup back home…I also came as an international student, having to pay about $8,000 a semester, when you know your family cannot afford it.” Pwint said, “But you are also forced to flee here because of the conscription law back home; with the coup, they will start killing you.

Pwint explained how the financial strain on families adds more pressure to the experience.

“So you can’t help but feel like a burden to your family because it’s a financial burden that they also have to endure that they’re not capable of, to be honest,” said Pwint.

The military coup in Myanmar started in 2021 when the democratically elected government was overthrown and taken over by the military. This coup was opposed by civilians and led to armed resistance to martial law.

Three years into the military coup, a conscription law was formally announced, endangering youth in the country. Although the law states that only people between 18-35 years of age will be drafted, according to Human Rights Watch, military recruiters have been kidnapping and forcing children to become soldiers.

“The conscription law was announced by the military regime in February 2024; rather than just conscription or military drafting, it was more of a forced kidnapping law.” Tun said, “This is the same military regime that almost the entirety of the Burmese population opposed, that we did not vote for.”

Tun explained that the conscription law was declared by the military regime in Feb. 2024. He shared that instead of just military drafting, the law induced kidnapping and killing.

“They overthrew our elected government, and when we peacefully protested, they did not just crack down on the protestors, but thousands were shot to death. Thousands of peaceful protesters were killed by them, and that’s the same military that is now asking us to serve in the military in turn to kill our own people,” Tun said.

Tun said how, upon coming to America, he saw a connection between the manner in which ICE is detaining people and the regime in Myanmar, in regards to forcibly taking people without regard for the age specified in the conscription law.

“In practice, it is similar to what ICE is doing. They don’t really care if you look like a youth, even if you are 16, they might just drag you, and the next thing you know, your child is just lost,” Tun said.

Skyline College offers support and community for immigrant students at Skyline. One of those resources for students is the UCC.

Fernanda Castorena, the program services coordinator at the UCC, shared that the UCC is a place where students can find academic support, legal counseling, and resources specifically for undocumented students.

“This work is really personal to me because I was… an undocumented community college student myself, and so this work is really personal to me,” Castorena said.

Castorena talked about how she is dedicated to providing her students with the best resources and support that she can.

“I think each time that I meet with students, I carry that understanding and that empathy into the things that are currently affecting us, and so because of that, I try to make sure that everything that I am providing students with is the most accurate up-to-date information,” Castorena said.

Aaron Torres Mendoza, a student a part of the Unlocking Futures Fellowship in the UCC shared how the resources he has found at Skyline have allowed him to continue as a college student.

“Without those resources, I don’t think I would still be here continuing to seek my higher education,” Torres Mendoza said.

Torres Mendoza explained that while there are resources available at Skyline for undocumented students, there is room for more support, especially when it comes to financial aid and scholarship opportunities.

“I see my citizen peers getting access to scholarships that give them thousands of dollars per semester or internships that pay them better hourly wages while they’re continuing in school. Not much of that is given to undocumented students,” Torres Mendoza said. “For me, I’m lucky to even find a scholarship that’s a couple of hundred dollars.”

Torres Mendoza also said that in the Stem Center, there is a wall of flyers with scholarship opportunities, most of which are not available to undocumented students. He shared that a separate section with opportunities accessible to undocumented students would be helpful.

In addition, Pwint said she would like to see a plan of action for students with vulnerable citizenship status to feel safe at Skyline.

Pwint mentioned how there are drills to prepare students for a variety of emergencies such as school shootings, and that ICE presence at school should be included on the list.

“I would like to see a more concrete stance and plans, if we can do drills, and a better way to communicate, rather than just text messages where there is no signal,” Pwint said. “Concrete steps would bring more comfort for us to be on campus.”

Tun and Pwint have been able to find community at Skyline through being a part of the Myanmar Student Union (MSU).

“I was able to go to my first meeting and learn more about it and find my hope. I felt so guilty about leaving the country and leaving my comrades behind,” Pwint said.

The MSU is a political organization that advocates and provides a community for Burmese students at Skyline. Over the years, the MSU has organized fundraisers for humanitarian aid in Myanmar, art builds, cultural festivals, carnivals, panels, a political play, and much more.

“I feel comfort in it [MSU], the support and the community here, and other people also fighting for national liberation, people who really listen to you and understand you. It’s not home, but it feels like home,” Pwint shared.

Tun adds to the importance of camaraderie among immigrants and students at this time, reflecting on the important role immigrants have always played in America.

“This whole country is built on the backs of immigrant labor, and that is the power we as immigrants have and need to realize,” Tun said.

Lastly, he noted that collective action is the strongest solution.

“The fact that there are so few of them, as in the billionaires and the rich few who are making all these oppressive policies upon the people,” Tun said. “We have so many of us, as long as you don’t see it as an individual problem and instead as a societal problem, a problem for all of us… We are definitely stronger.”",https://www.theskylineview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ABAZRhcEUJqIbW2LEu2Ab76SxeZtZIo7ofyfFa6B.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 07:17:23.051694

Court: Ambulance Chasing Not a RICO Claim But Fake Immigrant Papers Might Be,William Rabb,,,,,https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southeast/2025/11/05/846453.htm,"The Georgia Court of Appeals this week handed down multiple decisions, three of which could indirectly affect property and liability insurance coverage in the state for years to come.
On Oct. 31 this year, the appeals court vacated the huge verdict against the landlord and remanded the case for a new trial.
The appeals court disagreed.
Illegal immigrant labor can potentially affect workers’ compensation, builder’s risk and commercial liability insurance coverage, by underreporting payroll and the level of risk involved.
But the appellate judges said that the case law that those court decisions had relied on were not exactly on-point for this case.","The Georgia Court of Appeals this week handed down multiple decisions, three of which could indirectly affect property and liability insurance coverage in the state for years to come.

In a case over a deliberately set Atlanta apartment complex fire that killed a man and left 30 residents without a home, a jury in January 2024 had awarded $140 million to the family of the deceased resident. On Oct. 31 this year, the appeals court vacated the huge verdict against the landlord and remanded the case for a new trial.

The trial judge had given the jury improper instructions on premises liability, the appellate judges said. Despite the appeals court noting that the landlord had failed to install smoke detectors and sprinkler systems as required by law and regulation, “we conclude as a matter of law that the cause of the injury lay in an area possessed by Hughes (the deceased victim) and that it was error to charge the jury on premises liability law,” the opinion reads.

Instead, because the fire was set in a closet – not a common area at the complex – the jury should have been educated on landlord liability law, which exempts landlords from general landowner liability, the appeals court wrote.

The effect of the erroneous jury instruction was “to supplant the landlord’s limited duty to keep the premises in repair with ‘a harsher rule of responsibility than that to which it was already subject,'” the court wrote, citing a 1933 court ruling.

A further appeal by the Hughes estate are expected.

In a second opinion this week, the case involved allegations that may sound familiar to auto insurers: An Atlanta plaintiffs’ law firm was allegedly stirring up litigation with illegal ambulance chasing. No, it was not an insurance company making the accusations. It was another injury lawyer.

In Cambre vs. Lazenby, the appellate court on Nov. 3 found that a lower court should have dismissed a proposed class-action lawsuit. The case started in 2024 when Gainesville, Georgia, lawyer Shane Lazenby filed suit against Cambre & Associates, an Atlanta injury law firm.

Cambre was obtaining information about auto accident victims before that information was made public, then sending runners to solicit the victims as clients, often using high-pressure tactics, Lazenby alleged. Such practices are illegal under Georgia statutes and state Bar rules, the plaintiffs said.

Lazenby argued that the alleged ambulance chasing and “case running” gave the Cambre firm an unfair business advantage and constituted racketeering – in violation of Georgia’s Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. A trial court refused to dismiss the lawsuit, which Cambre’s team had said failed to state a claim or allege all necessary elements of a RICO violation. The appeals court disagreed.

“The facts alleged in support of Lazenby’s RICO claim are simply too attenuated and speculative to form the proximate cause of the supposed financial losses theoretically incurred by Lazenby and others similarly situated,” the appellate judges wrote.

In a third case, the appeals court found the opposite – that a trial court should not have dismissed a RICO suit brought by two whistleblowers stemming from a construction firm’s allegedly fraudulent immigration paperwork.

In Wommack vs. G.S. Construction, two human resources directors charged that the contractor had maintained a trove of fake documents purporting to show that illegal immigrant workers were fully documented.

The HR managers “discovered documents, such as fake social security cards, handwritten social security numbers, and fake permanent resident cards, that indicated the defendants were assisting these employees in committing identity fraud,” the court explained. Fraudulent drug screenings were also provided, the HR manager argued.

After insisting that she was required to report the unlawful employment, the first HR manager, Amy Weavear, was fired. Another one, Steven Wommack, was hired, and then fired in a similar manner, the court opinion said. Following their terminations, the plaintiffs filed a Georgia RICO civil complaint.

Illegal immigrant labor can potentially affect workers’ compensation, builder’s risk and commercial liability insurance coverage, by underreporting payroll and the level of risk involved. Some construction firms around the country have long been accused of hiring undocumented aliens and faking insurance coverage or deceiving insurance carriers.

“Both plaintiffs asserted not only that they suffered financial injury, including loss of wages, but also mental and emotional distress, and damage to their reputations,” the appeals court noted in the Wommack decision.

The trial court found that Georgia courts and the U.S. Supreme Court have held that a fired employee cannot turn the termination into a RICO suit. But the appellate judges said that the case law that those court decisions had relied on were not exactly on-point for this case. The plaintiff HR managers had alleged that the RICO violations were directly harmful to them and were made in furtherance of a scheme to profit from unauthorized immigrant labor.

“At this stage, because the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants’ acts or threats were intended to deter them from reporting the defendants’ criminal activity or later testifying, in violation of OCGA § 16-10-32(b) or OCGA § 16-10 93(b), the plaintiffs have each alleged that the defendants directed a predicate offense at them and that they suffered direct harm as a result—which is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss,” the appellate court wrote.",https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/11/ambulance-Adobe-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:18.266938

It is truly un-American.” Political tension across the nation is high as California voters cast ballots on Proposition 50,.
“California voters will not be sidelined from exercising their constitutional right to vote and should not let anyone deter them from exercising that right,” Weber said.
Los Angeles residents alone have cast more than 788,000 mail-in ballots.
Over the last month, the stakes in the California special election have ratcheted up as polls indicate Proposition 50 could pass.","As California voters went to the polls Tuesday to cast their ballot on a measure that could block President Trump’s national agenda, state officials ridiculed his unsubstantiated claims that voting in the largely Democratic state is “rigged.”

“The Unconstitutional Redistricting Vote in California is a GIANT SCAM in that the entire process, in particular the Voting itself, is RIGGED,” Trump said on Truth Social just minutes after polling stations opened Tuesday across California.

The president provided no evidence for his allegations.

“All ‘Mail-In’ Ballots, where the Republicans in that State are ‘Shut Out,’ is under very serious legal and criminal review,” the GOP president wrote. “STAY TUNED!”

Gov. Gavin Newsom dismissed the president’s claims on X as “the ramblings of an old man that knows he’s about to LOSE.”

In a video, Newsom said Trump had a history of “doing everything he can to suppress the vote.” The governor also used Trump’s latest claims to persuade Californians of the value of Proposition 50, Newsom’s plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts ahead of the 2026 election to favor the Democratic Party.

“He has folks dressed up in tactical gear, ICE and border patrol — 100 plus officers in L.A. as I speak — to intimidate and chill free expression, free speech, to intimidate voters; He does not believe in fair and free elections,” Newsom said of Trump. “What more evidence do we need of the importance of Proposition 50?”

At a White House briefing Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed, without providing examples, that California was receiving ballots in the name of undocumented immigrants who could not legally vote.

Asked what evidence Trump had that the voting underway in California is ‘rigged,’” Leavitt said: “They have a universal mail-in voting system, which we know is ripe for fraud.”

“Fraudulent ballots that are being mailed in in the names of other people, in the names of illegal aliens who shouldn’t be voting in American elections,” Leavitt added. “There’s countless examples and we’d be happy to provide them.”

Pressed for details, a White House staffer pointed to a September New York Post story about a Costa Mesa woman who faced felony charges in Orange County for registering her dog to vote and casting multiple ballots.

While no other examples from this election were provided, the official said California does not use voter ID. About 36 states do have laws requiring or requesting voters show identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, but California is one of 14 states and Washington, D.C., that use other methods to verify voters’ identity.

Assemblymember Marc Berman, a Democrat who wrote the 2021 law to make California a universal vote-by-mail state, said that voting by mail is safe and bipartisan. In 2017, he noted, Trump set up a presidential commission to search the country for cases of voter fraud.

“Six months later he disbanded the commission after no voter fraud was found,” Berman said. “This time is no different, but damage is still being done by this incessant eroding of Americans’ faith in our democracy. It is truly un-American.”

Political tension across the nation is high as California voters cast ballots on Proposition 50,. The measure is intended to offset GOP gerrymandering in red states after Trump pressed Texas to rejigger maps to shore up the GOP’s narrow House majority.

California’s top elections official, Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber, called Trump’s allegation “another baseless claim.”

“The bottom line is California elections have been validated by the courts,” Weber said in a statement. “California voters will not be deceived by someone who consistently makes desperate, unsubstantiated attempts to dissuade Americans from participating in our democracy.”

Weber noted that more than 7 million Californians have already voted and encouraged those who had yet to cast ballots to go to the polls.

“California voters will not be sidelined from exercising their constitutional right to vote and should not let anyone deter them from exercising that right,” Weber said.

Of the 7 million Californians who have voted, more than 4.6 million have done so by mail, according to the secretary of state’s office. Los Angeles residents alone have cast more than 788,000 mail-in ballots.

Leavitt told D.C. reporters Tuesday that the White House is working on an executive order to combat so-called “blatant” election fraud.

“The White House is working on an executive order to strengthen our election in this country,” Leavitt said, “and to ensure that there cannot be blatant fraud, as we’ve seen in California with their universal mail-in voting system.”

Trump has long criticized mail-in voting. As more Democrats opted to vote by mail in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the president repeatedly made unproven claims linking mail in voting with voter fraud. When Trump ultimately lost that election, he blamed expanded mail-in voting.

In March, Trump signed an executive order requiring that Attorney General Pam Bondi “take all necessary action” against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day. Most states count mail-in or absentee ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

Over the last month, the stakes in the California special election have ratcheted up as polls indicate Proposition 50 could pass. More than half of likely California voters said they planned to support the measure, which could allow Democrats to gain up to five House seats.

Last month, the Justice Department appeared to single out California for particular national scrutiny: It announced it would send federal monitors to polling locations in counties in California as well as New Jersey, another traditionally Democratic state that is conducting nationally significant off-year elections.

The monitors, it said, would be sent to five California counties: Los Angeles, Kern, Riverside, Fresno and Orange.

While Trump is often a flame-thrower on social media, he has largely been silent on Proposition 50, aside from a few Truth Social posts.

In late October, the president voiced skepticism with California’s mail-in ballots and early voting — directly contradicting efforts by the state’s GOP leaders to get people to vote.

“No mail-in or ‘Early’ Voting, Yes to Voter ID! Watch how totally dishonest the California Prop Vote is! Millions of Ballots being ‘shipped,’” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “GET SMART REPUBLICANS, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a37cf62/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+422/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F83%2F7a%2F3ada68ff45c6b31c4b55cc709106%2F1528054-me-election-prop-50-05-db.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:11.672490

The preliminary injunction hearing stems from a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who say agents have used too much force, including tear gas, during demonstrations.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis has already ordered agents to wear badges and banned them from using certain riot-control techniques, such as tear gas, against peaceful protesters and journalists. After repeatedly chastising federal officials for not following her previous orders, she added a requirement for body cameras.

The hearing comes after Ellis questioned senior Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino at a public hearing last week, where she took the rare step of ordering him to brief her each evening on the federal immigration crackdown in Chicago. That move was swiftly blocked by an appeals court.

On Tuesday, Bovino appeared in court yet again for a deposition — a private interview — with lawyers from both sides. Parts of the videotaped deposition will be played in court Wednesday, according to court filings.

Attorneys may also call to the stand a pastor who was hit in the head by a container containing a chemical agent while praying outside a federal immigration facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, local officials detained during protests outside the facility, and a protester who alleges she was hit by a flash-bang grenade that caused temporary hearing loss, court records show.

Court filings released late Monday night shed light on a previous deposition by Bovino in which he acknowledged tossing tear gas and being hit by a rock in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village last month. Bovino also testified that he has “instructed his officers to arrest protesters who make hyperbolic comments in the heat of political demonstrations,"" court records show.

Meanwhile, a federal judge is expected to rule Wednesday afternoon after a group of detainees filed a class-action lawsuit against federal authorities, alleging “inhuman” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman called the alleged conditions “unnecessarily cruel” after hearing people held at the facility detail overflowing toilets, crowded cells, no beds and water that “tasted like sewer.” He called for the hearing to reconvene at 4:15 p.m. local time Wednesday so that he can issue a temporary restraining order to address the conditions.

Courthouse to accommodate what is expected to be a large contingent of media and spectators.

At one point, Bovino was captured on video throwing tear gas above the heads of the crowd without warning and “despite an absence of threats or violence,” the filing alleged.","Nearly two months into “Operation Midway Blitz,” the controversial use-of-force tactics by immigration agents under the Trump administration will take center stage Wednesday in a Chicago federal courtroom, where a judge is deciding whether to put more long-term restrictions on the use of tear gas and other chemical agents on crowds and provide enhanced protections for protesters and media.

Among the evidence expected to be presented to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis during Wednesday’s preliminary injunction hearing: portions of sworn deposition testimony from Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and other immigration officials; footage from at least a dozen body-worn cameras agents were wearing during clashes with citizens across the city; and claims made by Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that force was appropriate to quell violent “rioters” who were attacking officers.

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. and could last well into the evening, as a temporary restraining order issued by Ellis as part of the underlying lawsuit expires on Thursday and the judge will have to decide quickly on whether to grant the requested remedies.

The case has received national attention, and an overflow courtroom has been set up at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse to accommodate what is expected to be a large contingent of media and spectators.

The hearing will be lacking at least one element of spectacle: Bovino will not have to appear as a live witness in court, as the plaintiffs agreed to drop that demand in exchange for an additional 90 minutes of deposition time.

But the 30-year Border Patrol veteran will certainly be front-and-center anyways. In arguments before Ellis on Tuesday, plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said they intend to play parts of Bovino’s deposition that will show he lied under oath, including making up “a story about getting hit in the head with a rock” in Little Village last month to justify personally lobbing tear gas canisters into the crowd.

The lawsuit filed by the Chicago Headline Club and a consortium of other media groups allege immigration officials have systematically violated the constitutional rights of protesters and reporters during the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement action, which began in earnest in mid-September and has shown no signs of slowing.

In laying out their case, lawyers for the plaintiffs said in a motion early Tuesday that the evidence in the case shows without injunctive relief, immigration agents “will continue to act as if they can use weapons of war to commit shocking acts of violence against civilians—protesters, press, clergy, bystanders, pregnant women, children—with impunity.”

Lawyers for the government, meanwhile, said that while Department of Homeland Security policy emphasizes respect for human life, de-escalation, and use of safe tactics, agents have a right to use necessary force to protect themselves and enforce lawful orders.

“Rioters have attacked law enforcement personnel with fireworks, rocks, and other objects,” the government filing stated. “Rioters also breached the perimeter of federal buildings, blocked all traffic into the only immigration facility in the region, damaged federal vehicles, and injured officers. At some violent protests, officers responded by issuing dispersal orders and using nonlethal crowd-control devices.”

The Department of Justice also said issuing a preliminary injunction would “continue the judicial micromanaging of immigration enforcement actions” and cause officers to hesitate in the field before protecting themselves or the public “out of fear of contempt.”

Before the hearing begins Wednesday, the parties will be going over a litany of last-minute issues, including whether portions of the proceedings should be sealed from public view.

Department of Justice attorney Elizabeth Hedges argued Tuesday they have not had time to make redactions to officer reports or body cam footage and that the courtroom should be cleared to avoid any inadvertent dissemination of officers’ identifications or non-public Homeland Security tactics or policies.

Art called that argument a “farce.”

“They can’t just seal an American courtroom…based on some vague notion that there is a danger to officers,” Art said.

Ellis asked for a list of everything the Department of Justice thought should be under seal and a brief description on why, and she would rule on the issue ahead of the hearing Wednesday. But she made clear she is not inclined to seal agents’ identifications.

“No other law enforcement officer, unless that officer is operating in an undercover capacity, has his or her identity sealed in a case,” Ellis said. “If a police officer files a report, everybody knows who that police officer is and that is revealed in open court.”

In their motion requesting an injunction, the plaintiffs laid out a series of high-profile incidents over the last month, including clashes between immigration officers in Chicago neighborhoods as well as in the suburbs. The motion accused agents and their supervisors of exaggerating the threat posed by citizens protesting arrests and filming immigration activities and, in many cases, lying about the force used to subdue them.

In one episode from the Lakeview neighborhood on Oct. 24, videos showed that one agent mocked the “vocal but nonviolent crowd of protesters” as tear gas was deployed, saying twice, “have fun!” and laughing at the protesters after the canister went off, according to the plaintiff’s filing.

“The agent then yelled ‘throw another one’ and prepared a second canister,” the filing stated. “Similarly, one agent told another, ‘Hey, throw it (tear gas) for fun.'”

The plaintiffs also alleged that some of the lies have come from Bovino himself, the person identified as the overall leader of “Operation Midway Blitz.”

In his sworn deposition, which lasted 6 1/2 hours over three days, Bovino testified he did not use force against a male protester who was yelling at him outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview on Oct. 3, the filing stated. Those assertions had been echoed by ICE Field Director Russell Hott, who claimed in public statements after the incident that Bovino had been assaulted.

But video from the scene showed the man never touched Bovino. Instead, the commander turned toward the man as he was obeying an order to move back and said, “What’d you say?” then climbed over a railing and tackled him to the ground, the filing alleged.

“Bovino’s denial that he applied force against Blackburn and Hott’s echo of this lie undermines the credibility of both witnesses, as well as the government’s broader contentions about rampant violence by protesters,” the plaintiff’s filing stated.

The motion also called into question the government’s claims about a recent incident in Little Village, where Bovino was seen leading an immigration action that targeted a laundromat and discount mall and sparked vehement protests on the streets.

At one point, Bovino was captured on video throwing tear gas above the heads of the crowd without warning and “despite an absence of threats or violence,” the filing alleged.

According to the filing, body-worn camera video turned over as part of the litigation showed Bovino telling his officers, “if you need to deploy gas, you deploy (expletive) gas.” One of the officers allegedly responded, “No, we’re good. We’re good. We’re ready to move out whenever you are,” the filing said.

Instead of the agents moving on, more violence ensued, including one agent who fired a pepper spray ball at close range and threw more tear gas at the crowd, “all without warning,” the filing alleged.

Her boyfriend, real estate broker Kyle Pearcy, was dressed as an ICE operative in camouflage uniform, flack jacket, and baseball cap.

A spokesperson for Rep. Boebert’s office told The Independent: “It’s a Halloween costume. Tell our senators to vote for the CR [continuing resolution] and open the government. They are choosing to let millions of American families suffer.”

The Independent has also contacted the DHS, and ICE for comment.

President Donald Trump has appropriated the sombrero over the last month for use in a series of memes mocking House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, most recently on a spoof MySpace page, as part of his attempt to blame Democrats for the government shutdown.

Boebert’s choice of costume appeared to be marrying that trend with a reference to the administration’s nationwide crackdown on undocumented migrants, which has principally targeted the Hispanic populations of Democrat-run cities.

Among those posting pictures from the party was Trisha Calvarese, a Democrat running to unseat Boebert, who wrote on X: “Lauren Boebert put more effort into a hateful Halloween party costume than she ever has into serving the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District.”

A person who was present at the party told ABC News, “It is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. Even the conservatives [at the party] were in shock. People avoided them.”

Also responding was Stacy Suniga, the president of the Latino Coalition of Weld County in Colorado, who told The Denver Post: “She should be ashamed of herself. Though I believe she is incapable of any emotion that generates human decency. Her bigotry and ignorance are clearly evident in her chosen apparel this day.”

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, co-chair of the Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus, urged Boebert to apologize and said she “should know that our culture is not a costume and being bilingual is an asset, not a joke.”

“The Latino Caucus was made aware of the photo on Saturday and members were outraged,” Gonzales told the Post. “We immediately began conversations within our caucus of how we wanted to respond.

“Congresswoman Boebert chose to mock our community, co-opt our culture, and make a sick joke while immigrant Coloradans with lawful immigration status in her own district… are being detained by ICE after doing everything that has been asked of them.”",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/16/12/42/GettyImages-2153410081.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-11-05 03:17:31.320016

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests in Virginia have nearly tripled under President Donald Trump's leadership compared to the previous administration, prompting Homeland Security to call out some of the state's ""worst of the worst"" dangerous and violent offenders captured just last week in the state.

The undocumented immigrant offenders highlighted by DHS came from Central America and the Caribbean, including El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, their crimes ranged from drug smuggling to domestic violence, rape, ""carnal abuse,"" making terroristic threats, extortion and more.

""This past week, ICE took down sexual predators, drug traffickers, rapists, abusers and other violent thugs across the Commonwealth,"" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""These arrests underscore the reality of open border and sanctuary policies that allowed criminals around the world to come to America and roam free across our country. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, the U.S. is closed to lawbreakers. We will continue to use every available tool to make America safe again.""

MAJOR BLUE COUNTY IN HOT SEAT AFTER VIOLENT ILLEGAL ALIEN ARRESTED 10 TIMES FINALLY NABBED BY ICE

One of the offenders from Guatemala, Westher Antonio Jacobo Morales, was previously deported in 2016, but committed a felony when he chose to come back and re-enter illegally once again, according to DHS. Arrested last week by ICE officers in Richmond, Morales has a rap sheet that includes rape, extortion and violating a court order.

A second offender from Guatemala, Daniel Soc-Patzan, entered the country illegally in 2013 and was issued a final order of removal that same year. He was arrested last week by ICE officials in Richmond as well. According to DHS, Soc-Patzan has a rap sheet including multiple infractions for assault and aggravated domestic violence.

Meanwhile, another illegal immigrant criminal highlighted by DHS had a criminal history involving ""carnal abuse"" and sexual assault. That individual, Harvin Francisco Rivera-Diaz, was arrested last week in Richmond after illegally crossing the southern border from Nicaragua in 2022 under the former Biden administration.

Adolfo Flores Ramirez, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, was arrested the same day, in Northern Virginia's Loudoun County. His criminal history included charges of driving under the influence, domestic violence and assault.

In addition to undocumented immigrants from Central America, ICE officials in Virginia picked up criminal illegal aliens from the Caribbean as well.

BIDEN-ERA ‘UNVETTED’ IMMIGRANTS NABBED AFTER VIRGINIA HIGHWAY GUNFIRE AS BORDER DEBATE HITS GOVERNOR'S RACE

One from Jamaica, Shannovan Emeil Facey, was issued a final order of removal in 2013 but has managed to stay in the United States until now after his arrest in Richmond. His criminal history includes drug smuggling, drug possession and weapons charges, according to DHS.

A second criminal illegal alien from the Caribbean included a man from the Dominican Republic who was arrested last week by ICE agents in Norfolk. The man, Elvin Tiburcio Mirambeaux, has a criminal history including making terroristic threats and drug possession.

Past ""worst of the worst"" roundups include arrests made in Los Angeles of illegal immigrant gang members, murderers and child predators.

For example, Mexican national Juan Carlos Marin-Hipolito was convicted of murder and sentenced to 50 years to life in prison, DHS said. Diego Fernandez-Martinez, also from Mexico, had convictions for carjacking, vehicle theft, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of a controlled substance for sales, robbery and prisoner in possession of a weapon, according to DHS, which noted he was also a member of the Surenos gang.

Meanwhile, a ""worst of the worst"" Halloween weekend roundup included arrests of criminal illegal aliens convicted of intercourse with a minor, sexual abuse, kidnapping, homicide and other serious crimes. DHS highlighted that 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S., according to a statement to Fox News Digital.

With multiple important statewide elections in Virginia looming, Fox News Digital reached out to Virginia candidates for governor and attorney general, including Democrat gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger, Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, Democrat Attorney General candidate Jay Jones and Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, for comment on these recent arrests.

""Disobedience of the law has no place in Virginia. Attorney General Miyares has proven time and again that violent offenders, including those in our country illegally, will face swift and uncompromising justice when they harm innocent Virginians,"" representatives for Miyares said. ""Jay Jones, on the other hand, would take our Commonwealth in the opposite direction. He intends to turn Virginia into a sanctuary state, tying the hands of law enforcement and endangering every law-abiding Virginian.""

We’re going to kill them.” Trump administration officials are also purposefully withholding information from lawmakers.
Last week, in a separate briefing, the administration excluded Democrats in a briefing with Senate Republicans on the strikes.","As the Trump administration blows past a key congressional deadline, a top lawyer in the Department of Justice has claimed that the executive branch does not need the approval of Congress to continue conducting boat strikes in and around the Caribbean — an assertion outside experts say is patently false.

Last week, Office of Legal Counsel T. Elliot Gaiser told a small group of members of Congress that the administration does not have to follow the 1973 War Powers Resolution and its mandate that Congress must approve of armed conflict conducted by the U.S.

The briefing was made just before the end of the 60-day deadline established by the legislation. The legislation requires the president to acquire approval for sustained military action within 60 days of an initial notification of actions. This deadline passed on Monday. Gaiser said that the administration is not going to seek approval or an extension of the deadline.

In an email to The Washington Post, a senior official said that strikes do not rise to the level of “hostilities,” as defined under the law.

The administration’s reasoning, it seems, is that “even at its broadest … [it] has been understood to apply to placing U.S. service-members in harm’s way,” and that the current engagement does not do so — even as the administration claims that the current operation is conducted in self-defense.

“The operation comprises precise strikes conducted largely by unmanned aerial vehicles launched from naval vessels in international waters at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,” the email said.

Experts say this reasoning is patently wrong. Brian Finucane, senior advisor for the International Crisis Group’s U.S. program, pointed out that Congress has previously noted that the resolution purposefully used a broader term — “hostilities” — rather than a narrower term — “armed conflict.” This was so that it could encompass not just attacks, but also a “clear and present danger of armed conflict.”

Further, last month, Trump explicitly said that the administration was engaged in “armed conflict” in its boat strike campaign.

“[F]or the administration to claim U.S. forces are in an armed conflict but not hostilities would be nonsensical to those members of Congress who passed the legislation,” Finucane wrote for Just Security.

Officials’ assertion of control over war powers is a show of how the Trump administration seems to be shifting its legal reasoning on the fly to continue its strikes. Trump, for his part, appears unconcerned with legal reasoning, simply saying last month: “I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, okay? We’re going to kill them.”

Trump administration officials are also purposefully withholding information from lawmakers. Last week, in a separate briefing, the administration excluded Democrats in a briefing with Senate Republicans on the strikes. And in briefings so far, lawmakers say the Pentagon has not provided lists of which gangs they’re targeting or the identities of those killed.

In fact, Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told The New Republic that the administration said they are targeting anyone “affiliated” with “narco-terrorist” groups — and that the administration won’t even explain what constitutes an “affiliation.”

“They did not in any way, shape, manner, or form explain what the ceiling and floor are for ‘affiliated,’” Smith said. Smith added that the administration’s treatment of survivors of the strikes — all of whom so far have been repatriated to their home countries — underscores the illegality of the operations.

Smith says he told administration officials: “So what you’re telling us is you need less evidence to kill somebody than you do to hold them.”

Meanwhile, the operation is seemingly constantly on the verge of expanding into a ground war. Last week, Miami Herald and The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. is prepared to strike ground targets within Venezuela.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/2025_11-4-trump-air-force-one.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:17:15.282327

Security forces have arrested three prominent scholars — Parviz Sedaghat, Mahsa Asadollazadeh, and Shirin Karimi — while summoning and interrogating economic researcher Mohammad Maljoo. The arrests of these independent voices in the social sciences and humanities who are known for their critical, left-leaning perspectives on Iran’s political and economic structures appears to mark a new, concerning violation of freedom of speech and thought.

The situation of the four citizens remains unclear, as neither Iran’s security nor judicial authorities have issued any official statements regarding their detention. The absence of information about the arresting authority, reasons, or charges has deepened fears among Iran’s academic and human-rights communities about their safety and due process.

According to reports, security agents raided the homes of these individuals, confiscating electronic devices, books, and research materials. The simultaneous arrests and summons indicate what appears to be a coordinated operation targeting researchers known for their critical and independent scholarship.

Parviz Sedaghat, a 63-year-old economist and political-economy researcher, has been an influential figure in Iranian intellectual life. He has collaborated with several economic publications, written extensively on inequality and neoliberalism in Iran, and published numerous translations and critical essays on global political economy. Known for his left-oriented analyses of capitalism and state policy, Sedaghat was arrested at his home on Sunday evening after security officers searched the premises and seized his belongings.

Mahsa Asadollazadeh, 35, is a sociologist and graduate of Tarbiat Modares University. Recognized for her independent research in political sociology and contributions to the website Political Economic Critique (Naqd-e Eqtesad-e Siasi), she was arrested on Monday at her parents’ residence in Tehran. Witnesses report that security officers entered without explanation and confiscated her personal and academic equipment. Her work often engages with critical social theory and explores power relations within Iran’s social structure.

Shirin Karimi, 42, is a translator and sociologist with a degree from the University of Tehran. She has authored and translated numerous works in sociology and philosophy, contributing to Iran’s critical academic literature. She was detained early Monday morning following a search of her home, during which agents seized her books and communication devices. As of now, her place of detention remains unknown.

Mohammad Maljoo, 53, an economist with a PhD from the University of Tehran, was summoned for questioning and had his personal devices confiscated. Maljoo, who has taught both in Iran and abroad, is recognized for his critical studies on Iran’s post-revolutionary economic history and his progressive economic viewpoints. Though not officially detained, his interrogation and confiscation of materials suggest that the crackdown extends beyond formal arrests.

The Islamic Students’ Association of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Tehran issued a public statement on November 4, condemning what it called the “arrest and intimidation of independent researchers.” The statement declared that “at a time when the country is collapsing under successive political, economic, social, and cultural crises — crises the ruling institutions cannot or will not acknowledge — the government has once again resorted to the outdated tool of repression instead of accountability.”

These arrests occur amid a wider pattern of pressure against writers, journalists, and activists across the country. In recent weeks, similar actions have been reported not only in Tehran but also in Kurdistan, Kerman, and Isfahan Provinces, where teachers and labor organizers have been harassed or detained. Security agents recently searched the home of journalist Marzieh Rasouli, producer of the Radio Marz podcast, and confiscated her electronic devices.

Meanwhile, editors of the Tehran-based daily Ham-Mihan reported that security agencies shut down the newspaper’s website and ordered its staff to refrain from posting on social media. The paper’s publisher, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, publicly denounced ongoing pressure from the IRGC Intelligence Organization and the Ministry of Intelligence, warning of the shrinking space for free expression in the country.

Ahmad Zeidabadi, a journalist writing for Ham-Mihan, noted: “The website of Ham-Mihan newspaper has been blocked since last week without any legal notice, and the paper is now published only in limited printed copies. The survival of modern newspapers depends on their online platforms, and blocking a paper’s website is effectively no different from shutting down its publication altogether.”

The arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, and confiscation of personal and research materials constitute clear violations of international human-rights standards, including Articles 9 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a party. These actions undermine freedom of expression, academic freedom, and the right to security and fair trial. Human-rights observers warn that such detentions are intended to intimidate intellectuals, silence critical inquiry, and dismantle Iran’s independent academic community. The lack of transparency and denial of legal counsel reflect a systematic pattern of repression that extends beyond individual cases.

The arrests of Sedaghat, Asadollazadeh, and Karimi represent an alarming continuation of Iran’s pattern of seeking to silence independent voices. NIAC strongly condemns the detention of these scholars and all political prisoners held for peacefully exercising their rights to free expression, association, and academic inquiry. NIAC urges the Iranian government to move in line with its international rights obligations, including by immediately releasing Parviz Sedaghat, Mahsa Asadollazadeh, Shirin Karimi, and all prisoners unjustly detained in Iran.",https://niacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/niac-new-favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-05 07:17:26.699547

In their letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, the Senators raised concerns with the “near-total secrecy” under which IAO operates in light of a series of troubling immigration enforcement actions that this Administration has taken – pointing to examples and credible reports of violations of detainees’ rights and inhumane treatment while in ICE custody. They pressed Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons for responses to a series of questions in the interest of providing much-needed transparency for Congress and the American public on these issues, including around the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

“We write to express our concerns regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) severe lack of transparency. IAO has been at the center of troubling actions ICE has taken under this administration but provides no public data on its operations,” the Senators began.

“IAO has been centrally involved in facilitating several concerning immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump Administration,” they wrote, pointing to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the relocation of university student Rumeysa Ozturk before a judge could rule on her case, and the attempted deportation of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala without due process. “These cases paint a troubling picture of IAO attempting to shortcut due process rights and avoid or defy judicial authority.

“IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers,” they continued. “The ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 report finds that flight volume is also trending upward, as the number of IAO flights has steadily increased throughout the year, with the months of May through August reaching higher figures than ever previously recorded.”

“Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as ‘dehumanizing’ and even ‘dangerous,’” they added. “A recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several detainees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them where they were going. […] Detainees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. In addition, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.

“Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency,” they concluded, going on to list a series of questions for response by Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons regarding the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

The letter was led by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and signed by Blumenthal and Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).

Context: For years, the Broadview facility has served as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility designed to hold people for fewer than 12 hours.

But in June, DHS officials quietly expanded permissions to 72 hours despite the lack of beds, showers, private bathrooms or medical care.

What they're saying: The hearing featured hours of testimony by former detainees who described cold, crowded, dirty rooms filled with more than 100 people, hard chairs, overflowing toilets, lights on 24 hours a day, sick people and foil blankets on the floor.

Two detainees testified they were kept there for five days.

The other side: Government lawyers admitted to the lack of beds, working showers, private toilets, medical care and private legal communication.

But they said they've started distributing baby wipes and detaining people for shorter periods before moving them to correctional facilities where they can more easily communicate with lawyers.

Plaintiff attorney Alexa Van Brunt said the temporary restraining order her clients are requesting is ""meant to improve things for a short amount of time so people are not suffering as they have been for months and so that people are not forced to sign things that waive their rights for the rest of their life.""

Federal government attorneys argued against the proposed TRO.

Key moments: Government lawyers described non-working showers at Broadview, and Judge Robert Gettleman said, ""One is reminded of Auschwitz when one thinks about that.""

""The fact that people are being kept overnight under not just one but multiple conditions that are unnecessarily cruel, if you wanna put a word on it, sleeping shoulder to shoulder next to filthy toilets that are overflowing surrounded by human waste is unacceptable,"" Gettleman said in closing.

Attorneys quibbled about whether detainee meals come from Subway or Jimmy John's. A consensus emerged around small, cold Subway sandwiches.

In Washington County, the Board of Commissioners declared a state of emergency Tuesday to allocate additional funds for immigration-related services. Leaders in neighboring Yamhill County said they’re also seeing an increase in enforcement activity.

A Newberg resident recorded video Sunday of what appeared to be federal agents arresting a man at a downtown laundromat. County officials said witnesses also reported seeing agents detain another person across the street at a Thriftway grocery store.

“From shopping to schools, I know church was closed this weekend because of ICE activity,” said Yamhill County Commissioner Bubba King.

King said people in the community are frightened and staying home.

“It’s no way for kids or families to have to live — in fear,” he said.

A local farmworker said he was heading to the laundromat when he got word that ICE agents were nearby.

“It feels bad because you can’t go out shopping. You can’t do a lot. Can’t go out at ease. So, there’s fear,” he said.

Another resident shared video of a suspected ICE vehicle downtown, just blocks from Newberg City Council President Elise Yarnell Hollamon’s home.

“These are my neighbors. They are people that my kid goes to school with their kids,” Yarnell Hollamon said. “I have a lot of concern about how to have those conversations with our kids and our neighborhood.”

The Trump administration has said its immigration crackdown is meant to improve community safety. But some local leaders and advocates argue the visible arrests are creating widespread fear and disrupting families and businesses.

“Immigrants are workers but also small business owners and consumers,” said Miriam Vargas Corona, executive director of Unidos Bridging Community. “Every time someone is taken, it creates a ripple effect in our local economy.”

King said he’s frustrated by what he sees as a lack of compassion for longtime residents.

“These people have lived here 20 to 30 years,” King said. “There’s a due process and human rights aspect that’s being overlooked. I’m getting tired of the insanity of that piece of it.”",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/b41dd972-382e-4c74-a27d-a95f820842b0/20251105T015347/b41dd972-382e-4c74-a27d-a95f820842b0_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 22:16:59.172777

The program offers federal student loan forgiveness to those who spend ten years repaying such loans while working full time in a public service job. The statute provides a clear list of qualifying employers, which include military service, emergency management, public health, government, public safety, law enforcement, early childhood education and library science, and all 501(c)(3) organizations, among others.

On October 31, the Department of Education issues a new rule that disqualifies employers from the PSLF program if the Department deems them to have a “substantial illegal purpose.” Under the rule, the Department will decide for itself whether this standard is met, based on its unilateral determination that an organization has engaged in activities disfavored by the administration concerning immigration, gender affirming care, and purported discrimination, along with other areas. The rule’s vague and overbroad language permits arbitrary enforcement against mission-driven organizations doing work or expressing opinions opposed by the government. The new rule threatens to harm many of the 2.5 million federal student loan borrowers who have collectively worked more than 100 million months in public service jobs in order to qualify for PSLF forgiveness.

The Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration serves as an important tool to inform Parliament and Canadians about key admission highlights and data on immigration in Canada. Its tabling in Parliament is mandated by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). This year, the Annual Report places renewed focus on the reporting requirements outlined in section 94 of IRPA. Reflecting this focus, the Report has been restructured to spotlight key data tables, year-over-year comparisons, and metrics central to immigration planning and accountability.

In addition to the Annual Report, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) also produces the Departmental Results Report (DRR). The DRR provides parliamentarians and Canadians with information on the Department’s performance against the expected results outlined in the Departmental Results Framework and Departmental Plan. It follows the structure of IRCC’s Core Responsibilities, as approved by the Treasury Board Secretariat. The DRR includes broader data and insights than those found in the Annual Report.

Please note that the DRR and the Annual Report may be tabled at separate times. If the Annual Report is published first, there may be a period during which the most recent DRR is not yet available.

About the Data in this Report

Admissions dataFootnote 1 are presented in Tables 1 through 4, as well as on the Government of Canada’s Open Government Portal.

In accordance with the Privacy Act, IRCC has implemented data rounding practices to help protect an individual’s privacy when publishing statistical data. This process includes masking small counts between 1 and 5, and randomly rounding other numerical data, including totals, up or down to a specified multiple (e.g., 5 or 10). These measures help prevent the identification of individuals in the data while maintaining overall data integrity.

IRCC continues to implement the 2021 Sex and Gender Client Identifier Policy, which enables individuals who do not identify as female or male to select “Another Gender – X” as their gender identifier on official documents such as passports, travel documents, citizenship certificates, and permanent resident cards. The “X” designation aligns with international standards for travel document specifications and remains the only alternative to “F” and “M” for the mandatory sex field in travel documents. IRCC is working to ensure consistent application of the policy across all program lines, including the collection, recording, and display of sex and gender information. As implementation continues, it is important to note that the term “unspecified”, which was used prior to the adoption of “Another Gender – X”, may still appear in some records as “recorded in the system.” This legacy designation is maintained separately from “X”.

Processing times for immigration applications are published and updated monthly on IRCC’s website. Readers are directed to the following link for the most up-to-date information: Check current IRCC processing times.

Immigration to Help Meet Canada’s Needs

Immigration has profoundly shaped Canada’s economic, social, and cultural fabric. First Nations and Inuit have lived on these lands since time immemorial. The French, English, and Métis Nations played foundational roles in shaping the early identity and institutions of the country. Since then, generations of immigrants have helped build a more inclusive, prosperous, and forward-looking Canada, one that continues to see diversity as a source of strength.

First generation immigrantsFootnote 2 comprised 23% of the population in 2021.Footnote 3 Data published by Statistics Canada indicates that as of January 1, 2025, the Canadian population reached 41,528,680.Footnote 4 In 2024, Statistics Canada estimated that Canada’s population grew by 744,324 people, a growth rate of 1.8% which is lower than in 2022 or 2023 and may reflect a transition back to rates more in line with the pre-pandemic period. Notably, international migration accounted for 97.3% of this growth. While Canada experienced a modest natural increase, with an estimated 19,738 more birthsFootnote 5 than deaths over the year, this alone would have resulted in only minimal growth. Immigration remains the primary driver of Canada’s population expansion.

Moving forward, Canada’s immigration policies will continue to focus on attracting, retaining and successfully integrating immigrants who are needed to help provide services, build infrastructure and support Canada’s economy. Immigration policies will also seek to balance Canada’s economic objectives with our family reunification, humanitarian and refugee commitments.

With growth comes the responsibility to ensure that those who choose Canada as their destination, and those who are already here, have access to the infrastructure, resources, and services necessary to build and sustain their lives.

Permanent Immigration to Canada

Foreign nationals can immigrate to Canada permanently through a variety of pathways and programs. These permanent resident programs grant individuals the right to live, work or study anywhere in the country. If they meet the requirements, permanent residents can also apply for, and be granted, Canadian citizenship.

IRCC facilitates the entry of permanent residents in a way that maximizes their economic, social, and cultural contributions to Canada, while also safeguarding the health, safety and security of all Canadians.

In 2024, 483,640 immigrants were admitted as permanent residents, in line with targets set out in the Government of Canada’s Immigration Levels Plan. Of these, 244,965 identified as women, 238,650 as men, and 30 as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 471,808 immigrants were admitted as permanent residents, which indicates a 2.5% increase from 2023 to 2024.

The following table provides the number of foreign nationals who became permanent residents, including those admitted under federal-provincial-territorial agreements.

Economic Immigration

Canada has various immigration programs to attract talented people and to spread benefits to communities across the country. Economic programs select skilled workers and entrepreneurs for their ability to contribute to the Canadian economy. The economic immigration class is the largest source of permanent resident admissions, accounting for 58.2% of all admissions in 2024. In 2024, 281,615 principal applicants and their spouses and/or dependents were admitted to Canada under Economic Immigration categories. Of these, 134,155 identified as women, 147,455 identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 272,744 individuals were admitted to Canada under the Economic Class reflecting a 3.3% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Express Entry

Express Entry is Canada’s application management system for the Federal Skilled Worker Program, Federal Skilled Trades Program, Canadian Experience Class, and a portion of the Provincial Nominee Program. Express Entry manages the intake of applications for permanent residence under key economic immigration programs, while facilitating the selection of individuals most likely to succeed economically. An additional tool within Express Entry is Category-Based Selection (CBS), which enables the Minister to establish categories to meet an identified economic goal and invite top-ranked candidates, who are eligible for the category, to apply for permanent residence. In 2024, candidates with experience in occupations eligible under the following categories were invited to apply for permanent residence through CBS rounds: French-language proficiency, Healthcare, Education, Trades, Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) occupations, Transport and Agriculture and Agri-food. In 2024, a total of 19 CBS rounds were conducted.

In 2024, Canada admitted a total of 134,980Footnote 20 individuals through Express Entry, including principal applicants and their accompanying spouses and dependants on these programs. Of these, 63,890 identified as women, 71,085 as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

Federal Business Class

The Federal Business Class attracts highly-skilled talent to support Canada’s strategic economic growth. The Class comprises the Start-Up Visa (SUV) program, which is designed to attract early-stage, high-growth companies that create jobs, and the Self-employed persons program, which selects exceptional individuals in the arts or athletics who will help strengthen Canada’s cultural fabric. In 2024, Canada welcomed a total of 7,635 individuals through these programs, including principal applicants and their accompanying family members. Of these, 3,670 identified as women, 3,965 identified as men, and a small proportion of the remaining applicants identified as another gender.Footnote 21

Regional Economic Immigration Programs and Pilots

Regional economic immigration programs, namely the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP), Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot (RNIP), and the Rural and Francophone Community Immigration Pilots (RCIP/FCIP) are place-based strategies designed to respond to diverse and evolving regional labour market needs, drive population growth outside major urban centres, and promote long-term integration and retention. These programs collectively accounted for 45% of economic immigration admissions in 2024.Footnote 22 While not included in this percentage, francophone immigration also plays a key role in supporting regional vitality and economic development, particularly in Francophone Minority Communities outside Quebec, through broader commitments to linguistic diversity and demographic renewal.

Regional programs are designed to allow delivery partners (i.e. provinces, territories, and communities) to select immigrants with the skills and experience needed to fill critical labour needs and better respond to regional realities.

In 2024, Canada admitted a total of 114,905 individuals through the PNP and 8,055 through the AIP, including principal applicants and their accompanying spouses and dependants. Of those admitted through the PNP, 53,730 were women, and 61,175 were men. For the AIP, 3,825 identified as women, and 4,230 as men. A small number of individuals in both programs identified as another gender.

The RNIP admitted a total of 4,070 permanent residents, in 2024, including principal applicants and their accompanying spouses and dependants, to one of eleven rural and remote communities across Canada. Of these, 1,895 identified as women, and 2,175 as men. The RNIP sunset in 2024 after five years and was replaced by the RCIP and the FCIP.

Sectoral Economic Immigration Pilot Programs

Economic immigration pilot programs test innovative approaches to help support specific economic objectives and labour market needs across Canada.

Under the Caregiver category, the Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker pilots, which received applications between June 18, 2019 to June 17, 2024, provided clear and direct pathways to permanent residence for workers who helped to meet the home care needs of Canada’s seniors, children and people with disabilities.

In 2024, 6,095 permanent residents and their spouses and dependants were admitted through the Caregiver category.Footnote 23 Of these, 3,685 identified as women, and 2,410 identified as men.

The five-year Agri-Food Pilot program (AFP), which expired on May 14, 2025, tested an industry-specific approach to immigration to help address longstanding labour needs in the Canadian agri-food sector. It provided a pathway to permanent residence for experienced, non-seasonal workers in year-round occupations in the mushroom and greenhouse crop production, meat processing, and livestock raising industries. In 2024, a total of 1,840 individuals (including principal applicants and their dependants) were admitted as permanent residents through the five-year AFP. Of these, 865 identified as women, and 980 identified as men.

Family Reunification

Family reunification remains a cornerstone of Canada’s immigration system. Canada remains committed to helping Canadian citizens and permanent residents sponsor eligible relatives to become permanent residents themselves. This commitment not only strengthens family bonds but also contributes to the economic, social, and cultural vitality of communities across the country. Sponsors agree to assume financial responsibility for the sponsored individual for a specified period, ensuring a smooth transition and integration into Canadian society.

In 2024, 105,990 individuals were admitted under the Family Reunification Category – this includes sponsored spouses, partners, dependent children and sponsored parents and grandparents as well as other sponsored family members. Of these, 64,170 identified as women, 41,810 as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 109,730 individuals were admitted under the Family Reunification Category representing a 3.4% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Sponsored Spouses, Partners, and Dependent Children

In 2024, 78,655 individuals were admitted under the sponsored spouses, partners and children category. Of these, 47,775 identified as women, 30,870 as men, and 10 identified as another gender.Footnote 24

In 2023, a total of 81,417 individuals were admitted under this category marking a 3.4% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Sponsored Parents and Grandparents

In 2024, 27,330 individuals were admitted under the Sponsored Parents and Grandparents category. Of these, 16,395 identified as women, and 10,940 as men.

In 2023, a total of 28,313 individuals were admitted under this category, representing a 3.5% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Super Visa

Parents or grandparents may also apply for the super visa, a multi-entry temporary resident visa that allows them to reunite with their Canadian citizen, permanent resident, and registered IndianFootnote 25 family members in Canada for up to five years per entry. While in Canada, they may also apply for extensions of up to two additional years.

In 2024, the Department approved 53,695 super visas applications. Of these, 33,040 were issued to individuals identifying as women and 20,655 to those identifying as men.

In 2023, a total of 73,113 super visas applications were approved, representing a 26.6% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Humanitarian and Compassionate and Other

The following section presents the number of individuals granted permanent resident status on the basis of humanitarian and compassionate grounds or public policy considerations.

Permanent residency may be granted on a case-by-case basis under humanitarian and compassionate grounds, or through public policy considerations in exceptional circumstances. These admissions comprise all Humanitarian and Compassionate and Other admissions, along with the Permit Holder Class.

In 2024, a total of 19,355 individuals were admitted under this category. Of these, 10,200 identified as women, and 9,150 as men and a small proportion identified as another gender. Admissions under this pathway exceeded planned range due to urgent public policy responses to global crises, including the humanitarian permanent residence pathway for up to 11,000 Colombian, Haitian, and Venezuelan nationals with family ties in Canada. Despite this higher volume overall permanent resident admissions remained within the planned range.

In 2023, a total of 14,355 individuals were admitted to Canada under the Humanitarian and Compassionate and Other category, representing a 34.8% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Refugees and Protected Persons

In 2024, a total of 76,685 refugees and protected persons were admitted as permanent residents. Of these, 36,440 identified as women, 40,230 as men, and 15 as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 74,979 refugees and protected persons were admitted as permanent residents, reflecting a 2.3% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Resettled Refugees

Each year, IRCC facilitates the admission of a targeted number of permanent residents under the refugee resettlement category. The Department provides protection to Convention Refugees, individuals who are outside of their home country and unable to return due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion and to those who are in need of resettlement as a result of being seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights.

Additionally, the Department funds service providers to offer tailored resettlement assistance to Government-Assisted Refugees and other eligible individuals in order to meet their immediate and essential needs upon arrival in Canada. This includes the provision of temporary housing, supports to help secure permanent housing, immediate and essential orientation, as well as providing links and referrals to other services and programs. Through the National Call for Proposals 2024 process, IRCC will continue to support eligible clients through the Resettlement Assistance Program.

The Resettlement Program also continues to deliver a number of distinct pathways and programs for vulnerable people, including religious and ethnic minorities, LGBTQI+ individuals, human rights defenders, as well as women and children in precarious situations.

In 2024, a total of 49,285 resettled refugees were admitted as permanent residents. Of these, 22,915 identified as women 26,370 as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender.

Of the total number of resettled refuges admitted:

19,485 were Government-Assisted Refugees

29,715 were Privately Sponsored Refugees

85 were admitted through the Blended Visa Office-Referred (BVOR) program, which allows sponsorship groups and government to jointly support resettled refugees identified by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR)

In 2023, a total of 51,081 resettled refugees were admitted as permanent residents, representing a 3.5% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Protected Persons in-Canada

Protected Persons in-Canada (PPIC) may apply for permanent residence and may include their dependents, whether in Canada or abroad. PPIC includes Convention refugees, individuals recognized by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) as persons in need of protection, individuals with positive pre-removal risk assessments, and protected temporary residents.

In 2024, a total of 27,400 individuals obtained permanent residence under the PPIC category. Of these, 13,525 identified as women, 13,865 as men, and a small proportion as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 23,898 individuals obtained permanent residence under this category, representing a 14.7% increase from 2023 to 2024.

Asylum Claims

The In-Canada Asylum System is responsible for receiving and registering asylum claims made within Canada, assessing eligibility for referral to the IRB, conducting security screenings, providing protection to those deemed in need at or within Canada’s borders, and removing individuals who do not qualify for Canada’s protection.

In 2024, Canada received 171,840 asylum claims at various ports of entry and inland offices.

Francophone Immigration Outside Quebec

In 2024, IRCC advanced several key initiatives, including the Francophone Minority Communities Student Pilot, the Francophone Community Immigration Pilot, and the expansion of the Welcoming Francophone Communities Initiative to 10 additional communities across Canada.

Through its Francophone Immigration Support Program, IRCC also funded nine projects totalling approximately $8,9M. This program engages Francophone communities by funding innovative approaches to address barriers and increase the recruitment, selection and retention of Francophone immigrants.

Admissions Targets for French-Speaking Permanent Residents Outside Quebec

In 2024, IRCC launched its Policy on Francophone Immigration, providing long-term strategic direction to support the vitality and economic development of Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. IRCC surpassed its 6% of overall admissions target for French-speaking permanent resident admissions outside Quebec, reaching 7.2% in 2024. In total, 30,550 French-speaking permanent residents were admitted to Canada outside of Quebec in 2024.

Categories of French-Speaking Permanent Residents Outside Quebec Admitted

In 2024, French-speaking permanent residents outside Quebec were admitted through all major immigration categories, with the majority entering via the Economic class.

Economic Class: 25,195

Sponsored by family: 1,680

Temporary Resident Programs and Volumes

A temporary resident is a foreign national who is legally authorized to enter Canada for a limited period. Temporary resident status is granted when an individual meets the legislative requirements to enter or remain in Canada as a visitor, student, worker, or holder of a temporary resident permit.

A total of 1.6 million temporary residents were issued permits in 2024; including study permits, work permits,Footnote 26 and temporary resident permits. Of these, approximately 687,000 were new arrivals to Canada as work or study permit holders.Footnote 27 Over the course of the year, 3 million individuals held valid permits to enter or remain in Canada as temporary residents. This figure includes those whose permits became effective in 2024, whether they were initial permits or renewals, as well as foreign nationals that were in Canada with valid status throughout the year. This figure accounts for the fact that individuals may hold more than one type of permit in a year.Footnote 28

International students

IRCC facilitates the entry of students who wish to study at a designated Canadian educational institution. Students approved to study in Canada are issued a study permit.

In 2024, 516,275 individuals held study permits in Canada. This included new permits and extensions. Of these, 242,970 identified as women, 273,235 as men, 55 as another gender and the gender of 10 individuals was recorded as unspecified. An intake cap on study permit applications was introduced in January 2024 to help manage unsustainable growth in the program, with an issuance target set at 485,000 for that year. Of the 516,275 study permit holders, only 293,835 were issued to new students entering Canada in 2024, with the balance being issued to students already in Canada. This means that there were less than 360,000 new study permit holders who entered Canada in 2024.

In 2023, a total of 682,889 individuals held study permits, of which 496,175 were new. This indicates a decrease of 24% from 2023 to 2024. Canada’s overall international student population declined by 4% at year end of 2024 compared to end of 2023.

Student to Permanent Resident Transition

In 2024, 25,580 study permit holders were granted permanent residency compared to 25,605 study permit holders in 2023, which is a decrease of 0.1% from 2023 to 2024.Footnote 29 Of these, 13,045 identified as women, 12,525 as men, and the remainder identified as another gender.

Temporary Foreign Workers

Foreign nationals seeking to undertake temporary work in Canada may be authorized to work without a permit, or receive a work permit under one of Canada’s work permit programs under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.

Through its management of the International Mobility Program (IMP) and its joint administration of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) with Employment and Social Development Canada, IRCC supports the effective and responsible entry of temporary foreign workers into the Canadian labour market when a work permit is required. The TFWP requires a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to hire a temporary worker, in order to ensure that qualified Canadians or permanent residents are not available, whereas the IMP allows employers to hire a temporary worker without an LMIA, based on the broader economic, cultural, or other competitive advantages for Canada and reciprocal benefits enjoyed by Canadians and permanent residents.

In 2024, a total of 905,440Footnote 30 individuals began working in Canada on new work permits, down from 946,259 in 2023, representing a 4.3% decrease.

This total includes work permits under both the TFW and the IMP.

In 2024, there were 191,630 individuals with new work permits under the TFWP. Of these, 41,060 identified as women, 150,565 as men, and a small number either identified as another gender or had their gender recorded as unspecified.

In the same year, there were 717,405 individuals with new work permits under the IMP. Of these, 344,470 identified as women, 372,845 as men, 50 as another gender, and the gender of 35 individuals was recorded as unspecified.

Together, the TFWP and IMP figures account for the entire population of work permit holders whose permits became effective in 2024.

The Department administers the Open Work Permit for Vulnerable Workers (OWP-V), which provides temporary foreign workers on valid employer-specific work permits access to an open work permit, if they are experiencing, or are at risk of experiencing, abuse in their job.

Temporary to Permanent Resident Transition

In 2024, the Department granted permanent residency to 160,100 individuals holding temporary work permits. Of these, 74,170 identified as women, 85,925 as men, and the remainder identified as another gender.

In 2023, a total of 156,580 temporary work permit holders were granted permanent residency, which indicates an 2.3% decrease from 2023 to 2024.

Visitors

IRCC facilitates the entry of visitors who wish to stay in Canada temporarily, while safeguarding the health, safety and security of Canadians.Footnote 31 Depending on factors such as the visitor’s nationality, travel document, and method of travel, they may require a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to enter Canada. IRCC processes TRVs and eTAs for visitors such as tourists, those seeking to visit family, and business travellers. Visitors provide economic benefits to Canada and Canadians, including through direct economic revenue, but also by supporting Canadian businesses and Canadian jobs in cities across the country. Business visits to Canada by foreign nationals also contribute to growth in trade and investment opportunities.

In 2024, a total of 5,031,925 TRVs and eTAs were approved. Of these 2,522,730 individuals identified as women, 2,509,080 as men, 110 as another gender, and a small proportion had their gender recorded as unspecified.

In 2023, a total of 5,491,145 holders of TRV and eTA were approved, representing a 8.4% decrease in approvals from 2023 to 2024.

Temporary Resident Permits

Under subsection 24(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) may be issued to a foreign national who is inadmissible to Canada or otherwise does not meet the requirements of the Act. An officer may issue a TRP if the foreign national’s need to enter or remain in Canada temporarily is justified in the circumstances. These permits are issued for a limited duration and may be cancelled at any time. In 2024, a total of 6,740 TRPs were issued. Further information on entering Canada with a TRP in cases of inadmissibility is available on IRCC’s website.

The following table presents the number of TRPs issued in 2024, categorized by grounds of inadmissibility as defined under IRPA.

Source: IRCC, Consolidated Business Reporting as of April 24, 2025.

TRPs for Victims of Human Trafficking

As a protection measure, TRPs may be issued to out-of-status foreign nationals in Canada who are identified as victims of human trafficking. These permits provide temporary resident status and make recipients eligible for a work permit. In addition, permit holders have access to healthcare services through the Interim Federal Health Program.

In 2024, a total of 130 TRPs were issued to victims of human trafficking and their dependants. This figure is included in the overall number of TRPs reported in Table 4.

TRPs for Victims of Family Violence

Since 2019, out-of-status foreign nationals who are experiencing family violence from a spouse or common-law partner have been eligible to apply for a fee-exempt TRP. This measure is intended for individuals whose application for permanent residence depends on remaining in a genuine relationship that has become abusive. The TRP grants temporary legal status in Canada, enabling individuals to apply for an open work permit or study permit, and to safely leave an abusive relationship without risking their immigration status.

In 2024, a total of 285 TRPs were approved for victims of family violence and their dependents. These cases are processed separately from TRPs and are not included in the totals shown in Table 4.

Public Policy Exemptions for a Temporary Purpose

In 2024, a total of 95 applications for temporary residence received exemptions under the public policy that exempts certain foreign nationals from inadmissibility provisions for a temporary purpose. This public policy enables eligible individuals to enter Canada as visitors, students, or workers, despite otherwise being inadmissible under standard immigration criteria.

These cases are processed separately from TRPs and are not included in the totals shown in Table 4.

Use of the Negative Discretion Authority

Pursuant to section 22.1(4) of IRPA the Annual Report includes the number of declarations made by the Minister that a foreign national (other than a foreign national referred to in section 19) may not become a temporary resident. Making this declaration is referred to as the use of negative discretion authority. Negative discretion authority is used when the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations. Alongside the number of declarations made this report also includes the public policy considerations that led to the making of the declarations.

In 2024, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship did not use the negative discretion authority under subsection 22.1(1) of IRPA.

Settlement Program

IRCC’s Settlement Program funds services to help newcomers integrate into the Canadian labour market and society, and build a successful life in Canada. In the context of the Settlement Program, a newcomer refers to an individual who is in an initial period of adaptation and settlement in Canada. Settlement services are available only to those who are permanent residents (including protected persons and resettled refugees). The department continues to provide settlement services to certain temporary residents who are on a clear pathway to permanent residence or arriving under a departmental response to an international crisis.

In 2024, a total of 694,640 unique clients received settlement services. Among the 98% of clients for whom gender data was available, 385,260 identified as women (55%), 309,320 as men (45%), and 62 as another gender. Over the same period, the percentage of French-speaking newcomers served by Francophone service providers continued to rise: 69% in 2024, compared with 63% in 2023.

The National Call for Proposals (CFP) 2024 process prioritized high-quality service continuity for the most vulnerable newcomers through IRCC’s Settlement and Resettlement programs, and also reinforced the Department’s dedication to advancing anti-racism, Truth & Reconciliation, gender equality, and equity priorities by embedding Gender-based analysis Plus (GBA Plus) and equity considerations into funding and programming.

In 2024, the Settlement Program Website was updated to create a one-stop-shop where newcomers and Canadians can find information about Settlement and Resettlement Programs, including insights from the Department’s most recent data and reports. Updates were also made to the Find Free Newcomer Services Near You page which allows newcomers to search for services based on their location and the type of service(s) they are seeking.

GBA Plus Considerations in Immigration

The Department’s ongoing Anti-Racism and GBA Plus efforts aim to ensure that gender, diversity, and a broad range of identity factors are considered in the development and implementation of policies and programs.

Analysis of gender and diversity dataFootnote 34 highlight both areas of progress and ongoing variances in representation across several programs within the Temporary and Permanent Resident streams. Variations in admissions data and social outcomes may be associated with identity-related factors such as gender, country of citizenship, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability, and others.

GBA Plus Considerations for Permanent Resident Programs

Overall PR admissions in 2024 included 49.4% individuals identifying as men, 50.7% as women and less than 1% as another gender. Some programs show greater variation in gender representation than others. Gender representation differs across programs due to a number of complex factors. For the four immigration categories the gender breakdown for program admissions in 2024 is as follows:

Federal EconomicFootnote 35: 47.6% identified as women, and 52.4% identified as men, including a small proportion that identified as another gender

Sponsored FamilyFootnote 36: 60.5% identified as women, and 39.4% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Refugee and Protected Persons in-Canada: 47.5% identified as women, and 52.5% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Humanitarian and Other: 52.7% identified as women, and 47.3% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Table 5: Top 5 Source Countries of Citizenship for Permanent Resident Programs

GBA Plus Considerations for Temporary Resident Programs

In 2024, gender representation within the TR stream varies. Overall:

Study Permits: 47.1% identified as women, 52.9% identified as men and a small proportion identified as another gender

Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) Program: 21.4% identified as women, 78.6% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

International Mobility Program (IMP): 48% identified as women, 52% identified as men, and a small proportion identified as another gender

Visitors: 50.1% identified as women, 49.9% identified as men and a small proportion identified as another gender

Across all Temporary Resident (TR) programs, the top five source countries consistently account for approximately 60% or more of total admissions (see table for details).

Table 6: Top 5 Source Countries of Citizenship for Temporary Resident Programs

Advancing Equity in Canada’s Immigration System

In 2024, IRCC reviewed its Anti-Racism Strategy 2.0 (2021–2024) and assessed departmental progress to inform the development of its next Equity Strategy for 2025–2028.

To support more inclusive and consistent decision-making, IRCC has developed several tools and frameworks, including the Institutional Bias and Racism Identification Method, and the Renewed Risk Management Framework. These initiatives aim to strengthen the department’s capacity to identify and mitigate potential sources of bias in program delivery and risk assessment.

Monitoring and Evaluating Equity

IRCC has implemented programs to assess the outcomes of its services and policies across diverse client groups. This includes the use of disaggregated data by gender, age, country of origin. The new IRCC Data Strategy (2023–2026) builds on existing commitments to responsible data management by further strengthening the use of reliable sources and strong privacy safeguards. Improvements in data usage and governance enables faster, more accurate insights that support equitable outcomes across programs.

IRCC also applies GBA Plus in its Algorithm Impact Assessments (AIAs), to ensure that advanced analytics, automation, and AI are implemented in a manner consistent with equity principles. As of December 2024, 21 AIAs have been completed, with 12 published and nine under internal review, contributing to service improvements and more accessible digital platforms for a broad range of clients.

Ministerial Instructions

Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) includes various provisions that allow the Minister to issue instructions to immigration officers, to enable the Government of Canada to best achieve its immigration goals. These instructions are typically issued for limited periods of time and can touch upon a diverse range of issues.

The table below provides a description and publication date of the 2024 Ministerial Instructions issued under paragraphs 24(3) and 10.3(1)(h.2) and section 87.3 of IRPA, as well as section 14.1 and subsections 30(1.2), 30(1.41), and 30(1.43), where applicable.

Table 7: Ministerial Instructions – 2024 Summary

Annex: Canada’s 2026–2028 Levels Plan

Throughout Canada’s history, we have welcomed people from around the world—those fleeing persecution, war and strife, those seeking to work hard and build a better life for their families, those seeking to study at our world-class universities, experts wanting to drive innovation in Canada. The fabric of our nation is woven with this tradition.

As we have welcomed the world, we had the promise that if someone came to Canada they would contribute to our prosperity, and in return they would get all Canada offered—a country that is generous, fair, and diverse.

Our immigration system was built to standardise and evaluate newcomers so that admission was based on a person’s merits. Over time, this system has evolved—its complexity has grown and its efficiency has waned. In recent years, the system became even harder to manage and less functional, and the pace of arrivals began to exceed Canada’s capacity to absorb and support newcomers in the way we are used to doing.

In 2018, 3.3 per cent of Canada’s population were temporary residents. By 2024, that number had more than doubled to 7.5 per cent, an unprecedented rate of growth that put pressure on housing supply, the healthcare system, and schools. Canada’s new government recognises that this system is no longer sustainable, and we are determined to make it so, for everyone who lives in and comes to this country.

We are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels—allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home. At the same time, Canada will continue its long tradition of welcoming those fleeing violence, persecution and displacement.

The results of the government’s focus are already becoming apparent. Asylum claims are down by a third, and new temporary foreign worker arrivals are down by approximately 50 per cent this year. New international student arrivals have also declined by approximately 60 per cent compared to 2024. This is a start, but we recognise there is more work to do.

Budget 2025 announces that the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will stabilise permanent resident admission targets at 380,000 per year for three years, down from 395,000 in 2025, while increasing the share of economic migrants from 59 per cent to 64 per cent. The new plan will also reduce the target for new temporary resident admissions from 673,650 in 2025 to 385,000 in 2026, and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. The fiscal cost of this measure is $168.2 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, and $35.7 million ongoing. These costs primarily represent the net loss in fee revenue, driven by fewer temporary resident admissions.

The government recognises the role temporary foreign workers play in some sectors of the economy and in some parts of the country. To that end, the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will consider industries and sectors impacted by tariffs and the unique needs of rural and remote communities.

In addition, Budget 2025 proposes a one-time initiative to recognise eligible Protected Persons in Canada as permanent residents over the next two years. This practical step is a reflection of the fact that the vast majority of these people cannot return to the country of their origin. It will also ensure that those in genuine need of Canada’s protection have their permanent status recognized, accelerating their full integration into the Canadian society and their path to citizenship. The fiscal cost of this measure is $120.4 million over four years, starting in 2026-27. This represents the costs for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency to process the additional applications, which are partially offset by higher fee revenues.

Budget 2025 also proposes to undertake a one-time measure to accelerate the transition of up to 33,000 work permit holders to permanent residency in 2026 and 2027. These workers have established strong roots in their communities, are paying taxes, and are helping to build the strong economy Canada needs. The fiscal cost of this measure is $19.4 million over four years, starting in 2026-27. This also represents the costs for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and other departments to process the additional applications, which are partially offset by higher fee revenues.

These targets keep permanent resident arrivals at less than one per cent of the population beyond 2027 and will reduce the total number of temporary residents to less than five per cent of Canada’s population by the end of 2027.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Additional details on the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will be provided when the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship tables the 2025 Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration.

Earlier this year, YouTube shut down the official account of the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association.","A documentary featuring mothers surviving Israel’s genocide in Gaza. A video investigation uncovering Israel’s role in the killing of a Palestinian American journalist. Another video revealing Israel’s destruction of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank.

YouTube surreptitiously deleted all these videos in early October by wiping the accounts that posted them from its website, along with their channels’ archives. The accounts belonged to three prominent Palestinian human rights groups: Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights.

The move came in response to a U.S. government campaign to stifle accountability for alleged Israeli war crimes against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.

The Palestinian groups’ YouTube channels hosted hours of footage documenting and highlighting alleged Israeli government violations of international law in both Gaza and the West Bank, including the killing of Palestinian civilians.

“I’m pretty shocked that YouTube is showing such a little backbone,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now. “It’s really hard to imagine any serious argument that sharing information from these Palestinian human rights organizations would somehow violate sanctions. Succumbing to this arbitrary designation of these Palestinian organizations, to now censor them, is disappointing and pretty surprising.”

After the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants and charged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Israeli Defense Secretary Yoav Gallant with war crimes in Gaza, the Trump administration escalated its defense of Israel’s actions by sanctioning ICC officials and targeting people and organizations that work with the court.

“YouTube is furthering the Trump administration’s agenda to remove evidence of human rights violations and war crimes.”

“It is outrageous that YouTube is furthering the Trump administration’s agenda to remove evidence of human rights violations and war crimes from public view,” said Katherine Gallagher, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. “Congress did not intend to allow the president to cut off the flow of information to the American public and the world — instead, information, including documents and videos, are specifically exempted under the statute that the president cited as his authority for issuing the ICC sanctions.”

“Alarming Setback”

YouTube, which is owned by Google, confirmed to The Intercept that it deleted the groups’ accounts as a direct result of State Department sanctions against the group after a review. The Trump administration leveled the sanctions against the organizations in September over their work with the International Criminal Court in cases charging Israeli officials of war crimes.

“Google is committed to compliance with applicable sanctions and trade compliance laws,” YouTube spokesperson Boot Bullwinkle said in a statement.

According to Google’s Sanctions Compliance publisher policy, “Google publisher products are not eligible for any entities or individuals that are restricted under applicable trade sanctions and export compliance laws.”

Al Mezan, a human rights organization in Gaza, told The Intercept that its YouTube channel was abruptly terminated this year on October 7 without prior notification.

“Terminating the channel deprives us from reaching what we aspire to convey our message to, and fulfill our mission,” a spokesperson for the group said, “and prevents us from achieving our goals and limits our ability to reach the audience we aspire to share our message with.”

The West Bank-based Al-Haq’s channel was deleted on October 3, a spokesperson for the group said, with a message from YouTube that its “content violates our guidelines.”

“YouTube’s removal of a human rights organisation’s platform, carried out without prior warning, represents a serious failure of principle and an alarming setback for human rights and freedom of expression,” the Al-Haq spokesperson said in a statement. “The U.S. Sanctions are being used to cripple accountability work on Palestine and silence Palestinian voices and victims, and this has a ripple effect on such platforms also acting under such measures to further silence Palestinian voices.”

The Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which the U.N. describes as the oldest human rights organization in Gaza, said in a statement that YouTube’s move “protects perpetrators from accountability.”

“YouTube’s decision to close PCHR’s account is basically one of many consequences that we as an organisation have faced since the decision of the US government to sanction our organisations for our legitimate work,” said Basel al-Sourani, an international advocacy officer and legal advisor for the group. “YouTube said that we were not following their policy on Community Guidelines, when all our work was basically presenting factual and evidence-based reporting on the crimes committed against the Palestinian people especially since the start of the ongoing genocide on 7 October.”

“By doing this, YouTube is being complicit in silencing the voices of Palestinian victims,” al-Sourani added.

Looking Outside the U.S.

The three human rights groups’ account terminations cumulatively amount to the erasure of more than 700 videos, according to an Intercept tally.

The deleted videos range in scope from investigations, such as an analysis of the Israeli killing of American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, to testimonies of Palestinians tortured by Israeli forces and documentaries like “The Beach,” about children playing on a beach who were killed by an Israeli strike.

Some videos are still available through copies saved on the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine or on alternate platforms, such as Facebook and Vimeo. The wiping only affected the group’s official channels; videos which were produced by the nonprofits but hosted on alternate YouTube channels remain active. No cumulative index of videos deleted by YouTube is available, however, and many appear to not be available elsewhere online.

Videos posted elsewhere online, the groups fear, could soon be targeted for deletion because many of the platforms hosting them are also U.S.-based services. The ICC itself began exploring using service providers outside the U.S.

Al-Haq said it would also be looking for alternatives outside of U.S. companies to host their work.

YouTube isn’t the only U.S. tech company blocking Palestinian rights groups from using its services. The Al-Haq spokesperson said Mailchimp, the mailing list service, also deleted the group’s account in September. (Mailchimp and its parent company, Intuit, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

Caving to Trump’s Demand

Both the U.S. and Israeli governments have long shielded themselves from the ICC and accountability for their alleged war crimes. Neither country is party to the Rome Statute, the international treaty that established the court.

In November 2024, the ICC prosecutors issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, charging the leaders with intentionally starving civilians by blocking aid from entering into Gaza. Both the Biden and Trump administrations rejected the legitimacy of the warrants.

Since his reelection, Trump has taken a more aggressive posture against accountability for Israel. In the early days of his second term, Trump renewed sanctions against the ICC and issued new, more severe measures against court officials and anyone accused of aiding their efforts. In September, in a new order, he specifically sanctioned the three Palestinian groups.

The U.S. moves followed Israel’s own designation of Al-Haq as a “terrorist organization” in 2021 and an online smear campaign by pro-Israeli activists attempting to link Palestinian Centre for Human Rights with militant groups.

The sanctions freeze the organizations’ assets in the U.S. and bar sanctioned individuals from traveling to the country. Federal judges have already issued preliminary injunctions in two cases in favor of plaintiffs who argued the sanctions had violated their First Amendment rights.

“The Trump administration is focused on contributing to the censorship of information about Israeli atrocities in Palestine and the sanctions against these organizations is very deliberately designed to make association with these organizations frightening to Americans who will be concerned about material support laws,” said Whitson, of DAWN, which joined a coalition of groups in September to demand the Trump administration drop its sanctions.

Like many tech firms, YouTube has shown a ready willingness to comply with demands from both the Trump administration and Israel. YouTube coordinated with a campaign organized by Israeli tech workers to remove social media content deemed critical of Israel. At home, Google, YouTube’s parent company, secretly handed over personal Gmail account information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an effort to detain a pro-Palestinian student organizer.

Even before Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza, YouTube had been accused of unevenly applying its community guidelines to censor Palestinian voices while withholding similar scrutiny from pro-Israeli content. Such trends continued during the war, according to a Wired report.

Earlier this year, YouTube shut down the official account of the Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association. The move came after pressure from UK Lawyers for Israel, which wrote to YouTube to point out that the organization had been sanctioned by the State Department.

Whitson warned that YouTube’s capitulation could set a precedent, pushing other tech companies to bend to censorship.

“They are basically allowing the Trump administration to dictate what information they share with the global audience,” she said. “It’s not going to end with Palestine.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/YouTube-deletes-Pal-accounts.jpg?fit=2000%2C1000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-04 21:17:01.124264

Hobbs accused of ordering state police to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities

Governor’s Office claims no records exist to support Judicial Watch’s allegations

Issue brings up question of state and federal cooperation on immigration

Judicial Watch is suing Gov. Katie Hobbs, accusing her of ordering state police and National Guard to not cooperate with federal immigration authorities and then hiding that fact.

The national organization, which is known for filing public records lawsuits, contends that statements the governor made shortly after President Trump was elected in 2024 are tantamount to declaring she won’t use state resources to enforce his order for mass deportations. And that, the lawsuit says, runs afoul of a state law that bars public officials from restricting the enforcement of federal immigration laws, a position buttressed by a press release statement from Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch.

“Gov. Hobbs’ apparent refusal to allow state resources to support lawful immigration operations undermines the rule of law and places law enforcement and other innocent lives at risk,” he wrote.

The lawsuit, however, has no actual evidence that Hobbs issued any such order.

Instead, Judicial Watch is relying on a statement that the governor made to ABC News about a week after the 2024 election. And he is telling Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Frank Moskowitz that he should order her to produce any and all documents about her “official non-participation” in deportation activities.

That interview took place at the border where Hobbs had gone to publicize her own deployment of National Guard soldiers to help Customs and Border Protection. Those, she said, are the things she will do “that are most helpful in securing our border.”

“What I will unequivocally say is that as governor I will not tolerate efforts that are part of misguided policies that harm our communities, that threaten our communities, that terrorize our communities,” Hobbs said. “And Arizona will not take part in those.”

The governor also predicted at the time it would lead to “people hiding in fear,” similar to what happened when the Republican-controlled Legislature adopted SB 1070 in 2010, which was designed at least in part to require police to ask people they stop about their immigration status.

“It harmed communities, it tore families apart,” Hobbs said. “That’s not going to happen on my watch.”

The governor made similar comments days earlier at a press conference in Phoenix, saying she will “stand up against actions that hurt our communities.” But she dodged a question at that time of whether she would use her powers to prevent the wholesale deporting of those who entered the country illegally.

All that, Judicial Watch said in its news release about the lawsuit, is sufficient to question whether she ordered those two agencies to withhold cooperation from federal immigration authorities.

Gubernatorial press aide Christian Slater called the action “a shameless, politically motivated lawsuit by a far-right activist group.”

“The governor believes law enforcement should follow all applicable state laws around coordination with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” he said. “But state law enforcement will not participate in activities that harm our communities such as ICE going into churches, schools, hospitals, or going after people who have been here for decades, who follow the law, who otherwise follow the rules.”

Slater also said the governor’s office is unaware of any actual request by federal officials to actually coordinate with their deportation efforts, meaning there has never been an order from Hobbs to agencies telling them not to cooperate in those activities. The only direction Hobbs has given state agencies, he said, is to follow state laws.

The records request, sent Dec. 17, 2024, demands any documents about orders, directives or even suggestions to DPS that reflect “your official non-participation position” as reported.

It also seeks documents that reflect policies that would violate a state law stating that no official or agency of state or local government “may limit or restrict the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law.”

That statute actually was part of SB 1070. While much of that law was voided by the U.S. Supreme Court, that section was never challenged and remains on the books.

Michael Bekesa, a senior attorney for Judicial Watch, told Capitol Media Services that he finally got a response of sorts from the governor’s office within hours of the lawsuit being filed last week.

“They sent us a letter that said, ‘We did a search, we have no records that are responsive to your request, but here’s seven pages of records that you may find interesting but aren’t responsive,”’ he said. And that, Bekesa said, took nine months.

But why does he believe there actually are some records directing agencies not to cooperate?

“She told the media they were going to not help with the federal government’s enforcement of immigration laws,” Bekesa responded. “How can the governor say they won’t do something without ordering her people not to do it?”

He conceded, though it “is possible” that Hobbs never received a request from the federal government to have DPS and National Guard actually enforce immigration laws. And that would mean there would be no directive to either agency to refuse — and no documents to produce.

“All we’re wondering is if she’s taken any proactive steps,” Bekesa said. “We think it’s a fair question.”

And then there was the nine-month delay.

“The burden is on the governor’s office to prove that they conducted an adequate search and then let us know that,” he said. “If they want to provide us a declaration, something under oath that says, ‘This is the search we did, we have no records,’ then, yes, we’d be reasonable and the case would be over.”

That, said Slater, is the case.

“There are no responsive records because the governor’s office has directed DPS to follow the law,” he said, repeating that Hobbs never issued any order that refused to work with ICE on deportations.

But there is a policy of sorts.

“Unless a state crime has been committed that falls under the jurisdiction of DPS, our personnel … do not conduct direct immigration enforcement,” Jeffrey Glover, director of the agency, said in June. He said if a state crime is committed and someone’s immigration status “becomes relevant,” officers may notify federal agencies “in accordance with existing laws and protocols.”

Judicial Watch bills itself as a “conservative, non-partisan educational foundation” that uses public records requests to investigate misconduct by government officials and files lawsuits “to hold to account politicians and public officials who engage in corrupt activities.”

Its recent lawsuits include one seeking records from the Department of Justice about decisions under the Biden administration to charge more people in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, another seeking records from federal agencies for spying on a Trump adviser, and documents related to the FBI investigation of Trump when he was a presidential candidate.

But it also has sued the CIA for records on what role convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein played with that agency.

What we know:

Two East Bay members of congress said there is increased ICE activity in their districts and that will impact some people's ability to participate in the essence of democracy.

""Nobody asked for this. We were promised they'd target the most violent, undocumented immigrants in our community,"" an angry Rep. Eric Swawell, (D) CA-14, said Monday afternoon in front of the Dublin Civic Center.

What has followed, according to Swalwell, is chaos. He said federal agents are terrorizing communities across California and the Bay in a stated administration goal of removing undocumented migrants.

""As bad as it looks, it's worse when you get up close to it,"" said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, (D) CA-10. ""This is the most corrupt administration, certainly in our lifetimes, and maybe in history.""

He joined his congressional colleague at the small news conference to deliver a fiery-tongued lashing of President Donald Trump. Both men hit familiar themes that the American democracy — due to the use of federal agents and National Guard troops in multiple cities — has lost its way.

What they're saying:

""I don't trust the feds in their ability to abide by our immigrant neighbors,"" said Dan Morley of the non-profit watchdog group, Indivisible Project.

He feared the shuttered federal prison in Dublin could see new life as a detention center for ICE.

The director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons has previously said this site, shuttered in 2024 due to a prison sex scandal, won't be reopened or used as an ICE detention facility. But in contentious political times, straight answers can be viewed as misdirection of the masses.

""We know if that immigration (detainment) center gets open,"" said Morely. ""If they have a facility, they will fill it. And they will fill it by racially profiling our neighbors.""

What's next:

Watchdog groups promise protests and civil disobedience if either site is reopened.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who've spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

“We’re what I call now sanctuary busters,” he said. “There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.”

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He's regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face.

“We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.”

Immigration agents' tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration's use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.”

“I think (the raids) haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that's had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

“A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.”

Bovino said he hasn't seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents' accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino’s presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker “wildly misinformed” while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor's appearance.

In response, Pritzker's office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino's “publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.”

Bovino wouldn't say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

“We’re going to be in Chicago a good while,” he said. “But you just never know.”

The government is accused of denying detainees proper access to food, water and medical care and coercing them to sign documents they don’t understand. Without that knowledge, and without private communication with lawyers, they have unknowingly relinquished their rights and faced deportation, the lawsuit alleges.

“This is not an issue of not getting a toilet or a Fiji water bottle,” attorney Alexa Van Brunt of the MacArthur Justice Center told the judge. “These are a set of dire conditions that when taken together paint a harrowing picture.”

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman presided at the hearing just days after Van Brunt’s group and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois filed the lawsuit and sought a temporary restraining order. The judge said the allegations are “disgusting.”

“To have to sleep on a floor next to an overflowing toilet — that’s obviously unconstitutional,” Gettleman said.

Attorney Jana Brady of the Justice Department acknowledged there are no beds at the Broadview building, just outside Chicago, because it was not intended to be a long-term detention site.

Authorities have “improved the operations” over the past few months, she said, adding there has been a “learning curve.”

“The conditions are not sufficiently serious,” Brady told the judge.

The lead plaintiffs in the case, Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona, were in the courtroom Tuesday at the judge’s insistence. The Mexican immigrants, who’ve lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years, had been held at Broadview until Friday but remain in government custody.

Testifying with the help of a translator, Moreno Gonzalez, 56, said he was arrested last week while waiting to start work. He said he was placed in a cell with 150 other people, with no beds, blankets, toothbrush or toothpaste.

“It was just really bad. … It was just too much,” Moreno Gonzalez, crying, told the judge.

For months advocates have raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, leading to the arrests of numerous protesters. The demonstrations are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/11/2025-11-02T021214Z_1948632989_RC20OHA3KZP8_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 20:56:53.813271

Guevara added that she got sick when she was at the Broadview facility.","U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman will issue a temporary restraining order against the Department of Homeland Security regarding the Broadview ICE facility after a lawsuit was filed over conditions inside.

At the end of a nearly six-hour hearing Tuesday, Judge Gettleman said he believed a group of plaintiffs, including multiple people who have been detained at the facility, have made a sufficient case to justify some sort of court order, but that he wanted ""to be able to fashion that in the most appropriate way I can."" Gettleman said he will formally issue the temporary restraining order, and go over what exactly it entails, at 4:15 p.m. Wednesday. Before that, he wants to see photos and videos from inside the facility.

The plaintiffs who brought the class-action lawsuit said they feel conditions at the facility on Beach Street in Broadview are overcrowded and dirty and not fit for humans. The facility is designed to hold detainees for up to 12 hours, but since the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the Chicago area began, often has held some migrants for days.

Gettleman said the Broadview facility has essentially become a prison. While he hasn't revealed what types of restrictions he plans to include in his order, he could go so far as to order it closed.

One of the major issues attorneys focused on during the lengthy hearing was the lack of access to legal representation for immigrants detained in Broadview. Attorneys for detainees said that issue could be fixed almost immediately with a court order, since people held there were able to contact and visit with their attorneys before ""Operation Midway Blitz"" began in September.

The government has argued the Broadview facility is a temporary holding facility, which contributes to the lack of communication and in-person meetings, but plaintiffs in the lawsuit have argued people are there for days, making the ""temporary"" nature of the facility moot.

The plaintiffs called five witnesses Tuesday who had been detained in the facility. Each testified that it was overcrowded; that there wasn't adequate food, medical care, or sleeping conditions; and that they could not access showers, soap, or other hygiene items.

The plaintiffs said detainees are only given two meals a day and none of them hot. They said the facility lacks toothpaste, toothbrushes, soap, cleaning materials, and menstrual products, and that people have had to sleep on the floor or in plastic chairs with only a plastic blanket. The plaintiffs further alleged, among other things, that toilets are overflowing with human waste, and that the waste has accumulated around toilets where people had to sleep.

There were also allegations that detainees were coerced into signing documents they did not understand.

The complaint alleges federal agents at Broadview ""cut off detainees from the outside world,"" which the government has denied.

The government attorney said because detainees are supposed to be held at the Broadview facility for a short timeframe, there are not beds in the holding cells. She also said detainees do not get new clothes for the same reason, unless they soil themselves.

The attorney for the feds said the government has also ""improved"" conditions at Broadview.

An attorney for the plaintiffs responded, ""We are not talking about one person sleeping on the floor for one night,"" and said all the conditions taken together are the issue. The plaintiffs' attorney added that the federal government's wanting to deport people more quickly is not an excuse to deny constitutional rights.

Government lawyers argued that granting a temporary restraining order to close the facility would ""halt the government's ability to enforce immigration law in Illinois"" and that granting a temporary restraining order to restrict or oversee their methods

Witnesses break down as they detail conditions inside facility

Pablo Moreno Gonzalez, 25, said he was born in Mexico and has lived in the U.S. and in Chicago for 3 years. He said he works as a construction worker, and was arrested by federal agents at Foster Avenue and Pulaski Road on Wednesday, Oct. 29.

Gonzalez said he was taken to the Broadview facility, where he said he was never told he could meet with an attorney, and was given documents asking if he wanted to leave.

""I said, 'Well, I have my family here. I don't have anyone in Mexico,"" he said, ""and I don't want to leave. I don't want to go back to my country.""

Gonzalez said he was then put in a cell with what he estimated were 150 to 170 people, and no beds. He said he was sitting in a chair to sleep, and there were not enough chairs for everyone.

""When I could stand up, I would have to jump with my fee, to I would not step on the next person,"" he said as he began to sob on the stand. ""It was too much. It was too much. It was just too much.""

Gonzalez said there were toilets close to each other, and he could not drink the water from the attached sink because too many people were using it, and it was dirty. He said people received three water bottles for day and a small sandwich in the morning, and there were sandwiches and bottles everywhere in the cell.

On cross-examination, government attorneys asked Gonzalez if he was able to call home and speak to his family, which he said he was. They also asked him if he asked his family to bring him medication or to contact an attorney, and he said he did not.

Another witness, a 47-year-old man named Felipe, said he was also born in Mexico and has lived in the U.S. for 31 years. He said he works as a package delivery person for Amazon.

Felipe said he was arrested Thursday, Oct. 30, in Wheeling, Illinois, and was taken to Broadview — where he said estimated a cell contained 120 to 150 people. He said the cell was still packed when 50 people were removed.

He said the bathroom in the cell was separated by a wall, but it did not protect privacy, and he had to wake up someone who was on or near the toilet to use the bathroom.

""They never mopped. They never swept,"" Felipe said. ""They were a garbage can, but it was overflowed.""

Felipe said the detainees were given subway sandwiches, but he only ate the first one he received because he ended up getting sick with diarrhea. He added that the detainees received three 8-ounce bottles of water a day.

Felipe said he was not able to see an attorney and would have wanted to do so.

He also said he was told to sign papers, which he claimed were described to him as court papers, but which he actually saw were self-deportation papers that would bar him from returning for a certain number of years.

""My whole life is here,"" he said.

A third witness, Claudia Carolina Pereira Guevara, participated in the hearing remotely from Honduras. She said she had lived in Joliet with her brother for five years, and has two children — a 5-year-old daughter and a 9-month-old. She said her kids were at the babysitter and she was going to work when she was arrested at 5 a.m. Oct. 2 and taken to Broadview.

Guevara said she was held for four days in a large cell and one day in a personal cell. In the big cell, she said staff never cleaned — and one time, the detainees even asked for a broom to clean the cell themselves, which she never received.

Guevara said the bathroom was also dirty and the toilet was overflowing, and the detainees tried to clean it themselves. Guevara also said there were no showers, no soap or sanitizer, and no toothpaste or toothbrushes.

""They wouldn't give us anything when it comes to cleaning,"" she said, ""absolutely nothing.""

Guevara said she was sometimes given two meals and sometimes three. She said the meals were from Subway and were cold, and sometimes just had vegetables. She said detainees had to wait for meals to get water.

Guevara added that she got sick when she was at the Broadview facility. She said the day after sleeping on the floor, she couldn't feel her feet and was vomiting.

Guevara said she asked to go to the hospital, but her request was declined. She said she was taken to out of the cell in a wheelchair and was given medicine for vomiting. She said she was not told what the medicine was.

Guevera further said she was asked to sign deportation papers, which she said she could not read or understand because they were in English, and she does not speak or understand English.

She said she was told she would be held at the facility until she signed the papers, so she did so.

Guevara said she was taken to a facility in Louisiana from Broadview.

What does FMCSA’s emergency non-domiciled CDL interim final rule do?
Under the rule, an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) would no longer be enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL.
FMCSA estimated that the changes would take about 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry.
According to the groups, Rivera Lujan is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old.","A lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the D.C. Circuit says FMCSA’s interim final rule on non-domiciled CDLs isn’t an emergency and will cause “irreparable harm” to drivers.

On behalf of truck driver Jorge Rivera Lujan, the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 20 by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Then on Oct. 24, the groups filed an emergency motion that asked the court to delay the rule’s effective date until the lawsuit plays out.

Following responses from FMCSA on Oct. 31 and from the plaintiffs on Nov. 3, the court will soon decide whether or not to let the rule remain in effect.

What does FMCSA’s emergency non-domiciled CDL interim final rule do?

The rule, which was announced by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in late September, significantly limits the authority of state driver’s license agencies to issue and renew non-domiciled CDLs for individuals from foreign jurisdictions.

Pointing to recent high-profile crashes and an internal audit, Duffy called it a “national emergency” and made the rule effective immediately.

Under the rule, an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) would no longer be enough to obtain a non-domiciled CDL. Additionally, asylum seekers, asylees, refugees and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients would be excluded from eligibility. The majority of current non-domiciled CDL-holders possessed an EAD. FMCSA estimated that the changes would take about 194,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders out of the trucking industry. Many of the individuals may be eligible for other employment in the United States.

While the rule is already in effect, the agency is accepting comments through Nov. 28. The agency has already received nearly 4,300 comments, with many of them coming from truck drivers who say the rule is taking away their livelihood.

FMCSA’s response to lawsuit

The agency argued that much of the danger surrounding issuing non-domiciled CDLs to foreign drivers is that there is no way to review their driving records.

“Without a verified driving record, there is a serious risk that unsafe or high-risk drivers – who may have prior violations, suspensions or a history of crashes in foreign jurisdictions – could be granted non-domiciled CDLs and operate large trucks and buses on U.S. roadways,” attorneys for FMCSA wrote in the Oct. 31 response brief. “Thus, limiting the eligibility of classes of potential applicants whose driving history cannot be ascertained will increase safety by appreciably reducing the number of non-domiciled CDL drivers with unknown driver safety records on the nation’s highways.”

Instead of arguing that there is a direct link between immigration status and a driver’s ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle, FMCSA argues that it is reasonable for them to determine that “credentialing individuals whose driving history is largely or entirely unknown does not provide an appropriate margin of safety.”

Plaintiffs’ arguments

Rivera Lujan has been a truck driver for 11 years.

According to the groups, Rivera Lujan is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old. He said he tried to renew his CDL on Sept. 30 but was told he could not do so because of the interim final rule.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” Rivera Lujan said in a news release. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government.”

During its reply to the court on Nov. 3, the plaintiffs said that FMCSA did not justify its decision to make the rule effective before going through a typical rulemaking process.

“FMCSA does not meaningfully contest that the factual evidence it cited does not demonstrate an emergency,” the plaintiffs wrote. “And FMCSA has expressly disclaimed ‘a direct link between immigration status and a driver’s ability to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle.’”

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security posted twocontracts at the end of October requesting proposals for “administrative office space in support of law enforcement operations” in Baltimore and Hyattsville, Md. The Baltimore facility will be between 11,500 and 18,500 square feet, while the Hyattsville space will range between 3,750 and 5,000 square feet.

“ICE is definitely on the footprint of those contracts, and it is a fair amount of space,” said Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey, who specializes in federal employment. “I was kind of doing some back of the napkin calculations [for the Baltimore location]. That's anywhere from 60 to 100 special agents. That's a lot of space.”

The proposals follow the pattern of previous contract solicitations posted by the General Services Administration, the government agency in charge of procuring office space for the government.

In September, the GSA's Public Buildings Service posted a solicitation for ""as-is, fully-finished and furnished office space in support of administrative operations for law enforcement"" in 19 cities across the country. The listing estimates each lease would include workstations for 70 people and notes the ""unique"" quick period of one week to submit bids.

ICE previously requested that GSA identify existing federally owned or leased property that might be suitable for their use in a range of cities across the country, including Baltimore.

Hyattsville sits in the middle of Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties, which hold more than half of Maryland’s Latino and Hispanic population.

“GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration’s goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission,” Will Powell, a spokesman for GSA told WYPR when asked for comment.

ICE did not respond for comment in time for publication.

It’s not just office space that is tipping off a possible larger ICE presence.

ICE and DHS awarded a contract at the end of September to Kinro Manufacturing for more than $233,000 for six months worth of shelf stable meals.

The contract is for 42,000 meals in Baltimore and Salisbury, Maryland.

The contract and proposals come as President Donald Trump recently said ICE raids “have not gone far enough,” during an interview with 60 Minutes.

In response, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News, “No one is off the table.”

“We're going to use all the tools in the toolbox. We have great federal partners,” he said. “Department of Justice has been outstanding with us, and we are going to team up with everyone that wants to work with us, and we're to go out there and keep the president's promise to sure that we have one of the largest deportation efforts ever.""

The president has also ordered the mobilization of more than 23,000 National Guard troops for “quick reaction forces” to deal with civil disturbances.

“Residents and State employees have planned their lives and careers around receiving (federal student loan) forgiveness,” the attorneys general wrote.
The loan forgiveness program applies to a wide range of workers beyond those employed by state government and municipalities, including those who work for some nonprofit organizations.
“To be clear, (the public service loan forgiveness program) is not merely a convenient recruitment tool for State employers,” the attorneys general wrote.","For the 29th time so far this year, Arizona is suing the Trump administration, this time to block the U.S. Department of Education from cancelling public service student loan forgiveness for employees of government agencies and organizations that help undocumented immigrants, promote diversity, equity and inclusion or take part in political protest.

“Public service should never be weaponized for political games,” Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes said in a statement. “This rule undermines the very spirit of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and threatens workers who dedicate their careers to public service. I’m proud to join my fellow attorneys general in suing to block it.”

On Monday, Mayes joined a coalition of 21 other Democratic attorneys general in a lawsuit challenging the new rules from the U.S. Department of Education. The states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to declare the rule unlawful and block the department from implementing it.

The rule, finalized Oct. 31, allows the department itself to decide that agencies or organizations are ineligible for student loan forgiveness if the Trump administration says they have a “substantial illegal purpose.” The rule is scheduled to go into effect in July 2026.

But the Department of Education’s description of an illegal purpose is based on its own ideological agenda, the attorneys general wrote.

“In seeking to crack down on specific activities disfavored by this Administration, the true intent behind the Rule is clear,” the attorneys general wrote. “The Department seeks to chill the activities of public service employers by discouraging their employees from what it deems objectionable forms of public service.”

The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was created by Congress in 2007 to encourage professionals to go into public service careers with lower pay than private sector jobs, where they might not otherwise be able to pay off their student loan debt. After 10 years of regular payments while working in public service, the federal government forgives remaining student loan debt for those in the program.

“Over the years, (the program) has enabled more than one million public servants to pursue careers that might have otherwise been out of reach,” Mayes’ office wrote in a statement. “For state governments, (the program) is a critical tool to recruit and retain qualified professionals in vital fields like education, health care, and law enforcement.”

In addition to the lawsuit from the attorneys general, a group of more than a dozen cities, labor unions and nonprofit organizations from across the country filed a separate suit in federal court in Massachusetts on Monday seeking “to restore the promise that a bipartisan Congress made to public-service workers and their employers in establishing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program nearly 20 years ago.”

The Arizona Education Association, the largest teachers union in the state, was unavailable for comment, but its parent organization, the National Education Association, joined in the suit alongside other labor unions.

“The new rule imposes harsh and illegal restrictions, makes repayment less affordable, and silences the voices of educators and other beneficiaries of the programs,” NEA President Becky Pringle said in a statement. “We refuse to stand by while politicians trap dedicated educators in generations of debt.”

Congress was clear, the attorneys general wrote in their lawsuit, that all government employees — except for elected members of Congress — were eligible for public service student loan forgiveness.

The states have benefited greatly from the loan forgiveness program, Mayes and the other attorneys general argued, because it helped them to recruit “first responders, early childhood educators, librarians, nurses, public defenders, and public prosecutors” who might otherwise have gone to work in the private sector to ensure they could pay off their student loans.

“Residents and State employees have planned their lives and careers around receiving (federal student loan) forgiveness,” the attorneys general wrote.

The loan forgiveness program applies to a wide range of workers beyond those employed by state government and municipalities, including those who work for some nonprofit organizations.

“To be clear, (the public service loan forgiveness program) is not merely a convenient recruitment tool for State employers,” the attorneys general wrote. “For many employees with debt loads that reach into the tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars, (the program) is the only reason they can afford to work in public service in the first place.”

In March, Trump issued an executive order instructing the U.S. Department of Education to change eligibility rules for the public service loan forgiveness program based on the administration’s view of “substantial illegal purpose.” The new rule disqualifies employees of government entities or organizations that “aid and abet” violations of federal immigration law, support protests against the Trump administration or back gender-affirming care for transgender youth. (The administration denigrated health care for trans children as the “chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children or the trafficking of children to so-called transgender sanctuary States for ‘purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents.’”)

The attorneys general argue that Trump’s executive order and the Department of Education rule attempt to give power to the department that has not been conferred to it by Congress.

“The Department redefines ‘qualifying employer’ in a sharp departure from the corresponding definition of ‘public service job’ that Congress put in place in 2007 — and that has remained substantively intact since then — but provides no adequate justification for this grant of unfettered discretion,” the AGs wrote.

The rule also targets state government entities while exempting federal government entities, without explanation, the attorneys general claimed.

“Put simply, the Final Rule is nothing more than a laundry list of this Administration’s policy priorities designed to attack lawful conduct it does not agree with,” the attorneys general wrote.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/unemployment-debt-bills-piggy-bank-2048x1286.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:01:05.655540

The Justice Department drops Baltimore County from its “sanctuary jurisdiction” list after new ICE partnership amid nationwide immigration debate.

The U.S. Department of Justice has announced that Baltimore County has been removed from the Trump administration’s list of so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions,” following a new agreement with federal immigration authorities.

The decision, announced late last week, comes after the county signed a Memorandum of Understanding with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to collaborate on immigration enforcement efforts.

The move follows the release of a federal list in August naming more than 500 jurisdictions nationwide that the administration said were obstructing federal immigration laws.

“Despite restrictions from state leadership, Baltimore County has shown a willingness to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement,” Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward said in a statement. “This is a small step toward restoring public safety, and we appreciate the county’s commitment to updating its policies.”

Baltimore County is the second jurisdiction to be removed from the list since its publication.

Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security classified eight Maryland counties, including Baltimore County and Baltimore City, as “sanctuary jurisdictions.”

| Related: Trump admin. deems 8 Maryland counties and Baltimore ‘Sanctuary jurisdictions’

The list also included Anne Arundel, Charles, Howard, Montgomery, Prince George’s, Queen Anne’s and Talbot counties.

DHS said the jurisdictions were “deliberately and shamefully obstructing” federal immigration enforcement and urged them to align with federal laws.

Local leaders across Maryland criticized the designation, saying it was politically motivated and inaccurate.

Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown called the federal designation “inflammatory rhetoric” and “legally flawed.” He said Maryland’s policies comply with the Constitution and pledged to defend the state against any punitive action.

Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said earlier this year that the city was not a sanctuary jurisdiction because it does not run its own detention facilities. “We are a welcoming city, and we make no apologies for that,” Scott said in a statement at the time.

Baltimore County Executive Kathy Klausmeier’s office also rejected the label in May, saying the county prioritizes public safety and community policing while following all federal, state, and local laws.

A preliminary audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that, mostly during 2024-2025, multiple states were using the money improperly. California, the biggest culprit, spends over $1.3 billion in federal Medicaid dollars on healthcare for illegal immigrants.

We're actually clawing that money back from those states now, but the fact that that could still happen is very frustrating to all of us,"" Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told Fox Business in late October.

According to CMS, the other states and districts in question, including Illinois, spent the second most (around $30 million). Followed by Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Colorado. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-M.N., said the law prohibits this from happening.

But you know what, you didn't have the verification tools in place to enforce the law so we put the verification in the 'Working Families Tax Cut Act,' also known as the Big, Beautiful Bill,"" Emmer told Fox News Digital last month.

While federal Medicaid money is supposed to be prohibited from being used for illegal immigrants, it can be used by states for emergency treatment, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. But CMS says some Democratic-led states aren't following the law.

""Protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud, and abuse isn’t optional—it’s the law. Every dollar misspent on illegal health care spending is a dollar taken from vulnerable Americans. Federal law forbids using Medicaid funds for illegal immigrants, yet several Democrat-led states did it anyway. The Trump Administration won’t tolerate it. CMS is auditing aggressively, recovering every dollar, and holding states accountable,"" said HHS Press Secretary Emily Hilliard.

We are clawing back that money. We have already gotten hundreds and millions of dollars back which again, proves that states were guilty, or they wouldn't give us the money back otherwise,"" Oz said.

“Had Congress wished to try to make federal transportation funding contingent on cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement, it could certainly have attempted to do so,” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote.
McConnell’s ruling Tuesday served another blow to the Trump administration.
But on Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump suggested on social media that funding would resume only after the government reopens.","Democratic attorneys general have notched another victory after a federal judge in Rhode Island Tuesday ruled the Trump administration can’t tie billions of dollars meant for road and bridge repairs to states’ cooperation with civil immigration enforcement.

The administration “blatantly overstepped” its statutory authority in trying to place immigration-related conditions on federal funding U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ruled in his permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Transportation.

“The Constitution demands the court set aside this lawless behavior,” McConnell wrote.

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha celebrated McConnell’s ruling.

“It should go without saying that the ability of Rhode Islanders to travel on safe roads and bridges cannot hang on the political whims of one man,” Neronha said in a statement.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Transportation did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Twenty states, led by California, filed suit in Providence in May after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy issued a directive outlining the administration’s expectations for cooperation in return for infrastructure grants that had already been approved by Congress.

20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

“Federal grants come with a clear obligation to adhere to federal laws,” Duffy said in a statement when the directive was issued in April. “It shouldn’t be controversial — enforce our immigration rules, end anti-American DEI policies, and protect free speech.”

Joining Rhode Island and California in the lawsuit were AGs from Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and Vermont.

The states argued that such a directive was outside the scope of the agency’s power and was “impermissibly vague.”

DOT attorneys have argued in court that the statute governing the agency, as enacted by Congress, allows it to impose any conditions on grant agreements so long as it “reasonably determines” those conditions align with its core mission.

But McConnell found that the conditions were too unrelated to transportation issues for the DOT to try to impose such funding conditions.

“Had Congress wished to try to make federal transportation funding contingent on cooperation with federal civil immigration enforcement, it could certainly have attempted to do so,” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote.

He added that the Trump administration had failed to explain why the court should stay any ordered relief, noting that the DOT never even appealed the preliminary injunction that was issued in June.

“The court sees no reason it should stay relief now that the case has reached summary judgment,” McConnell wrote.

McConnell’s ruling Tuesday served another blow to the Trump administration. On Oct. 31, he ordered the U.S. Department of Agriculture to tap into contingency funds to cover food stamp funding amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.

Liz Breadon, who represents Allston-Brighton on Boston City Council, called it the largest single raid she’s aware of in the neighborhood this year. She said, as far as she knows, all of the people detained had some form of legal immigration status.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement drove up to Allston Car Wash on Cambridge Street Tuesday morning. Agents detained nine immigrants who were all working at the facility, co-owner Mike Delaney told GBH News.

“Our main concern is with our employees that were detained,” Delaney said. “We really don’t want to do anything that would stir the hornet’s nest.”

“It was kind of crazy,” he said.

Delaney said some of his employees were cleaning the interiors of customers’ cars when they were detained, and that the raid ended around 11 a.m. He declined to speak to media further out of concern of jeopardizing his detained employees.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security didn’t respond to requests for comment about the arrests, what the charges were for the individuals and where they were taken.

ICE has made a number of arrests and conducted several official operations in Massachusetts, including one called Operation 2.0 in September. The agency announced more than 1,400 immigrants were detained by the agency that month, with more than 600 having serious criminal convictions or charges.

A number of community members and volunteers for LUCE Immigrant Justice Network of MA arrived later to witness the scene, document and confirm details.

Councilor Breadon was alerted to the arrests and arrived at the car wash around 10:45 a.m.

“Someone said there were as many as 17 cars, but I cannot verify the exact number of cars. But it was a very big raid for Allston-Brighton,” she said.

Breadon told GBH News this is the largest immigration raid she knows of in her district under the Trump administration.

She arrived after the arrests, as vehicles were driving immigrants away. She saw what she believes to be an ICE vehicle departing the lot, a black SUV with tinted windows and Texas license plates.

Breadon spoke with a manager at the scene.

“My understanding is that they all had documentation, whether it was a green card or a work authorization card or whatever, they all have documentation, but they were not allowed to go and get their papers,” she said.

“Three people from the same family were taken,” said Heloisa Galvão, executive director and co-founder of the Brazilian Women’s Group, an area nonprofit that helps immigrants. She said no Brazilians were arrested, and that those arrested were local Guatemalans.

The car wash owner, who knows many of the employees personally, declined to give information about who was detained. GBH News could not immediately identify the people who were detained.

Galvão has been in contact with community members who know the employees.

“It’s revolting what the government is doing. We can’t take this anymore,” she said.

“It’s very distressing because these are members of our community, their kids go to our schools, they attend our churches in the neighborhood,” Breadon said. “They’re just hard-working immigrants who are trying to make a better life for their families.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/6e89636/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa3%2F2f%2Fe128c39c4f9092b0466f85a93703%2Fgettyimages-2225418082.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:01:18.079471

As proposed, SouthCoast Wind would include 141 turbines in federal waters about 23 miles south of Nantucket. When completed, it would generate up to 2,400 megawatts of energy, enough to power more than 840,000 homes in New England.

The project is being developed in two phases and has not yet started construction. The first phase, known as SouthCoast Wind 1, would provide power to both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Representatives for SouthCoast Wind did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an earlier filing in the case, Michael Brown, the chief executive of SouthCoast Wind, said the company had already spent more than $600 million on the project.

Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group that represents developers of offshore wind farms as well as companies that drill for oil and gas in the ocean, said he was disappointed by the ruling. “We’re concerned about any delays in any of these projects when they’ve already gone through the vetting and approval process,” Mr. Milito said in an interview Tuesday.

The Trump administration said in September that it would weigh whether to revoke the Biden-era approval of the project. Months earlier, in March, the town of Nantucket sued the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in an effort to block the project. The town accused the agency of failing to comply with environmental and historical preservation laws when it issued the permit.

Soon after returning to the White House, Mr. Trump issued a sweeping order to halt all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms. His administration has since gone after several wind farms that had been given federal permits by the Biden administration and were either under construction or about to start.

In April, the Interior Department ordered that work be stopped at Empire Wind, a $5 billion wind farm off the coast of New York that had received all necessary approvals from the Biden administration and was 30 percent completed. After several weeks and negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul, Democrat of New York, the administration allowed Empire Wind to proceed.

White House officials suggested they had relented only after Ms. Hochul agreed to approve new gas pipelines in the state. Ms. Hochul denied that any such deal had been made.

“I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession,” Mr. Bessent said on CNN on Sunday. He described the economy as being in a “period of transition” because of a pullback in government spending to reduce the deficit. He called on the Fed to support the economy by cutting interest rates.

Mr. Bessent’s remarks added to pressure on the Fed and deflected blame from Mr. Trump in case the economy does ultimately face a downturn, reinforcing a strategy that has been in place since the start of the year. As the administration has imposed aggressive tariffs on nearly all of America’s trading partners and slashed federal spending, potentially slowing growth, it has sought to pin blame squarely on the Fed in the event of an economic downturn.

“This is all going to be put at the Fed’s feet,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the accounting firm RSM.

For months, Mr. Trump has assailed Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, for moving too slowly to lower interest rates. That has included branding Mr. Powell as “Mr. Too Late” and a “numbskull.” Over the summer, he escalated his pressure campaign on the central bank and took more aggressive steps to reshape the top ranks responsible for making policy decisions.

Mr. Trump is in a legal battle set to be decided by the Supreme Court after his attempt to oust Lisa Cook, a governor, from her position over allegations of mortgage fraud. In August he appointed Mr. Miran, who at the time was one of his top economic advisers, to the Fed’s Board of Governors after one member, Adriana Kugler, stepped down before her term ended.

Since joining the central bank in September, Mr. Miran has pushed hard for substantially lowering interest rates. In an interview with The New York Times on Friday, he warned that the Fed risked causing an economic downturn if it did not do so.

“If you keep policy this tight for a long period of time, then you run the risk that monetary policy itself is inducing a recession,” he said. “I don’t see a reason to run that risk if I’m not concerned about inflation on the upside.”

But that view is not widely shared by other Fed officials or by most economists across Wall Street. At the past two policy meetings, Mr. Miran has been the lone dissenter in favor of a bigger, half-point cut. Last month, most policymakers backed a quarter-point reduction, while one official dissented in support of keeping interest rates steady because of his concerns about inflation.

Mr. Bessent’s mention of a recession is unusual for a Treasury secretary; downturns can become self-fulfilling if consumers and businesses pull back in anticipation of a contraction.

Despite Mr. Bessent’s comments, the Treasury Department said this week in its statement on the economy for the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee that it did not expect a recession.

“Looking ahead to the next few quarters, the outlook for the U.S. economy faces upside and downside risks,” Treasury economists wrote. “However, on balance, economists view the risk of a recession as relatively low.”

They noted that the federal government shutdown and declining federal employment were headwinds for growth. The labor market had been flashing some worrying signals in recent months before the shutdown caused, in effect, a blackout of government statistics. Job growth had ground to a halt, and the breadth of sectors actually hiring had narrowed.

Those trends appear to have continued. And yet, Mr. Powell and other officials like John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, have not conveyed much concern about the economy’s tipping into a recession.

Mr. Powell, at a news conference after the Fed’s latest meeting to set rates, questioned whether there would be sufficient support to lower interest rates in December at a time when the Fed’s goals of low, stable inflation and a healthy labor market are in tension with each other.

As Mr. Bessent and Mr. Miran have asserted, the housing market does remain under significant pressure, a trend that began in 2023. But the Fed’s ability to lower interest rates, which would help support the housing market through lower mortgage rates, is significantly constrained because of the price pressures resulting from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Matthew Martin, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he did not view a recession as the most likely outcome for the economy, though he conceded that the Fed was walking a “tight path” and that some cracks had emerged in the economy’s foundation.

Some industries have felt more pain than others amid uncertainty over tariffs and other Trump administration policies. Perhaps the most noticeable, Mr. Martin said, was the pullback in the manufacturing sector despite the administration’s efforts to revive it.

“That’s an area where tariffs increased uncertainty and decreased demand,” he said.

Factory activity contracted for an eighth straight month in October, according to survey results released Monday by the Institute for Supply Management. Manufacturers have also continued to shed workers.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that while the national economy was not in a recession, it appeared to be struggling to avoid one. In an analysis last month, he found that 22 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia were in or near a recession and that the fate of the economy could hinge on how California and New York fare in the coming months.

“Only a few industries are still adding to payrolls, mainly health care and hospitality,” Mr. Zandi said. “Construction, manufacturing, technology, finance, government and many professional services are shedding jobs.”

Mr. Duffy has warned repeatedly of looming disaster in the national airspace, as controllers — who are among the essential federal employees forced to work through shutdowns without pay — face a second paycheck that is “a big fat zero,” as he put it on Tuesday. According to Mr. Duffy and the controllers’ union, many have taken on side jobs to make ends meet.

But while Mr. Duffy has frequently pledged to reduce air traffic when controller absences rise, his threat to shut down airspace conveyed an increased sense of alarm.

“The F.A.A., and us, will close the airspace down, we will restrict the airspace when we feel it’s not safe,” he said. As the transportation secretary, Mr. Duffy oversees the Federal Aviation Administration.

For all of his warnings about the dangers shutdown poses to air travel, Mr. Duffy has firmly maintained that it is safe to fly. He repeated that assertion on Tuesday, with a caveat.

“People always ask me is the system safe, and I would tell you yes, the system is safe — and if it wasn’t, we would shut it down,” Mr. Duffy said, echoing comments he has made in the past.

“But with this shutdown, it would be dishonest to say that more risk is not injected into the system,” he added.

Even before the shutdown, the work force of certified controllers was sorely overtaxed, with most routinely working overtime hours to compensate for the fact that about 3,000 of approximately 14,000 positions are vacant. The vacancies have also forced some controllers to cover two positions, and Mr. Duffy said on Tuesday that the shutdown was exacerbating that workload.

“They have to work those two positions because their colleagues have called in sick or they’re waiting tables or they’re driving Uber,” Mr. Duffy said.

He added that the F.A.A. was accustomed to enlisting different air traffic facilities to help avoid interruptions and maintain air travel safety when certain towers and centers faced a shortfall of controllers. Last Friday, which saw 35 facilities experience substantial shortfalls, the Federal Aviation Administration reported that nearly 80 percent of air traffic controllers assigned to facilities in the New York area were absent.

But without an act of Congress, he said, there were no extraordinary measures he could take to compensate controllers for their labor.

“We’ve tried to pull every dollar we can for different programs where we’re legally allowed to pull and fund,” he said. “But the truth is, the law doesn’t allow me to say, ‘the Congress hasn’t funded the government, I can just go find money and pay air traffic controllers.’ That’s not the way our Constitution works and our government works.”

The F.A.A. has drawn on prior year funds to sustain some operations, including the agency’s academy that trains new controllers, through the shutdown. But the academy is expected to run out of those funds by Nov. 15, according to an F.A.A. spokeswoman. The Trump administration has also covered the salaries of active duty military by reprogramming federal funds, with a small percentage of the salaries being covered through a private donation.

Hours after that ultimatum, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, appeared to walk back the president’s comments. She told reporters at a news briefing that the administration is “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments in November.

“We’re complying with the court’s order, and we’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can, and as quickly as we can, but it’s going to take some time,” Ms. Leavitt said.

The whiplash on Tuesday only added to the persistent sense of panic and anxiety among the roughly one in eight poor Americans who rely on SNAP, the nation’s largest anti-hunger program. The president’s comments once again raised the risk that these families could find themselves vulnerable to hunger and financial hardship, even though a federal court ordered Mr. Trump and his aides to restart nutrition assistance.

To comply with that directive, administration officials told two separate courts this week that they would make only partial payments to people on SNAP, essentially halving their aid for November. That alone had proved insufficient for cities and nonprofits, which had returned to court on Tuesday — before Mr. Trump’s threat — to try to restore full benefit amounts and force the government to pay the money more quickly.

“This is immoral. See you in court,” Skye L. Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing one of the lawsuits that has repeatedly challenged the Trump administration, said in a post on social media.

The White House declined to elaborate on Mr. Trump’s plans. The Agriculture Department did not respond to a request for comment.

In the original order, published on Saturday, Judge John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island essentially gave the Trump administration a choice. He said it could provide full SNAP payments by Monday or partial benefits by Wednesday, while finding that the government had a legal obligation to sustain the program if the funds were available.

The Trump administration chose the latter approach, financed using about $5 billion set aside for SNAP in an emergency reserve previously established by Congress. The Agriculture Department could have tapped an ample store of additional funds to provide full benefits to those enrolled in food stamps, but the agency declined to do so.

As a result, families stood to receive about half as much in nutrition benefits this month than they would have normally — and, potentially, only after weeks or months of delay. Officials at the Agriculture Department had acknowledged these limitations in court filings, even as the administration refused to make other funds available for SNAP.

By Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared to suggest he would halt food stamps entirely. He said on social media that the benefits were managed “haphazardly” and attacked Democrats, a set of comments that recalled his previous threat to punish the party and cut its favored programs during the shutdown.

Some congressional Democrats expressed outrage over what they saw as a patently illegal act.

“The president is not a king,” said Representative Angie Craig of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House’s leading agriculture committee. “He is not free to disregard the rule of law whenever it becomes politically inconvenient for him.”

By that afternoon, Ms. Leavitt insisted that the president only sought to register his disapproval with using emergency funds to pay SNAP benefits. She said that Mr. Trump wanted those “funds preserved,” even though the administration had attested to a judge that it would exhaust that money during the shutdown.

Before the president posted his threat on social media, local leaders and nonprofits had filed anew in federal court in the hopes of securing a clearer order from Judge McConnell, one that would force the Trump administration to pay benefits rapidly and in full.

“Time is of the essence when it comes to hunger,” they wrote in their filing, prepared by lawyers from groups including Democracy Forward.

They said that the court “did not contemplate that millions would be deprived of basic nutritional assistance for weeks” while the government readied its partial benefits. They asked the judge to force the Trump administration to “release the unlawfully withheld funding, in its entirety, for November SNAP benefits.”

The filing, in Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va., was styled as a rebuttal of Mr. Comey’s claims that the charges he is facing should be thrown out as an act of vindictive prosecution by the Trump administration. He is accused of lying to and obstructing Congress in testimony on the investigation into Russia and the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, during which he was asked whether he had authorized anyone at the F.B.I. “to be an anonymous source in news reports.”

Yet the prosecutors who wrote the filing spent as much time suggesting that Mr. Comey had used the confidant, Daniel C. Richman, a law professor at Columbia University, as a conduit to the news media as they did seeking to reject allegations that the indictment was vindictive. Mr. Richman had worked at the F.B.I. as a “special government employee,” leaving in early 2017.

Last month, lawyers for Mr. Comey accused President Trump of improperly ordering the Justice Department to prosecute him out of a deep personal animus reaching back to May 2017, when he was fired as F.B.I. director while overseeing the Trump-Russia investigation.

The lawyers pointed to the extraordinary origins of the case: a public message on social media in which Mr. Trump ordered his attorney general, Pam Bondi, to go after Mr. Comey, one of his most reviled adversaries. The demands came shortly after the president had ousted the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who had refused to indict Mr. Comey and replaced him with a neophyte prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, who quickly filed charges in the first criminal case she had ever handled.

Mr. Comey’s lawyers have also argued that the case Ms. Halligan filed should be dismissed because Mr. Trump improperly appointed her to her post as U.S. attorney. But in a separate motion on Monday, prosecutors rejected that claim.

The motion also included a highly unusual sworn statement from Attorney General Pam Bondi saying that on Friday, for “the avoidance of doubt,” she had retroactively named Ms. Halligan to a second post in the office — that of special attorney — with the authority to handle both Mr. Comey’s prosecution and a second case against Letitia James, New York’s attorney general and another of Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies.

While Mr. Comey’s lawyers described Mr. Trump’s social media message as “smoking-gun evidence” of vindictiveness, the prosecutors argued it was “hardly evidence at all” and merely part of “a mix of news reports, social-media posts and speculation” used to accuse the president of bias.

The prosecutors also claimed that the indictment of Mr. Comey was not born out of animus but rather addressed “the societal interests” of bringing charges against “a former F.B.I. director who lied to Congress about his conduct while at the helm of the nation’s primary federal law-enforcement agency.”

The indictment accuses Mr. Comey of lying to and obstructing Congress during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020.

At that hearing, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked Mr. Comey whether he had authorized someone at the F.B.I. “to be an anonymous source in news reports.” The indictment says Mr. Comey misled the committee by saying that he had not done so.

Mr. Comey’s lawyers have attacked the indictment — as well as Mr. Cruz’s question — as imprecise and confusing. Moreover, they have said that Mr. Comey’s answer was not a detailed, direct response to Mr. Cruz, but was instead a “literally true statement” in which he said he stood by previous testimony he had given three years earlier when he was asked similar questions in a different congressional hearing.

Even though they were supposed to be addressing the question of vindictiveness, the prosecutors filled the opening pages of their filing with quotations from personal emails and texts messages between Mr. Comey and Mr. Richman, as well those between Mr. Richman and reporters.

While those communications could ultimately help prosecutors prove that Mr. Comey used Mr. Richman to communicate to the news media, it remained unclear what bearing they had on the specific charges in the case: namely, whether Mr. Comey was lying when he denied authorizing an F.B.I. employee to anonymously share information for news reports.

Prosecutors have not made clear what new reports they were referring to or which reporters may have worked on them.

Indeed, the new court filing quoted communications between Mr. Comey and Mr. Richman concerning several articles in The New York Times. Two cited in the filing touched on Mr. Comey’s controversial handling of the conclusion — and brief reopening — of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server close to the 2016 election in which she was the Democratic candidate.

The first article was a graphic The Times published on Nov. 2, 2016, outlining the pros and cons of the choices available to Mr. Comey in his handling of reopening the Clinton investigation. It did not contain any new information about the inquiry or cite Mr. Richman — or anyone else — as a source.

Still, the emails quoted in the filing suggest that Mr. Richman helped influence the abstract analysis presented in the article.

Before the graphic was published, Mr. Comey had complained about The Times’s coverage and said to Mr. Richman, “Perhaps you can make him smarter.” It is not clear whether that was a reference to the same reporter who was working on the graphic, but after it appeared, Mr. Comey wrote to Mr. Richman, “Well done my friend.”

The other article appeared to be an investigation published in April 2017 that scrutinized Mr. Comey’s handling of communications about the Clinton investigation. It featured on-the-record quotations from Mr. Richman. The indictment accused Mr. Comey of lying about authorizing an anonymous source to leak information to the news media.

The filing also discussed The Times’s publication, days after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May 2017, of information about Mr. Comey’s earlier conversations with the president. Mr. Comey later testified to Congress that he had directed Mr. Richman to share information about them, based on contemporaneous memos he had written.

The filing quoted a text Mr. Richman sent the author of those articles, Michael S. Schmidt, saying that he “just got go ahead” — a possible reference to Mr. Comey agreeing to let him serve as a source. Even if that were true, it could not be a basis for the criminal charge because the indictment accuses Mr. Comey of lying about using an F.B.I. employee to leak information and Mr. Richman was no longer working at the F.B.I. by then.

The new filing also disclosed an insinuating piece of evidence that did not appear to be related to either of the two charges detailed in the indictment. It instead appears related to a third charge that Ms. Halligan tried to bring against Mr. Comey, but that a grand jury rejected.

That involved a memo the C.I.A. sent to the F.B.I. on Sept. 7, 2016, containing intelligence about Russia’s interference in that year’s campaign. The F.B.I. had recently opened an investigation into Russian interference and the nature of the Kremlin’s ties to associates of the Trump campaign.

The memo itself broaches how Russian intelligence analysts had discussed purported emails saying that in late July 2016, Mrs. Clinton had supposedly approved a campaign plan centered on Mr. Trump and Russian hackers to distract from her own email scandal. Evidence gathered by a special counsel later showed that the purported emails were likely fabricated.

At the September 2020 hearing, a senator had asked Mr. Comey about the memo, but Mr. Comey said he had no memory of seeing it. The third charge Ms. Halligan tried to bring was over whether Mr. Comey lied in saying that.

The new filing said the F.B.I. had recently found handwritten notes from Mr. Comey, dated Sept. 26, 2016, that read: “HRC plan to tie Trump.”

Even though that appeared to refer to Mrs. Clinton, it is not clear why those notes would support the failed charge, since they do no mention the Sept. 7 memo at issue. It has long been public that Mr. Comey knew about the allegation itself because he was present for a briefing in August at which it was mentioned.

But the roughly one in eight families that receive SNAP may still be at risk of imminent hunger and financial hardship. The Trump administration opted against using its full stable of available funds — totaling into the billions of dollars — to sustain the nation’s largest anti-hunger program. As a result, eligible households may receive only half as much in benefits compared with their usual amounts, officials said.

It also remained unclear when food stamp recipients would actually receive their aid. The Trump administration had previously warned that it could take weeks to provision benefits on a partial basis, further underscoring the consequences of its budgetary decision on Monday.

Many Democrats sharply condemned the White House in response, saying the administration had a legal and moral obligation to pay full benefits on time, especially given the fact that there were plenty of available funds.

“It is not enough to do the bare minimum — the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, who leads her party on the chamber’s top agriculture panel.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

“There’s a process that has to be followed,” Scott Bessent, the Treasury secretary, told CNN on Sunday. “So, we got to figure out what the process is. President Trump wants to make sure that people get their food benefits.”

For the millions of poor Americans who depend on SNAP, the whiplash has only compounded the real, financial consequences from a shutdown that has no end in sight. Still, Mr. Trump has made no real effort to negotiate an end to the fiscal stalemate roiling Washington, where Democrats refuse to back a Republican measure to reopen the government because it does not extend a set of subsidies that help Americans afford health insurance.

The saga began last week, when the Trump administration said it would not tap billions of dollars that it had in reserve to continue funding nutrition benefits into this month, in a break with its own prior, public guidance. The move defied calls from congressional Democrats and Republicans alike, who wanted to see the White House protect the poor in the event that the shutdown continued for weeks longer.

The decision prompted cities, states, religious groups and nonprofits to sue, as they looked to spare low-income families from experiencing hunger for as long as the government remained closed. Two different federal courts ultimately sided with those groups on Friday, and the judges imposed a deadline of Monday for the Trump administration to communicate its next steps.

Only one of the judges, John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, explicitly ordered the Trump administration to restart SNAP payments immediately. In a written order, issued on Saturday, he said the Agriculture Department could either make full payments to SNAP recipients by Monday or partial payments by Wednesday.

Judge McConnell gave the government those extra days after administration officials told the court that providing partial payments could take weeks in some cases because of technical constraints. In doing so, he encouraged the Trump administration to fund payments in full using a second account at the Agriculture Department, one comprised largely of tariff revenues

Responding on Monday, the Trump administration maintained that it could not legally source SNAP payments this way, even though it had tapped the money repeatedly to sustain another federal nutrition program during the shutdown. In a sworn declaration, Patrick A. Penn, a top official at the Agriculture Department, added that using the money to provide full food stamp aid would also “stray from congressional intent.”

The assertion offered a stark contrast with the myriad other ways in which Mr. Trump has reprogrammed the budget during the shutdown to blunt some of its potential consequences. But SNAP is a function of government that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have long aspired to cut and restrict, and one that Mr. Trump himself has associated with Democrats, whom he promised to punish as a result of the federal closure.

Anti-hunger groups broadly condemned the White House for opting to release only partial benefits. Crystal FitzSimons, the president of the Food Research & Action Center, said the decision would force “state agencies to scramble under unclear guidance, which will further delay benefits.”

But signs quickly emerged that the fight might not be over.

Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, which represented cities and nonprofits that had sued, said the group was “considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.”

“It shouldn’t take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided,” she added in a statement.

Hours after that ultimatum, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, appeared to walk back the president’s comments, saying that the administration was “fully complying” with the court and would provide partial food stamp payments this month.

It is unclear when recipients of food stamps will actually receive their aid, as the federal shutdown stretches on with no end in sight. Here’s what we know:

What are SNAP benefits?

The federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is how the federal government helps people buy food if they cannot afford it. About 42 million Americans, living in 22 million households, use SNAP — representing roughly one in eight people in the United States. The benefits, commonly known as food stamps, average around $187 a month and cost the federal government about $8 billion monthly.

How does the shutdown affect SNAP?

Lawmakers must regularly approve money for SNAP through their normal budget process, which is currently paralyzed by a legislative impasse in Congress. Though the government shut down at the beginning of October, SNAP benefits were not expected to run out of funds until the beginning of November.

What can the government do to fund SNAP?

SNAP maintains a sizable reserve as a kind of rainy-day fund to cover any emergencies or shortfalls.

Many congressional Democrats and Republicans had encouraged the Trump administration to use this funding to preserve food stamps into November and protect the poor as the government continued to remain closed.

But the Trump administration declined to dip into those funds, even though the Agriculture Department had said previously that it could reprogram money to prevent benefit cuts. Administration officials have maintained that they could do little to rescue SNAP, despite the fact that they had moved around billions of dollars to sustain other functions of government while federal funding had lapsed.

More than two dozen states sued the Trump administration in an effort to unlock those funds before benefits ran out.

What have the courts said?

Two different federal courts ruled on Friday that the Trump administration had acted unlawfully in trying to hold back SNAP’s emergency funds. The twin court defeats amounted to a major rebuke of the White House — though only one of the judges, John J. McConnell Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, explicitly ordered the Trump administration to restart SNAP payments immediately.

Mr. Trump said late Friday that the administration would provide the funding for food stamps, in what appeared to be a signal that the administration would ultimately obey the ruling.

But on Monday, the Trump administration instead said it would only partially fund SNAP in November, offering a temporary and limited reprieve to low-income families. Officials claimed in court filings that the administration could not legally use some funds available to the Agriculture Department — composed largely of tariff revenues — even though it had tapped that money repeatedly to sustain another federal nutrition program during the shutdown.

Then, on Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested he would not fund SNAP at all, saying on social media that SNAP benefits would be distributed “only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!”

Ms. Leavitt appeared hours later to suggest Mr. Trump’s statement was false, telling reporters that “we’re complying with the court’s order, and we’re getting that partial payment out the door as much as we can, and as quickly as we can, but it’s going to take some time.”

Lawyers for the administration had also previously suggested it could take weeks to disburse the benefits during the shutdown.

The Trump administration’s legal position on food stamps is a stark contrast with the myriad other ways in which Mr. Trump has reprogrammed the budget during the shutdown for his own agenda. SNAP is a function of government that Mr. Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have long aspired to cut and restrict, and one that Mr. Trump himself has associated with Democrats, whom he promised to punish as a result of the government shutdown.

How much do people get to spend?

The amount is adjusted each year, according to federal guidelines. In 2025, the maximum monthly benefit for one person is $292. For a household of four, it’s $975.

The amount also depends on which state recipients live in, and on factors like whether anyone in the household has a steady income or is a dependent.

How do people use SNAP?

The system is fully electronic, eliminating the paper food stamps that used to be presented at checkout. Each month, a dollar amount is loaded onto a card, which is used like a debit or credit card.

What can SNAP be used for?

Almost any food sold at a grocery store, including soda, chips, candy and snacks. (Some states have enacted rules that prevent SNAP money from being spent on soda and candy.) It can’t be used, however, for hot or cooked food, or for anything other than food.

Where can SNAP be used?

At most retailers, farmers’ markets and pharmacies that sell food, like Walgreens and CVS. SNAP cards can also be used to order from online markets like Walmart and Amazon.

Do recipients have to be U.S. citizens?

In most cases, yes. But people who are refugees, have been granted asylum, are from Cuba or Haiti, or belong to certain other groups are eligible if they meet income requirements. Green-card holders and permanent residents must wait five years to receive benefits.

### About Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights:RFK Human Rights is a nonpartisan, not-for-profit organization, founded in 1968, that works to realize Robert F. Kennedy’s dream of a more just and peaceful world.
About Public Citizen Litigation Group Public Citizen Litigation Group is the litigating arm of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen.","Washington, D.C. — Four non-profit public-interest organizations filed a lawsuit today to challenge a new rule issued by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) that threatens to disqualify certain employers from eligibility for the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The plaintiffs in the case — Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, the American Immigration Council, The Door – A Center of Alternatives, Inc., and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) — are represented by Student Defense and Public Citizen Litigation Group.

ED established the new rule in response to an Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump. Finalized on October 31, the rule allows ED to disqualify employers from the PSLF program that are deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” by the Secretary of Education. Under the rule, ED will decide for itself whether this standard is met, based on its unilateral determination that an organization has engaged in activities disfavored by the administration concerning immigration, gender affirming care, and purported discrimination, along with other areas. The rule’s vague and overbroad language permits arbitrary enforcement against mission-driven organizations doing work or expressing opinions opposed by the government.

ED’s new regulation threatens to harm many of the 2.5 million federal student loan borrowers who have collectively worked more than 100 million months in public service jobs in order to qualify for PSLF forgiveness.

“The Rule will make it more difficult for employers in certain fields, such as advocacy on behalf of immigrants, to recruit and train employees, and will chill politically disfavored but legal activities by PSLF employers.” the complaint states. “The Rule is contrary to the PSLF statute, exceeds the Department’s regulatory authority, and violates the constitutional rights of nonprofits whose employees are statutorily eligible for PSLF.”

PSLF was created in 2007 to encourage students to pursue public service careers after graduation. The program offers federal student loan forgiveness to those who spend ten years repaying such loans while working full time in a public service job. The statute creating the program provides a clear list of qualifying employers, which include military service, emergency management, public health, government, public safety, law enforcement, early childhood education and library science, and all 501(c)(3) organizations, among others.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare the new rule unlawful and to declare that ED lacks the legal authority to change the statutory criteria for PSLF.

“Congress created PSLF to support those who work in public service jobs, not to let the President play favorites. The Trump administration should not be allowed to use a program designed to reward public service as a weapon against its political enemies,” said Cormac Early, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group and lead counsel on the case.

“Congress made a promise that if Americans give back to the country, the country will give back to them. Now the Trump Administration wants the power to renege on that promise if they disagree with your employer’s mission or perceived political views,” said Student Defense President Aaron Ament. “This new, unlawful rule is a slap in the face to the millions of first responders, health workers, teachers, and other public servants who believed the government could be trusted to keep its word.”

“The Trump Administration’s attack on the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program strikes at the heart of civic space and public service. By targeting individuals who choose to work in nonprofits defending the human rights of immigrants and advancing diversity, inclusion, and transgender rights, this rule seeks to silence voices for equity and justice while weakening these organizations’ ability to recruit the next generation of leaders,” said Kerry Kennedy, President, RFK Human Rights.

“Public Service Loan Forgiveness was a clear commitment from the government to individuals who have dedicated themselves to public service,” said Jorge Loweree, Managing Director of Programs and Strategy at the American Immigration Council. “This regulation weaponizes that commitment. No one should be forced to choose between supporting their neighbors and securing the financial stability they were promised.”

“Latino families across the country rely on mission-driven nonprofits for immigration assistance, health care, and programs that support underserved young adults. This rule hands any administration a blank check to punish nonprofits it dislikes and jeopardizes the future of the teachers, nurses, veterans, and legal advocates who serve the public every day,” said Juan Proaño, CEO of the LULAC Institute. “LULAC Institute joined this case to defend the statute, protect our workforce, and ensure Latino borrowers are never forced to choose between serving their community and keeping a promise the government already made.”

In particular, this route is available to family members whose family relationship with their sponsor was formed after the sponsor’s grant of stateless leave. This route has no English language requirement, no maintenance, accommodation or other requirements; the family relationship is enough, regardless of when it was formed.

When the new rules come into force on 11 November 2025, further to the statement of changes HC 1333, family members are only eligible to join their stateless sponsor under Appendix Statelessness where the family relationship was formed before the sponsor’s first grant of statelessness leave. Where the family relationship was formed after the first grant of statelessness leave, family members must apply under Appendix FM.

There is, therefore, a short window in which the family members of stateless sponsors whose family relationship was formed after the initial grant of stateless leave can apply for family reunion under part 14 of the rules. If this window is missed, those family members would need to apply under Appendix FM.

Background

The rules for stateless persons and their family members were found in part 14 of the immigration rules until January 2024 when part 14 was replaced by Appendix Statelessness. Appendix Statelessness removed family reunion rights for family members of stateless sponsors, instead directing them to apply under Appendix FM.

Asylum Aid successfully challenged this change in February 2025 and the new rules on family reunion were deemed unlawful.

In response, the Home Office agreed to continue processing applications for stateless family reunion under part 14 of the immigration rules, despite the fact that this section of the rules had been archived.

The transitional provision in Appendix Statelessness states:

A partner or child of a stateless person can apply to stay in the UK under Part 14: Stateless Person on or after the 31 January 2024 if they have or last had permission as a partner or child under Part 14: Stateless Person. A child born in the UK to a parent who has either permission to enter or stay as a stateless person or is the partner of a stateless person can also apply for permission to stay under Part 14. For those eligible to apply under Part 14 as a partner or child of a stateless person, the Part 14 rules in place on the 30 January 2024 will apply. In any other case, a partner or child of a stateless person (who is not themselves stateless and therefore applying in their own right) can apply to join or remain with a Stateless person in the UK under Appendix FM.

There was (and still is) no clear process for applying under the archived rules and public information was unclear, incorrect and contradictory. However, this regime has continued since and it is still possible to apply under part 14 until the incoming rules take effect on 11 November 2025.

After 11 November, the rules in Appendix Statelessness will be the only statelessness family reunion rules going forward, apart from those who have already been granted family reunion leave under part 14.

Changes

Further to the most recent statement of changes, the following change will be made to archived part 14 of the rules on 11 November:

14.1. For paragraph 417 substitute: “417. Applications made on or before 10 November 2025 for permission as a partner or child of a stateless person will be decided under the Part 14 rules in force at that time. Applications on or after 11 November 2025 will be decided under Appendix Statelessness rules, if the applicant meets its requirements. If not, the applicant must apply for permission under Appendix FM”.

As we have already noted, the rules in part 14 allow for a partner or child to apply for family reunion irrespective of when the family relationship with their sponsor was formed. The new rules under Appendix Statelessness only allow for family members whose relationship pre-dated the sponsor’s grant of statelessness leave to apply.

Applications made under part 14 of the immigration rules don’t result in a grant of leave in line with the sponsor; the family member must complete their own five year period of residence before becoming eligible for settlement. Applicants who are granted under the new rules will be granted leave in line with the sponsor.

Part 14 of the immigration rules also does not allow a stateless person who has settled or naturalised as British to sponsor their family members, whereas the new rules coming into force will allow sponsors who have settled or naturalised as British to sponsor their family members provided that the family relationship existed before the sponsor’s initial grant of statelessness leave.

Drafting errors in new rules

It is also worth noting that there are drafting errors in the new rules. The Home Office is aware of these errors but they will not be corrected until the next statement of changes to the rules. When the caseworker guidance on ‘Permission to stay as a stateless person’ is next updated, it should explain the correct eligibility criteria.

The first error is that the rules have ‘and’ instead of ‘or’ at paragraph S 11.3 (b)(ii), which has the effect of excluding a person with five years’ leave to remain from sponsoring their family.

S 11.3. An application as a partner or child of a Stateless person under Appendix Statelessness must meet the following validity requirements:

(a) the applicant must have provided biometrics when required; and

(b) the applicant must be applying as a partner or child of a person (P) on the statelessness route who:

(i) has made a valid application for permission to stay in the UK on the Appendix Statelessness route that has not been decided; or

(ii) has permission to stay in the UK on the statelessness route; and

(iii) is settled or has become a British Citizen, providing P had permission to stay on the statelessness route when they settled and the applicant either had permission as their partner or child at that time, or the applicant is applying as a child of P and the applicant was born in the UK before P settled.

The second error is in the second definition of an eligible partner which fails to mirror paragraph S 11.3 (b)(iii) (above) so has the effect of excluding settled or British sponsors:

S 14.2. The applicant must be the partner of a Person (P) where one of the following applies:

(a) P has permission to stay as a Stateless person; or

(b) P is, at the same time, applying for (and is granted) permission to stay as a Stateless person;

S 14.3. The applicant must meet the requirements of Appendix Relationship with Partner of these Rules.

Conclusion

Anyone applying for family reunion under part 14 of the immigration rules should make sure that they state extremely clearly that they are applying under those rules in all the free text boxes in the application form and in a letter of representations, as otherwise their application may be be lumped into the new rules.

In the October 31 Hiran Management v NLRB decision, the 5th Circuit held that the NLRB lacks authority to award damages for “foreseeable pecuniary harms” flowing from alleged labor law violations. The decision means the Board cannot force employers in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to pay for expenses like credit-card interest, missed rent, or childcare costs that workers incur as a result of an employer’s alleged unfair labor practice. This decision follows the 3rd Circuit’s similar ruling late last year, while the 9th Circuit reached the opposite conclusion by upholding the NLRB’s broader authority to award damages. What do (even non-unionized) employers need to know about this decision – and what should you do?

NLRB Awards Employees Damages for All Foreseeable Pecuniary Harms

Hiran Management runs Hungry Like the Wolf, a Houston-based karaoke restaurant with an 80s vibe. After the owner hired a new supervisor, the non-unionized staff complained about extra duties and unkept promises of extra pay.

When tensions boiled over at a staff meeting, several employees walked out – then decided to strike and develop a list of demands. Most stayed off the schedule the next workday. The restaurant’s lawyer later invited them to a meeting to discuss concerns, but the discussions fell apart. A week later, the lawyer notified the striking workers they were no longer employed.

The Biden-era NLRB ruled the employees engaged in protected concerted activity and ordered reinstatement. It also awarded the employees full compensatory damages as a “make-whole” monetary remedy, including repayment for a wide range of “foreseeable” financial harms beyond back pay. The Board relied on its 2022 opinion called Thryv, Inc., which empowered it to compensate workers beyond backpay.

Hiran Management appealed the Board’s decision to the 5th Circuit, which issued a unanimous opinion striking down the NLRB’s authority to issue broad remedies late last week.

5th Circuit Chops Back NLRB’s Power to Award Compensatory, Non-Equitable Damages

The 5th Circuit disagreed with the NLRB’s approach – in emphatic terms. The court opened by underscoring the novelty of what the Board is trying to do:

Ninety years after Congress created the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB claimed for the first time the ability to award full compensatory damages in its enforcement proceedings. (emphasis added)

Later, the panel explained that although the National Labor Relations Act allows equitable remedies like reinstatement and backpay, it does not authorize broad consequential-damages awards, which constitute legal relief. “The Board’s remedy aims to redress concrete losses to the Employees wholly apart from backpay and pay-related costs,” the court said, “it covers harms typically dealt with in tort suits for compensatory damages, and it operates as a compensatory damages order.”

And the court warned that the NLRB would effectively have no boundaries if it were able to operate under the Thryv standard: “After Thryv, the only limit is the Board’s imagination.” In sum, the 5th Circuit said that only Congress can authorize the Board to award full compensatory damages, and it has not done so.

Why Should Non-Unionized Employers Care?

This opinion isn’t just about union shops. The NLRA protects all non-supervisory employees’ rights to act together over workplace concerns – whether or not a union is involved. In fact, the dispute here started with a walkout by non-union restaurant workers, and the Board still sought expansive financial remedies. That means everyday issues like group complaints, coordinated scheduling protests, or employees teaming up to challenge a policy can be protected under the NLRA and, if not handled correctly, can trigger potential monetary exposure.

If the NLRB’s broadened remedy power stands in some jurisdictions, even routine concerted-activity claims could carry far larger financial stakes, which could result in increased settlement pressure and litigation risks.

Where Courts Stand Now: A Growing Split

Two circuits have now rejected the NLRB’s expanded Thryv remedial scheme:

5th Circuit (this case) – covering Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi

3rd Circuit (summary here) – covering Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware

One circuit has allowed the Thryv remedial scheme:

9th Circuit – covering California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Montana, Idaho, Alaska, and Hawaii

What’s Next?

Given this direct circuit split – on a major federal agency power question touching thousands of cases – it seems possible that the Supreme Court could step in to resolve the conflict.

Meanwhile, the NLRB remains in flux. It has been operating without an active quorum since the change in administration, and thus unable to issue decisions or set new legal precedent. While President Trump nominated two new members to the Board back in July, they have yet to be confirmed by the Senate, and the lingering government shutdown makes it difficult to predict when they could be formally installed.

Once the Board resumes operating with a quorum, we expect it to move away from Thryv and stick with its traditional forms of monetary awards (i.e., backpay). We could even see the Board issue an opinion reversing itself on the issue of damage authority. In fact, the new NLRB General Counsel issued a memo in May calling the Thryv standard into question, further signaling a change in philopshy. But Boards will swing back and forth with changes in administration and thus having a definitive word from SCOTUS about the powers of the NLRB in this area would be of massive help to the labor law community.

Practical Takeaways for Employers

✅ Expect legal uncertainty until SCOTUS weighs in

If your company has locations in multiple jurisdictions, remedies may differ depending on where a case lands. Multi-state employers should consider this when negotiating settlements with the Board.

✅ Traditional remedies still apply

The 5th Circuit’s decision does not eliminate reinstatement, backpay, or standard make-whole relief. Those remain firmly in place.

✅ Prepare for NLRB pushback

The Board may likely move away from awarding Thryv remedies, even where courts allow them.

✅ Proactive compliance matters

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who’ve spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

“We’re what I call now sanctuary busters,” he said. “There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.”

Doubling Down on Chemical Agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He’s regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face.

“We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.”

Immigration agents’ tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a Raid That Amplified Tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration’s use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because ""you have to get the people out.”

“I think (the raids) haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

“A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.”

Bovino said he hasn’t seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents’ accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming Elected Leaders and Activists

Bovino’s presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker “wildly misinformed” while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor’s appearance.

In response, Pritzker’s office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino’s “publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.”

Bovino wouldn’t say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

“We’re going to be in Chicago a good while,” he said. “But you just never know.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 16:02:30.762893

Four Chinese immigrants who live, work, study and raise families in Florida — but claimed they were prohibited under Senate Bill 264 from buying a house — brought the suit. Multi-Choice Realty, a local real estate firm that says the law harms its business, is also a plaintiff.

But in a split ruling, the circuit judges held that none of the plaintiffs has standing to challenge the law’s purchase restriction because none of them has shown they suffered an imminent injury.

The majority wrote that the purchase restriction does not actually prevent any of them from purchasing property because they are all domiciled in Florida, not China.

Under Florida law, a person is domiciled in the state if they live “at a place” in Florida, and it does not require an intent to remain permanently to establish domicile.

“This is true even if the person does not have permanent immigration status,” U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Luck wrote in the opinion.

“As with anyone else, when a person without permanent immigration status is present in Florida and forms the intent to make Florida her permanent or indefinite home, she’s acquired domicile in Florida,” the Donald Trump appointee added.

The ruling also affirmed the denial of their request to block the law’s requirement that persons who are domiciled in China, and who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents, register real property they already own and sign an affidavit swearing they have complied with the law.

The majority determined that this requirement does not apply to the plaintiffs because all of them owned a property interest in a home before the provision took effect on July 1, 2023.

While the judges acknowledged the plaintiffs’ concerns over their future ability to purchase Florida property, they failed to establish an imminent injury because none of them showed evidence of specific plans to purchase other properties in the state.

Three of the individual plaintiffs — Yongxin Liu, Zhiming Xu and Yifan Shen — have lived in Florida for years under work visas and have already purchased at least one property. One of the plaintiffs, Xinxi Wang, is at least arguably domiciled in China, the judges wrote, because she has only a temporary student visa and, unlike the other plaintiffs, has not expressed an intention to remain indefinitely in Florida.

The purchase restriction doesn’t impair Wang’s home ownership because it was purchased before the law took effect. However, the judges found she is likely subject to the registration requirement as it is located in Miami within 10 miles of a military installation or critical infrastructure facility.

Still, the judges agreed with the lower court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion because they failed to show a substantial likelihood of success on their claims that Chinese domicile and Chinese national origin are the same thing and that the registration requirement is therefore discriminatory.

As for the real estate brokerage, Multi-Choice, the majority was also not persuaded by its claims that it will lose existing and potential customers from buying Florida property because it failed to specify any harmed clients.

Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis signed SB 264 into law in 2023, restricting land purchases by immigrants from “foreign countries of concern,” including China, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Syria, on or within 10 miles of any military installation or critical infrastructure facility in the state.

The law specifically restricts people who are domiciled in China or who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from owning any real property in Florida, regardless of location. The sole exception is that people with a valid non-tourist visa or who have been granted asylum can purchase one residential property, but only if it is less than two acres and not within five miles of a military installation.

In their suit, the plaintiffs argued the law violated the Fair Housing Act and Equal Protection Clause because the purchase restriction, registration and affidavit requirements unconstitutionally discriminated against “Chinese persons” based on “race, ethnicity, color, alienage and national origin.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Barbara Lagoa, a fellow Trump appointee, joined Luck in the decision. Their ruling remands the lower court that denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction to do so without prejudice as to the purchase restriction, meaning it can be tried again in the future.

But U.S. Circuit Judge Charles Wilson wrote separately to express his dissent with the majority’s “dubious equal protection and preemption analyses.”

The Bill Clinton appointee criticized the lack of scrutiny regarding states’ generalizations about their own “power” and the need for “safety” from outsiders to support discriminatory policies and classifications based on where someone is from.

He added that in his view, the plaintiffs would have likely succeeded on their federal preemption claim because Florida’s law intrudes on federal authority.

“If every state enacted its own restrictions on foreign property investment, they would weaken the President’s ability to speak to foreign nations on behalf of the United States,” Wilson wrote.

In August, the First District Court of Appeals ruled that UC had not provided sufficient evidence to justify its “discriminatory policy” of not hiring students who are in the country without legal permission.
That ruling stopped short of overturning the hiring protocol, but the judges ordered UC to reconsider it using proper legal criteria.
A plaintiff in the case, former UC lecturer Iliana Perez, urged the university system to take the latest court decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

Officials with the university system say the decision puts them in a precarious position as they negotiate with the Trump administration after the withdrawal of federal research funds.

A 2024 lawsuit argued that UC’s ban defied state law. In August, the First District Court of Appeals ruled that UC had not provided sufficient evidence to justify its “discriminatory policy” of not hiring students who are in the country without legal permission.

That ruling stopped short of overturning the hiring protocol, but the judges ordered UC to reconsider it using proper legal criteria. Instead, UC took the case to the state’s high court, which last week declined to hear the challenge.

Rachel Zaentz, a UC spokesperson, said in a statement Tuesday that the university system is “assessing its options” and that the court’s decision not to review the case “creates serious legal risks for the University and all other state employers in California.”

Under Trump, UC has contended with federal grant suspensions and a White House demand that it pay a $1 billion fine over allegations including antisemitism and the illegal use of race in admission at the Los Angeles campus.

A plaintiff in the case, former UC lecturer Iliana Perez, urged the university system to take the latest court decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

“The California Supreme Court’s decision not only reaffirms that discriminating against undocumented immigrants from accessing on-campus employment cannot continue to be tolerated,” Perez said in a statement Monday to the Los Angeles Times. “But it also gives UC the clarity to finally unlock life-changing opportunities for the thousands of immigrant students who contribute to its campuses, and to the state’s economy and workforce.”

The lawsuit said that without the ability to work, students without legal status struggle to raise the money needed to afford the full cost of their education, including housing. While those students are eligible for state grants and tuition waivers, they are barred from accessing federal grants and loans. That pushes many students to find jobs under the table or in unsafe conditions, advocates have said.

UC argued that hiring students without legal status could expose campus employers to civil or criminal litigation and put at risk the billions of dollars in federal contracts the system receives.

A preliminary audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that, mostly during 2024-2025, multiple states were using the money improperly. California, the biggest culprit, spends over $1.3 billion in federal Medicaid dollars on healthcare for illegal immigrants.

We're actually clawing that money back from those states now, but the fact that that could still happen is very frustrating to all of us,"" Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told Fox Business in late October.

According to CMS, the other states and districts in question, including Illinois, spent the second most (around $30 million). Followed by Oregon, Washington, D.C., and Colorado. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-M.N., said the law prohibits this from happening.

But you know what, you didn't have the verification tools in place to enforce the law so we put the verification in the 'Working Families Tax Cut Act,' also known as the Big, Beautiful Bill,"" Emmer told Fox News Digital last month.

While federal Medicaid money is supposed to be prohibited from being used for illegal immigrants, it can be used by states for emergency treatment, regardless of citizenship or immigration status. But CMS says some Democratic-led states aren't following the law.

""Protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud, and abuse isn’t optional—it’s the law. Every dollar misspent on illegal health care spending is a dollar taken from vulnerable Americans. Federal law forbids using Medicaid funds for illegal immigrants, yet several Democrat-led states did it anyway. The Trump Administration won’t tolerate it. CMS is auditing aggressively, recovering every dollar, and holding states accountable,"" said HHS Press Secretary Emily Hilliard.

We are clawing back that money. We have already gotten hundreds and millions of dollars back which again, proves that states were guilty, or they wouldn't give us the money back otherwise,"" Oz said.

The outcome may affect how public employers respond when staff raise concerns about workplace conduct in public forums.","Mary Joanne Deziel Timmins, who served as general counsel and litigation counsel for Colorado’s Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, alleges she was fired for raising concerns about board members’ conduct. According to her complaint, Timmins discovered that some board members were engaging in what she believed to be corrupt and potentially unlawful behavior, including holding private meetings, using personal emails for district business, and consulting with an outside attorney who was allegedly conflicted.

Timmins says she repeatedly advised the board during executive sessions that these actions could violate Colorado’s open meetings law and risk the district’s attorney-client privilege. She also claims she warned board members to stop using personal emails for official business and to preserve all relevant communications, especially given ongoing litigation.

Despite her warnings, Timmins alleges that board members continued these practices. According to the complaint, some members admitted during depositions to destroying texts and emails related to district business. After her private warnings went unheeded, Timmins says she took her concerns public – speaking at board meetings, talking to reporters, and discussing the issues with local residents. She alleges that she disclosed the board’s alleged violations, the risk to the district’s finances, and what she described as a failure by board members to distinguish between their fiduciary duties and personal interests.

Timmins was later terminated from her position. She filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming she was retaliated against for exercising her First Amendment rights. The district court dismissed her claim, holding that her speech was made pursuant to her official duties as a public employee and therefore not protected by the First Amendment.

On appeal, the Tenth Circuit reversed that decision. The appellate panel found that Timmins’ statements to the press and private citizens, while related to her job, were not part of her official duties as general or litigation counsel. The court emphasized that public employees do not lose First Amendment protection simply because their speech concerns their work, especially when speaking outside the chain of command. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

For HR professionals, especially in the public sector, this case highlights the boundaries between an employee’s official responsibilities and their rights as private citizens. The outcome may affect how public employers respond when staff raise concerns about workplace conduct in public forums.

The court’s decision means Timmins can pursue her claims, but her allegations have not been proven and the case is still ongoing.

The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border.","ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) — The Border Patrol commander leading an immigration crackdown in Chicago applauded his agents’ aggressive tactics that have prompted resident backlash and lawsuits.

From his use of chemical agents to a helicopter raid on an apartment building, Gregory Bovino defended the approach of U.S. Customs and Border Protection as appropriate and necessary for what he says are threats his agents have faced in the nation’s third-largest city.

“I didn’t have any reason to think it would be this bad, but it’s far worse than I ever thought,” Bovino told The Associated Press during a wide-ranging interview between meeting employees at a suburban CBP office and sitting for another deposition in growing litigation over his tactics.

More than 3,200 people with alleged immigration violations have been arrested since “ Operation Midway Blitz ” began in September as part of the Trump administration’s push to target cities with “ sanctuary” immigration policies. What started as a handful of arrests in Latino and immigrant-heavy communities has rippled across the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs, dipping into Indiana.

Bovino spoke to AP as fresh teams were replacing agents who’ve spent two months in Chicago, some directly from a Los Angeles crackdown. He likened officers fanning the region to police working beats, but their mission is to counteract an “invasion” of “criminal illegal aliens,” how Trump administration leaders describe people living in the country without legal permission.

“We’re what I call now sanctuary busters,” he said. “There are no sanctuaries. There will be no sanctuaries.”

Doubling down on chemical agents

Bovino is visible around Chicago, where the sight of Border Patrol agents away from international borders has startled residents.

While keeping his job as head of a Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, along the U.S.-Mexico border, Bovino has done Chicago River boat patrols and led armed agents on a march along the Michigan Avenue shopping district. He’s regularly spotted in daily operations, frequently in Little Village, a Mexican neighborhood with a busy business corridor.

Sightings of agents in and around Chicago draw quick responses by activists and residents who blow whistles and honk horns as some follow CBP vehicles. Agents have increasingly used rubber bullets, pepper balls and CS gas, a synthetic irritant used by police as tear gas.

During one clash in Little Village, Bovino threw a canister of gas toward a crowd he claimed included rioters. The Department of Homeland Security said Bovino was hit with a rock. Bystanders rejected that claim, saying agents deployed gas without warning.

Bovino told the AP that using chemical agents is “far less lethal” than what agents face.

“We use the least amount of force necessary to effect the arrest, we do that,” he said. “If I had more CS gas, I would have deployed it.”

Immigration agents’ tactics are the subject of legal challenges. A judge has required them to wear body cameras and document arrests and forced Bovino into a courtroom. Suburban Broadview, the site of an immigration processing center, has also opened three criminal investigations against federal agents.

Praising a raid that amplified tensions

Agents have made arrests outside courthouses, schools, homes and, increasingly on freeways. On Monday, a half-dozen agents visited a truck stop in Hampshire, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) outside Chicago, to knock on truck cabs and ask drivers if they were U.S. citizens. The operation resembled Border Patrol checkpoints that are common along the Mexican border. The AP witnessed two arrests — an Uzbek man and a Russian driver with a pending asylum application.

Bovino spoke shortly after President Donald Trump endorsed his administration’s use of tear gas and other tactics rarely seen away from the border because “you have to get the people out.”

“I think (the raids) haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by Biden and by Obama,” Trump said in a CBS “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday.

Bovino insists some Chicago residents have thanked him, including during the aftermath of a raid where hundreds of agents stormed an apartment building in the largely Black South Shore neighborhood that’s had an influx of migrants and prompted frequent complaints.

Agents used a Blackhawk helicopter to rappel onto the building and explosives to open doors in a raid that critics called excessive and inhumane.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for investigation into reports that children were zip tied as several U.S. citizens were also held for hours. Federal authorities said they arrested two people with alleged Tren de Aragua street gang connections, along with dozens suspected of violating immigration laws.

Bovino said agency intelligence showed the building was a threat, which prompted the intense approach.

“A lot of people said that was a little too much. Well, exactly how would they intend to get, a safety element onto the roof to make it safe for those going into that apartment or the neighboring buildings?” he said. “I’m proud to say that that went off about as good as it possibly can.”

Bovino said he hasn’t seen evidence of Border Patrol teams having contact with children, despite residents’ accounts and video, including in a neighborhood where people said children preparing for a Halloween parade were exposed to tear gas.

Blaming elected leaders and activists

Bovino’s presence is the topic of frequent angry news conferences in the Democratic stronghold as Pritzker, floated as a potential 2028 presidential contender, and Trump have traded barbs. Pritzker argues that federal agents inflame tensions and that the increased militarization is part of a wider plot to influence elections.

Bovino points the finger at Pritzker, activists and news outlets. He called Pritzker “wildly misinformed” while repeatedly mispronouncing his name during the interview, even after being called out, and took jabs at the governor’s appearance.

In response, Pritzker’s office said Tuesday that the federal government has diverted valuable public safety resources to Bovino’s “publicity stunts aimed at boosting his ego.”

Bovino wouldn’t say when the Chicago operation would wind down or say what city might be the next target, urging the element of surprise.

“We’re going to be in Chicago a good while,” he said. “But you just never know.”

""Her name certainly popped up in an immigration database to show she had a removal order,” said Armstrong.
“So ICE went to detain her at the airport because they knew that’s where she would be.
""Immigrants that are in immigration court have a responsibility to keep their address updated, with the immigration court and with ICE,"" Armstrong said.","SALT LAKE CITY — After a woman was arrested by ICE at the Salt Lake City International Airport last Wednesday, her family is still trying to cope with the shock and are hoping things work out moving forward.

""It makes me very sad because we're human beings and we don't deserve to be treated like that,” said a close family member, too afraid to show her face or publicize her name. ""I think that we don't do anyone any harm. We just go out to earn our daily bread, to earn for our kids. We don't do anything bad, that's against the rules.""

On Thursday, ICE told FOX 13 News that the woman in the video being arrested was 39-year-old Marta Brizeyda Renderos Leiva from El Salvador. She was taken into custody last week after a deportation order from 2020.

“She is a woman who had no idea there was a removal order against her,” said Andy Armstrong, a lawyer from Stowell-Crayk working on Leiva’s case.

Leiva is a single mom to four kids who are U.S. citizens.

""She came here always with the hope that she'd have a better future and help her children advance. She's always been dedicated to her children, an exemplary mother, a good neighbor. We've never had problems with anyone,” said Leiva’s family member.

Leiva was ordered by a judge to be deported after not appearing for a court hearing. Armstrong said the notice for Leiva to appear went to an address where she hasn’t lived. She believes it was sent to the notary who helped with the immigration proceedings a couple of years ago.

""She went to this individual to help her fill out the forms, as many immigrants do, go to these services, and we believe that it was his address that was on the form as his address,” Armstrong said.

Leiva also had a valid work permit, till 2029, that was approved in 2024. Her lawyer thought she had all the documents needed, but she was flagged at the airport.

""Her name certainly popped up in an immigration database to show she had a removal order,” said Armstrong. “So ICE went to detain her at the airport because they knew that’s where she would be. Now we know they didn’t choose the airport because they just simply didn’t want to go to their house — they didn’t have a record of where her house was.”

We reached out to ICE and they said she was arrested in a targeted enforcement operation because of that deportation order and her remaining in the United States.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would have been the ones to grant the work permit, and they could not be reached for comment.

Her attorney stressed that it's up to people to make sure their details are updated to try to avoid situations like these.

""Immigrants that are in immigration court have a responsibility to keep their address updated, with the immigration court and with ICE,"" Armstrong said. ""But they have to know that they have a responsibility, and she did not know that and she never knew her case had been transferred over to ICE.""

The lawyers filed a motion to reopen Leiva's case and give her due process.

Monday, Dec. 1

Cox Communications v. Sony Music Entertainment

In this case Cox Communications, Inc., one of the country’s largest internet service providers, squares off against several of the nation’s largest record companies and music publishers.

According to the underlying lawsuits, over a two-year period, 2013 and 2014, a large number of Cox’s internet subscribers used peer-to-peer file-sharing networks, such as BitTorrent, to download and distribute copyrighted songs owned by the plaintiffs.

In a bid to crack down on this activity, the Recording Industry Association of America and its affiliated record labels, hired a company called MarkMonitor to track illegal file sharing and notify internet service providers when infringement was detected.

MarkMonitor sent Cox over 163,000 notices of infringement during the relevant period.

In response, Cox instituted a so-called “thirteen-strike” policy, under which it warned or temporarily suspended subscribers after repeated notices.

The record companies maintain this policy did little to nothing to deter the behavior they wanted to stop. In fact, they noted, Cox rarely terminated service for copyright infringement, while regularly terminating service for nonpayment.

Fed up, the record companies sued Cox, alleging that the ISP was secondarily liable for copyright infringement occurring on its network.

Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed Cox either intentionally contributed to or benefited from its subscribers’ infringements by failing to take adequate steps to stop it, thereby inducing or materially contributing to the unlawful acts.

A federal court in Virginia denied Cox statutory safe harbor under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and allowed the case to proceed to trial on theories of vicarious and contributory copyright infringement.

The jury found Cox liable on both counts and awarded $1 billion in statutory damages.

On appeal, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the jury’s finding of willful contributory infringement, reversed the vicarious liability verdict, and vacated the damages award, remanding the case for a new trial on damages.

The justices are being asked to determine whether the 4th Circuit erred in holding that mere knowledge of another’s direct infringement suffices to find willfulness under the pertinent law, 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)?

Urias-Orellana v. Bondi, Atty. Gen.

Douglas Humberto Urias-Orellana, a Salvadoran citizen, fled to the United States with his wife and minor child after facing threats from a local hitman.

The violence began in 2016 when the hitman shot and seriously injured Urias-Orellana’s two half-brothers in separate incidents. He then vowed to kill their entire family.

Over the next several years, Urias-Orellana was repeatedly threatened at gunpoint by masked men demanding money and warning they would harm him as they did his brothers. In December 2020, he was physically assaulted in his hometown, with the attackers striking him three times in the chest.

To escape these threats, Urias-Orellana and his family relocated multiple times within El Salvador. They lived peacefully in some locations for extended periods but encountered problems when returning to areas near his hometown.

After learning that his attackers were searching for him in early 2021, the family entered the United States without authorization in June 2021. They applied for asylum based on persecution of their family group, with Urias-Orellana also seeking protection under the Convention Against Torture.

An Immigration judge denied their applications, finding the harm they said they’d experienced did not constitute persecution and that they could safely relocate within El Salvador. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed.

That led to a petition for review before the 1st U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals, which the court denied, upholding the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision on all claims.

The question presented to the justices is whether a federal court of appeals must defer to the Board of Immigration Appeals’s judgment that a given set of undisputed facts does not demonstrate mistreatment severe enough to constitute “persecution.”

Tuesday, Dec. 2

First Choice Women’s Resource Centers, Inc. v. Platkin

This case asks the court to determine whether a religious nonprofit can challenge a state attorney general’s subpoena in federal court, or if it must first exhaust state court remedies.

The underlying litigation stems from the New Jersey attorney general’s decision to serve an investigatory subpoena on First Choice, a faith-based pregnancy center, demanding that it turn over most of its donor’s names.

First Choice challenged the subpoena under 42 U.S.C. 1983 in federal court, and the attorney general filed a subsequent suit to enforce it in state court.

The state court granted the attorney general’s motion to enforce the subpoena but expressly did not decide First Choice’s federal constitutional challenges.

The attorney general then moved in state court to sanction First Choice. Meanwhile, the district court held that First Choice’s constitutional claims were not ripe in federal court.

The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in a divided per curiam decision, holding that the center could litigate its constitutional claims in state court.

In doing so, the majority followed the rule of the 5th Circuit and split from the 9th Circuit. It did not address the likely loss of a federal forum once the state court rules on the federal constitutional issues.

Wednesday, Dec. 3

Olivier v. City of Brandon

Gabriel Olivier was an evangelical Christian who regularly preached in public using signs and loudspeakers to convey religious messages.

Beginning in 2018, one of his favorite places to evangelize was the sidewalk outside the Brandon Amphitheater, a city-owned venue in Brandon, Mississippi.

But in 2019, the city enacted an ordinance requiring protestors during live events to remain in a designated protest area, restricting use of loudspeakers and prohibiting non-handheld signs.

In May 2021, Olivier returned to the Amphitheater during a concert to preach and was ordered by the police chief to move to the protest area.

Olivier left, but returned a short time later, and was given a citation for violating the ordinance. He pleaded no contest in municipal court, paid a fine, and did not appeal the conviction.

A short time later, Olivier filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, seeking damages and an injunction to prevent future enforcement of the ordinance.

In doing so, he said it violated his First and 14th Amendment rights.

The district court held that his claims were barred by the doctrine established in Heck v. Humphrey because success on them would necessarily undermine his prior conviction.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, modifying the dismissal to be with prejudice only until the conditions set by Heck were met.

The issue has created a split between the circuit courts.

Monday, Dec. 8

Trump, President of the United States v. Slaughter

Rebecca Kelly Slaughter was serving as a commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, when President Donald Trump fired her and explained his decision was based on his belief her continued service was “inconsistent with [the] administration’s priorities.”

This reason violated the standard for dismissal under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which limits the president’s ability to remove an FTC commissioner to “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”

Slaughter sued Trump and the three remaining FTC Commissioners, arguing her removal was unlawful because the president failed to offer a valid statutory cause.

The district court ruled in favor of Slaughter, declaring her removal unlawful, ordering her reinstatement, and issuing a permanent injunction against the remaining commissioners and their subordinates, barring them from interfering with her duties.

The administration appealed the decision and requested a stay of the district court’s order pending the appeal.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal and dissolved an administrative stay that had been previously entered.

The Supreme Court granted the stay in September, at the same time it said it would hear the case on an expedited basis.

The justices will decide whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers.

At the same time, they’ve been asked to consider whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.

Tuesday, Dec. 9

NRSC V. FEC

This dispute began three years ago when two Republican party committees joined then-Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and then-Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, in suing the Federal Election Commission.

In their complaint, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee claimed the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 unconstitutionally restricts their ability to coordinate campaign advertising with their own candidates.

They said such coordination is crucial to enabling the party and its candidates to unify their political message and spend money more efficiently.

While the plaintiffs acknowledge that the Supreme Court’s decision in the 2001 case FEC v. Colorado upheld this limit, they argue that subsequent events have rendered that ruling obsolete and say it should be overturned.

Specifically, they cite changes in campaign finance law, the rise of “Super PACs,” and shifts in the Supreme Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence as factors supporting their position.

Following the act’s rule for constitutional challenges, a federal judge in Ohio certified the question and sent it on to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard the case en banc.

The 6th Circuit held that the act’s limits on coordinated campaign expenditures do not violate the First Amendment. The justices have been tasked with deciding whether the 6th Circuit got it right.

Wednesday, Dec. 10

Hamm v. Smith

Joseph Clifton Smith was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Alabama. However, years later, he filed a federal habeas corpus petition, seeking to overturn his death sentence on grounds that he is intellectually disabled and therefore cannot be executed under the Eighth and 14th Amendments.

The critical issue presented by his petition was whether he met the well-established three-prong test for intellectual disability.

These are whether he exhibited:

Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.

Significant deficits in adaptive behavior, and

The manifestation of these qualities before age 18.

Smith was subjected to multiple IQ tests that revealed scores ranging from 72 to 78 — all within or near the range associated with intellectual disability when the standard error of measurement was taken into account.

After extensive evidentiary hearings featuring competing expert testimony about both Smith’s IQ scores and his adaptive functioning deficits, a federal judge found Smith intellectually disabled, and the court vacated his death sentence.

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, but the Supreme Court granted certiorari and remanded the case, asking the appellate to clarify whether its ruling relied solely on the lower end of Smith’s IQ score range or on a broader analysis of all evidence.

On remand, the 11th Circuit explained that it based its decision on the latter, and that it believed it found “consistent evidence” that Smith “may” qualify as mildly disabled.

The Supreme Court will consider whether courts evaluating multiple IQ scores must find that every valid score of “about” 75 or less supports a so-called “Atkins claim.”

An Atkins claim is a legal argument made by a defendant in a capital case that they have an intellectual disability and cannot be sentenced to death because of the Supreme Court’s 2002 ruling in Atkins v. Virginia.

The claim is based on the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The Atkins decision established that executing individuals with intellectual disabilities is unconstitutional.

FS Credit Opportunities Corp. v. Saba Capital Master Fund

Investment vehicles organized as closed-end mutual funds under Maryland law adopted so-called “control share provisions” that stripped voting rights from shareholders who owned 10% or more of a fund’s shares.

These provisions were adopted in response to an activist investor, Saba Capital, which had been acquiring large positions in underperforming closed-end funds.

Saba Capital’s investment strategy was predicated on creating greater shareholder value by electing new directors who would then advocate for share buybacks.

In order to fulfill this strategy, Saba Capital sued 16 closed-end funds in June 2023, seeking rescission of these control share provisions.

It argued in its complaint that the provisions violated the Investment Company Act, which requires that “every share of stock shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding stock.”

A federal judge in New York granted summary judgment in favor of Saba against eleven of the funds, dismissing five of the cases due to forum selection clauses requiring that lawsuits be filed in Maryland.

In doing so the court said control share provisions violated the ICA’s equal voting rights mandate. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later affirmed the decision.

With that ruling, appellate courts have now split 2-1 over whether Congress created an implied private right of action in Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act.

The 3rd and 9th Circuits, relying on statutory text and structure, have held that Section 47(b) does not create an implied private right of action, and a panel of the 4th Circuit has agreed in an unpublished opinion.

Only the 2nd Circuit — where plaintiffs may be able to sue most investment funds subject to the ICA, given New York’s and the New York Stock Exchange’s roles in financial operations — has held the opposite view, based on an “inference”: parties may bring a lawsuit under Section 47(b), even though Congress never said so.

The question presented to the justices is whether Section 47(b) of the act, creates an implied private right of action.

The Statue of Liberty welcomes new Americans who are yearning for freedom, no matter where they come from or the color of their skin. The Trump administration wants to change that.

The administration is reportedly(link is external) overhauling the U.S. refugee system to place English speakers, white South Africans and Europeans at the front of the line. Gutting the refugee program—at a time when violence across the world is reaching the highest levels(link is external) since World War II—is a choice that will inevitably endanger millions of people.

In other words, President Donald Trump wants to rewrite the message at the base of the Statue of Liberty to say: “White people only.”

This betrays everything America stands for.

Since its founding, the United States has provided refuge for people fleeing violence and persecution. Our country has been built by immigrants, refugees, dreamers and fighters—people who came here driven by hope and the belief that a better life was possible.

For many in our community, the refugee program was a lifeline. Thousands of Vietnamese, Hmong, Cambodian, Laotian and Burmese refugees sacrificed everything to reach America’s shores. They did not choose to leave their homes. They were forced to—escaping with just the clothes on their backs and the courage to rebuild their lives in a foreign land.

Yet these refugees never lost faith in the promise of America. Despite the language barriers, cultural differences and economic hardships, they carried an unbreakable spirit and refused to be defined by what they had lost. Instead, they defined themselves by the opportunities America presented, opening businesses, serving in our military and working tirelessly to build a better future for their families. Their contributions can be seen in every corner of society today.

This is the American dream come to life.

To suggest that some refugees are more “deserving” of safety and opportunity is to erase the contributions of millions of refugees who have given back to America many times over.

This is coming from the same administration that wants to end birthright citizenship, a constitutionally protected right that has been upheld by the Supreme Court for over a century. Birthright citizenship is one of the most common pathways for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to become U.S. citizens. It is how I, the daughter of immigrants, became a U.S. citizen and now serve in the halls of Congress.

But now these immigration pathways are under attack via a coordinated effort to redefine who counts as an American. And make no mistake: these decisions will have far-reaching consequences for the Asian American and Pacific Islander community, 65 percent(link is external) of whom were born outside this country.

We have gone down this troubling path before. The administration’s actions harken back to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, when Chinese immigrants were banned from entering the United States and those living in the U.S. were denied citizenship. It set a precedent to further restrict immigration for other Asians seeking entry into our country, including for Japanese, Koreans and Filipinos.

This is not the America our parents and grandparents dreamt of.

We cannot let the Trump administration redefine who gets to be American. We cannot let them erase decades of sacrifice and success from refugees who have strengthened this country.

It is our duty to preserve the America that welcomed our families with open arms. That promise is still alive, and we must live up to it.",https://capac.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 12:05:17.173118
,Litigation,2025-11-04 16:37:10+00:00,Constitutional Accountability Center,The other arguments in Trump's tariffs case - Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/news/the-other-arguments-in-trumps-tariffs-case/,"Congress passed that law (and not IEEPA) to give the power the president to deal with trade deficits, the brief says.
Therefore, the brief contends, Trump must comply with the restrictions that the Trade Act imposes, which limits tariffs to 15% and 150 days.
The history of U.S. trade law is at the center of many of the briefs filed with the court.
“The notion that Congress delegated the power to impose unbounded, devastating tariffs that could completely restructure international relations through the phrase ‘regulate .
Trump’s executive orders imposing the tariffs, the group says, are contrary to that intent.","Certain briefs concentrate on the text of IEEPA.

A brief on behalf of a group of 207 members of Congress (including Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska) tells the justices that IEEPA does not give the president the power to impose the tariffs. The Trump administration’s “interpretation of IEEPA,” they say, “would effectively nullify the guardrails set forth in every statute in which Congress expressly granted the President limited tariff authority—a result Congress did not intend.”

A brief from Jill Homan, the deputy director of the America First Policy Institute, a nonprofit conservative think tank, argues the opposite: that IEEPA gives the president power to impose tariffs. Specifically, Homan contends that Congress’ grant to the president in IEEPA the power to “regulate … importation” “includes the power to impose tariffs because tariffs have been used throughout American history as a common tool for regulating commerce, and they have been imposed specifically on imported goods.” But in any event, she continues, the Supreme Court should interpret the phrase “regulate … importation” expansively in light of the larger context of IEEPA, which “include[s] broad, sweeping powers.”

A brief from BRB Management, which describes itself as “a small business that operates retail stores directly affected by tariffs and related trade policies,” focuses on a different part of IEEPA: its grant of authority only to “regulate … importation” of “any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” The company contends that at the point where tariffs are imposed on goods, they generally are owned by U.S. buyers – and therefore are not owned by foreign countries or foreign citizens.

Other briefs focus on different laws that, they say, could justify the tariffs.

America First Policy Institute, which describes itself as “a non-profit, non-partisan research institute” dedicated to putting “the American people first,” tells the justices that the president has the power under a different law – the Tariff Act of 1930 – to impose the tariffs at the center of this case. Section 338 of that law, the group explains, gives the president the power to impose tariffs of up to 50% if he determines “that any foreign country places any burden or disadvantage” on U.S. commerce “directly or indirectly, by law or administrative regulation or practice, by or in respect to any customs, … charge, exaction, classification, regulation, condition, restriction, or prohibition.” And it doesn’t matter, the group says, that Trump did not rely on this provision in his executive orders imposing the tariffs.

Erica Hashimoto, the director of the Georgetown University Law Center’s Appellate Litigation Clinic, filed a brief on behalf of a group of trade scholars arguing that a different trade law – Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 – applies to the tariffs at issue in this case. Congress passed that law (and not IEEPA) to give the power the president to deal with trade deficits, the brief says. Therefore, the brief contends, Trump must comply with the restrictions that the Trade Act imposes, which limits tariffs to 15% and 150 days.

The history of U.S. trade law is at the center of many of the briefs filed with the court.

A brief on behalf of a group of former national and economic security officials argues that IEEPA does not give the president the power that he claims to impose these tariffs. Instead, the officials contend, “IEEPA continued (but narrowed) the authority that its predecessor, the [Trading with the Enemy Act], granted the President to impose sanctions and embargoes,” and presidents for almost 50 years have interpreted it as such. If the court upholds the tariffs, the officials say, it would “risk[] undermining the ability of this President and future Presidents to use IEEPA, as Congress intended, to address foreign policy crises.”

Carla Anderson Hills, who served as the U.S. Trade Representative during the George H.W. Bush administration, and Alan William Wolff, an international trade lawyer who has served in senior roles in the federal government, tell the justices that Trump’s use of IEEPA “as a means for correcting trade deficits conflicts with “the United States’ systematic and unbroken practice of implementing trade laws since the ratification of the U.S. Constitution.” Because it is not clear whether IEEPA gives the president the power to impose the tariffs, they argue, that practice should “carry substantial weight.” Of note, Hills and Wolff are represented by Roderick M. Hills, Jr., a professor at New York University’s law school and the son of Carla Anderson Hills.

Aditya Bamzai, a law professor at the University of Virginia Law School, filed a brief in support of neither party in which he argues that Congress enacted the Trading with the Enemy Act, the predecessor to IEEPA, against a backdrop in which “the use of a ‘tax’ or ‘fee’ was an appropriate method to regulate trade with the enemy under the classic laws of war.” And when Congress passed the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the law on which Trump relied in imposing the tariffs, it included the same phrase – “regulate … importation” – found in IEEPA. Therefore, he writes, “that language is best read to have the same meaning that it had when used in the TWEA before the passage of the IEEPA.”

The Constitutional Accountability Center, which describes itself in the brief as “a think tank and public interest law firm dedicated to fulfilling the progressive promise of the Constitution’s text and history,” contends that Congress’ enactment of IEEPA “reflects a deliberate severing of peacetime emergency powers from their war powers origins,” “undermining any inference that Congress silently included the extraordinary power to impose tariffs within IEEPA’s regulatory authorities.”

A group of tax law professors argues that Congress, rather than the president, should determine tariffs. This conclusion, they say in their brief, is supported by early U.S. history. The Framers of the Constitution believed that duties on imports were likely to be an important source of revenue for the new country, and they designed the Constitution so that “divisive questions” like “taxation and foreign imports” “would be settled by a large, representative, and deliberative legislature—not by a single Executive.”

The Cato Institute, which describes itself in its brief as “a nonpartisan public-policy research foundation … dedicated to advancing the principles of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government,”points to history to argue that “Congress knows how to give the President discretion—within limits—to modify tariff rates.” Moreover, Cato contends, whatever the phrase “regulate … importation” might have meant in the context of the Trading With the Enemy Act, “the historical record and this Court’s separation of powers precedents” suggest that in IEEPA Congress did not intend to give the president the power to impose tariffs in peacetime.

Several briefs focus on whether the tariffs violate either the “major questions” doctrine – the idea that if Congress wants to give the executive branch the power to make decisions of vast economic or political significance, it must say so explicitly – or the nondelegation doctrine, the idea that Congress generally cannot delegate its lawmaking powers.

The state of California and Gov. Gavin Newsom argue that nothing about the text, context, or history of IEEPA gives any sign that Congress intended to give the president the power to impose tariffs. This conclusion is also supported by the major questions doctrine, they say in their brief. “The notion that Congress delegated the power to impose unbounded, devastating tariffs that could completely restructure international relations through the phrase ‘regulate . . . importation,’ in the context of a list of seven other verbs and eleven other objects, cannot be squared with the major-questions doctrine (or any other interpretive principle).”

A brief on behalf of 31 former federal judges appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents argues first that if the president did have the power under IEEPA to impose the tariffs it would violate the nondelegation doctrine because the law does not provide the president with any standards to guide him. Moreover, the judges say, courts can review the president’s determination that there is an “unusual and extraordinary” threat that triggers IEEPA. That, they contend, “is a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation” and “the type of determination that federal judges make every day.”

A group of nonprofits and academics, led by Advancing American Freedom, a group founded by former Vice President Mike Pence, tells the justices that if IEEPA does give the president the power to impose these tariffs, “it would violate the nondelegation doctrine because … IEEPA does not contain an intelligible principle to guide either the President’s declaration of an emergency or his implementation of tariffs.”

A brief in support of the Trump administration from the American Center for Law and Justice, which describes itself as “an organization dedicated to the defense of constitutional liberties secured by law,” emphasizes that, under the Constitution, the president has primary responsibility for foreign affairs. In IEEPA, the ACLJ writes, Congress gave the president broad emergency power, reflecting its “recognition that international economic crises require rapid, coordinated responses that only unified executive action can provide.” And the major questions doctrine does not apply in this case, the group says, because “foreign affairs present fundamentally different considerations” from the kinds of cases involving “domestic regulatory overreach by unelected administrators” that the doctrine was designed to address.

Consumer Watchdog, a group that describes itself as a “non-profit, non-partisan public interest organization dedicated to protecting consumers from economic harm,” argues that Trump’s tariffs violate the nondelegation doctrine. Trump, the group says, contends “that IEEPA silently gives him” “immense power.” But the tariffs are not linked to “any limits or conditions in IEEPA – and everything determined by the unfettered choices of the President.” That, the group says, runs afoul of the requirement that, if Congress delegates its authority, it must provide an “intelligible principle” to guide the exercise of that authority.

Some briefs focus on, among other things, where the challenges to the tariffs should be filed.

A brief supporting the Trump administration from two members of Congress – Reps. Darrell Issa and Brian Mast – as well as America First Legal Foundation, a nonprofit law firm co-founded by Stephen Miller, and the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which describes itself as “the only national non-profit organization representing exclusively domestic producers across many sectors and industries of the U.S. economy,” argues that the court should issue its decision in the case brought by V.O.S. Selections, rather than Learning Resources. This is so, the brief argues, because IEEPA “authorizes embargoes for reasons other than public safety” – which brings lawsuits arising out of IEEPA under the purview of the Court of International Trade.

A brief filed on behalf of several small businesses, led by Emily Ley Paper, that are challenging the tariffs in their own litigation, as well as the New Civil Liberties Alliance, argues that the text of IEEPA is clear, and it does not give the president the authority that he claims to impose tariffs. Because IEEPA does not address tariffs, the brief continues, the district court in Washington – rather than the Court of International Trade – has the power to hear the disputes over the tariffs.

Some briefs supporting the challengers touch on the effects (or lack thereof) of the court’s decision.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Consumer Technology Association state that, as a result of the tariffs, “businesses have been forced to raise prices, freeze hiring, and postpone investments”; moreover, they add, “for all businesses and investors, the President’s claimed authority to impose, modify, pause, and remove tariffs under IEEPA at the drop of a hat is resulting in chaos and uncertainty.” Finally, they warn that if the court upholds the president’s authority, future administrations “will have similarly expansive authority to impose worldwide tariffs based on their own objectives.”

A brief on behalf of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, which describes itself as “a non-partisan research and educational organization dedicated to showing Americans how taxes, government spending, and regulations affect everyday life,” focuses largely on the facts underlying the case and the effects of a ruling for the challengers. The group contends that “trade deficits are not a sudden or unexpected development, and are in fact a routine and ordinary event, the opposite of an emergency. The U.S. has run trade deficits continually for 49 years.” Moreover, the group add, a ruling from the Supreme Court that strikes down the tariffs would not be “catastrophic,” as the government has suggested, but would instead “simply return us to the comparatively low level of tariffs that were in place at the start of the year.”

A group of government officials, legislators, labor unions, and businesses from Washington partly focus in their brief on the effects of the tariffs (as well as the uncertainty surrounding them) on the state. Among other things, they note, “Washington’s economy is projected to suffer a net loss of $8.1 billion in output sales between 2025 and 2029,” and the state could lose as many as 32,000 jobs. “Should the President’s tariffs remain in place,” they write, “Washingtonians will see higher prices for food (16% higher cumulatively over two years); higher prices for clothes and shoes (around 7% in the next year); and higher prices for cars (a 20-25% rise for used cars over two years and a 6% rise for new cars).”

A brief from the American Watch Association, the U.S. trade association for the watch industry, tells the justices about the effects of the tariffs on the industry. It explains that “watchmaking is a globally integrated industry that depends upon longstanding specialty manufacturers abroad” – and in particular, in Switzerland and Japan – “for essential watch components” that cannot be obtained in the United States. As a result, the group says, the industry’s costs have increased, and members of the trade association “are already being forced to lay off employees, close storefronts, or increase consumer prices.” Moreover, they add, because of “the unusually high startup costs for precision manufacturing, there is no realistic prospect that the President’s tariff program will spur the creation of new manufacturing jobs in the United States.”

Several briefs address other arguments related to trade law and the president’s power.

A brief filed on behalf of former federal judges, government officials, and members of Congress argues that when Congress wants to give the president the power to impose tariffs, it does so clearly. But in any event, the brief continues, the president cannot rely on IEEPA to impose tariffs to address trade deficits because “trade imbalances that have persisted every year since IEEPA was enacted in 1977 cannot count as an ‘unusual and extraordinary threat.’”

A brief on behalf of 13 former U.S. military, national security, and foreign policy officials argues that federal courts can and should review whether the president has properly invoked the National Emergencies Act and IEEPA. And here, the officials contend, he has not done so: although Trump invoked “the alleged threats posed by the trade deficit and lack of international cooperation on opioid trafficking,” “these are persistent, longstanding issues, not ‘unusual and extraordinary’ threats.”

A brief on behalf of a wide-ranging group that includes constitutional scholars, legal historians, and former U.S. senators urges the court to “reaffirm the basic principle that Congress, not the President, holds the power to tax and to make major trade policy. Emergencies,” the group writes, “do not erase that principle, and the government cannot through the back door smuggle tariff authority into a statute that deliberately does not authorize it by invoking ‘foreign affairs’ or imagining the power to ‘regulate’ as including the power to tax.”

Law professor Vikram Amar and former member of Congress Mickey Edwards argue that when Congress delegates broad power to the president, it can be difficult for Congress to reclaim that power because the president can veto any legislation that Congress passes to do so. Courts should keep this in mind, Amar and Edwards contend, when determining whether – as in this case – a law delegates the kind of expansive powers that the president has claimed, and instead should read IEEPA narrowly. If the Supreme Court is wrong, they say, “there is a relatively easy fix: Congress can pass a new bill by simple majority and the President will almost certainly sign it into law.”

The Brennan Center for Justice, which describes itself as an “an independent, nonpartisan law and policy organization,” contends that the National Emergencies Act, a 1976 law that governs the president’s exercise of emergency powers, and IEEPA were intended to limit the president’s use of emergency powers. Trump’s executive orders imposing the tariffs, the group says, are contrary to that intent.

Lauren Boebert at a Halloween party has drawn criticism over the Colorado congresswoman’s Mexican-themed costume, which included a sombrero, a dress and a sign that made light of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
Tell me if juicy ICE coming,” an apparent pun on “Tell me if you see ICE coming.” ICE is an acronym for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The 4th District also includes populous Douglas County.
Trisha Calvarese, a Democrat who lost to Boebert last fall for the 4th District seat and is running again to represent the district in 2026, condemned the congresswoman over the weekend.
“Lauren Boebert put more effort into a hateful Halloween party costume than she ever has into serving the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District,” Calvarese said on X.","A photo of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert at a Halloween party has drawn criticism over the Colorado congresswoman’s Mexican-themed costume, which included a sombrero, a dress and a sign that made light of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

The photo was circulated on social media over the weekend. The Republican is dressed in what appears to be a traditional Mexican outfit, of sorts, and is holding a sign with a message that uses a racist play on words invoking a stereotyped Mexican accent.

The sign reads: “Mexican Word of the Day: Juicy. Tell me if juicy ICE coming,” an apparent pun on “Tell me if you see ICE coming.” ICE is an acronym for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Standing near her in the photo is a man dressed as an ICE agent.

The costume drew condemnation from Latino advocacy groups in Colorado.

“She should be ashamed of herself,” said Stacy Suniga, the president of the Latino Coalition of Weld County. “Though I believe she is incapable of any emotion that generates human decency. Her bigotry and ignorance are clearly evident in her chosen apparel this day.”

Boebert represents a part of Weld County in the 4th Congressional District. According to the Colorado Redistricting Commission, the ruby red Eastern Plains-centered district was at least 14% or so Latino as of the 2020 census — having the lowest Latino representation among the state’s eight congressional districts. The 4th District also includes populous Douglas County.

Boebert has generated headlines before for charged commentary and personal behavior that has proven embarrassing — enough to where she apologized for her words and actions.

Not this time. When asked about the Halloween photo, Boebert said through a spokesperson that “it’s a Halloween costume.”

She did not answer several questions put to her office by The Denver Post about the photo, instead lambasting Democrats for repeatedly voting against a short-term spending bill, called a continuing resolution, that would end the federal government shutdown.

“Tell our Senators to vote for the CR and open the government,” she said. “They are choosing to let millions of American families suffer.”

Four years ago, Boebert apologized after a video circulated on X, the social media platform then known as Twitter, of her implying that Rep. Ilhan Omar, a fellow member of Congress and a Muslim, could be a suicide bomber. She also apologized for her behavior during a performance of the “Beetlejuice” musical in Denver in September 2023, when she was caught vaping, groping her date and flipping off Buell Theatre staff after they asked her to leave.

Trisha Calvarese, a Democrat who lost to Boebert last fall for the 4th District seat and is running again to represent the district in 2026, condemned the congresswoman over the weekend.

“Lauren Boebert put more effort into a hateful Halloween party costume than she ever has into serving the people of Colorado’s 4th Congressional District,” Calvarese said on X.

State Sen. Julie Gonzales, co-chair of the Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus, called on Boebert to apologize and said she “should know that our culture is not a costume and being bilingual is an asset, not a joke.”

“The Latino Caucus was made aware of the photo on Saturday and members were outraged,” Gonzales wrote to The Post on Monday. “We immediately began conversations within our caucus of how we wanted to respond. … Congresswoman Boebert chose to mock our community, co-opt our culture, and make a sick joke while immigrant Coloradans with lawful immigration status in her own district, such as fifth-grade teacher Marina Ortiz, are being detained by ICE after doing everything that has been asked of them.”

She was referring to an incident late last month in which Ortiz, who teaches at Global Village Academy in Parker, was detained along with her family during a check-in appointment at an ICE field office. The school said she had legal authorization to live and work in the United States.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TDP-Z-boebert-halloween-01.jpg?w=1024&h=1027,N,,2025-11-04 13:02:25.768126

The Department of Agriculture announced that it will tap into a contingency fund to provide only half of the benefits under SNAP, the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Democratic Congressmember Rashida Tlaib said, “It shouldn’t take a court order to get the president to stop starving families and release the funds.” On Monday, Republican Senator John Barrasso blocked a Democratic bill demanding full funding for SNAP benefits. About one in eight U.S. residents get an average of $187 a month in food benefits from the government. This is Jessica Alicea, a SNAP recipient in Virginia.

In labor news, several major U.S. companies have announced layoffs affecting tens of thousands of workers. Amazon said it would eliminate about 14,000 corporate jobs, with Reuters reporting that number could more than double, as artificial intelligence tools increasingly replace white-collar workers. Meanwhile, Target announced plans to cut 1,800 corporate jobs, General Motors said it’s cutting over 3,300 electric vehicle jobs, and Paramount began laying off 2,000 workers following the media conglomerate’s merger with Skydance. Meanwhile, shipping giant UPS said it had eliminated some 48,000 jobs this year. Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the second consecutive meeting, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned of a weakening labor market. The Fed’s decision came in the absence of key data on inflation and employment due to the government shutdown.

Former Vice President Dick Cheney has died at the age of 84. Beginning in 1978, Cheney served six terms as Wyoming’s lone U.S. congressmember, where he voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa and against a holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. He left Congress in 1989 to serve as defense secretary under President George H.W. Bush, overseeing the first Gulf War and the bloody U.S. invasion of Panama that deposed leader and former U.S. ally Manuel Noriega, while killing hundreds of people. From 1995 to 2000, Cheney served as chair and CEO of the oil services company Halliburton, before George W. Bush tapped him as his running mate. As vice president, Cheney was a key architect of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq under the false pretext of preventing Saddam Hussein from developing weapons of mass destruction. The invasion led to more than 650,000 deaths, according to a study by The Lancet. As the occupation of Iraq foundered, Cheney argued for the “Salvador option” of using death squads similar to U.S.-supported paramilitaries in El Salvador and other Central American countries in the 1980s. Dick Cheney steadfastly defended the use of torture against detainees of the so-called war on terror. This is Cheney speaking to “Meet the Press” just days after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.

Vice President Dick Cheney: “We also have to work, though, sort of the dark side, if you will. We’ve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world. A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly, without any discussion, using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies, if we’re going to be successful.”

We’ll have more on Vice President Dick Cheney’s life and legacy later in the broadcast.

In Sudan, the U.N.'s migration agency says more than 36,000 people have fled El Fasher since the city was seized by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces last week, after 18 months under siege. Displaced families were forced to walk to the neighboring town of Tawila, which is already sheltering more than 650,000 people forced out of their homes. Survivors described streets littered with corpses and families separated by violence, with those displaced forced to trek for days without food or water. This comes as famine grips El Fasher and the town of Kadugli, according to a report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world's leading authority on food crises. Famine is also threatening to spread to 20 other areas in the Darfur region and central Sudan’s Kordofan region, as fighting between the Sudanese government and the RSF rages on. Meanwhile, the RSF has vowed to take over the city of el-Obeid in central Sudan, currently under control by the Sudanese army.

Israel is continuing to intensify its attacks across Gaza, further violating the U.S.-brokered truce that went into effect on October 10. Al Jazeera reports Israeli forces have demolished homes and residential buildings in Gaza City as Palestinian families still don’t have access to enough food, clean water, medicines or safe shelter with winter approaching. There are an estimated 75,000 displaced people sheltering in overcrowded UNRWA-run buildings, damaged by Israeli attacks, while tens of thousands of others are living in makeshift refugee camps in Gaza or amid the rubble of what was once their homes. This is a displaced Palestinian man in Khan Younis.

Ehab Hussein: “Today the basic necessities aren’t available. Meat isn’t available, and chicken isn’t, either. As for the situation of vegetables, today it’s unpredictable. Sometimes prices go up, sometimes they go down. The situation is hard. We can’t bear it. We’re living in tents. All our lives we’ve prayed for winter rain, but today we hope winter doesn’t come, because we will be humiliated in tents.”

Israel has released the bodies of another 45 Palestinians after Hamas returned the remains of three Israeli soldiers. As of Monday, Israel has handed over the bodies of at least 270 Palestinians since the U.S.-backed Gaza deal went into effect last month. Israel has also released another five Palestinians in Israeli prison custody; the men were taken to Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir el-Balah for medical care. Many of the bodies and Palestinian captives released by Israel show signs of torture and abuse. It is estimated that Israel still holds the remains of about 1,500 Palestinians from Gaza.

This all comes as fallout continues following the arrest of a former top lawyer of the Israeli military for her role in the leak of surveillance video that showed Israeli soldiers gang-raping a Palestinian prisoner at the Sde Teiman prison last year. Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was arrested on Sunday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called Israel’s worst PR attack in its history. He’s yet to condemn the rape of the Palestinian prisoner.

In Southern California, advocates are raising more alarm over ICE’s use of force in immigration raids, after agents shot a 25-year-old U.S. citizen in the Los Angeles area as he attempted to warn the federal officers that children would soon gather at a school bus stop where the officers had just pulled over a vehicle. Lawyers for Carlos Jimenez said he was shot while trying to leave the scene and reversed his car in panic. A bullet remains lodged in the back of his right shoulder. Jimenez was then arrested, accused of assaulting an officer, which his lawyers deny. He was released from jail on bond last week as he faces federal charges. The shooting came about a week after ICE agents shot a Mexican immigrant they were attempting to arrest during a botched operation in L.A. late last month.

In more immigration news, two separate courts have ordered the Trump administration not to deport a man who spent 43 years in a Pennsylvania prison for a crime he did not commit. On October 3, 64-year-old Subramanyam Vedam walked free from Huntingdon State Correctional Institution, where he’d been held for over four decades, after his conviction for a 1982 murder was vacated. His freedom came three years after the Pennsylvania Innocence Project uncovered evidence that prosecutors had buried an FBI report that would have exonerated him. He was immediately arrested by ICE agents. Vedam is currently detained at an ICE jail in Alexandria, Louisiana. Vedam came to the U.S. from India with his parents when he was just 9 months old.",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/71/79671/full_hd/hd1-Mamdani-Trump-Cuomo.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 13:57:37.578877

Civil rights and immigration advocacy groups sought to make permanent a District of Columbia District Court’s July injunction that found the Trump administration could not block asylum seekers from making asylum claims — a form of protection extended to those fearing persecution.

A separate appeals panel lifted the lower court’s order, permitting the administration to block asylum seekers while the merits of the case were argued.

The Trump administration cited the 212(f) proclamation and claimed that because there is an “invasion” at the southern border, asylum protections – which were created by Congress – could be denied. The 212(f) proclamation gives the president the authority to suspend entry of migrants under certain circumstances.

Encounters with migrants at the southern border have remained the lowest in years.

Immigration crackdown

The executive order from January fell in line with the president’s immigration crackdown, as he aims to limit immigration in the interior of the country with mass deportations and cease migration to the United States through curbing access to asylum and refugee resettlement.

During Monday’s oral arguments, Department of Justice attorneys on behalf of the Trump administration argued that Trump has the authority to decide who is admissible into the country, regardless if it’s an asylum claim.

The suit was brought on behalf of three organizations by the American Civil Liberties Union, National Immigrant Justice Center, Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, Texas Civil Rights Project, ACLU of the District of Columbia and ACLU of Texas.

Those three organizations are the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. They provide legal services to people seeking asylum and argued that they are unable to do so under Trump’s proclamation.

The judges on the panel included Cornelia T.L. Pillard, Justin R. Walker and J. Michelle Childs.

Former President Barack Obama nominated Pillard and former President Joe Biden nominated Childs. President Donald Trump nominated Walker during his first term.

Trump executive powers

Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said the president’s proclamation was an extension of his executive branch powers.

Ensign argued that the Trump administration views asylum as discretionary, and that the president can “take the steps necessary to make an entry bar effective, including defining consequences for violating it.”

Ensign argued that because the appeals court this summer allowed for the district court’s order to be paused, it means the government is likely to prevail on its argument.

Lee Gelernt of the ACLU argued that the proclamation’s use of 212(f) cannot override asylum law in the Immigration Nationality Act that Congress passed.

“This is an internally coherent statute which Congress has put together the pieces,” Gelernt said of the INA. “And what’s ultimately happening here is that the administration doesn’t like the way Congress has put together the pieces.”

He added that Congress was specific in describing a migrant who would not be allowed to qualify for asylum, such as someone who has ties to terrorism.

“But 212(f) itself cannot override asylum,” Gelernt said.

Ensign also asked the panel of judges, if they decide to allow the lower court’s injunction to go into effect, to give the Trump administration at least two weeks to implement the new policy at the southern border.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/miamitimesonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/11/61171431-caf0-4740-b25c-80bad2150ff5/686c19620c0f3.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-04 15:01:37.950341

One in four arrests nationwide have taken place in Texas, and the state’s numbers have nearly doubled since President Donald Trump returned to office, outpacing every other state, according to new Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained by the Texas Tribune.

Workplace raids on the rise under Trump admin

While Texas is home to the nation’s second-largest undocumented population — more than 1.6 million people of the estimated 13.7 million nationally — immigration attorneys argue local jails have become a direct pipeline to ICE custody.

Under Trump, 60% of detainees have no prior convictions, a sharp rise from the Biden era, and more than half were taken directly from local jails.

David A. Katz, a former assistant U.S. attorney, argued the Trump administration is not focusing on criminals.

“There’s just a focus on undocumented people in general, and that’s why we’ve seen the workplace raids. We’ve seen all of that sort of thing,” Katz said. “He’s gone after the people who are just working for a living, who are here, albeit illegally.”

Attorneys have argued that shift in enforcement priority — from targeting violent offenders to sweeping up non-criminal immigrants — is driving arrest numbers higher in states like Texas and could stretch beyond immigration into voter behavior.

ICE: No plans to target polling sites

In states such as California and New Jersey, immigration advocates say fear of ICE near polling places is keeping some Latino voters home.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, accused the Trump administration of “rolling out enforcement around Election Day.”

“You’ll see that all across this country. I don’t think this; I know this, because we were in those conversations,” Newsom said. “You’re also going to see ICE deployed. You’re going to see these masked men from border patrol also near voting booths and polling places.”

In November 2024, Hobbs responded to a question on whether Arizona’s state police and National Guard would assist with federal immigration enforcement efforts by stating, “What I will unequivocally say is that, as governor, I will not tolerate efforts that are part of misguided policies that harm our communities, that threaten our communities, that terrorize our communities, and Arizona will not take part in those…. We will not be participating in misguided efforts that harm our communities, and I’ve been incredibly clear about that.”

Federal supremacy in immigration matters is established by the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause and codified in the Immigration and Nationality Act in Title 8 of the U.S. Code. These provisions reserve exclusive authority to the federal government for the regulation of admission, removal, and enforcement of immigration laws.

“Governor Hobbs’ apparent refusal to allow state resources to support lawful immigration operations undermines the rule of law and places law enforcement and other innocent lives at risk,” stated Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

The submission – from National Partnership for New Americans, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Detention Watch Network, Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), Latin America Working Group, and others – emphasizes that the first Trump administration’s signature trade deal did not fix rules in NAFTA that destroyed livelihoods, contributing to forced displacement of millions and mass migration.

Together, the groups note that the USMCA review coincides with a troubling escalation in the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant campaign, marked by mass deportations, expanded detention, and militarized enforcement, which ignores how U.S. economic policies have contributed to migration pressures.

The comments outline key recommendations to transform the USMCA, including:

Replacing corporate-dominated advisory committees with a transparent process that centers the voices of migrant, frontline, and labor communities.

Strengthening workers’ rights and their enforcement, including for migrant workers.

Affirming governments’ right to protect small farmers, regulate investment, and ensure food security.

Removing Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) and other corporate privileges that undermine labor and environmental safeguards.

Quotes from signatory organizations:

“As a national network of immigrant and refugee rights organizations, NPNA is proud to support the call for a trade framework that upholds the dignity and rights of workers, families, and communities across borders. For too long, trade policies driven by corporate greed have uprooted communities, deepened inequality, and forced immigrants to live as second-class in societies that have failed to build just trade and immigration systems centered on human dignity.” Nicole Melaku, Executive Director, the National Partnership for New Americans

“Rather than protecting labor rights and the environment, NAFTA and the USMCA traded away the interests of workers in favor of the interests of big business, and freed multinational corporations from public regulation in the northern hemisphere and globally. Workers and unions have been denied legal status, forced to work longer for less pay, and threatened with outsourcing if they did organize for their rights. Global trade must have real benefits for workers and communities. Anything less is simply not sustainable.” Vicki Gass, Executive Director, Latin America Working Group

“At the U.S.-Mexico border, we witness every day how unjust economic systems and failed trade policies uproot families and force migration. Grounded in the call to uphold the dignity of every person, we believe trade and immigration policies must be rewritten to serve the common good. The USMCA review is a crucial opportunity to build an economy that keeps families together, protects communities, and helps address the root causes that compel people to leave their homes in search of survival.” Dylan Corbett, Executive Director, Hope Border Institute",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:05:37.966714

Plaintiffs filed suit alleging that defendant infringed their patent directed to fire wall hanger technology. Following discovery, the court partially granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, holding that defendant was estopped from asserting one of the three prior art references at issue in the proceedings, but that there were “questions of fact concerning whether [defendant] is estopped from asserting” the other two references. Defendant filed a motion to bifurcate the trial into two phases, proposing that the court conduct a bench trial on the estoppel issue, prior to a jury trial on the issues of infringement and invalidity. Plaintiffs opposed the motion. Following briefing, the court granted defendant’s motion, ordering that the trial should be bifurcated, with the issues on PGR estoppel to be decided by the court in a bench trial.

First, the Court noted that district courts routinely decide the application of PGR and IPR estoppel as a matter of law, and stated that “it is appropriate for the Court to resolve the factual disputes regarding PGR [e]stoppel in a bench trial prior to a jury trial on the legal issues.” The Court then turned to the question of whether bifurcation was appropriate here. To decide whether to bifurcate trial, courts consider several factors, including separability of the issues, simplification of discovery and conservation of resources, prejudice to the parties, and juror confusion. The court determined that bifurcation was warranted here. First, a bench trial on PGR estoppel in this case “would not violate the Seventh Amendment because . . . PGR Estoppel is not a common issue with either infringement or invalidity,” involving different witnesses, law, and facts. Second, bifurcation would promote efficiency and aid judicial economy because the Court was already “well-versed in the facts, expert opinions, and law . . . based on the PGR [e]stoppel briefing.” Additionally, a determination on the PGR [e]stoppel issue could also “obviate the need to adjudicate” aspects of defendant’s invalidity counterclaim. Third, any delay caused by bifurcation was small compared to the length of the litigation and was outweighed by the risk of prejudice to defendant from a single jury trial where defendant wasted time and resources arguing invalidity theories that were later mooted. Finally, bifurcation would reduce juror confusion because bifurcation would remove several witnesses and complicated testimony from the jurors’ consideration, allowing them to focus on the issues of infringement and invalidity.

Practice Tip: When involved in parallel proceedings before a district court and the PTAB, parties should consider whether any factual disputes related to PGR or IPR estoppel are better resolved by the court prior to a jury trial on infringement and/or validity. A court may favor bifurcation where it could simplify the trial, particularly where the court has already considered the issue in other briefing.

This was in honor of the Disappeared in America National Weekend of Action.

Over 60 demonstrators gathered together to pray for immigrants being deported or held in detention centers.

Ryan Brown is the wife of Ali who was deported in 2017. He was denied citizenship after their marriage in 2010 because of his asylum case back in 1999.

His case went back and forth in immigration court for decades. Brown said during his time in the U.S. he had legal work authorization, pay taxes, and had a legal drivers’ license.

“He has been gone for 8 years in September and we are working with the immigration law clinic to file waivers to allow his return to the United States. So we are just hoping to make progress on that soon,” she said.

Brown said she attended Sunday’s event to support other families affected by deportation.

She said she still has minimal contact with her husband. He is in a mining area that is not safe, little electricity and water. She said they will go weeks at a time without hearing from him.

“The system is broken. The legal system is broken. People are set up to fail the way things currently run. I am a pretty educated person myself. I have a Master’s degree and I have tried to navigate this system with him for 15 years,” she said.

She said nothing will change until there is an immigration reform to help secure the borders, and provide better assitance for immigrants trying to legally become citizens.

During the prayers, Brown became emotional as she held back tears, holding a sign of her husband.

Reverend Wesley Snedeker is the pastor of the Church of the Isles United Church of Christ of Indian Rock Beach.

“What we want to see is the violations of the human and civil rights of migrants stopped. We want to stop seeing people who are being detained without cause,” Snedeker said. “People who are many people who are trying to follow the process the right way, being detained in immigration courts or outside immigration courts.”

Snedeker also said he wants to ask the system to allow faith communities inside these detention centers to assist with the religious needs not provided for the immigrants.

How to listen to U.S. Supreme Court oral arguments in tariffs case A live audio feed of Supreme Court oral arguments is available online.","Oregon will go in front of the U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 5 to argue against some of President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The lawsuit was originally filed by Oregon and 11 other states in the U.S. Court of International Trade on April 23. It's since been consolidated with cases brought forth by businesses, all of which challenge the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to authorize the tariffs.

The trade court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have both ruled in Oregon's favor, saying the tariffs exceed Trump's authority.

The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court and requested an expedited timeline.

“This case is about the limits of presidential power,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a statement. “The Trump Administration’s attempt to use emergency powers as a back door to raise taxes on American families was never lawful.”

Oregon's Solicitor General Benjamin Gutman will speak for the states.

Oral arguments are scheduled to last 80 minutes.

If the court rules in Oregon's favor, the Trump administration could have to refund $90 billion in tariff revenue, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The tariffs have been a key piece of Trump's second term and removing them ""would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,"" the administration wrote in legal filings.

Trump considered attending the oral arguments and would have been the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He decided against it, writing in a social media post that he did ""not want to distract from the importance of this Decision.""

What is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act?

The crux of the case going before the Supreme Court is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

The 1977 law says the president can impose economic regulations in response to ""any unusual and extraordinary threat"" and has been used previously to put sanctions on other foreign powers.

The courts have so far ruled that IEEPA does not grant Trump the power to issue the tariffs.

Attorneys for the states and federal government will seek to convince the justices that their interpretation of the law is correct.

Oregon's lawsuit asked for the court to strike down the tariffs issued using IEEPA as justification.

Those include the ""trafficking"" tariffs placed on Mexico, China and Canada in February.

Trump declared an emergency and issued the tariffs ""to hold Mexico, Canada, and China accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.""

In April, Trump issued ""reciprocal"" tariffs on most countries, arguing that trade deficits constituted a national emergency under IEEPA.

Tariff lawsuit is one of many Oregon has filed against the Trump administration

Oregon has joined more than 40 lawsuits against the Trump administration since January, but this is the first to go before the country's highest court.

Oregon and Arizona are co-leading the tariff suit for the states. April estimates predicted the tariffs could cost U.S. households $3,800 annually and local businesses have said the increased costs have impacted profits and relationships.

As of August, the state had spent about 4,000 hours, or $1.15 million on those lawsuits and protected an estimated $4.4 billion, according to the Oregon Department of Justice.

A live audio feed of Supreme Court oral arguments is available online.

Oral arguments in Oregon's tariff case are scheduled to begin at 7 a.m. PST on Oct. 5.

The hiring-policy case is the second time in recent weeks that the California Supreme Court has refused to review a lower-court decision at the request of UC lawyers.
The lawsuit regarding UC’s hiring policy was filed by a former UCLA student and a lecturer in October 2024.

The recent refusal to hear UC’s challenge to the lower court’s decision was met with joy by immigrant rights groups. But UC expressed concern.

The university system has grappled with federal grant suspensions and other painful Trump administration actions after being accused of violating federal laws, and UC spokesperson Rachel Zaentz said in a statement that the ruling “creates serious legal risks for the University and all other state employers in California.”

UC is already fighting the Trump administration’s proposed $1.2-billion fine stemming in part from federal allegations that UCLA failed to protect Jewish students’ civil rights during pro-Palestinian campus protests last year.

The hiring-policy case is the second time in recent weeks that the California Supreme Court has refused to review a lower-court decision at the request of UC lawyers. Last month, the state’s high court declined to overturn an order that UC release the document outlining the terms of the Trump administration’s settlement proposal.

UCLA argued that disclosing the information would harm ongoing negotiations with the Trump administration and open them up to unnecessary public scrutiny.

The lawsuit regarding UC’s hiring policy was filed by a former UCLA student and a lecturer in October 2024. It alleges that the UC system’s refusal to hire undocumented workers violates state law because it discriminates against students based on their immigration status.

Plaintiffs argued that, without campus work, students lacking documentation not only miss out on career-advancing research opportunities but also often struggle to afford tuition, housing and even food.

In August, a California Court of Appeal ruled that UC had not provided sufficient legal grounds to justify its “discriminatory policy.”

That ruling stopped short of overturning the hiring policy, but rather asked UC to reconsider it using proper legal criteria. Instead, UC opted to challenge the appellate court’s ruling to the state Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case last week, thus allowing the ruling to stand.

Former UC lecturer and plaintiff Iliana Perez said in a statement Monday that, as a formerly undocumented student, she had seen firsthand how employment restrictions limit opportunities for immigrant students. She is urging UC to take the Supreme Court’s decision as an opportunity to revise its hiring policy.

“The California Supreme Court’s decision not only reaffirms that discriminating against undocumented immigrants from accessing on-campus employment cannot continue to be tolerated,” Perez said, “but it also gives UC the clarity to finally unlock life-changing opportunities for the thousands of immigrant students who contribute to its campuses, and to the state’s economy and workforce.”

UC is “assessing its options” following the state Supreme Court’s decision, according to Zaentz. The university system did not indicate that it is plans to change its hiring policy.

“UC has been a leader in supporting its undocumented students — remarkable young people who have overcome obstacles and excelled academically — including hiring DACA students,” Zaentz said.

Under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, undocumented youth who were brought to the United States as children are protected from deportation and can get work permits.

UC does allow the hiring of students with DACA; however, new applicants have been shut out of the program for years. The Trump administration has proposed reopening DACA to first-time applicants, which would include many students who are now old enough to qualify, but has not done so yet.

Attorneys representing UC have argued that its hiring policy is justified because offering jobs to undocumented students could run afoul of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, a federal law that bars the hiring of people without legal status. Attorneys have said that hiring undocumented students could lead to litigation, civil fines, criminal penalties and the freezing of federal funding.

The three-judge appellate court panel, however, ruled in August that fear of federal litigation is not sufficient grounds for UC to uphold the discriminatory hiring policy.

UC has historically advocated for undocumented students to receive equal treatment at its campuses. Several UCs provide spaces aimed at developing academic and leadership success among immigrant students, such as the Dream Resource Center at UCLA.

Issues regarding undocumented students have become more politically volatile during the Trump administration. At UC, concerns have grown not just around on-campus employment but also potential immigration law enforcement on campuses and in-state tuition rates.

UC, like other public state universities, offers in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants who graduate from California high schools. Rough estimates say there are 80,000 students who benefit from Assembly Bill 540, which since 2001 has allowed such immigrants to avoid the much higher nonresident rates.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/768062d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6218x3264+0+440/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7a%2F36%2F02d1acfc4401a8e3fa400c5273af%2F1297686-me-uc-board-of-regents-daca-students-jlc-0517-10768.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 07:02:04.239120

Local Officials Disagree.,Beth Schwartzapfel,,,,,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2025/11/04/national-guard-trump-ice-crime-chicago,"In response, Trump sent 500 National Guard soldiers to the area, but a judge blocked their deployment to the city.
In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.
When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.
Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said.
But certainly the most infamous example of the National Guard being used to quell protest was at Kent State University in 1970.","The Trump administration’s deployments of federal agents and National Guard troops to cities across the country, in the name of reducing crime, are having the opposite effect, according to local leaders — eroding the trust required for them to police effectively, making it harder for them to prosecute violent crimes, and leaving residents feeling less safe.

These concerns are noted repeatedly in interviews with policing experts and community members, and in lawsuits challenging troop deployments in several American cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Memphis, Tennessee.

In Chicago, ICE agents began using increasingly aggressive tactics in September during what President Donald Trump dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.” It was a response, ICE said, to crimes committed by migrants in Illinois without documentation. The scenes have been dramatic by design: an overnight raid on an apartment building, with Blackhawk helicopters and U.S. citizens dragged into the street in zip-ties. The tactics have resulted in at least one death: In September, an immigration agent shot and killed 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González while attempting to pull him over and arrest him.

Locals in Chicago have turned out in force to protest, leading to daily demonstrations at an ICE processing center outside Chicago and elsewhere throughout the city. In response, Trump sent 500 National Guard soldiers to the area, but a judge blocked their deployment to the city.

Nevertheless, the presence of immigration agents in the city — with their military-style uniforms and tactics — has made it harder, prosecutors argue in a federal lawsuit, to pursue cases against people accused of violent crimes in Chicago.

In one case, the wife of a man who had been murdered did not want to come to court to testify for fear of being arrested by Homeland Security agents. Her fear of arrest “makes it more likely that her husband’s murderers will go free and justice will be denied,” wrote Jose Villarreal, a prosecutor with the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office, in court documents.

Villarreal listed a wide array of crimes that his office can no longer prosecute because of ICE’s presence in the city: children who are victims of sexual assault, whose mothers fear that bringing them to court might lead to their arrest by immigration agents; domestic violence cases where victims fear testifying because of immigration agents stationed at the courthouse, meaning “the predators who victimized them may walk free.”

Amid the Trump administration’s insistence that its immigration enforcement is meant to ensure law and order, Villarreal argued that Homeland Security’s actions in and around courthouses in Chicago have made it harder “to protect the victims of violent crime and uphold the law through criminal prosecution.” A spokesperson for the Cook County State’s Attorney’s office declined a request to interview Villarreal, citing the pending litigation.

Calls to 911 have dropped precipitously in the city since the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Chicago Tribune reported, especially in the predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood of Little Village. “They don’t really want to call the police because they associate the police with ICE,” Dolores Castañeda, a community activist, told the Tribune. As a result, residents “are feeling more unsafe than ever before.”

After the Trump administration began to flood Memphis with both National Guardsmen and other federal law enforcement agents in October, residents said that traffic stops by officers armed with assault rifles dressed in military garb made them feel less safe. “It makes everyone feel like a criminal. So you just literally criminalize the whole of Memphis,” said Keedran Franklin, a community organizer there.

In Memphis, where local police have struggled to build trust with communities of color — under the Biden administration, the Memphis Police Department was under investigation for using excessive force and racially profiling Black and brown residents — local police officers have been working side-by-side with the federal agents, doing traffic stops and executing warrants. In one case, a woman was dragged out of her house naked while federal agents searched for someone who didn’t live there.

“That's only made the relationship even more strained,” said Amber Sherman, a community activist and a member of a police reform task force in the city. “And I didn't think there was a chance of repair anyways, but I definitely don't think there is one now. Just because of the level of trauma that's being inflicted every single day.” The Memphis Police Department did not respond to a request to comment on Sherman’s concerns.

The playbook in Memphis was different from the other cities, because unlike governors in California and Illinois, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, supported the move. Several hundred federal law enforcement officers — from the National Guard and a wide range of other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives — arrived to participate in an action the government called “Memphis Safe Task Force.” But the county’s Democratic mayor, Lee Harris, has since sued the governor and others. The enormous influx of troops led to over 1,000 arrests, and local jails do not have the capacity to hold that many people. Weeks after the task force began operating, Harris declared a state of emergency to deal with overcrowding in the jails. By the end of October, troops were still there and had made hundreds of additional arrests.

In Los Angeles, where the Trump administration began deploying troops in June, Trump said that the aim was to protect federal employees and property from protesters who objected to ICE’s aggressive tactics when they descended on the city in tactical gear, conducting large-scale workplace raids. In response, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other state officials sued the Trump administration, arguing that military presence would “only escalate tensions” and “erode public trust.”

Their warnings were prescient. When the National Guard arrived, protesters redoubled their efforts, briefly blocking access to U.S. Highway 101 and amassing at a downtown jail, where officers with the National Guard, ICE, and Homeland Security deployed tear gas to clear them.

“Soldiers patrolling the streets of Los Angeles have not made anyone safer; indeed, the opposite is true,” according to court filings in California’s lawsuit to end the National Guard deployment. The Trump administration’s “confrontational decision to deploy the military in a civilian city serves only to spread fear and heighten tensions in Los Angeles. If anything, the presence of the military threatens to further destabilize the community and escalate a situation that calls for cool heads and steady hands.” About 100 troops remain stationed there, according to military officials.

In interviews with The Marshall Project and in court documents, police experts argue that National Guard troops and other militarized federal law enforcement make it harder for police to keep cities safe. “For some chiefs, this is their worst nightmare,” said Christy Lopez, a Georgetown Law professor who oversaw Constitutional policing enforcement at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. “They've been working with communities for years — decades — building trust with immigrant communities, marginalized communities. All it takes is one raid to destroy years of goodwill,” she said.

That’s because modern-day policing depends on trust. To prevent and solve crimes, police need community members to call them in emergencies and to cooperate in investigations — actions the public won’t take if they don’t trust that their concerns will be taken seriously. “True public safety is only possible when the community believes that their police department exists to serve them with fairness, equity, and respect,” wrote U. Renee Hall, former Dallas police chief, in a declaration filed in the Washington, D.C., litigation, which began in early September, weeks after troops began patrolling the city with fatigues and armored vehicles.

Many people don’t differentiate between Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security agents, National Guard troops, and local officers, Lopez, the Georgetown professor, said. “It’s all just people with guns who can tell you what to do.” Federal agents often wear tactical vests that say “POLICE” — although technically they are not — which further confuses people, said Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police officer. “I don’t want the line blurred, because I don’t want ICE giving a bad name to police departments.”

Since the end of the Civil War, the idea that the military should not intervene in the country’s civil government — except in emergencies — has been enshrined in both law and our national values. A handful of such emergencies took place during the civil rights movement, when the federal government sent the National Guard to Southern states to assist with desegregating schools, at times over segregationist governors’ objections. The last time the National Guard was called into an American city was in 1992, when California’s governor requested assistance in Los Angeles amid riots after the acquittal of the White police officers caught on videotape beating Rodney King.

But certainly the most infamous example of the National Guard being used to quell protest was at Kent State University in 1970. Amid escalating demonstrations against the Vietnam War, including a building on campus set ablaze, the mayor of Kent, Ohio, asked the state’s governor to send in troops. Shortly after arriving on campus, soldiers opened fire on a crowd, killing four college students.

In October, federal circuit court Judge Ronald M. Gould warned in a written dissent that “to have an armed military faced off against civilian protesters, whatever the motivation of the President, threatens to produce another tragedy, such as that occurring at Kent State University in 1970.” A majority of his colleagues on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Trump to continue with troop deployments in Los Angeles.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/PI7wTMeQ3lRp7cIwUyx4q0xCqCqN12BqLCY6vqCedus/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9mZ2xyeWtsbXBi/NW41ZmJiMnV2c2Zt/dnh6d3B4LzI1MTEw/NC1BTW9yYWxlc19G/RUQtUk9VTkRVUF9N/ZW1waGlzLmpwZw,N,,2025-11-04 06:18:18.095710

Some experts also believe that a loss for the Trump administration wouldn’t mean the end of its tariff regime.","Seven months ago, President Donald Trump proclaimed April 2 “Liberation Day.” Standing in the White House Rose Garden, he announced a round of “reciprocal” tariffs levied against nearly every country in the world.

He had already levied tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico shortly after taking office in January. But are all these tariffs lawful? The Supreme Court will consider the question Wednesday.

The case concerns what the Trump administration regards as its greatest economic policy achievement to date, and what a bipartisan array of critics describes as a new effort by Mr. Trump to expand presidential power beyond the Constitution’s limits.

Why We Wrote This

After lower courts struck down the legal argument for the Trump administration’s most sweeping tariffs, the Supreme Court now takes up the matter. The case is important not only for the economic policy of the United States, but for the Constitution’s separation of powers.

Mr. Trump brought his case to the justices after three lower federal courts struck down the tariffs. The administration, the courts ruled, authorized the tariffs by misreading an emergency economic powers law. Decades of precedent support their interpretation of the law, the administration counters.

If the high court rules in President Trump’s favor, “it potentially offers unprecedented amounts of authority to the president,” says Wendy Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former acting deputy U.S. trade representative.

According to Mr. Trump, this power is critical to America’s economic competitiveness on the world stage.

The case is “one of the most important … in the history of our Country,” he wrote on social media last month. “If we don’t win,” he said at the White House in October, “we will be a weakened, troubled, financial mess for many, many years to come.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said a ruling against the administration would raise difficult practical questions about what to do with the billions in tariff revenue already collected. Even critics of the tariffs agree with the Trump administration’s assessment – to an extent.

“I’m not sure it’s [one of] the most important cases in American history, but it is one for the ages,” said Michael McConnell, a Stanford Law School professor who is representing small businesses challenging the tariffs, during a call with reporters last week.

“This is a major confrontation between the executive branch and Congress,” he added.

Origins of tariff authority

The Constitution delegates the tariff power to Congress, with Article I stating that the legislative branch has the power “to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.”

But Congress has also passed several laws giving the president some authority to set tariffs. The law at issue in this case is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This law – which doesn’t mention the word “tariff” – says that in the face of an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” the president can declare a national emergency and invoke the IEEPA, which provides them new powers to “regulate … importation.”

The Trump administration is arguing that trade deficits, as well as fentanyl trafficking from China through Mexico and Canada, are national emergencies justifying its tariff declarations. Mr. Trump is the first president to attempt to use the IEEPA to levy tariffs.

The closest another president has come to unilaterally imposing tariffs came in 1971, when Richard Nixon cited a predecessor statute to the IEEPA in ordering a small and “temporary” 10% tariff on imports to the U.S. He ended the tariffs four months later after successful trade negotiations with the affected nations.

The Trump administration says it is following a similar playbook, citing trade deals with the European Union, Japan, and Britain agreed upon after imposing tariffs. Unlike under President Nixon, however, many of those framework deals include a Trump tariff remaining in place.

Mr. Nixon “applied these tariffs for a short period of time,” says Ms. Cutler. “Under the Trump administration’s view, once you declare an emergency you can keep them for as long as you want.”

The Constitution and Congress’s role

The confrontation boils down to America’s earliest democratic principles. Taxation without representation sparked the Revolutionary War, and the Constitution sought to address it by giving Congress the exclusive power to levy taxes. By unilaterally imposing tariffs –effectively a tax on American businesses that import goods, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation) – critics say Mr. Trump is ignoring these foundational principles.

More specifically, the Trump administration has been doing an end-run around the Constitution by misinterpreting the IEEPA, critics from legal groups across the ideological spectrum claim.

The IEEPA, they argue, is effectively a wartime law. When the country faces an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” the act gives the president a range of new powers to address the emergency, including the power to “regulate … importation.”

That is not a power to set tariffs, critics argue. Furthermore, they claim, an emergency the Trump administration is citing is no emergency at all. The executive order imposing the “Liberation Day” tariffs, for example, includes the phrase “large and persistent…trade deficits.”

“Use of the IEEPA is limited to extraordinary emergencies, [and] a trade deficit is not unusual or even an emergency,” said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a legal group that represents a group of small businesses challenging the tariffs.

The center is one of a number of strange bedfellows fighting Mr. Trump’s tariffs. When it last appeared before the justices, the organization won a landmark case restricting union organizing rights around the country – a decision celebrated by conservative America. In the tariffs case, the organization now finds itself allied with left-leaning organizations including the Brennan Center for Justice and the Democracy Forward Foundation.

Also on their side is the Pacific Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm that typically represents conservative causes. One of the group’s recent Supreme Court victories struck down a Biden administration loan-forgiveness program.

In the tariffs case “the issues are effectively the same,” says Oliver Dunford, a senior attorney at the firm.

“Here, the president is effectively making new policy,” he adds. “And if we want to address [a policy issue], Congress has to be involved.”

As for the bipartisan opposition, Mr. Dunford hopes it’s a “good omen that … in the future, there will be more bipartisan opposition to presidents when they exceed their authority.”

How the White House defends tariffs

The Trump administration, meanwhile, claims that the trade deficits have created “an ongoing economic emergency of historic proportions.” Using tariffs to pressure China, Mexico, and Canada to limit fentanyl trafficking into the U.S., meanwhile, is a valid use of the IEEPA, the administration argues.

One of the administration’s prominent claims is that the tariffs fall squarely within the presidents’ authority over foreign policy and national security matters.

The IEEPA “is a particularly broad delegation in the domains of foreign policy and national security,” the administration wrote in its petition to the court.

If the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, the administration added, it “would reflect an intolerable judicial intrusion into the President’s responsibility to manage foreign relations and trade.”

Trump administration officials have also raised what could be a persuasive “remedies” argument – one focused on what the administration would have to do should it lose.

In a declaration submitted to the court, Mr. Bessent wrote that billions of dollars in tariffs have already been collected. If the tariffs are suddenly eliminated, he added, “unwinding them could cause significant disruption.”

Given the time-sensitive nature of the case, most courtwatchers believe the justices will deliver an opinion months before the term ends in June.

Some experts also believe that a loss for the Trump administration wouldn’t mean the end of its tariff regime. The justices could uphold some tariffs but not others, and, if some tariffs are struck down, the administration could use other statutes to reimpose them. The administration has also set tariffs under different statutes, such as tariffs on steel and aluminum, that have not been legally challenged.

“If [the tariffs are] struck down, it would be a blow to the president’s trade agenda, but there may be a Plan B,” says Ms. Cutler. “We’ll still be in a world where tariffs are a core part of the administration’s trade agenda.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/11/1103_NTARIFFS_port_ledeL.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-11-04 12:06:17.392608

His family said to El País that he called them daily – until he seemingly disappeared without immediate explanation in June.
Gamboa’s family described not being able to find him until August, after they were scammed by two attorneys and then actually located him with the help of a third attorney.
An air ambulance paid for by ICE flew Gamboa to Costa Rica on 3 September, El País wrote.
But Gamboa’s family told El País that they are under the impression that the Costa Rican government is reluctant to get involved beyond “the bare minimum”.","The recent death of a Costa Rican man who was jailed by US immigration authorities in February before being deported in a vegetative state in September has prompted his family and supporters to speak out with allegations of negligence and inhumane treatment.

Nonetheless, a spokesperson for Donald Trump’s administration – which has aimed to deport as many people as possible from the US since his second presidency started in January – maintained in a statement that the medical treatment Randall Alberto Gamboa Esquivel received before his death is better than many immigrants “have received in their entire lives”.

The statement from assistant homeland security secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that Gamboa “illegally reentered the US – a felony – in December 2024”. Citing information from Gamboa’s family, the Spanish-language news outlet El País reported that he had embarked for the US in search of work, and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested him in Texas in February.

Gamboa, 52, initially was held at Texas’s Webb county detention center before being transferred to another facility in the state in Port Isabel. His family said to El País that he called them daily – until he seemingly disappeared without immediate explanation in June.

Eventually, “someone at the detention center said he had a health issue, and that’s why he wasn’t answering us,” Gamboa’s sister, Greidy Mata, told El País. “But they didn’t give us any more information.”

McLaughlin’s statement said “medical professionals diagnosed [Gamboa] with unspecified psychosis and hospitalized him at Valley Baptist Hospital so he could get proper mental health and medical care”.

Gamboa’s family described not being able to find him until August, after they were scammed by two attorneys and then actually located him with the help of a third attorney. By then, Gamboa was bedridden in a vegetative state, and his family’s attorney began the process of having him sent to Costa Rica.

An air ambulance paid for by ICE flew Gamboa to Costa Rica on 3 September, El País wrote. Stricken with encephalopathy, the muscle ailment rhabdomyolysis and the inability to eat on his own, he was admitted to an emergency room in the Costa Rican capital of San José before being transferred to a hospital in his home town of Pérez Zeledón.

Gamboa then died in that hospital on 26 October.

His family has since sought to apply pressure on those in Costa Rica’s government to demand answers from their US counterparts. But Gamboa’s family told El País that they are under the impression that the Costa Rican government is reluctant to get involved beyond “the bare minimum”.

In a video recorded outside Gamboa’s funeral and aired by the Spanish-language news network Univision, his significant other Adriana Ureña said “the medical treatment that Randall got in the United States … in my opinion was terrible”.

One political figure in Costa Rica who has expressed support for Gamboa’s family is the nation’s former president, Óscar Arias, the winner of the 1987 Nobel peace prize.

“Randall Gamboa entered the [US] illegally but in perfect physical condition,” Arias wrote on the social media platform X. Condemning what he called the “complicit silence” of Costa Rica and the US, he added, “Randall’s family deserves to know the truth and to learn what happened when he was in custody of American immigration authorities.”

The Trump administration revoked Arias’s US visa in April, something the two-time Costa Rican president said was done because he oversaw his country’s formalization of relations with China in 2007. Arias, though, said he spoke out about Gamboa because he could not stay silent when “a Costa Rican – a humble Pérez Zeledón municipal worker – was deported in an inhumane condition”.

“I will not shut up when the lives of human beings are jeopardized,” Arias also wrote.

In her statement about Gamboa, McLaughlin contended, “Ensuring the safety, security and wellbeing of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

The Trump administration initially insisted that its immigration crackdown would prioritize targeting violent criminals. But government data reported in September showed that immigrants with no criminal record were the largest group in ICE detention.

McLaughlin’s statement about Gamboa noted that illegally re-entering was a felony. The statement also made it a point to say Gamboa had previously been convicted of driving a commercial vehicle without a commercial license as well as fraud, neither of which is a violent offense.

Furthermore, Trump won his second presidency after separate New York state court juries convicted him of criminally falsifying business records as well as committing civil fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.

“Under President Trump and [homeland security secretary] Kristi Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences,” McLaughlin’s statement said. “Criminal illegal [immigrants] are not welcome in the US.”

Mata said outside Gamboa’s funeral, “The United States needs to realize Randall was not a delinquent – and he was wholly loved. … And he died surrounded by people who loved him.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a64f3fc72c4bc20a782d16254b2cee910bddfea6/325_0_2921_2336/master/2921.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1313b6a8dcc586a776b4f95400f23f22",N,,2025-11-04 05:16:55.721263

“Operation Midway Blitz”

This all stems from “Operation Midway Blitz”, a massive ICE operation launched on September 8.

As DHS describes it, Midway Blitz is intended to “target the criminal illegal aliens who flocked to Chicago and Illinois because they knew Governor Pritzker and his sanctuary policies would protect them and allow them to roam free on American streets.”

“Governor Pritzker” refers to Illinois Gov. Jay Robert “J.B.” Pritzker (D), billionaire “heir to the Hyatt Hotel fortune”, Democratic Party heavyweight, and a long-time and vehement critic of the president’s “mass deportation” plans.

And “sanctuary” in that sentence is a descriptive phrase, not a knock: Illinois and Chicago are each on DOJ’s “Sanctuary Jurisdictions” list, the former thanks to its “TRUST Act” (which the state argues “helps bolster community trust and cooperation”), and the latter its “Welcoming City Ordinance” (arguing that “Partnering with ICE would go against” its “mission to make Chicago the most immigrant friendly city in the country and turn” the city “into a community of fear for immigrants”).

Midway Blitz has resulted in 3,000 illegal alien arrests in Illinois and its environs (including 146 truckers at the Indiana State line), but it has also triggered any number of protests, some of which have turned violent – including one recently that resulted in a rear-end accident cum melee in suburban Evanston.

Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino

The “immigration chief” referred to in the judge’s order is Gregory Bovino (pictured above, speaking with DHS Secretary Noem), technically Border Patrol Chief in the agency’s El Centro (Calif.) sector but at present the “commander-at-large” in charge of Midway Blitz.

He’s been in the Border Patrol for almost three decades, and is unapologetic about his recent duties, telling CNN: “We’re going to carry out that mission . . . And that’s paramount, or else we shouldn’t be here. We’re going to carry that mission out.”

Pritzker is firing back, contending he “refuse[s] to let Trump, Noem and Bovino continue on this march toward autocracy. . .. Their plan all along has been to cause chaos, and then they can use that chaos to consolidate Trump’s power.”

Did I mention that an alleged Chicago-area Latin Kings member, Juan Espinoza Martinez, has been arrested and charged by DOJ with placing a $10,000 bounty on Bovino’s head?

The chief plainly elicits strong feelings. As Newsweek put it:

Bovino's approach to enforcement has been characterized by rapid, high-intensity operations, often referred to as ""turn-and-burn"" tactics. These methods have attracted criticism from local officials and civil rights groups, who argue that they disproportionately target immigrant communities and violate constitutional rights.

Chicago Headline Club v. Noem

Nowhere have those feelings run higher, though, than in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (greater Chicago), locus of Chicago Headline Club v. Noem.

The lead plaintiff in that case is “a non-profit membership organization of professional journalists working in the Chicagoland area with hundreds of professional journalist members”, and on October 6, it and others filed a complaint against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Bovino, and other officials over what they term to be:

the right of the demonstrator Plaintiffs to exercise their First Amendment rights to peacefully protest and to exercise their religion in the area around the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, and in other places where demonstrators are opposing the Administration’s federal incursion into the Chicagoland area.

They complain “Federal agents have responded” to those “peaceful protests” with “a pattern of extreme brutality in a concerted and ongoing effort to silence the press and civilians”; on that basis, they sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to stop those alleged abuses.

In response, DOJ contended the plaintiffs are actually seeking “to dictate crowd-control policy in ways that would tie the hands of federal law enforcement officers (‘LEOs’) even in circumstances of imminent danger and would risk bogging this Court down in micro-management of crowd control decisions by federal LEOs”.

The case was assigned to district court Judge Sara Ellis, and apparently, she wasn’t bothered by “micro-management of crowd control decisions by federal LEOs”.

That’s because on October 28, she issued an order requiring federal agents in Midway Blitz “to place an identifier conspicuously on their uniform where one can easily view it and the Agent's equipment does not obscure it”, telling the government to “strive to ensure” agents carry body−worn cameras, and directing DHS to provide the court with “all CBP use of force reports relating to Operation Midway Blitz from” September 2 through October 25, and to continue to do so on an ongoing basis.

DOJ’s Petition for a Writ of Mandamus

Most crucially, however, Judge Ellis also ordered Bovino to appear in her court “in person, week days at 5:45 PM”. That prompted DOJ to file a petition for a writ of mandamus and a stay of that requirement, which the department termed an “extraordinary and extraordinarily disruptive requirement,” with the Seventh Circuit.

Among other things, DOJ argued:

The court’s order is . . . untethered to the plaintiffs’ underlying claims and goes substantially beyond what is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the court’s prior orders. And the order only underscores the extent to which the district court has exceeded its judicial role by arrogating to itself the role of supervising and micromanaging the day-to-day operations of an Executive Branch law-enforcement agency.

As the Legal Information Institute (LII) explains: “A (writ of) mandamus is an order from a court to an inferior government official ordering the government official to properly fulfill their official duties or correct an abuse of discretion”. They are often sought in federal court when a party wants to appeal a decision but can’t.

TROs are short-term orders and not generally subject to appeal, but if Judge Ellis issues an injunction along the lines above, expect it to return more formally to the circuit court.

“Two Principal Failings”

In any event, on October 29, the Seventh Circuit issued an administrative stay of the order directing Bovino’s appearance pending briefing, and on October 31, issued its formal order in the case granting the petition for mandamus.

“While this litigation presents very challenging circumstances, the Seventh Circuit explained, “the district court’s order has two principal failings”:

First, it puts the court in the position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator of the parties’ adversarial presentations. Second, it sets the court up as a supervisor of Chief Bovino’s activities, intruding into personnel management decisions of the Executive Branch.

“These two problems”, the circuit panel held, “are related and lead us to conclude that the order infringes on the separation of powers.” Waiting for an appeal “would not solve the problems created in the interim”.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/Bovino-Noem-Chicago.png,N,,2025-11-04 04:56:56.970177

Many teachers, nurses, government and nonprofit workers have stayed in their jobs in hopes of benefiting from the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

The lawsuit, which also includes the nation's two largest teachers unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, comes less than a week after the U.S. Department of Education published a rule change to PSLF.

Effective July 1, 2026, the department says the change will allow it to deny loan forgiveness to workers whose government or nonprofit employers engage in activities with a ""substantial illegal purpose."" The job of defining ""substantial illegal purpose"" will fall not to the courts but to the education secretary.

PSLF was created by Congress in 2007, and signed by then-President George W. Bush, to cancel the federal student loan debts of borrowers who spend a decade working in public service, including teaching, nursing and policing.

According to the lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the plaintiffs fear that a city or county government's resistance to the administration's immigration actions, for example, or anti-DEI policies, could lead the secretary to exclude that government's public workers from loan forgiveness. They worry that a local nurse or first responder could be denied loan forgiveness because their local leaders defied the Trump administration.

The complaint argues the rule is ""an attempt to target organizations and jurisdictions whose missions and policies do not align with [the Trump administration's] political positions on immigration, race, gender, free speech, and public protest.""

""Politically motivated retaliation, like what the administration has done here, should have no place in America,"" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs.

The plaintiff group also includes the National Council of Nonprofits, which said in a statement upon the rule's release:

""Nonprofits operate food banks, serve veterans, assist domestic violence survivors, deliver meals to seniors, respond to disasters, and much more. Nonprofits must be able to identify and meet those needs without political interference, fear of retribution, or exclusion from a program designed to support their employees.""

Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent denounced the lawsuit.

""It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,"" Kent said in a statement to NPR. ""This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.""

In response to plaintiffs' concerns that the administration could use PSLF as a weapon to punish political opponents, Kent insisted ""the Department will enforce [the rule] neutrally, without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology, or the population they serve.""

The complaint says PSLF has allowed local governments to retain employees, including lawyers and engineers, who could earn more in the private sector. Albuquerque's leaders say that losing access to PSLF ""would likely create an untenable staffing crisis.""

In a statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu added: ""The City is joining with cities, unions, and nonprofits across the country to protect a program that helps Boston's workforce and millions of Americans in public service careers pay for college.""

What activities does the administration consider to be illegal?

One key question raised by this rule change, and the lawsuit, is: How will the Education Department define activities with ""substantial illegal purpose""?

According to the rule itself, such activities could include:

""aiding and abetting violations of Federal immigration laws""

""supporting terrorism or engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy""

""engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of Federal or state law""

""engaging in the trafficking of children to another State for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents in violation of Federal or State law""

""engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination""

""and engaging in a pattern of violating State laws.""

If the secretary determines that an employer has behaved with ""substantial illegal purpose,"" according to the rule, the employer can either engage with the department and accept a corrective action plan or risk losing access to PSLF for its employees for 10 years.

In response to public comments, the Education Department has said, ""[it] would have no basis to remove eligibility from nonprofits engaged in work related to immigrant communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial justice if those organizations are following the law.""

But the plaintiff cities, which sit on the U.S. Justice Department's ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" list, say the Trump administration has already accused them of impeding the enforcement of federal law, and that this rule ""represents yet another attack on politically disfavored local governments and nonprofits that have local laws, policies, and missions that are anathemas to the Administration.""

""The actions of these cities are legal,"" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers, another organization representing the plaintiffs. What's more, she says, ""whether or not these activities are legal, is not a [determination] that the secretary of education has either the right or the expertise to be making.""

The new rule is the culmination of a presidential action, issued in March, in which President Trump accused the Biden administration of abusing PSLF, and said the program ""has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.""

What did Congress intend when it created PSLF?

The plaintiffs argue Congress was clear about what should qualify as ""public service"" when it wrote the law, and that this new rule goes against lawmakers' intent.

""The Higher Education Act defines public service jobs as including government or a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization. It does not provide any discretion or wiggle room within that definition,"" Yu says. ""Congress has said that this is who is entitled to public service loan forgiveness. The secretary doesn't have the authority to change that.""

In response to public comments, the Education Department has disagreed, writing that ""[it] rejects the suggestion that this rule exceeds its legal authority. The [Higher Education Act] grants the Secretary explicit power to regulate title IV programs. PSLF is a title IV program, and its proper administration requires clear, enforceable standards.""

Another lawsuit was filed in tandem Monday, by a coalition of 21 state attorneys general, arguing on behalf of Democratic-leaning state governments that worry their public employees could likewise be denied loan forgiveness because of state leaders' decisions to support immigrants, promote DEI or provide gender affirming care.

The coalition of attorneys general warned in a press release that the rule would result in ""widespread confusion, fear, and instability in the public workforce, forcing states to confront severe staffing shortages, higher turnover, and skyrocketing costs to maintain essential services.""

According to federal data, more than 1.1 million public service workers have thus far had their federal student loan debts discharged under PSLF.

This story was updated to include comment from the U.S. Department of Education.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

More than a million Americans have had their student loan debts erased because they've worked in public service. Many teachers, nurses, government and nonprofit workers have stayed in their jobs in hopes of benefiting from the federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Now, though, the Trump administration is changing the rules around who can qualify. Today, a host of cities and 21 states led by Democrats filed a pair of lawsuits saying they fear their public workers could soon be excluded. NPR's Cory Turner is here in the studio with more. Hey.

CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Hey, Juana.

SUMMERS: So Cory, let's just start with a quick reminder of the PSLF program. How is it supposed to work?

TURNER: Yeah, it was created by Congress in 2007, signed by then-President George W. Bush. And the law offers what is essentially a quid pro quo to federal student loan borrowers. If you work for 10 years in public service, the government agrees to erase whatever is left of your student loan debts. The idea was to help nonprofits and state and local governments hire and retain good people even if they can't pay private sector wages. And Congress, we should say, defined public service really broadly in the law to include anyone working in government or a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

SUMMERS: Right, OK. So help me understand, then, how does the Trump administration hope to change this program?

TURNER: Yeah, they released a final rule change last week that will go into effect in July, and it allows the education secretary to deny loan forgiveness if employers engage in activities with, quote, ""substantial illegal purpose,"" Juana.

SUMMERS: OK.

TURNER: There, the department includes, quote, ""aiding and abetting violations of federal immigration laws,"" also engaging in, quote, ""the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of federal or state law."" The concern among these states and cities with this lawsuit is that by being what the Justice Department has called sanctuary jurisdictions, for example, or by following state or local laws that promote diversity or protect the rights of transgender people, the secretary of education could say to them, look, I think your leaders are acting with illegal purpose, and then bar any of that state or local government's employees from getting loan forgiveness. These suits accuse the administration, essentially, of trying to weaponize PSLF and they argue the secretary doesn't have the authority, let alone the expertise, to decide what is illegal purpose or to add restrictions that Congress never intended in the law.

SUMMERS: Cory, what's the Trump administration had to say about those accusations?

TURNER: Yeah, in a statement today from the undersecretary of education, Nicholas Kent, he called it - opposition to the rule unconscionable. Kent also said, quote, ""this is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm."" He also insisted the rule would be enforced, quote, ""without consideration of the employer's mission, ideology or the population they serve."" One last thing, Juana. Employers at risk of failing this new standard will have two options. They can risk being excluded from loan forgiveness for 10 years or they can change their policies as part of a corrective action plan.

SUMMERS: NPR education correspondent Cory Turner, thank you.

TURNER: You're welcome.

The case risks undermining Copenhagen’s strict immigration policy – which, according to newly appointed Immigration Minister Rasmus Stoklund, aims to “make it possible to send more people out of Europe.”

Stoklund will be questioned in parliament on Tuesday after Danish media reported in August a tenfold increase in international students from Nepal and Bangladesh from 190 students in 2019 to 2.146 last year.

Opposition parties, including the Liberal Alliance and far-right Danish People’s Party, have called for an inquiry, accusing the government of “losing control” of the country’s strict immigration policy.

“There is little to suggest that the government understands how serious this matter is,” Mikkel Bjørn, a far-right MP and vice-chairman of the immigration committee in the Danish parliament told Euractiv.

With national elections due next year, the backlash could not come at a worse time, as opponents sense political opportunity in questioning the ruling coalition’s credibility on one of its defining issues.

Frederiksen’s political headache

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s coalition – formed by her Social Democrats, the Liberals, and the centre-right Moderates – has built its reputation on one of Europe’s toughest immigration lines.

Her party’s goal is to prevent refugees from reaching Europe’s borders by establishing third-country facilities where both asylum processing and potential resettlement would take place.

The party has also claimed credit for inspiring a European Commission proposal that would permit the creation of deportation centres outside the EU.

However, the latest scandal has exposed an unexpected flaw in the country’s policy. Under current rules, foreign students from third countries who hold a visa are allowed to bring their families to Denmark – granting both the students and their relatives access to the labour market.

Right-wing parties now argue that the system is being abused, with applicants using the visas as a backdoor to work in Denmark. The number of accompanying family members has risen tenfold in recent years, according to data from Statistics Denmark obtained by the investigative outlet Frihedsbrevet.

Universities in the line of fire

The controversy first erupted two months ago, when Roskilde University – located 30 kilometres west of Copenhagen – was found to have a disproportionately high number of students from Bangladesh. Sixteen percent of the university’s new master’s students now come from the country.

Politicians from several parties, including government parties, accused universities of “running their own immigration policy” in contradiction with the government’s restrictive stance. The far-right party even demanded the resignation of Education Minister Christina Egelund.

Frederiksen herself publicly rebuked the university, saying universities should not “determine Danish immigration policy”. Following her comments, the chair of Roskilde University’s board, Carsten Toft Boesen stepped dow, even though the admissions in question were legal.

The university later acknowledged that its international admissions had “got out of hand” and stressed that Roskilde is “primarily for Danes.”

Closing the loophole

Since the scandal broke in August, the Danish government has moved to tighten oversight and close the loophole of international admissions.

New measures include higher Danish-language requirements for international students, stricter documentation of qualifications, and closer monitoring of recruitment practices. Further restrictions will take effect in 2026, including a ban on foreign students bringing spouses or partners to Denmark.

Still, opposition parties dismissed most of the initiatives as “quick fixes”.

“It’s great that measures are being taken,” said Danish People’s Party MP Mikkel Bjørn. “But I’m puzzled that the government does nothing to repair the damage that has already been done.”

He added that students who entered on “questionable qualifications” should be deported immediately. “If it were up to me, they’d already be on a plane back to Bangladesh.”

According to attorney Bjørn Dilou Jacobsen – an expert in immigration and human rights law – the issue is far from simple.

Each case would require an individual legal assessment to determine whether a student visa had been granted on false information. Even if that were the case, authorities would still need to assess whether deportation could raise human rights concerns under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – which protects the right to family life.

MP Sofie Lippert from the Green Left has also called the situation “an obvious problem”, adding that “student visas must not be used to exploit the system”.

The immigration ministry has not responded to Euractiv’s request for comment at the time of publication.

Louis on the Air” brings you the stories of St. Louis and the people who live, work and create in our region.","On Sept. 2, agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided a St. Peters restaurant and arrested more than a dozen workers. The Golden Apple Buffet’s employees hailed from several countries, including China, Mexico and Indonesia. Some have now spent weeks detained and awaiting deportation.

But the raid did not reveal evidence of human trafficking or any criminal enterprise, said Jim Hacking, an immigration lawyer representing 10 workers.

The raid didn’t target just the Golden Apple Buffet. ICE agents used battering rams to enter homes in St. Charles where about 20 of the restaurant’s employees lived.

“Two of my clients were getting out of the shower, and the person knocking on the door had a gun pointed at them,” Hacking said. “It was a very intense situation.”

Nearly one month later, nine of Hacking’s clients have agreed to a “voluntary departure.” The completion of that plan has been delayed by the ongoing criminal case against the buffet’s two owners, Guo Liang Ye and De Jin Ye, both residents of St. Charles County.

The federal indictment is light on detail. The owners are charged with a single felony of bringing in and harboring aliens. They are accused of acting with “knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact that aliens had come to, entered and remained in the United States in violation of the law.” If convicted, the pair face a fine of up to $250,000 and 10 years in prison.

The press release from the U.S. Department of Justice made no mention of the workers or any illegal activities. Still, Hacking said he was compelled to investigate his clients’ living conditions. All of them had come to the U.S. from Indonesia.

Some had been in the country for a few months, others for years. “I was worried that these people were victims of human trafficking,” he said. But that’s not what he discovered. “Based on my conversations with everyone, I became convinced that they had found out about a job posting online, and they moved to St. Louis to take this job and to be able to live in that house.”

Although the indictment accuses the men of unlawfully remaining in the country, Hacking points out that they had all applied for visas. Eight had obtained work authorizations. All of them had made official pleas for asylum.

But those proceedings didn’t offer any protection on the day of the raid.

“People say all the time, ‘Why don't these immigrants just do things the right way?’” he noted. “Well, you know what my clients did? They went to the State Department, they paid a fee, they got a visa to the United States. When they got here, they applied for asylum, and after that, they applied for work authorization.

“And what did it get them? It got them dragged out of a shower at gunpoint, dragged into jail where they were sent to rot.”

Hacking contested some of the details alleged by neighbors, and published by Fox2, that described up to 20 people living in a single home in St. Charles. He said that the number was likely exaggerated and that the workers were spread over a total of four homes.

“I don't believe there were 20 people living in a house,” he said. “The reason I say that is because everyone that I talked to said they had their own room and their own bed.” Hacking acknowledged that the living conditions could constitute a housing violation.

“We can all agree that maybe you shouldn't have 12 people living in the house, and maybe there's housing codes in St. Peters that say you can't do that. Other than that, I think the government might have a hard time proving their case,” he said. “They thought they were going to find a place where everybody was undocumented and nobody had work authorization. I think they were surprised, at least with my clients, that the majority of them did have work authorizations.”

Hacking doesn’t represent all of the workers caught up in the raid. Although his clients were offered the choice of taking “voluntary deportations,” he said some of the workers are still being held in jail as potential witnesses.

Five of his clients have already left the country. He expects the other deportations will be carried out in the next couple of weeks.

Hacking sees the raid against the Golden Apple Buffett as part of the larger anti-immigration sweeps targeting individuals and businesses across the country. On Wednesday, ICE agents in Staunton, Illinois arrested a restaurant owner and detained him in the Ste. Genevieve jail, prompting hundreds to protest over the weekend.

“Making somebody stay in immigration detention is a very strong tool in their arsenal of getting people to leave the United States,” Hacking said. His clients spent weeks in the Ste. Genevieve jail, cut off from contact with their families and supporters.

These cases, he said, are spreading fear throughout the country.

“I can only imagine what people are going through,” he said. “Worried that they are going to get snapped up when they drop off their kids at school, or when they go to the doctor or they go to the gas station. It's just a really, really dark time.”

Multiple people from Honduras have been detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a shipyard in Harvey. Agents inspected the worksite, Barrois Welding Service, on Oct. 30, leading to the arrest of 25 workers. ICE said the operation stemmed from an investigation by HSI New Orleans in March after an employee was arrested for immigration violations. During the investigation, HSI agents served a notice of inspection and immigration subpoena on the owners of Barrois Welding Service. Barrios failed to provide the required employee documentation, including I-9s, identification documents, or a current employee listing. According to ICE, many of those arrested had criminal histories, including prior illegal entry, DUI, discharge of a firearm within city limits, and resisting an officer by giving false information. HSI New Orleans continues efforts to determine potential criminal culpability related to the investigation.

Like so many in the city since “Operation Midway Blitz” began in September, Mendez had been “on the lookout” since federal immigration officers “started taking over,” he told the Daily Beast.

When he saw the masked officers in unmarked vehicles drive into the lot, Mendez decided to pull out his cameraphone and start recording—“to do my part,” he said—as Illinois governor JB Pritzker has repeatedly asked people.

What came next was brutal, as the Puerto Rican security guard filmed two Border Patrol agents smashing the window of a white Ford pickup with their batons.

“The poor guy was surrounded by agents, workers, and customers,” said Mendez, 27, who added that the incident was so dramatic and shocking that other store staff also came out to film.

The officers then pulled out a Hispanic man before handcuffing him, and bundling him into an unmarked red vehicle.

After the man was detained, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in a separate unmarked blue Chevy Tahoe threatened to tear-gas anyone who intervened, Mendez says, before they all drove out of the lot as one ICE officer can be seen in his video flipping him the bird.

But despite Mendez having done what he believed any good citizen should have, he says a supervisor “sent me home” after Mendez objected to his superior’s demands to stop filming and go back to his position at the shop door.

Mendez, who claims that Menards’ bosses demanded store staff who had filmed the episode delete their footage, was then fired altogether the same day, according to a termination notice obtained by the Beast.

The letter from security contractor O’Brien & Associates—which provides security staff to Menards—cites “insubordination” and claims Mendez left his “designated post,” argued with an “ICE employee,” and “almost [got] pepper-sprayed.”

It states that he then returned to the lot twice against instructions, and when sent home, he told his site manager, “Make me.”

The letter says: “You are terminated as of Tuesday October 28th, 2025.”

Mendez disputes some of what his former company says, claiming managers had previously insisted the lot was private property and off-limits to immigration operations.

Having worked at the store for two years and now seeking a new job, he was unrepentant. “Would I do it again? Yes, I would,” Mendez said.

Menards is owned by John Menard Jr., a long-time Republican donor who has bankrolled conservative causes and worked with Donald Trump to advise on economic reopening in 2020, according to Urban Milwaukee and the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign’s summary of his giving to GOP-aligned groups. Federal contribution records show that Menards-linked donations flow overwhelmingly to Republicans, according to OpenSecrets.

Since September, “Operation Midway Blitz” has seen the growth of hard-edged Border Patrol actions in and around Chicago, which have increasingly overshadowed ICE’s presence in the city, as the Trump administration escalates more widespread raids to increase deportation tallies.

Their actions have drawn blistering judicial scrutiny following tear-gas and pepper-ball deployments in residential areas and at a children’s Halloween parade. Agents allegedly broke a 67-year-old man’s ribs during the fracas.

Last week, a federal judge ordered Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to appear in court every evening and turn over use-of-force files, although this has been paused pending appeal. Barack Obama-appointed Sara Ellis also told Bovino he must wear a body camera.

The Daily Beast contacted Menards and O’Brien & Associates for comment twice on Thursday. Neither had responded by the time of publication.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the arrest had been part of a “targeted immigration enforcement operation,” which led to the arrest of Santos Mena-Flores, “a criminal illegal alien from Mexico with previous arrests for domestic battery, aggravated DUI, and violating a restraining order for assault.”

She said that Mena-Flores had “refused to comply with lawful commands to open his door during the operation, agitators started surrounding the vehicle, yelling profanities at agents and blowing whistles.

“Mena-Flores then started backing up his vehicles and officers fearing they would be run over, broke the vehicle’s window and placed him under arrest.”

McLaughlin added that Border Patrol “did not deploy any crowd control measures.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gV48gMEdAgfQ6x48q1OPOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/2a7bef3d4640b39b4bed1c2fbfed3770,N,,2025-11-04 01:56:39.676242

Tim MacDonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, is leading the legal challenge through court filings alongside immigration attorney Hans Meyer. They are arguing that ICE is conducting warrantless arrests that violate federal law. The lawsuit names four plaintiffs who were detained without warrants, including a Utah college student stopped after a traffic violation and a Colorado business owner who was mistakenly identified as someone else.

""It's really important that ICE complies with the law,"" MacDonald said. ""Our laws are harsh enough as they are.""

According to court documents, the plaintiffs include Refugio Ramirez Ovando, Caroline Dias Goncalves, and two others identified as J.S.T. and G.R.R. The lawsuit alleges ICE has a pattern of making warrantless arrests without determining whether individuals pose a flight risk, as required by federal statute.

MacDonald cited a case in Durango where ICE detained a father and two children despite searching for someone else, sharing that these types of situations occur often.

""ICE admitted in court that was a mistake,"" he said.

The family was transferred to a family holding detention facility in Texas.

""We are seeing these are not the exceptions,"" MacDonald said. ""This is what ICE is doing across the country while their rhetoric claims they are going after what they call criminals.""

The ACLU argues that federal law requires ICE agents to have probable cause that a person is both in the country unlawfully and likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained.

""Before they seek to detain and arrest someone, they ought to make sure they have the right person and they do it lawfully,"" MacDonald said.

In response, ICE declined to comment on pending litigation. However, in court filings, the agency argues that ""Congress has authorized immigration officials to interrogate individuals and to conduct arrests with or without a warrant.""",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/3a14be32-1dc6-4153-ab12-1dd66d6d1735/20251104T014901/3a14be32-1dc6-4153-ab12-1dd66d6d1735_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 01:56:53.760923

The Episcopal bishop of Texas said the priest, who was a ""legally employed Kenyan clergy member who works for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,"" was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials this week while returning home from his workplace.

The statement added that the priest, who was not named, has been transferred to an immigration detention center in Conroe, north of Houston, and had been able to speak to his family. In its statement, the diocese, which covers most of the eastern part of the state, called for assistance from ""representatives in power"" and said pastoral and legal teams from the diocese are ""accompanying the priest's community and family as they continue to seek justice and understanding in this matter.""

Asked about the priest's arrest, the bishop, the Rt. Rev. C. Andrew Doyle, said the detained priest is ""OK"" but that church officials are still seeking answers. ""We do not know yet why he was targeted,"" Doyle told Religion News Service in an email. ""He is working legally and his immigration status is documented with a work permit.""

Doyle said that the diocese is also in contact with some elected officials in the region, although he did not name which.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At least one other religious leader, Muslim hospital chaplain Ayman Soliman, had been detained earlier by ICE as part of President Donald Trump's ongoing mass deportation effort. Soliman was detained in July and held for weeks before being released in September. A South Korean college student whose mother is an Episcopal priest was also detained over the summer, prompting outcry from faith leaders before her eventual release.

The administration's immigration policies have been widely criticized by religious leaders, including prominent Episcopal Church leaders. At a service at the Washington National Cathedral celebrating Inauguration Day, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, the Rt. Rev. Mariann Budde, made headlines for her sermon, in which she asked Trump, who was in the pews, to ""have mercy"" on immigrants. The president later dismissed Budde as a ""so-called Bishop.""

A few weeks later, the Episcopal Church became a plaintiff in a faith-led lawsuit against the administration challenging the president's decision to rescind an internal government policy that discouraged ICE raids in ""sensitive locations"" such as churches. ICE and DHS agents have conducted enforcement activities near or even on church property at least 10 times this year.

In May, the Episcopal Church formally ended its longstanding partnership with the federal government to resettle refugees, citing the government's decision to halt the refugee program for virtually everyone except for white Afrikaners.

Religious leaders of various traditions have also protested the administration's immigration policies, with some being shot with pepper balls and pepper rounds and hundreds of others publicly pledging to put their ""bodies on the line"" to advocate for immigrants.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/webRNS-Episcopal-Diocese-Texas1.jpg?h=ada05aa9&itok=ZjAe_Psg,N,,2025-11-04 01:17:44.488327

Some restaurants are closing earlier than usual, street vendors are fewer and farther away, and more and more customers are using food delivery services instead of dining in.

On a recent Wednesday, only a handful of people were nervously standing at the bus stop on Hamlin Avenue across from Carnitas Uruapan. Inside the popular Mexican restaurant, tables sat empty during what would typically be a busy weekday lunch hour. Staff were screening customers at the door before letting them in.

It had been a chaotic morning marked by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the city’s Southwest Side. Federal immigration agents, accompanied by Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, had swarmed one of Chicago’s oldest and largest immigrant communities — known as “Mexico of the Midwest” — and neighboring Cicero, arresting at least seven people, including U.S. citizens, and clashing with residents who filmed them. The security camera at Carnitas Uruapan had caught what appeared to be an ICE agent trying to enter — but the door was locked.

“We’re being selective about who we let in today, I guarantee most places out here right now have their doors locked,” Marcos Carbajal, owner of Carnitas Uruapan, told the Tribune on Oct. 22. “Lately, we have to keep an eye on the door just to make sure we’re only letting people in who look like they’re a regular diner.”

Intense immigration enforcement continues to ripple across the Chicago area as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz.” And the restaurant industry has been feeling the impact: Significantly fewer customers are dining in, owners are locking their doors when they feel unsafe and businesses are operating at a loss.

Since September, Little Village had largely avoided large-scale ICE raids. But on Oct. 22, the shrill sound of whistles filled the neighborhood as volunteers sprang into action, warning people to duck into stores or hide inside private properties.

“We are dying a slow death,” Carbajal said. As soon as the threat of the immigration enforcement “blitz” happened, weekday traffic dropped 50% at the Little Village restaurant, he said. And looking at an entire week, they are down 35%-40% compared with any given week before the operation started, Carbajal said.

Carnitas Uruapan opened its third location in Little Village at the end of January, shortly after President Donald Trump’s inauguration, when fears about potential ICE raids were already circulating. Business started picking up in the summer, but it was short-lived.

“We’ve become unprofitable — we’re running at a loss,” he said. “I’m using my other two (locations) to keep people employed here and running at a loss so that I can try to get to the other side and just keep the doors open and keep people here. If I didn’t have three locations, this would have been over. I would just have to shut down.”

Carbajal employs 19 people across the locations and relies heavily on takeout from the Pilsen shop to stay afloat. The Gage Park location, tucked away on 55th Street and California Avenue, has seen a 15%-20% drop in revenue.

“If there are active raids in the area, you see a sharp impact in any of these places — if there’s anything going on that day, it almost lingers,” Carbajal said. “The rest of the day you’re going to have an empty dining room and the few days after will probably be slow too.”

On Sundays, Carnitas Uruapan has a security guard at the front entrance watch for suspicious activity that might require the restaurant to lock its doors, and to make sure customers are safe. On Saturdays, Carbajal and his father, Inocencio — also known to locals as “El Guero” — man the door.

The Tribune spoke to several restaurant owners about the impact of immigration enforcement on their businesses and on diners. The blow to foot traffic is widespread across the city, but was felt most in neighborhoods with higher Latino populations. The fear of run-ins with agents, or worse — detainment — has dampened an otherwise energetic shopping district in Little Village.

Little Village and Pilsen, much like Devon Avenue’s Little India in Rogers Park or Greektown on Chicago’s Near West Side, are microeconomies that rely heavily on a shared culture to keep things moving.

“A lot of people that work in these neighborhoods feel comfortable working in these neighborhoods because they speak the same language and share the same traditions,” Carbajal said, noting that his father came to Pilsen in the ’80s, settling in an area that reminded him of Mexico.

Chicago Ald. Mike Rodríguez, 22nd, who represents Little Village on the City Council, said the foundations that hold up the local economies will begin to crack when interconnected communities are attacked.

“The people who have worked in these neighborhoods their whole lives are just hurting,” Rodriguez told the Tribune.

Rodriguez said he didn’t see a single street vendor on 26th Street the Monday following the Oct. 22 raid in Little Village, an area typically humming with venderos selling produce or chicharrones. He said the raid was a turning point for the neighborhood. Locals are much more scared than they were before that day, Rodriguez said.

A certain part of the overall revenue funneled into Little Village has always been from individuals from neighboring states, Rodriguez noted. And it’s most often migrant tourists looking for specialty goods or dishes not found elsewhere.

“Those folks aren’t coming because they also don’t want to put their families at risk,” he said. “They may be going somewhere else, or just waiting for this to blow over.”

Rodriguez said some business owners he spoke to reported that weekly sales had already dropped around 70% even before the Trump administration took office in January. So it’s not all attributed to Trump or the increased immigration enforcement activity, Rodriguez noted, as some restaurants in Little Village have yet to fully bounce back to pre-pandemic levels of revenue.

At Rubi’s Tacos on 18th Street in neighboring Pilsen, business is steady, but the general fear of ICE is equally unsettling. Maria Landa, owner of Rubi’s, said she has to think about protecting both her customers and her staff.

“We tell our customers, you are safe here. You want to come, come here,” Landa said. “We’ll lock the doors if we ever need to.”

Landa, who moved to the U.S. in 1984 when she was 18 years old, focuses on the authentic flavors of Mexico’s Guerrero region at Rubi’s. The restaurant has been fortunate enough to serve a decent amount of diners, Landa said, but there are several longtime customers who haven’t been to the restaurant in over a month.

Community groups have recently begun organizing events that draw customers to local restaurants. Belmont Cragin United launched a mini “Taste of Belmont Cragin” event at the end of October. The restaurant crawl featured mom-and-pop shops like Latin Patio, Avenida Peru, El Taconazo Jr. and The Fancy Scoop, as well as street carts operated by the vendors’ children and grandchildren.

Ambrocio Gonzalez, chef and owner of La Catedral Cafe, which has locations in Little Village, North Lawndale, New Eastside and Brighton Park, said community events are the one silver lining: People are coming together and becoming even stronger.

Gonzalez, who employs a staff of 80, said he’s grateful for customers who purposefully come into his Mexican restaurants to support the culture.

“We’re trying to survive and at this point, we are living day by day,” he said. “Sales is a huge factor because if we don’t sell, we are not able to cover expenses or payroll. And on top of that, we don’t know what’s going to happen the next day.”

Gonzalez said his dining rooms barely fill up anymore, and it isn’t just the location in Little Village seeing less traffic.

“This is where we see that it’s not just about race, it’s about everyone being fearful because even if you’re out and you’re a citizen, (immigration agents) have been seen coming after people just for trying to help someone,” he said.

Gonzalez, like Carbajal at Carnitas Uruapan, also locks his doors as needed, but will soon go one step further.

“We’re trying to see if something can be done about the masks (that agents are wearing). So if you have those gator-type masks on, we’re not going to open the door,” Gonzalez said, noting that customers with medical masks and face coverings for religious reasons will be allowed in. “The amount of things that we have to be thinking and worrying about is just crazy.”

Gonzalez and several other restaurant owners compared the current climate to how small businesses fought to stay open during the COVID-19 pandemic. But Esam Hani, a restaurateur who owns several restaurants along Milwaukee Avenue in Logan Square under the group One of a Kind Hospitality, said it’s significantly worse.

Hani, who is Palestinian, has had to make some difficult but necessary operational decisions to ensure his employees get their paychecks.

“I have to dip into my personal savings to keep the doors open, but for how long can I do that?” he said. “The landlords are not making concessions for us like they did in COVID. We’re still making the monthly rents, paying our employees, paying gas and electric … all that kind of stuff. Those costs are still there.”

A representative for One of a Kind Hospitality said the company employs over 100 people, of whom 80% identify as Latino.

“Three of my restaurants are Mexican restaurants I’ve had for 24 years now, so we built an old base of a Hispanic clientele that’s been with us and loyal to us and they’re not coming out anymore because of this,” Hani said.

Among the seven restaurants the group oversees is Cafe Con Leche, serving mostly Latin fusion food and coffee, as well the gastropub Harding Tavern and Saba Italian. Hani said the ICE-related lull, while affecting immigrant communities the most, is also prevalent in other demographics.

“At Saba, it was pizza Wednesday, and we have $10 pizzas that night as a special … I literally had three tables last week — it was horrible,” Hani explained. “Normally, we have a packed house. And I had a similar situation at one of my other restaurants where we didn’t even break $1,000 in sales.”

Hani is reporting a 35%-40% loss in sales with expenses “through the roof.” A drop in customers day to day, week after week, is not just abnormal for a restaurant, it’s also unsustainable, Hani added.

“And unfortunately, if this does go past the next couple of months, you’ll see a lot of small businesses start closing because they can’t pay their staff or they can’t pay their rent,” he said. “That’s just how it is in our industry.”

Those running restaurants stressed one thing over and over: Customers who are not afraid and are not being targeted should go out to eat now more than ever.

“We’re a whole ecosystem — we hire local people, we buy all our produce from local vendors, the people that are driving the delivery trucks that bring our meat, the people that are bringing our ingredients, these are all neighborhood people and the majority of them are Latino,” Carbajal said. “We all depend on each other.”

Carbajal said Carnitas Uruapan will happily drive beyond their normal delivery areas to field orders from office workers downtown, which could offset some of the impact of their empty dining room.

“I know it’s hard for people to go far outside of where they are or where they usually eat, but we need people who consider themselves allies to really make it a point to visit local restaurants,” he said. “Grab a drink with friends, join us for lunch, tip our staff well — we really are struggling for our livelihoods out here.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctc-l-ice-restaurants-02_245450020.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-03 23:17:11.509286

,Agencies,2025-11-04 00:33:26+00:00,the Guardian,Two courts urge ICE to halt deportation of man wrongfully imprisoned for more than 40 years,"Cy Neff, www.theguardian.com, cy-neff",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/subu-vedam-ice-deportation-overturned-conviction,"Two different courts have called on immigration officials to halt deportation of a Pennsylvania man who spent more than 40 years in prison for a murder conviction that was recently overturned.
An immigration judge stayed his deportation on Thursday until the Bureau of Immigration Appeals decides whether to review his case.
He has maintained his innocence in the murder case throughout his time in prison and his conviction was overturned this year.
His lawyers argue that the four decades he wrongly spent in prison, where he earned degrees and tutored fellow prisoners, should outweigh the drug case.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said on Monday that the reversal in the murder case does not cancel the drug conviction.","Two different courts have called on immigration officials to halt deportation of a Pennsylvania man who spent more than 40 years in prison for a murder conviction that was recently overturned.

Subramanyam Vedam, 64, was brought to the United States by his parents when he was nine months old. Vedam is a legal permanent resident, and according to his lawyer, had his citizenship application accepted prior to his arrest in 1982. He is known by his relatives as “Subu”, per the Associated Press.

He is currently being held in a short-term center in Alexandria, Louisiana, which is equipped with an airstrip for deportations.

An immigration judge stayed his deportation on Thursday until the Bureau of Immigration Appeals decides whether to review his case. That could take several months. Vedam’s lawyers also got a stay the same day in US district court in Pennsylvania but said that case may be on hold given the immigration court ruling.

Vedam was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1983 and received an additional sentence of two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offense a year later, as part of a plea deal that was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence.

He has maintained his innocence in the murder case throughout his time in prison and his conviction was overturned this year. He was released from state prison on 3 October only to be taken straight into immigration custody.

The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking to deport Vedam over his no contest plea to charges of LSD delivery, filed when he was about 20. His lawyers argue that the four decades he wrongly spent in prison, where he earned degrees and tutored fellow prisoners, should outweigh the drug case.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said on Monday that the reversal in the murder case does not cancel the drug conviction.

“Having a single conviction vacated will not stop ICE’s enforcement of the federal immigration law,” Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, said in an email.

Vedam’s sister and lawyers argued that his stay in jail for over four decades negates the drug charge.

“We’re also hopeful that Board of Immigration Appeals will ultimately agree that Subu’s deportation would represent another untenable injustice,” Saraswathi Vedam said, “inflicted on a man who not only endured 43 years in a maximum-security prison for a crime he didn’t commit, but has also lived in the US since he was nine months old.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a407cbc15b94a40a300fe4bda076808981f83b5a/14_0_1761_1409/master/1761.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d4b93ffef1886526034b58377a298039",N,,2025-11-03 20:57:17.615739

""They see somebody outside and they just take 'em. No questions asked. It's just done,"" said activist Aileen Lopez.

A sign outside the complex warns unwelcome visitors to stay away. But the agents paid it no mind.

It is unclear who they were possibly looking for, but a few minutes after 10 a.m., they took a man into custody. Friends said he does not live there but was stopping by to give a coworker a ride to work.

One woman, who wants only her first name, Adriana, used, was recording from her balcony.

Pillen had previously said he expected detainees at the facility Nov. 1, but he walked that back last week, saying there were a couple of issues that still need to be worked through.
“Phase one will be up to 200 detainees, and we'll start accepting detainees this week into the McCook facility,” Pillen said.
“ It'll probably take up to two to three weeks to get the first phase 200 and then the other phase has work to be done.","Gov. Jim Pillen said Monday that he expects people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to start arriving at a repurposed state prison in McCook sometime this week.

Pillen announced in August that the state would enter into an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security to operate an immigration detention facility at the former site of the Work Ethic Camp, a minimum-security prison in McCook. The contract between DHS and the state was signed on Sept. 20 and released publicly last month. Nebraska will be paid about $2.5 million per month to house up to 300 immigration detainees under the contract, which is set to last through 2027. The state will also receive a $5.7 million reimbursement for modifications made to the Work Ethic Camp.

Pillen had previously said he expected detainees at the facility Nov. 1, but he walked that back last week, saying there were a couple of issues that still need to be worked through.

At a news conference Monday, the governor said there will be two phases to the plan to house inmates at the repurposed WEC.

“Phase one will be up to 200 detainees, and we'll start accepting detainees this week into the McCook facility,” Pillen said. “ It'll probably take up to two to three weeks to get the first phase 200 and then the other phase has work to be done.

Ms. Stagi ran after him, saying, “Dude, you can’t take my phone.” Ms. Stagi said she reflexively touched the agent’s back to get his attention.","Brice Current, the police chief in the Durango, Colo., knew there was a problem the moment he saw the video of an immigration agent putting a protester into what the chief saw as a chokehold and throwing her down an embankment.

Immigration agents had arrested a Colombian man and his two children on their way to school last week, provoking a furious response from this liberal college town of 20,000 in the mountains of southwest Colorado. Dozens of residents — many with their arms linked — descended on the small Immigration and Customs Enforcement building where the family was being held, set up camp outside the razor-wire gates and tried to block authorities from removing the family from Durango.

What set the protest apart from similar clashes between residents and immigration agents in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities was Chief Current’s determination that the masked federal agent involved in the scuffle had crossed a line and his request for an investigation. He said he even considered filing criminal charges himself against the agent.

“It appeared to be an out-of-policy and possibly illegal use of force,” he said in an interview at police headquarters.

The scene from Durango, captured by fellow protesters and put on social media, was violent and jarring, but no more so than many others across the country. Several protesters, including elected officials and a Democratic congressional candidate, have been arrested or charged with federal crimes at immigration detention centers. American citizens have been whisked into unmarked vehicles and charged with resisting arrest or attacking officers, though the people arrested have maintained they did no such thing.

Protesters, journalists and clergy have sued over federal agents’ use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions against protesters. A U.S. citizen who was violently thrown to ground in Chicago has vowed to “pursue all legal avenues” against the agents involved.

But so far, no local prosecutors are known to have filed criminal charges against immigration agents.

In an interview, Chief Current said that rather than bring charges himself, he decided that state investigators were better equipped to handle thorny legal questions of whether the agent had broken any laws, or could even be prosecuted in Colorado.

Federal agents have broad legal protections, and the Trump administration has argued that the Constitution puts federal officers out of reach of state laws when they are carrying out their duties.

Still, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said it was investigating any “state criminal law violations during the incident,” and would send its findings to local prosecutors to make a decision about whether to file any charges.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation declined to comment further. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Sean Murray, the district attorney in Durango, said that before he made a decision about filing any charges, he would have to weigh whether laws were violated and whether the agent had immunity. If he did file a charge, he said he expected it would prompt reams of litigation.

Last month, when Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former House Speaker, said local police could arrest federal agents who broke California law Ms. Pelosi’s assertion provoked a furious response from the Justice Department. Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, called such an arresting “illegal and futile,” and fired off a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Ms. Pelosi warning them to “stand down or face prosecution.”

In Durango, Franci Stagi, 57, the protester who was involved in the altercation with the masked immigration agent, said she supported Colorado’s decision to investigate. The Times obtained videos which showed how the events unfolded from people on the ground, seen from multiple different angles.

Mr. Solano, his wife and their children landed in Durango about 18 months ago after fleeing political violence in Colombia, and applied for asylum, according to Enrique Orozco-Perez, a co-director of Compañeros, an immigrant resource center in Durango that worked with the family.

“They felt a sense of security because their case is active,” Mr. Orozco-Perez said.

Mr. Solano worked three jobs, and his wife did cleaning work, made empanadas and cared for the children in a rundown trailer park outside Durango. The family had no run-ins with local law enforcement, officials said.

Mr. Solano was driving Jana and Kewin to school that Monday when immigration agents stopped him at about 7:30 a.m. and pulled him from his car. He shouted to passers-by that his children were in the car.

His arrest turned out to be a case of mistaken identity, an ICE official in Denver later said during a court hearing reported earlier by The Denver Post. In Durango, Chief Current said he pressed ICE officials to at least release the two children from custody to reunite with their mother, but he was rebuffed.

Ms. Stagi said she does not attend many protests, but as a mother, she was outraged that two children could be arrested and held for more than 24 hours inside the ICE office that operates in a former carwash on the edge of Durango.

“They’re little kids,” she said.

Ms. Stagi’s confrontation with the immigration agent — who has not been identified by local law enforcement — occurred at about 6 a.m. Tuesday, according to videos from the protest.

The masked immigration agent was walking through a crowd of protesters when Ms. Stagi approached him, phone in hand, and asked, “You won’t even show your face?”

The agent hit her hand, knocking away the phone and possibly grabbed it. Ms. Stagi ran after him, saying, “Dude, you can’t take my phone.”

Ms. Stagi said she reflexively touched the agent’s back to get his attention. The instant she did, she said, he wheeled around, grabbed Ms. Stagi by the hair, put her into a chokehold, dragged her through the street and threw her down a grassy embankment.

Ms. Stagi said she realized in that moment she should not have touched the agent — an action that experts in police use of force said could be used to argue that the agent was acting reasonably.

“It was a knee-jerk reaction,” Ms. Stagi said. “I’m 5-2. I’m not assaulting him. I was just looking for my phone. He crossed the line.”

The protest again spiraled out of control later that day when more than a dozen federal officers — some in military-style gear — arrived to clear away protesters so agents could remove Mr. Solano and his children.

Videos show officers pulling the protesters away from the fence surrounding the ICE building and cutting through chains that protesters had put around the front gates. Officers pepper-sprayed protesters and fired crowd-control munitions at them. Some protesters appeared to push officers and throw water bottles.

Chief Current said the F.B.I. had opened an investigation into the clashes, raising the possibility that some demonstrators could face federal charges. An F.B.I. spokeswoman in Denver declined to comment, citing the government shutdown.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/04/multimedia/04nat-durango-ice-current-jvwq/04nat-durango-ice-current-jvwq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 19:02:11.994611

That theme continues even after she dismissed the case last year, because she hasn’t ruled on long-pending motions seeking the release of special counsel Jack Smith’s report on the matter, which she blocked in January.

On Monday, the federal appeals court that covers Florida issued an order putting Cannon on a two-month clock to rule. In a one-page order, a three-judge panel noted that the Trump-appointed trial judge has had release motions pending before her months, but that she “has not ruled or conducted any other further proceedings on the pending motions.”

The panel said that amounted to “undue delay” and gave the judge 60 more days to rule.

American Oversight and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University have been pressing for release of Smith’s report.

Depending on what Cannon eventually decides, the issue could wind up back on appeal at the circuit court that had previously reversed her handling of the documents litigation before Trump was charged. After Cannon dismissed the case last year on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed, he appealed to the circuit court but, before the court ruled on Cannon’s dismissal, he withdrew the appeal after Trump won the 2024 election, citing the Justice Department’s policy against prosecuting sitting presidents.

,Policy,2025-11-03 22:30:43+00:00,NOTUS,Trump Administration Stops Publishing Immigration Data as It Ramps Up Deportations,"Jackie Llanos, www.notus.org, jackie-llanos",,,,,https://www.notus.org/immigration/trump-administration-immigration-data-deportations,"Agencies overseeing immigration have stopped publishing certain data, making it increasingly difficult to track effects of drastic policy changes in the second Trump administration.
However, the official didn’t answer questions about how the agency defined deportations to reach the overarching number.
Freedom of Information Act requests have become one of the only ways the public can obtain data about Trump’s escalation of deportations.
Even outside of the shutdown, obtaining data from a FOIA request can take years, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.
“Data transparency for us right now in immigration is like an oversight tool,” she said.","Agencies overseeing immigration have stopped publishing certain data, making it increasingly difficult to track effects of drastic policy changes in the second Trump administration.

The Department of Homeland Security announced last week what it called a record-breaking number of 527,000 deportations, with 364,800 coming from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and 162,200 from Customs and Border Protection.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE and CBP to arrest and remove the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in our country,” a senior DHS official wrote in an email to NOTUS.

However, the official didn’t answer questions about how the agency defined deportations to reach the overarching number. DHS hasn’t published underlying data on removals and repatriations this year.

This is a switch from past administrations — including Trump’s first one.

“There’s no accountability, no way to assess, no public understanding about what’s really going on that is not curated by a press release from the agency, and that means that we just don’t know a lot about what is going on with most of the immigration system right now,” said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, describing the lack of data as crushing to DHS’ credibility.

ICE also hasn’t updated its removal operations statistics dashboard since January. That dashboard details arrests, detention and removals broken down by information including criminal history — a key indicator of how an administration is prioritizing enforcement.

The government does not track how many U.S. citizens it detains, according to a ProPublica investigation that prompted an ongoing probe by Democratic members of Congressional oversight committees.

Freedom of Information Act requests have become one of the only ways the public can obtain data about Trump’s escalation of deportations. However, getting a response to a FOIA request can be a lengthy and expensive process.

During the shutdown, getting information is even more difficult. NPR reported that it filed a FOIA request in August for waivers that exempt ICE agents from using federal license plates, but received an email in October saying requests were on pause during the shutdown.

The Deportation Data Project, created by a group of academics and attorneys who publish anonymized individual data on arrests and deportations, has stopped updating during the shutdown due to lack of information from the government.

Even outside of the shutdown, obtaining data from a FOIA request can take years, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.

“Really, FOIA is not an adequate substitute for transparency. It is very valuable, but it cannot substitute alone for the government proactively disclosing data to the public on a regular basis so that people can track the scale of government operations and help fact check claims made by the government,” Reichlin-Melnick said.

DHS and its subagencies are not the only ones with a data problem.

The Department of State hasn’t published its monthly reports on the number of visa issuances per country and category since May and refugee admissions since December. That missing data makes it more difficult for analysts to assess the changes in the legal pathways through which people can enter the country.

There’s no data available on visa issuances since before the government started social media screenings for international students during the summer, meaning that the scope of the changes is impossible to know.

Although aggregating data isn’t instantaneous, Cecilia Esterline, a senior immigration policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, said the lapse in time without data was beyond what is normal.

“Data transparency for us right now in immigration is like an oversight tool,” she said.

Outside of permanent and temporary immigration processes, Esterline said the economic boost expected from the World Cup next year would be hard to predict without data on the number of tourist visas the government is issuing ahead of the tournament.

Over the last several months, Investigate Midwest has been reporting on how the Trump administration is reshaping the agriculture industry through the rollback of immigration programs and a mass deportation campaign.

Here are seven takeaways from that recent series:

Chicago-area raids have created fear among food warehouse workers

Undocumented immigrant workers in Chicago’s food warehouses face heightened fear of ICE raids and mass layoffs. This climate of anxiety has disrupted workplace routines and led to some workers leaving their jobs. The raids and policy rollbacks have also meant that the temp workers fueling much of this work have become even more vulnerable to exploitation, as they are now less likely to seek help.

The Trump administration is challenging state efforts to protect immigrant workers

Illinois lawmakers and worker centers have attempted to pass new laws and provide resources to protect immigrant workers, including education rights, driver’s licenses and legal support during ICE audits or raids. Despite these efforts, ongoing federal lawsuits and budget cuts at labor enforcement agencies have hindered progress, creating additional vulnerabilities within the workforce.

Policy reversals have created mass layoffs at meatpacking plants

Not only has the Trump administration deported thousands of undocumented residents, but it has also created more undocumented workers by rescinding various programs. This includes a humanitarian parole program, which allowed individuals to enter the U.S. temporarily to seek safety or escape political persecution. Many of those immigrants found work in meatpacking plants, but were recently fired, including at a JBS plant in Beardstown, Illinois.

Mass deportations are creating an agricultural labor shortage

Large-scale deportations and the rollback of programs allowing immigrants to work in U.S. agriculture legally have significantly reduced the available workforce for farmers and the broader food system. Efforts to fill these vacancies with U.S.-born workers have largely been unsuccessful, leaving vital sectors like farming and meatpacking facing acute labor shortages. About 750,000 immigrants have left the labor force since January, according to the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization.

Deportations are likely to expand the use of temporary foreign worker visas

The Trump administration’s aggressive deportation agenda is pushing the agriculture industry to rely more on temporary visa programs, such as H-2A and H-2B, rather than recruiting U.S.-born workers as Trump intended. Dairy, meatpacking and crop operations have increasingly turned to foreign labor to fill jobs vacated by deported or deterred undocumented workers.

Expansion of the H-2A visa program offers only short-term relief

In response to those labor shortages, the administration has modified the H-2A visa program, which allows some agricultural employers to hire foreign nationals for extended periods. However, this is widely considered a stopgap rather than a systemic fix — dairy and other year-round operations remain largely ineligible, and full-scale reforms have stalled without congressional action.

“The H-2A program is not the sustainable solution, but it is a short-term solution,” said John Walt Boatright, the director of government affairs at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farmer advocacy group. “I do foresee the H-2A program continuing to increase in use, but by no means is that a measure of its popularity.”

Political and administrative inaction hinders long-term solutions

Despite acknowledgement from both government officials and industry leaders that labor shortages threaten farm viability and the nation’s food supply, there has been little legislative movement. A federal government shutdown and a lack of hearings in Congress have delayed substantial immigration and labor reforms, leaving small farms especially vulnerable while favoring larger, industrial producers that are better equipped to navigate visa complexities and automation.

For the second time in a little over a week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers reportedly shot someone in Los Angeles, California. This time, it was a US citizen who ICE officers shot from behind while he was driving a car, according to a report from the Los Angeles Times.

The victim was a 25-year-old named Carlos Jimenez, who is a father of three. He was shot after getting out of his car to tell ICE agents, who had pulled over a vehicle, that children would soon be gathering in that spot for the school bus, his lawyer, Cynthia Santiago, told the newspaper. The agents’ cars had blocked a southern lane on the road and jutted into a second lane, according to the LA Times. “He was telling them, ‘Excuse me. Can you guys please, you know, please wrap this up.’ And immediately, the masked agent pulls out a gun and exchanges some words,” Santiago told the newspaper.

The lawyers allege that Jimenez then got in his car, reversed because he was afraid, and was shot in the back of his right shoulder, where a bullet remains lodged. “Use of deadly force is to be used as a last resort,” Santiago said. “Coming out to communities with guns drawn is the opposite.”

ICE, for its part, has offered a more sinister characterization of the events. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), told the LA Times that Jimenez “attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping” and that the shots were “defensive.” Jimenez was charged in federal court with assault on an officer and released on bond Friday.

In the ICE agent’s criminal complaint, filed in federal court on Friday, he claims Jimenez “engaged in a verbal altercation with the officers” and that the complaining officer then told Jimenez to leave and grabbed his pepper spray. As this unfolded, the complaint claims, Jimenez pulled his car forward and to the left, and then apparently turned and “rapidly accelerated in reverse.” One of the officers at the scene apparently “feared that the [Jimenez’s car] would hit [the officer]” and the car they had previously pulled over.

There does not yet appear to be any publicly available video of the incident. Jimenez’s condition was not immediately clear.

There have been other recent reports of immigration officers shootings. Between August and October, ICE officers reportedly shot into four cars—one in LA less than two weeks ago; two in Chicago, including one that was fatal; and one in San Bernardino.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, told the LA Times that the latest incident is “another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day in and day out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals.”

But what it more likely indicates is even more proof that, as my colleague Noah Lanard wrote last week, ICE seems to pose a far greater danger to civilians than the other way around—contrary to the agency’s claims that they require the National Guard’s protection.

As he wrote:

A Mother Jones review shows that there is little evidence that ICE agents face such severe and widespread danger compared with other law enforcement agencies that they need military personnel to come to their aid or to break from centuries of public accountability by hiding behind masks.

The Trump administration has provided almost no information to back up its statements about rising assaults, which makes its claims hard to assess. But details about ICE officers who’ve died on the job are readily available on the agency’s website.

Those records show that none of ICE’s agents have ever been killed by an immigrant in the agency’s more than two-decade history. Instead, the leading cause of death by far among ICE officers is COVID-19. According to ICE’s data, the second leading cause of death is cancer linked to 9/11. (The pandemic and cancers connected to the September 11 terrorist attacks account for 75 percent of the deaths in ICE’s history.)",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_11_03_ice-e1762204511785.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-03 17:17:13.722415

The plaintiffs also argue that the rule violates the First Amendment rights of millions of public service workers.

Massachusetts, New York and 20 other states, also filed a separate lawsuit Monday, making similar arguments. Both lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

Plaintiffs in both suits allege the administration is trying to use the loan forgiveness program as a political weapon.

“Contrary to law, the regulation allows current and future administrations to change PSLF eligibility according to their priorities or ideology, inviting government overreach and abuse and creating instability that will undermine the program’s success. This must not stand,” Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, said in a statement.

Nicholas Kent, the undersecretary of Education, refuted the idea the department had such intentions and said the department would enforce the rule “neutrally” regardless of the employer’s mission, ideology or the population they serve.

“It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,” Kent said in statement. “This is a commonsense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking, and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.”

It also argues that state courts are fully capable of evaluating the potential conflict between state and federal law.","The New Mexico Ethics Commission on Friday urged a federal judge to return to state court its lawsuit seeking to sue the Corrections Department over allegations that probation officers colluded with federal immigration agents to detain and deport New Mexico immigrants.

In September, the Commission asked a local judge to allow its suit against Corrections Department Secretary Alisha Tafoya Lucero for allegedly violating a new state law —the Nondisclosure of Sensitive Personal Information Act — that prohibits state employees from sharing personal information, including immigration status, to anyone outside of their agency except in limited circumstances.

New Mexico probation officers accused of referring ‘problem’ probationers to ICE for deportation

The Commission received a complaint, which it then investigated, that alleged state probation officers referred information about at least three probationers’ immigration status to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency after July 1, when the law went into effect.

At the time of the lawsuit, ICE held two of the probationers in ICE custody, and deported one to his unspecified home country, causing “hardships to their New Mexican and American family members,” according to the lawsuit. The other two probationers’ status remained unclear as of Monday.

The Ethics Commission alleges probation officers lured the probationers to meetings “under false pretenses” at their local probation offices, where ICE agents were waiting to detain them.

While the NSPIA empowers the Commission to sue alleged violators, the agency asked a First Judicial District judge in Santa Fe to weigh in on whether a pair of federal laws conflicts with the new state law.

Those 1996 federal statutes say local and state governments can’t “be prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service,” which became ICE in 2003.

In response to the Ethics Commission’s request in state court, the Corrections Department on Oct. 17 filed a motion in federal court that argued a federal judge is best suited to weigh in on the Commission’s request, given that the Commission’s motion seeks interpretation of federal law.

In that filing, the department did not address the underlying allegations about its probation officers’ collusion with ICE.

But the Ethics Commission pushed back against the suit’s removal to federal court in its Oct. 31 motion, saying that federal courts have routinely ruled they don’t have jurisdiction to take over requests like the one the Commission made in state court.

Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge.
In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport people who illegally crossed the Texas-Mexico border.
Also this year, Abbott ordered state police to work with federal immigration agents to arrest immigrants.","On the evening of July 1, Luis Medrano called Houston police for help after his wife had gotten violent and punched him twice in the face during a schizophrenic episode in which she was hearing tormenting voices, according to a police report.

Medrano, 50, a Mexican immigrant who met his wife when they crossed the Rio Grande with a group of about a dozen other migrants more than three decades ago, had tried to take his 47-year-old wife to the hospital, but she refused to go. So he did what he’d done three times before: called the police so they would take her to a hospital.

But this time, the officer arrested her on suspicion of assault and booked her into jail. And after a prosecutor dismissed the case, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, picked her up from jail and eventually deported her to Mexico.

“My children blame me for all of this,” Medrano said. “But believe me, this was not my intention; I only wanted to get her help.”

In Texas, which has the second-largest population of immigrants living illegally in the country — with more than 1.6 million of the estimated 13.7 million nationally — the local criminal justice system has become the main funnel sending immigrants into ICE custody, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of federal government data.

Medrano’s story is emblematic of how the Trump administration has intensified its immigration enforcement compared to Trump’s first term, which focused largely on the southern border amid a record number of asylum seekers. The administration’s focus has now shifted to Democratic-led states such as California, Illinois and New York, where witnesses have recorded masked ICE agents using force in some cases to arrest people at worksites, immigration courts, commercial parking lots and at their homes.

From Trump’s inauguration to July 29, ICE made 138,068 arrests nationwide, 24% of them in Texas.

The Tribune analyzed ICE’s enforcement data from September 2023 to late July 2025, comparing the last 18 months of the Biden administration with the first six months of the Trump administration’s second term. The data, obtained through a public records request to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by the Deportation Data Project, a group of immigration lawyers and professors, shows that in Texas:

ICE’s average daily arrests have more than doubled from 85 under Biden to 176 under Trump.

Daily arrests have jumped about 30 percentage points in the ICE regions that include Houston and Dallas.

About 52% of ICE arrests have been of people in local jails, down from 61% during the Biden administration.

Arrests of people who had not been convicted of a crime have increased from 42% under Biden to 59% under Trump.

The Harris County Jail leads the country in ICE detainers — a request from immigration agents to hold a person for deportation — while jails in Dallas, Bexar and Travis counties have also been in the top 10.

The data is the most detailed information to be made publicly available since Trump’s return to the White House and offers a glimpse into its aggressive immigration enforcement in the nation’s interior.

Legal observers have noted the administration has stopped consistently publishing detailed immigration data that his predecessors routinely shared with the public — in some cases, previously published data has been deleted from government websites. For example, a Department of Justice report that showed immigrants in Texas commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens disappeared from the DOJ website soon after Trump took office.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, responded to questions from the Tribune by citing an Oct. 30 social media post by DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin that said “70% of illegal aliens ICE has arrested have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.

“And that doesn’t even account for those wanted for violent crimes in their country of origin or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists,” the post says. “The list goes on. The media continues to act as a PR firm for criminals.”

Paul Pirela, a Houston-based immigration lawyer, said the data reveals that the Trump administration’s strategy is simple: “Deport as many people as possible and as fast as possible.”

Cesar Espinosa, executive director of the immigration activist group FIEL in Houston, said his organization can gauge how quickly the Trump administration is working compared to the Biden administration by the number of phone calls they get.

During the Biden administration, he said, “We might get one or two calls with somebody getting picked up by ICE every month, every other month. Now we’re averaging about 15 to 20 calls a day.”

That’s because Texas has been among the most receptive states to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, said Rocio Paez Ritter, a sociology and criminology associate professor at the University of Arkansas.

“What is happening in Texas is that there seems to be a system in place that makes it easier to help ICE deport people, compared to other states like California, where there is more resistance,” she said.

Less than half of arrested immigrants had criminal convictions

In its first term, the Trump administration focused on the southern border as hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many from Central and South America, came seeking asylum. The administration implemented policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “remain in Mexico” policy, under which more than 70,000 non-Mexican people were forced to wait in Mexico until their asylum cases wound through U.S. immigration courts.

But the second Trump administration has been even more aggressive in clamping down on immigrants living illegally in the nation’s interior, setting a goal for ICE of at least 3,000 arrests a day. The data shows that in the first six months of this term, ICE averaged 727 arrests a day, more than doubling the 304 daily arrests under Biden.

To help meet that goal, Congress approved $170 billion for immigration enforcement in July aimed at expanding immigrant detention centers and hiring as many as 10,000 additional ICE agents by the end of the year — which would more than double its current staffing of 6,500 agents — and enticing recruits with a $50,000 signing bonus.

“So as those new officers come on, that is inevitably going to lead to a major increase in arrests, and as detention centers come online, more people will be detained, and so immigration enforcement is going to get more aggressive over the next two years,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, a group in Washington that advocates for immigrants. “I don’t see this as just an initial surge followed by a slowdown. I think the goal of this administration is pedal to the metal at all points.”

During last year’s presidential campaign, Trump promised “the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,” and administration officials have repeatedly said they are going after “the worst of the worst.”

But during its first six months, the data show that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who don’t have a criminal record than the Biden administration did in its final 18 months. In Texas, 58% of people ICE arrested under Biden had criminal convictions, compared to 42% under Trump, according to the data, which doesn’t specify the type or seriousness of those crimes.

The rhetoric that the Trump administration is going after hardened criminals gives the impression that the administration is focused on the general public safety, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology at the University of California, Irvine.

“Are like 95% of these people arrested the worst of the worst? I don’t think so,” she said. “So the net keeps widening for who is being caught up in these practices and policies.”

César Cuauhtémoc García-Hernández, an immigration law professor at Ohio State University, said the deportation quotas the administration set for itself are pushing them to look beyond people convicted of crimes.

“There simply are not enough migrants in the United States who have committed serious crimes to reach the kinds of detention and deportation numbers that the president and high-ranking and immigration officials in his administration have committed to,” he said.

Two Texas arrests: One on the street, one at an ICE check-in

The data shows that even though the Trump administration has mostly depended on local jails to find and arrest immigrants living in the country illegally, ICE agents have also conducted more non-custodial arrests on the streets, in homes and during ICE check-ins. Some immigrants who have been allowed into the country are required to report to ICE offices periodically while their immigration cases — such as asylum requests — are pending.

Under the Biden administration, 80% of ICE arrests came from county jails and federal and state prisons. Under Trump, that number has dropped to 64.1% — which underscores the increasing ICE activity outside of the criminal justice system.

One of the people arrested recently was Marwan Marouf, who was on his way to work after dropping off his 15-year-old son at a Dallas high school in September. According to Marouf’s older son, about five vehicles surrounded Marouf’s car when ICE agents pulled him over.

Marouf, a Palestinian born in Kuwait with Jordanian citizenship, came to the U.S. on a student visa to study electrical engineering at Louisiana State University, then landed a job as an electrical engineer in Dallas. That’s where he met his wife, a fellow Jordanian who was visiting her sister. A year later, they married and had their first child, Mohammed Marouf, now 27.

The elder Marouf became active in the local Muslim community, volunteering to mentor young people and deliver sermons at a local mosque. He also volunteered with other religious groups, including local Christian and Jewish leaders, his son said.

As part of his volunteer work, he donated to a Palestinian-led charity called the Holy Land Foundation, which the Bush administration shut down in 2001 and later prosecuted its leaders, accusing them of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, which the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization.

Marwan Marouf, like many others, said he donated to the charity believing the group’s efforts were solely to support Palestinian people affected by the Israel-Palestine war.

So when he applied for his green card in 2014, immigration officials notified him that they planned on denying his application. Five years later, their U.S.-born son sponsored his parents for a green card — his mother’s application was approved in 2020.

But on Sept. 22, when ICE agents arrested Marwan Marouf, they gave him a letter notifying him that his green card application was denied. Since then, he’s been in custody at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, about a three-hour drive from Dallas. His lawyers are attempting to fight his deportation.

“We’re very spiritual, so we know God has a greater plan for us,” Mohammed Marouf said.

Marwan Marouf has never been charged in connection with his donation to the now-defunct charity. But a statement attributed to McLaughlin, from Homeland Security, said: “A green card is a privilege, not a right. If you are pushing Hamas propaganda, supporting terrorist organizations, and conducting other anti-American actions, you will face consequences.”

A month before Marouf’s arrest, ICE agents detained Austin resident Yony Perez-Oduardo, 42, but they didn’t have to go looking for him.

Perez-Oduardo had entered the country in Brownsville in May 2022 and when Border Patrol arrested him, he was placed in the Migrant Protection Protocols and was allowed to remain in the country while his asylum request was pending, as long as he checked in with ICE in San Antonio.

Meanwhile, his 40-year-old wife, Ana and their 14-year-old daughter — who came to Texas through a Biden administration program that allowed Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to enter the U.S. under a parole program that Trump has since shut down — eventually received green cards, making them legal permanent residents.

Meanwhile, Perez-Oduardo continued to do his semiannual check-ins with ICE, waiting for a decision on his asylum case. On Aug. 12, Perez was arrested at an ICE office in San Antonio as his wife and daughter watched.

“They took him away and our girl had to witness it,” said his wife. “It traumatized her.”

ICE deported Perez-Oduardo to Mexico in the past month, his lawyer said, because it’s a faster process than trying to deport him to Cuba. If he fought his deportation, he could have been kept in detention for months and banned from the country for a decade, said his lawyer, John Tutton. Perez-Oduardo may have a chance to eventually return to the U.S. because his wife has sponsored him for a green card, his lawyer added.

Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago

After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge. When he tried to post bail for her release, Harris County Jail officials told him ICE had placed a detainer on Gonzalez so agents could deport her after her case was settled.

When prosecutors dismissed the case, she was immediately transferred to an immigrant detention center, then deported to Mexico on Oct. 1. Medrano, who was also living in the U.S. illegally, followed her, leaving their four U.S.-citizen adult children behind. They have since relocated to San Luis Potosí, where they have some distant relatives.

In 2017, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office agreed with ICE to let its agents have access to the jail to investigate inmates’ immigration status.

“This agreement has allowed our agency to redeploy deputies who previously were performing ICE duties in the jail to local law enforcement duties that enhance public safety,” said Jason Spencer, a Harris County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson.

Unlike California, which has the most immigrants living illegally in the country, Texas has followed the Trump administration’s lead in cracking down on them under Gov. Greg Abbott.

Since 2021, the state Legislature has approved more than $11 billion for border enforcement and building border walls — all part of Abbott’s signature Operation Lone Star, which since 2021 has sent thousands of state troopers and National Guard soldiers to the Texas-Mexico border.

In 2017, the Legislature approved a bill that outlawed any local policies that prevent cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement, a law that has forced immigrant-friendly cities and counties to work with ICE, even if local leaders oppose it.

In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport people who illegally crossed the Texas-Mexico border. The Biden administration, El Paso County and immigrant rights organizations sued the state to overturn the law, which is on hold while the case remains pending in the courts.

And in this year’s legislative session, lawmakers approved a law requiring Texas sheriffs to enter into formal agreements with ICE that allow them to deputize some deputies to work as immigration agents. Also this year, Abbott ordered state police to work with federal immigration agents to arrest immigrants. Between late January and early September, troopers arrested 3,131 people across the state, most of them on suspicion of improper entry into the country.

In Harris County, which leads the country in ICE detainers, Abbott recently launched a violent crimes task force that includes state troopers and local police, and said residents should expect a higher law enforcement presence “swarming” the area.

“The Trump administration is relying quite heavily on partnerships with local law enforcement agencies in Republican-led states, because those are the places that are willing to work hand in hand with ICE,” said García-Hernández, the Ohio State professor.

Those partnerships can help turn a misdemeanor arrest into a deportation.

Once a person is in jail for any offense, ICE agents can check their immigration status, and if they’re in the country illegally, ask sheriffs — who commonly run the jails — to hold the person for them so they can be transferred to ICE custody and deported.

“Sometimes it’s been as simple as a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat belt or a DUI or other charges,” said Pirela, the Houston immigration lawyer.

Kennedy Human Rights today announced the release of 18-year-old Carlos Guerra Leon after his unlawful, months-long detention in a Louisiana ICE facility. Guerra Leon was released on October 31 after a federal judge from the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) on October 30 calling for his immediate release. Defying the order, ICE officials refused to release Guerra Leon when his attorneys arrived at the detention facility that same day – forcing his legal team to file an emergency motion.

Within minutes of receiving the TRO, Guerra Leon’s attorneys drove more than five hours to Jackson Correctional Facility in northern Louisiana to bring Guerra Leon home. When they arrived, facility staff refused to release him despite being shown the federal order. ICE officials claimed to have “no knowledge” of the ruling and took no action to comply. Instead, the facility called the local sheriff on the attorneys.

“Carlos is an 18-year-old who wanted to go home to his mom,” said Bridget Pranzatelli, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project. “There was no basis for him to be detained in the first place. Even with a team of attorneys and a federal court order requiring his immediate release, Carlos was forced to spend another night in jail. This is just another example of how immigration enforcement that targets everyone without regard to legal limits and failure to immediately act on court orders is harming our community members in irreparable ways.”

Ordering the government to respect Guerra Leon’s valid immigration protections – deferred action status and Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) – Judge Terry Doughty wrote that Guerra Leon’s release, “…serves the public interest by ensuring that the Government adheres to its own laws and by preventing the public interest from being undermined through unnecessary detention.”

“The fact that Carlos sat unlawfully locked up for yet another night–beyond the already nearly three months of unlawful detention–packed into a room with over 100 grown men is abhorrent,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director for the ACLU of Louisiana.“One would have hoped that an administration so focused on law and order would uphold that very same law and order when it came knocking. That it was not upheld, calls into question the administration’s respect for the very foundation of our democracy and our three co-equal branches of government.”

“As a young person with special humanitarian protections, Carlos should’ve never been detained in the first place,” said Sarah Gillman, Director of Strategic U.S. Litigation at RFK Human Rights. “But like so many others, he was snatched from his community and disappeared to Louisiana – a move we’ve seen time and time again as the government continues to weaponize immigration detention. We applaud the court for upholding Carlos’ fundamental rights and we applaud Carlos, who demonstrated amazing resilience and heart in an unimaginable situation. We remain committed to fighting for the many others like him who have been wrongfully subjected to this administration’s cruelty.”

Guerra Leon is a recent high school graduate from Spring Valley, New York. He came to the United States from Guatemala when he was ten and was later granted deferred action status and SIJS, a humanitarian immigration program designed to protect children who have survived parental abuse, abandonment, and neglect. His status allowed him to attend school, work legally, and build a stable life in the U.S. But on August 9, Guerra Leon was stopped by federal officers and arrested without a warrant. He was sent to Jackson Parish Correctional Center, a Louisiana ICE facility a thousand miles from his home.

Guerra Leon has now been released and reunited with his family in New York.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, has hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday in the human smuggling case against him in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.

Here’s what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump’s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.

What are the charges?

Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.

What is the motion to dismiss about?

Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive” and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn’t matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.

“The relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,” McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are “plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.”

What is the main motion to suppress evidence about?

Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.

In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.

Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane “consistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.” And the trooper, they said, had “no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.”

Is he being deported?

Abrego Garcia currently can’t be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",https://wpcdn.us-midwest-1.vip.tn-cloud.net/www.fox21online.com/content/uploads/2020/05/fox-21-avatar.png,N,,2025-11-03 15:17:31.814146

Trump’s enforcement efforts have unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.

Here’s what to know about the latest legal efforts on the issue:

Tennessee court addresses Guard deployment in Memphis

Monday’s hearing on the Memphis deployment is before Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal in Nashville.

Democratic state and county officials contend in a lawsuit that Republican Gov. Bill Lee cannot deploy the Tennessee National Guard for civil unrest unless there is rebellion or invasion, and even then, it would require action by state lawmakers.

In a legal filing last week, the state said the plaintiffs are misinterpreting how the Tennessee Constitution classifies the National Guard. Tennessee law gives the governor “the authority to dispatch the Guard when needed and to determine when that need exists,” the state added.

Since their arrival on Oct. 10, National Guard troops have been patrolling neighborhoods and commercial areas of Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid in downtown, wearing fatigues and protective vests that say “military police.” Officials have said Guard members, who are armed, have no arrest power.

Trump announced in September that the National Guard would accompany authorities from a slew of federal agencies as part of the so-called Memphis Safe Task Force.

Democratic Mayor Paul Young, who is not involved in the lawsuit, said he never requested that the Guard come to Memphis. But after Trump made the announcement and Lee agreed, Young and others have said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders.

Since they arrived Sept. 29, the federal agencies have made more than 1,500 arrests and issued thousands of traffic citations, according to statistics provided by the U.S. Marshals Service. Arrests have been made on charges ranging from homicides and drug and weapons violations to immigration warrants. Lee has said the National Guard would “play a critical support role” for local law enforcement.

Young said earlier this month that operations include some 150 Guard members.

The Memphis Safe Task Force includes 31 partner agencies across different levels of government and more than 1,700 personnel, according to a court declaration by Chad Hunt, chief inspector with the United States Marshals Service and the task force’s commander.

Judge considers West Virginia deployment in D.C.

West Virginia is among several states that sent National Guard members to Washington, D.C., to support Trump’s crime-fighting efforts. Last month, a West Virginia judge asked attorneys for the state to address whether Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s deployment of up to 300 Guard members to the nation’s capital in August was legal.

A civic organization called the West Virginia Citizen Action Group says in a lawsuit that Morrisey exceeded his authority. Under state law, the group argues, the governor may deploy the National Guard out of state only for certain purposes, such as responding to a natural disaster or another state’s emergency request.

Morrisey’s office has argued the deployment was authorized under federal law.

After one witness for the plaintiff group testified Monday, the judge said the hearing would continue on Nov. 10.

Kanawha County Circuit Judge Richard Lindsay in Charleston heard initial arguments in the case Oct. 24. The civic group argued it was harmed by the deployment by being forced to refocus its resources away from government accountability and transparency.

The state attorney general’s office sought to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacked standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision. Lindsay rescheduled the hearing and ordered the state to focus on whether what Morrisey did was lawful.

The West Virginia National Guard has said its deployment could last until the end of November.

While Trump issued an executive order in August declaring a crime emergency in the nation’s capital, the U.S. Justice Department says violent crime there is at a 30-year low.

Within a month, more than 2,300 Guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling under the Army secretary’s command. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist them.

Separately, a federal judge heard arguments Oct. 24 on District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb ’s request for an order that would remove National Guard members from Washington streets. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, did not rule from the bench.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/11/2025-10-17T014416Z_908606297_RC29DHARRXYM_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MEMPHIS-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 15:17:37.846082

Wyden and 10 other senators raised concerns with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) “near-total secrecy” as part of its mass deportation agenda. IAO has been centrally involved in immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump administration.

The senators pointed to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the relocation of university student Rumeysa Ozturk before a judge could rule on her case, and the attempted deportation of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala without due process.

“IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers. Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as ‘dehumanizing’ and even ‘dangerous,’” the senators underscored in their letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Reports of a recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several deportees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them their destination. In addition, deportees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. Lastly, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.

“Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency,” the senators concluded.

The senators pressed Noem and Lyons to answer questions that would provide Congress and the American people much-needed transparency, including the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

The program has historically allowed government and nonprofit workers to apply to have their remaining federal student loans canceled after 10 years of service and monthly loan payments.
The states’ lawsuit said the new rule would “empower the Department of Education to serve as a roving enforcer of the administration’s animus” by stripping the loan forgiveness eligibility from workers whose employers are disliked by the administration.

The program has historically allowed government and nonprofit workers to apply to have their remaining federal student loans canceled after 10 years of service and monthly loan payments.

A coalition of nonprofits and city and county governments, including a variety of teachers unions and legal aid and immigration rights groups, filed suit in Massachusetts seeking to block the rule. A second lawsuit, also filed in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by 21 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia.

The Trump administration said the rule finalized last week would exclude employers that “engage in unlawful activities such that they have a substantial illegal purpose, including supporting terrorism and aiding and abetting illegal immigration.”

Critics warned that the rule could give the administration the power to exclude nonprofits and government agencies that back policies at odds with the administration’s agenda. Groups that aid undocumented immigrants or support diversity initiatives or gender-affirming care for children could potentially be at risk.

The city of Chicago — a frequent target of President Trump — said it feared it would be penalized because of its inclusion on a Justice Department list of so-called sanctuary cities that the department claimed impeded enforcement of federal immigration laws. Albuquerque, Boston and San Francisco, which also appear on that list, are also plaintiffs in the suit filed by cities and nonprofits.

The states’ lawsuit said the new rule would “empower the Department of Education to serve as a roving enforcer of the administration’s animus” by stripping the loan forgiveness eligibility from workers whose employers are disliked by the administration.

Both lawsuits claim that the new rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and exceeds the Education Department’s authority.

“It is unconscionable that the plaintiffs are standing up for criminal activity,” Nicholas Kent, the under secretary of education, said Monday in response to the lawsuits. “This is a common-sense reform that will stop taxpayer dollars from subsidizing organizations involved in terrorism, child trafficking and transgender procedures that are doing irreversible harm to children.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/03/multimedia/03trump-news-pslf-topart-tbcj/03trump-news-pslf-topart-tbcj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 14:01:11.549450

Johnson, professor of African American Religious Studies at Harvard Divinity School, encouraged Rabbi Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz, president and dean of Valley Beit Midrash, to wrestle with how religious conviction can coexist with political realism and pluralism in an age of fracture. The evening unfolded as a shared act of probing into faith’s limits, its political temptations, and its enduring capacity to humanize public life.

Faith as Protest: A Journey Toward Moral Complexity

Johnson opened by describing higher education as a place “to dive in murky waters, and not necessarily to find a way out.” That set the tone for an exchange that moved between biography and theology. He asked Yanklowitz what had first drawn him toward the rabbinate. Yanklowitz traced it to his interfaith upbringing with “one parent evangelical Christian and the other a Reform Jew,” and to his embrace of Judaism as a “religion of protest.”

“It’s not a religion of submission. It's primarily a subversive force of protest.”

He went on to outline a spiritual journey from his interfaith youth in Chicago through years exploring Reform Judaism, “black hat” Orthodoxy, and even a West Bank settlement, searching for a “sweet spot between particularism and universalism.”

Johnson found parallels in his own path from a conservative African American Baptist church to more activist congregations. Both men noted that early religious formation had demanded certainty, only for adulthood to demand nuance. For Yanklowitz, Orthodoxy’s “black-and-white” appeal eventually gave way to what he called “progressive Orthodoxy—an oxymoron,” one that insists on moral complexity while holding fast to tradition. “I’m trying to figure out a way to live in the complexity and the paradoxes and the messiness of the fullness of life, and yet also not lose those basic simple truths,” said Yanklowitz.

Dialogue Across Difference

When Johnson turned to the question of religion’s place in a polarized democracy, he wondered how to teach students who know only “constant chaos” and view consensus as weakness. Yanklowitz replied that hope depends on proximity:

“When we’re distant, just on social media, it’s very hard to hold on. The more proximate we get, the more hopeful I can be.”

He argued for a pluralism that resists both relativism and authoritarian unity, invoking the Tower of Babel story as a defense of “the dignity of difference.”

Johnson answered from a political historian’s lens. African American faith, he said, had long oscillated between realism and hope: “We wanted to believe in something that hadn’t materialized.” Students, he added, hunger for honesty about “the racial roots” of current crises and for courage to speak publicly about them.

God, Justice, and the Work of Humility

The dialogue then turned inward to the question of God in social change. “I cannot imagine a more robust philosophy of caring about human rights than the notion that there is godliness in every person,” Yanklowitz said. Yet he cautioned that “the scariest people I know are positive they’re on the side of good.” Faith, he argued, must cultivate humility, not certainty: “A racist is a rejecter of God. If you look at a skin color and don’t see God in that person, you’ve denied God.”

Johnson, invoking theologian Anthony B. Pinn, wondered aloud whether God-language still holds meaning for a people “constantly acting and hitting our heads against the wall.” For him, belief remains both necessary and challenging: “Politically, I know we have to act in the world. Yet we were definitely abandoned.” The two found common cause in that tension, seeing religion’s power less in dogma than in its capacity to bind wounded communities.

When audience members asked about the temptation to misuse religion in politics, Yanklowitz conceded the danger. “It’s easy in the sanctuary to hold ideals,” he said, “but once you become a practitioner, you have to sacrifice.” On immigration, he described his own activism grounded in Jewish scripture’s repeated command to “love the stranger,” while acknowledging the practical “messiness” of borders and property.

Learning to Hope Again

The evening closed on the question of pessimism. Johnson called Afro-pessimism a discipline of truth-telling, “a way to check our bad faith.” Yanklowitz agreed that utopias were illusions but urged faith in process: “Justice, justice you shall pursue—the first justice is the ends, the second is the means.” He concluded with a story about an asylum-seeking mother and her young child who had stayed in his home for Shabbat after their journey through the desert. Unable to communicate with her because of the language barrier, he watched as his own toddler began to play with hers, and their laughter filled the room.

“If we can learn to play together again in a society where we’re just yelling at each other, if we can learn to form these new groups across these lines and laugh together,” he said, “pessimism becomes impossible.”

In a season defined by division, the conversation offered no neat resolution, only what Johnson had promised at the start: a willingness to “sit in the murky water” together and keep faith that dialogue itself is a moral act.",https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/Johnson-Yanlowitz%20Faith%20Event%20%282%29.png,N,,2025-11-03 15:17:35.146533

Huerta Cisneros was “minding his own business — not creating havoc.","CHICAGO LAWN — Fresh bread in hand from Carniceria La Hacienda, Edgar Manzo was returning to his car when a red minivan pulled up quickly.

The situation caught Manzo by surprise. The red Chrysler Pacifica came close to the front of his car on West 63rd Street, and he briefly “thought someone was pulling up” on him the morning of Oct. 15.

As he got into his own car, Manzo saw an apparent officer in “full uniform,” but no badge, exit the minivan, pull up his mask and approach a man walking toward the same grocery store Manzo had just left.

Manzo pulled out his phone and started recording, he said.

Manzo’s quick decision would end up providing a Chicago Lawn family with the only concrete evidence they could find that their missing loved one — who has schizophrenia — had been taken by federal agents.

At the time, Manzo was taken aback by how fast the immigration officer apprehended the man on 63rd Street.

“Maybe two seconds — two or three seconds — that’s all it took for him to take out the zip ties, tie him up, and then he walked him to” the car, Manzo said. Another officer joined them.

“I was trembling myself,” Manzo said. “I’m recording and I’m not sure if these guys are going to throw their car at me next or come to my window next for some reason.”

The apprehended man was “so calm, he didn’t fight back,” Manzo said, adding that he couldn’t make out anything agents might have said to the man.

Then the agents took the man away. Manzo didn’t know who he was, but posted the video on Facebook.

It soon circulated among community groups, and made its way to a pastor who recognized the man as Omar Huerta Cisneros, a permanent U.S. resident who has had a green card allowing him to live and work in this country since 1988, according to his family. The pastor, Rose Garcia, contacted his family.

Without the video, barely longer than 30 seconds, Huerta Cisneros’ family says they wouldn’t have known what happened to him. And, because he has schizophrenia, he “doesn’t have the mental capacity to reach out to anybody,” Araceli Favela, his sister-in-law, previously told Block Club.

“He doesn’t know anybody’s phone number,” she said. “He does not even have a cellphone himself.”

The family scrambled to find him.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement wouldn’t help them, even after the family reached out to members of Congress and the Mexican consulate. Family members searched for Huerta Cisneros for two weeks before Favela received tips about someone matching his description near a Walgreens in Franklin Park. She rushed to the area and found him Tuesday morning.

Family members believe immigration agents dropped him off there — possibly a day after detaining him. But federals officials never contacted the family with details, and they don’t know where he slept during his time away from home.

“He said something about ‘They said it was too far’ to take him home,” Favela said.

Spokespeople for immigration agencies didn’t respond to requests for comment on the detainment.

Manzo said “with everything going on in the neighborhood” it was his “instinct” to record because “what if something bad happened?” Filming Huerta Cisneros’ detainment was the first time he’d documented an immigration arrest, Manzo said.

He was “emotional” afterward, calling his wife and his parents to “let it out.”

“I’m like, ‘Oh my God, this poor guy. This is crazy the way they’re doing these things,'” Manzo said. Huerta Cisneros was “minding his own business — not creating havoc. He’s just a guy … a dark-complected guy.”

Manzo doesn’t know Huerta Cisneros but has learned about him through community posts and realized he went to school with his niece. The family thanked him via Facebook for taking the video, he said.

The speed with which the car pulled up and how quickly Huerta Cisneros was detained has stayed in Manzo’s mind, leaving him mulling the question, “What if it was your family?”

“It’s just the fact that he was an older gentleman, walking down [the street], doing nothing,” Manzo said. “It’s like ‘wow.'”",https://bcc-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/Cisneros.png,N,,2025-11-03 14:56:38.422497

A recent Stateline article highlighted concerns among public-health experts that racial health disparities in the United States may widen as the federal government has begun dismantling programs designed to address inequities. Many grants and offices aimed at supporting health outcomes for communities of color, low-income populations, and rural areas have been terminated or scaled back.

The reductions include thousands of research grants through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related agencies, and the discontinuation of funding for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which had been used to mitigate historic gaps in care, environmental burdens and chronic-disease burden among racial and ethnic minorities.

With program capacity shrinking and federal backing waning, state, local, and nonprofit organizations are struggling to fill the vacuum and it’s doubtful they can match the scale of lost support. Experts believe this could mean slower progress or even regression in closing health-outcome gaps across race and place. From the article:

“You’ve got declining capacity, and increasing need — which is a formula for problems,” said Richard Frank, director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy. “It’s impossible to make all that up with state and local dollars,” he continued.

This issue of federal policy impacts on minority communities will also be the subject of a 2025 MACo Winter Conference panel titled, “Federal Policy and Marginalized Communities: County Strategies for Support and Equity.” This session will take place Thursday, December 11, 2025; 1:30 PM – 2:30 PM and feature speakers discussing impacts including civil rights protections, immigration enforcement, LGBTQIA+ communities, and more.

“Like a majority of American citizens, Hispanic voters are blaming the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans for not focusing enough on the economy, especially the rising costs of food, housing and health care.

WASHINGTON, DC — UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Latino civil rights and advocacy organization, released today findings from its Bipartisan Poll of Hispanic Voters: The Road to 2026, the biggest bipartisan poll of Latinos. The survey of 3,000 registered Latino voters finds that 81% are concerned Congress is not fulfilling its checks-and-balances role and is ceding too much of its constitutional authority to President Donald Trump and the executive branch. This electorate is the nation’s second-largest voting-age population and a critical group whose priorities carry significant weight, particularly in an environment of razor-thin margins.

Nearly two-thirds (62%) disapprove of how the Republican Party is leading Congress, and a similar share (61%) hold Republicans responsible for the recent federal government shutdown, compared to just 22% who blame Democrats. If the 2026 midterm elections were held today, with 75% saying they are certain or likely to vote, 52% of Latino voters would vote for the Democratic House candidate, 28% for the Republican. This signals both parties have work to do to win over more of these voters.

Regarding President Trump, 64% disapprove of his job performance. Of those who voted for him, 13% say they would not vote for him again and another 9% are uncertain they would choose him. The issues most shaping views of President Trump include the cost of living and inflation, immigration arrests and deportations, jobs and the economy and cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.

“Like a majority of American citizens, Hispanic voters are blaming the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans for not focusing enough on the economy, especially the rising costs of food, housing and health care. We are now in the longest government shutdown in history, and families are dealing with disruptions to critical services and skyrocketing insurance costs,” said UnidosUS President and CEO Janet Murguía. “Equally alarming is that Hispanic voters feel that civil rights, freedoms and their personal safety, and that of their loved ones, are at risk. They are deeply concerned Congress is not exercising its duty to provide a check-and-balance on the administration.”

Pocketbook issues continue to dominate Latino voters’ priorities — reflecting heightened concern over the cost of living, jobs, housing and health care affordability, with immigration rounding out the top five. In addition to economic insecurity, Hispanic voters are also feeling their freedoms are under threat. The poll found that:

72% oppose the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use appearance, languages, and work/labor as grounds to arrest someone on suspicion of immigration violations.

59% believe civil rights and liberties have become less secure.

A majority do not support the way in which federal military/national guard deployments are occurring, including 31% who believe such deployments should not happen at all.

49% are very concerned that they or someone close to them may become a victim of political violence, with 44% believing that recent increase in political violence is mostly due to Republican talk, as opposed to 19% holding Democrats responsible.

41% think people fear immigration authorities will arrest them even if they’re U.S. citizens or have legal status.

“For Latino families in rural America, the economic challenges emphasized by this poll hit even harder, from rising housing and health-care costs to wages that fall short. Nearly half of rural Latino families say they’re struggling just to meet basic expenses,” said Alex Sánchez, CEO of Voces Unidas, based in Glenwood Springs, CO. “The future of rural America is deeply connected to the Latino experience, and if our elected officials want to understand where the country is headed, they need to start listening to the Latino communities that feed it, build it and keep it running — and begin working to address our needs.”

Other key findings nationwide include:

On Issues and Economic Landscape

Four of the top five priorities for Hispanic voters continue to be driven by pocketbook issues:

#1 Cost of living/inflation (53%) — Cost of food and basic living expenses, housing affordability, gas prices and electricity bills.

#2 Jobs and economy (36%) — Wages, job security, prices and job creation.

#3 Housing (32%) — Rising cost of rent and cost of electricity, utilities, taxes, home insurance, home maintenance/repairs and lack of affordable housing.

#4 Health care (30%) — Rising health care costs, monthly premiums, co-pays and deductibles.

#5 Immigration (20%) — Path to citizenship for law-abiding, long-residing undocumented individuals; safe and humane facilities for those in detention; giving people their day in court.

Compared to last year, 39% feel their economic situation is worse now; only 14% say they are doing better. Looking ahead to next year, 50% believe the Trump administration’s economic policies will make them worse off.

65% believe President Trump and Congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on improving the economy, a 5% increase since April 2025.

On the Political Landscape and Environment

Views on parties: 55% say the Democratic Party cares a great deal about the Latino community while 29% say the same of the Republican Party. In contrast, 33% say the Republican Party is hostile towards the Latino community, compared with 7% of respondents saying the Democratic Party is.

Which party is better on specific issues: Hispanic voters say they trust Democrats more to handle health care (55%), climate change, voting rights, and immigration reform (each at 51%) and inflation and affordability (50%). Conversely, they believe Republicans would do a better job managing border security (37%).

Military deployments: 33% believe federal military deployments should only happen if state or local leaders request them. 31% say federal military deployments should not happen at all and only 24% say the federal government should be able to send military forces even if local governments do not want them.

On Immigration

On recent immigration policies and actions, 33% said employers have lost workers because people fear being arrested if they go to work, and 29% say children are missing classes because their parents fear being arrested while taking their kids to school.

Top immigration policy priorities include a path to citizenship for law-abiding and long-residing undocumented individuals, including those who were brought to the country as children (43%); ensuring detention facilities are safe, sanitary and humane once immigrants are detained (35%); ensuring people in deportation proceedings have a chance to make their case in court (34%); and cracking down on human smugglers and drug traffickers (33%).

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on Trump’s unprecedented use of an emergency powers law to slap broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada and other major trading partners.

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on Trump’s unprecedented use of an emergency powers law to slap broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada and other major trading partners.

On social media Trump has called it “THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER” and repeatedly claimed that the Ontario government’s anti-tariff ad campaign featuring an address by the late Ronald Reagan was an attempt to interfere with the case.

Many billions of dollars are at stake. If the administration loses in the Supreme Court, it may have to return tariffs paid by importers since the spring and will forgo a source of revenue that Trump has claimed is making America rich again.

Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit in Washington, D.C., says the stakes are also high for the functioning of U.S. democracy and for the Supreme Court.

“They have so far in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs,” Wydra said in an interview with CBC News. “From a separation-of-powers, constitutional standpoint, the question is huge.”

Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the power to tax or tariff, unless it passes a law that gives the president that authority.

Trump used a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy broad-based tariffs over a pair of what he declared to be national emergencies: the cross-border trafficking of fentanyl (for tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China) and the deep trade deficits the U.S. has with dozens of countries around the world (what Trump called his “Liberation Day” tariffs).

What the case hinges on

Whether IEEPA gives the president the legal authority to impose tariffs in this way and for those reasons is the fundamental issue before the court.

The case does not test the long-established power of a president to impose tariffs sector by sector, as Trump has done with imports of steel, aluminum and automobiles, to protect specific U.S. industries.

More than 40 organizations, individuals and interest groups have submitted “friends of the court” briefs ahead of Wednesday’s hearing in an effort to sway the justices.

Nearly all of those submissions, also known as amicus briefs, urge the court to rule that Trump’s use of IEEPA is illegal.

The list of those who’ve submitted legal briefs opposing the tariffs crosses a wide range of ideology, geography and profession, including some high-profile names:

Carla Hills, the former U.S. trade representative and lead negotiator of NAFTA in the George Bush administration.

Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, whose name is on a brief from a group of academics.

Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who served as successive chairs of the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2018, are among the signatories of a brief from economists.

There are also friend of the court submissions from:

A group of small businesses in Florida who say they’ve been ‘grievously harmed by the illegal tariffs.”

Another group of import-dependent small companies led by a clothing business called Princess Awesome.

The owner of a small vineyard in Oregon whose lawyers say he believes empowering the president to impose tariffs in this way would be “the most evident unconstitutional transfer of legislative authority in his lifetime.”

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation, saying the tariffs “will ultimately hurt, not help, the economy.”

The submissions by the Trump administration’s legal team paint a completely different picture.

The tariffs “are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders,” says the main submission to the court from Solicitor General John Sauer on behalf of the Department of Justice.

Sauer says that IEEPA empowers the president with “a broad range of tools” to address international emergencies, and tariffs should not be excluded as an option.

His predecessors have used its powers to levy sanctions on enemy regimes, to ban transactions with groups that are deemed terrorist organizations or to freeze the assets of designated transnational criminal organizations.

Wydra says neither the long-running trade deficits nor the cross-border fentanyl trafficking are actually the kind of “unusual and extraordinary” threats that give the administration the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.

“Even if they did, they don’t have the power to enact tariffs this big. And even if they had that authority, they don’t have the authority to enact tariffs for an indefinite period of time,” she said.

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report's findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff's first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they've seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization's clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola's Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,"" she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn't able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he's been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization's clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it's much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,"" Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren't always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”

Colorado’s attorney general is suing the Trump administration over its decision to move U.S. Space Command headquarters from Colorado Springs to Huntsville, Alabama. Attorney General Phil Weiser filed the lawsuit last week, arguing the President’s move is unconstitutional and violates federal law requiring notices and reports to Congress before relocating a major military headquarters. Weiser said President Donald Trump openly admitted the move was meant to punish Colorado for its mail-in voting system. The lawsuit also names Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Department of the Air Force and Air Force Secretary Troy Meink as plaintiffs.

The Trump administration said the federal government has more office space than it needs. A lawmaker’s bill would expedite plans to get rid of underutilized space. The ""Disposing of Inactive Structures and Properties by Offering for Sale And Lease"" (DISPOSAL) Act would authorize the sale of six pieces of prime D.C. real estate and clear the way for the federal government to sell 20 underutilized federal buildings every year. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) said the revenue will offset a multi-billion-dollar maintenance backlog for federal buildings.

Federal courts temporarily block the Trump administration from pausing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments during the government shutdown. A judge in Massachusetts is requiring the Agriculture Department to use its contingency funds or whatever resources are available to ensure there is no disruption to food assistance for November. The Trump administration is instructed to update the court later today. In a separate case, a federal judge in Rhode Island granted a temporary restraining order requiring the administration to restore SNAP benefits as soon as possible.

Agencies are planning for shutdown furloughs to continue into November. As the partial government shutdown moves into its second month, agencies are starting to tell the more than 700,000 federal employees who are furloughed that their time away will be extended another 30 days. The departments of Commerce, Justice and Homeland Security as well as NASA and the General Services Administration, at the very least, sent out emails to employees detailing the extension through late November, either the 29th or 30th depending on the agency. Agencies also sent inconsistent messages about whether or not furloughed feds would get paid after the shutdown ends.

The Federal Acquisitions Regulatory Council and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy are out with new companion updates to 27 different sections of the FAR. These include bringing in updates to previously released information about required use of contracts and a beta version of the Category Management Buying Guide. OFPP and the Council said the FAR Companion will evolve and is intended to share the foundations of discretionary practices that complement the FAR. The FAR Council also said the final call for comments on all changes to the FAR are due today by 4:30pm.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is detailing military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as special assistant U.S. attorneys in offices handling immigration enforcement. A new memo directing the military services to identify lawyers for detail to the Justice Department comes as nearly two dozen military attorneys are set to begin hearing immigration cases in federal courts after being appointed as temporary immigration judges. Hegseth announced in September that the Defense Department would detail up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges. A Justice Department’s notice, released last week, lists 11 new immigration judges and 25 temporary judges. Most have military ties, and at least 18 are still serving.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is urging organizations to adopt best practices for securing a popular Microsoft product. CISA and several partner agencies released Microsoft Exchange server security best practices last week. Many organizations use Exchange for critical communications. But CISA said hackers have been exploiting vulnerabilities within Exchange servers to steal data and disrupt organizations. The best practice guide comes after CISA directed federal agencies in August to immediately patch critical security vulnerabilities in Exchange Servers.

The Trump administration is taking another crack at a national cybersecurity strategy. National Cyber Director Sean Cairncross said the White House will work closely with industry as it develops a new National Cybersecurity Strategy. Cairncross spoke at a conference hosted by Palo Alto Networks in northern Virginia last week. “We’re looking for partnership from the private sector in every way we can, and in part that is feedback from you all,” he said. One major challenge for national cybersecurity efforts is the majority of U.S. critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. But Cairncross said the Trump administration will look to harmonize cyber regulations rather than relying on new security mandates.

The White House’s nominee to lead the U.S. Strategic Command said the Defense Department’s ability to test and conduct electronic warfare operations remains limited. During his confirmation hearing, Vice Adm. Richard Correll, who currently serves as Stratcom’s deputy commander, told lawmakers last week the department is “not where it needs to be.” He said the congested nature of the electromagnetic spectrum has made open-air testing increasingly difficult. A few ranges capable of handling advanced electronic warfare exercises are often forced to halt testing to avoid unintended interference. Correll said the same challenges impact how the Joint Force trains; recent exercises have revealed a number of shortfalls such as lack of high-end training equipment and too few training opportunities across the force.

Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose a range of country-specific and global tariffs. These actions triggered legal challenges before lower courts, which consistently held against the president, including at the appellate level. In Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, the Supreme Court will decide two crucial questions:

(1) By enacting IEEPA, did Congress authorize the president to impose tariffs?

(2) If so, is that delegation of authority lawful?

Yet even before answering these two questions, a third threshold issue must be answered:

(3) Has IEEPA been lawfully triggered at all here? Has Trump lawfully unlocked IEEPA’s emergency powers by satisfying the necessary congressional prerequisites to invoke it? Or, as some amici assert, did Trump not only fail to meet those prerequisites, but also make an invocation of IEEPA that is pretextual and hence illegal for that reason as well?

Merits briefs have been filed by the parties and 44 groups of amici curiae: 37 in support of the challengers, 6 in support of the government, and 1 in support of neither (see here). Ahead of the Court’s oral argument on Nov. 5, 2025, this “bench memorandum” provides a concise reader’s guide to amici’s main arguments.

The Tariff Case Briefing: A Reader’s Guide

This case consolidates three separate challenges to the Trump Administration’s tariffs brought by Learning Resources and hand2mind, private companies including V.O.S. Selections, and several states (collectively “the challengers”). The challengers argue that Trump’s so-called “global reciprocal tariffs” and country-specific opioid “trafficking tariffs” are illegal, because IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs and cannot constitutionally delegate such power. The challengers also argue that the tariffs are invalid because the president’s justifications to impose tariffs do not meet IEEPA’s statutory requirements. The U.S. government rejects each of these arguments.

The Challenge to Trump’s Tariffs

The challengers urge the Supreme Court to reject the Trump Administration’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. They recall that the framers regarded the power to tax, which includes the power to impose tariffs, as the “most important of the authorities” held by the federal government. Accordingly, the Constitution vests that power exclusively in Congress. Although the president has significant foreign affairs powers, he has no independent constitutional authority to impose tariffs or taxes, so can impose tariffs only if Congress has specifically authorized him to do so.

• Text: The challengers assert that IEEPA makes no such specific authorization to impose tariffs. The text of the statute grants the president emergency powers to “regulate…importation or exportation” to deal with an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” emerging in whole or substantial part outside of the United States. The plain meaning of “regulate” in this context does not entail a tariffing power, according to the challengers. Because “regulate” applies to both importation and exportation, it cannot imply the power to tariff, since no branch of the federal government has the power to impose tariffs on exports. The judiciary requires Congress to speak clearly when delegating major authority to the Executive, and Congress has never delegated tariffing or taxing powers through these words.

• Legislative History: IEEPA’s legislative history also shows, the challengers argue, that Congress did not authorize the president to impose tariffs through that statute. When Congress was reforming its emergency legislation, including IEEPA, it adopted other statutes that explicitly delegated to the president limited authority to impose tariffs. They made no such provisions in IEEPA. In the 69 times that presidents have invoked IEEPA since its passage in 1977, none until Trump has attempted to use the statute to place tariffs on other nations.

• Nondelegation and Major Questions Doctrines: The challengers additionally argue that if the Court construed IEEPA’s authority to “regulate” as the power to tariff, such an interpretation would raise serious major questions and nondelegation concerns. The challengers contend that Congress has not clearly delegated the unprecedented and highly significant authority claimed by the government, raising issues under the major questions doctrine (which says that Congress must clearly authorize delegations of major economic and political significance). Additionally, the challengers submit, accepting the government’s interpretation would mean that Congress had granted the president virtually limitless authority to remake the national economy without any congressional limiting guidance or instruction — essentially usurping Congress’s full legislative power to tax, thereby raising significant nondelegation doctrine concerns.

• IEEPA Not Lawfully Triggered: Finally, the challengers address the third, threshold argument identified above: that even if IEEPA lawfully authorized the imposition of tariffs, Trump did not properly invoke it: i.e., he did not comply with the prerequisites of IEEPA that are legally required to access that statutory power. IEEPA mandates that to invoke emergency powers, the president must declare an emergency with respect to an “unusual and extraordinary” threat and can take emergency action only to “deal with” that specific threat. But here, the challengers argue, the U.S. trade deficit — the claimed emergency that the president invokes to impose the global reciprocal tariffs — is neither unusual nor extraordinary, but instead, a long-standing and persistent condition. Additionally, tariffs do not “deal with” opioid trafficking and thus fall beyond the statute’s scope.

The Government’s Response

With respect to each claim, the government asserts the opposite:

• Text: IEEPA’s language, according to the government — specifically the power to “regulate…importation”— authorizes Trump’s tariffs. The government argues that “regulate” has a broad meaning and, when paired with “importation,” encompasses the authority to impose tariffs. The government concedes that the tariffs do not directly combat drug trafficking, but it contends that the tariffs do “deal with” the declared emergencies as intended by the broad language in the statute, because they provide the president “leverage” against other countries.

• Legislative History and Precedent: To support its claim, the government points to S. v. Yoshida Int’l, where the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals interpreted language permitting the president to “regulate importation” in IEEPA’s predecessor statute, the Trading With the Enemies Act (TWEA), to authorize tariffs imposed by then-President Nixon. Additionally, the government argues that the other delegated powers in IEEPA suggest a broad grant of authority, rather than one that excludes the power to tariff.

• Nondelegation and Major Questions Doctrines Inapplicable: The government dismisses any concerns under the either the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine. As to the major questions doctrine, the government points to factors such as what it describes as the unambiguous nature of IEEPA’s language, as well as the fact that the statute delegates the authority at issue to the president directly in order to address emergencies (thus arguing that Congress intentionally used broad language to delegate broad powers). The government also asserts that IEEPA incorporates sufficiently clear policy articulations as well as limits to avoid nondelegation doctrine concerns. In any event, the government also claims that neither doctrine applies in the foreign affairs context, and that tariffs are a foreign affairs issue.

• Legislative Context: Responding to the challengers’ other arguments, the government asserts that other trade statutes that more explicitly delegate the power to impose tariffs should not cabin the Court’s interpretation of IEEPA. The Court should treat IEEPA as a separate source of authority that allows tariffs in different contexts.

• Against Judicial Review of IEEPA Triggering: The government argues against judicial review, especially of the question whether the emergencies constitute unusual and extraordinary threats. It alleges that allowing courts to review presidential determinations of emergencies amounts to second-guessing the president’s foreign policy judgments. The government asserts that IEEPA does not require the president to justify his determinations and only mandates reporting to Congress, and thus only the legislative, and not the judicial, branch can check presidential emergency powers.

Arguments of Amici Supporting the Government or Not Taking a Position

Seven groups of amici — consisting of two U.S. Representatives and several advocacy organizations and legal scholars and professors — filed briefs in support of the administration or neither party. Because these amici’s arguments largely track the government’s arguments urging the Supreme Court to uphold the levied tariffs, it is primarily new arguments that are described here.

• Political Question Doctrine: Amici Representatives Darrell Issa and Brian Mast contend that both the Constitution and historical precedent appoint the president as the “sole organ” of the federal government in foreign affairs. Amici American Center for Law and Justice argue that presidential emergency determinations constitute nonjusticiable political questions: “quintessentially executive judgment[s]” committed entirely to the political branches. Determining whether an unusual and extraordinary threat exists to trigger IEEPA requires, they assert, assessments of complex geopolitical considerations, classified intelligence, and predictive decision-making that courts lack the expertise and institutional capacity competently to review. These amici further argue that any judicial review of presidential emergency declarations would violate separation of powers by second-guessing the president’s foreign affairs decisions. The statutory design of IEEPA and the National Emergencies Act (NEA) support this notion, S. Reps. Issa and Mast assert, because those statutes establish processes for presidential or congressional termination of, not judicial oversight of, national emergencies.

• IEEPA Authorizes Presidential Tariffs: Amici supporting the government offer varied claims to support the interpretation that IEEPA’s delegation to the president of the power to “regulate…importation” includes the power to impose tariffs. Amici Jill Homan and the nonprofit America’s Future argue that the Court should construe the terms to authorize tariffs because tariffs have been used throughout U.S. history to regulate commerce. Representatives Issa and Mast, like Professor Aditya Bamzai (who supports neither party), point to previous instances where the Court interpreted “regulate” in other statutes to include a power to tax. Additionally, amici suggest that because the other delegated powers in IEEPA are broad, “regulate…importation” should be read broadly to include the power to impose tariffs. The American Center for Law and Justice suggests that congressional acquiescence confirms this broad reading (Authors’ Note: since these amicus briefs were filed, the Senate has voted to end the emergencies the president declared to impose global tariffs and country-specific tariffs on Canada).

• Legislative History and Context: Supporting neither party, Professor Aditya Bamzai points to IEEPA’s legislative history and its relationship to TWEA, because in the Yoshida case, a lower court interpreted TWEA to delegate to the president the power to impose tariffs. Thus, notwithstanding Congress’s intent by adopting IEEPA to cabin TWEA’s emergency powers, Bamzai claims, because Congress copied TWEA’s previously interpreted language into IEEPA and did not formally deny the power to tariff, they implicitly delegated the power to tariff. Amicus Bamzai expressly acknowledges, however, that the power to tariff implicates the power to tax. In the alternative, America First Policy Institute argues that even if the Court finds IEEPA does not authorize Trump’s tariffs, it could nevertheless uphold them under Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930 — even though the president has not invoked this provision. Amici Jill Homan and Representatives Issa and Mast add that because tariffs are not necessarily taxes, construing IEEPA to authorize tariffs does not necessarily intrude upon Congress’s exclusive constitutional authority to impose taxes (see further related arguments from amicus Chad Squitieri here).

• Inapplicability of Nondelegation and Major Questions Doctrine The American Center for Law and Justice contends that the concerns raised by the nondelegation and major questions doctrines should not apply here because foreign affairs and national security are at issue. Alternatively, Representatives Issa and Mast contend the statute would satisfy existing nondelegation requirements since IEEPA incorporates specific preconditions for presidential action.

Arguments of Amici Supporting the Challengers

The overwhelming majority of the amicus briefs filed — thirty-seven groups of amici ranging from bipartisan coalitions of Members of Congress to economists and national security officials to former federal judges to farmers and businesses — support the challengers in urging the Supreme Court to invalidate Trump’s IEEPA tariffs.

IEEPA Does Not Authorize Tariffs: In support of the challengers, most amici assert that, based on its statutory text and background, IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. These arguments are based on:

• Text: The statute lacks terms Congress typically uses to permit tariffs (“duties,” “imposts,” “tariffs”), and its authorization to “regulate” “importation” does not include revenue-raising authority. The Washington Legal Foundation says it “strains credulity” to read “regulate … importation” as conferring the power to tariff when the two words are far apart in the statute and surrounded by other non-tariff delegated powers.

• Original Meaning of the Constitution: Amici George Allen et al. (including Koh, one of the co-authors of this blogpost) reject the government’s contention that foreign affairs and national security considerations create an “escape hatch” or carveout that permits otherwise impermissible delegations. Any such non-rigorous nondelegation standard for national security or foreign affairs should not, in any event, apply here because, from the founding, Article I vests Congress with the exclusive power to levy taxes and duties and the power to tariff. Under the original meaning of the Constitution, the president, by contrast, had no tariff or commerce authority.

• Legislative Intent: Amici Vikram Amar and Mickey Edwards contend that Congress intended IEEPA to constrain, not expand, presidential emergency economic powers. Congress enacted IEEPA and the NEA, which gives the president the power to declare national emergencies subject to specific oversight requirements—to rein in, not expand, presidential powers. After decades of presidential overreach during continuous states of emergency, the NEA restored congressional control over the irresponsible declaration of national emergencies, while IEEPA restricted the President’s use of emergency powers to situations that meet a narrow statutory threshold. Thus, as amici former national security officials argue, the NEA and IEEPA exude distrust of, not deference to, presidential invocations of emergencies.

• Past Legislative Practice: Where Congress has intended to authorize tariffs, it has enacted detailed trade statutes with express language imposing carefully calibrated limits on presidential tariff authority. The absence of such clear statutory language permitting tariffs in IEEPA means it cannot be read to override decades of trade legislation. In addition, amici California, Constitutional Accountability Center and Professors of Foreign Relations Law dismiss the assertion based on the Yoshida case that IEEPA’s incorporation of language from a predecessor statute, TWEA, indicates that IEEPA permits tariffs, since the Yoshida court had ruled that TWEA conferred tariff authority. The CATO Institute notes that for nearly 50 years until now, no president ever interpreted IEEPA to authorize tariffs—a “telling signal” that Congress never intended to delegate that power to the Executive

• Disruption of the Legislative Landscape: Amici George Allen et al. contend that the president’s IEEPA tariffs ignore and override Congress’s statutory schemes for trade and tariffs. The political branches have established a U.S. trade and tariff policy centered on principles of equal treatment and most-favored-nation status through statutes and treaties. By attempting to use IEEPA, they argue, the president seeks to sidestep Congress’s carefully created statutory limits and procedures, undermining longstanding U.S. trade policy.

• Nondelegation Doctrine: Amicus NYU Law Institute for Policy Integrity asserts that there is no foreign affairs or national security exception that negates the requirement that Congress must clearly authorize such a significant delegated power. Interpreting IEEPA to allow tariffs would transfer Congress’s taxing power to the Executive when Congress made no express authorization. Professors of Administrative Law argue that even if IEEPA expressly authorized the president to impose tariffs, such an open-ended delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch would violate the separation of powers. Consumer Watchdog adds that IEEPA provides no guiding “intelligible principle” defining the duration, rate, amount, or scope of any such tariffs, nor does it establish substantive guardrails to constrain the president’s discretion. Construing IEEPA broadly would thus grant the president unbounded tariff power that would swallow Congress’s exclusive authority.

Arguments of Pro-Challenger Amici regarding “Pretextual Emergencies”

The Claimed “Emergencies” Are Reviewable

Rejecting the government’s and a few pro-government amici’s arguments that various justiciability doctrines bar the Court from inquiring into the validity of emergencies, several amici—including a group of 31 former federal judges—assert that the Court can and must review whether the president has met the statutory requirements imposed by the NEA and IEEPA to invoke emergency powers.

The President Did Not Meet IEEPA’s Statutory Requirements

Several amici argue that the president did not meet IEEPA’s statutory requirements.

• No Unusual or Extraordinary Threat: First, amici argue that the president’s declared emergencies are not unusual or extraordinary threats. For instance, economists and former government officials assert that trade deficits do not qualify as unusual and extraordinary threats under IEEPA because they are long-standing and persistent, and in any event do not pose a “threat” within the meaning of IEEPA. In fact, Congress gave the president the power to address trade deficits through a separate, non-emergency statute: the Trade Act of 1974. Second, former national security officials contend that, as a similarly long-standing problem, fentanyl trafficking is not an unusual and extraordinary threat under IEEPA. The government’s own data show the tariffed countries were already addressing these issues, and Congress spoke to the narcotics problem through other statutes. Third, even if the threats were legitimate, amici Scott Lincicome et al. assert that tariffs “deal with” neither the trade deficit nor fentanyl trafficking, as IEEPA requires.

The President Has a Constitutional Duty to Make Bona Fide, Non-Pretextual Emergency Declarations

Two briefs — one filed on behalf of Peter Sage and one filed on behalf of former senior U.S. government officials John Bellinger et al. by Susman Godfrey and the Peter Gruber Rule of Law Clinic at Yale Law School (including some of the authors of this Reader’s Guide) — argue that both the trade deficit and fentanyl trafficking emergencies are pretextual, and hence illegal.

• The President Has an Affirmative, Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws: This responsibility requires the president “to be honest and engage in reasonable inquiry in finding facts that serve as predicates for exercises of power.” When a statute requires executive fact-finding to access its authorities, the president must execute fact-finding faithfully, not pretextually. As Justice Cardozo warned, in “default of such fulfilment, there is in truth no delegation, and hence no official action.” Accordingly, the president cannot use pretextual bases to exercise executive authority.

• No Presumption of Regularity: While the Courts generally presume that the Executive acts with procedural regularity and for bona fide, non-pretextual reasons, this presumption is not iron-clad. Where there is “clear evidence” that officials have not properly discharged their duties, such as by acting pretextually, courts may inquire into the Executive’s stated rationale.

• The President’s Invocations of IEEPA Are Pretextual: When adopting the NEA and IEEPA, Congress intended the statutes to impose “carefully constructed legal safeguards” that would ensure the president exercises emergency economic powers “only when emergencies actually exist.” Accordingly, to wield IEEPA’s emergency economic powers, the president must declare a national emergency under the NEA with respect to a genuine threat that is unusual and extraordinary. In this case, however, amici argue, the president’s invocation of IEEPA “cannot be adequately explained in terms of” the president’s declared threats: trade deficits and fentanyl trafficking. Rather, amici contend the president’s stated rationales are pretextual for the following reasons:

• Trade Deficit Tariffs: Objective facts and the Administration’s own actions, amici assert, suggest the president imposed “reciprocal” tariffs for a purpose other than responding to the alleged trade deficit “emergency.” First, the tariffs were not “reciprocal.” In fact, the president’s actions under IEEPA generally set tariffs at rates much higher than those imposed on U.S. goods. Second, the Executive provided shifting justifications for the “reciprocal” tariffs, including raising revenue. Third, the president almost immediately suspended, except as to China, imposition of these tariffs following a negative stock market reaction and emphasized the necessity of “flexibility,” which belies any argument that the trade deficit is truly an “emergency” requiring immediate action. Finally, after an additional extension, the president stated that he subjected some trading partners to tariffs even if they proposed terms that addressed trade imbalances but still “failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters.”

• Trafficking Tariffs: The trafficking tariffs are similarly pretextual, amici argue. The Administration’s own assessments contradict the suggestion that the opioid threat is increasing, and that the three countries targeted—Canada, China, and Mexico—are not taking steps to address this issue. Earlier this year, the Drug Enforcement Administration reported that it has found numerous indicators that “the Government of China is controlling more fentanyl precursors to comply with recent updates to the United Nations counternarcotics treaty”—so much so that Mexican cartels are experiencing difficulties in sourcing fentanyl precursors from China. Likewise, U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics show that 80 percent of all individuals arrested bringing fentanyl into the United States across the southwest border are not Canadian, Chinese, or Mexican nationals, but rather U.S. citizens. The claim that Canada is a major source of fentanyl is particularly disingenuous, amici note: the U.S. government’s own statistics show only 0.2 percent of the fentanyl arriving at the U.S. border came from Canada in 2024.

• True Motivation is Trade Policy: Moreover, amici assert that the public record demonstrates that other priorities—especially trade policy—motivated the president’s fentanyl tariffs. In describing why these countries’ supposed “failure to act” regarding fentanyl had become a national emergency under IEEPA, the president cited not the unusual threat of fentanyl, but his own announced “America First Trade Policy.” Just weeks after imposing these tariffs, the president declared, “Tariffs are about making America rich again.” He also used the tariffs to remove congressionally created de minimis exemptions for Chinese goods, a longstanding trade priority for the Administration. The president similarly emphasized that the main reason for the tariffs is not Canada or Mexico’s alleged role in the fentanyl trade but rather trade deficits and barriers, as well as the countries’ overall relationships with the United States.

• Separation of Powers: Amici argue that accepting the president’s invocation of IEEPA based on trade deficit and opioid threats that are usual and ordinary, or that are pretextual, would dangerously disrupt the constitutional balance between the legislative and executive branches by removing meaningful congressional restraints on delegated powers.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1448512515-scaled-e1695254153249.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:05:19.016955

Reynolds said a decision in favor of the Trump administration would also undermine the political case to overturn the emergency declarations.
Even if a Republican-led Congress passed a measure to reclaim power over tariffs, Trump would have the power to veto it and keep that control for the executive branch.","The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday over whether a law allows President Donald Trump to implement a worldwide tariff regime, in a case experts and lawmakers said ultimately could undermine Congress’ foundational power over taxation.

The Trump administration is set to urge the justices to find that those tariffs are within the powers that Congress gave to the presidency in an emergency economic powers law in 1977, with huge issues in the balance, including billions of dollars in federal tariff revenue and trillions of dollars in international trade.

The legal questions hinge on the wording in the law around regulating trade and declaring emergencies, how specific Congress must be when delegating large powers to the executive branch and whether Congress can turn over its constitutionally assigned role to establish tariffs.

But a larger question lurks over eroding the congressional power over the purse, at a time when Trump has pushed the boundaries of long-standing ideas on what presidents have the authority to do.

A decision in favor of the Trump administration would undermine the constitutional order on how federal funds are collected and spent, said Josh Chafetz, a Georgetown Law professor who specializes in the powers of Congress.

“It’s going to be a huge blow to Congress if Trump essentially can try to raise as much money as he wants by levying tariffs. That is creating a huge slush fund,” Chafetz said. “That is so deeply antithetical to the text of the Constitution and the struggle that birthed it.”

Chafetz said actions by the Trump administration to freeze funds, spend funds during the shutdown and raise revenue through tariffs are undermining the “three pillars” of Congress’ main power over federal spending.

“This administration has been not just chipping away but taking a sledgehammer to some of Congress’ core powers,” Chafetz said.

At the same time, a decision against the Trump administration would put pressure back on the Republican-controlled Congress to pass laws addressing a signature piece of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy, said Molly Reynolds, the interim vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

The country has experienced “several decades of increasing presidential power in lots of ways at the expense of congressional power,” with numerous decisions by members of Congress and the Supreme Court that effectively granted more power to the presidency, Reynolds said.

“I think it would sort of put the ball back in Congress’ court. Congress would have to decide if it wants to legislate and decide whether it wants to codify what Trump has asked for,” Reynolds said.

Legal case

This year Trump declared a swath of national emergencies under the National Emergencies Act, including problems tied to fentanyl smuggling, trade imbalances and the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in his home country.

The administration then used those declarations to justify tariffs under a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. That includes specific tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, the worldwide “Liberation Day” tariffs and others against countries such as Brazil.

The Trump administration has argued that Congress in IEEPA gave the president broad power to “regulate” trade in an emergency, which could include embargoing trade with another country entirely. Tariffs, the administration argued, are less extreme than that.

Earlier this year, the Court of International Trade and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit both found that the tariff regime violated federal law. They agreed with the challenges from the businesses and states that the law at issue did not mention tariffs or give specific rules for how they could be put in place.

Michael McConnell, a retired judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit who represents one of the challengers to Trump’s tariffs, told reporters last week that allowing a president to impose tariffs without congressional approval would make it “very tempting” for an executive to end-run the legislative process to raise revenue.

“He has no power to authorize tariffs on American citizens without the authorization of Congress,” McConnell said.

In one bipartisan brief at the Supreme Court, more than 200 House and Senate members, including Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, argued that Trump’s tariffs “usurped” congressional authority over tariffs and taxes.

“The Administration’s interpretation of IEEPA would effectively nullify the guardrails set forth in every statute in which Congress expressly granted the President limited tariff authority — a result Congress did not intend,” the brief said.

“IEEPA does not grant the President the power to impose tariffs on American citizens importing goods to generate leverage in trade talks,” the brief said.

The brief argued that Congress has been specific in the past when it gave the president the power to collect tariffs and mostly limited those powers to tariffs on a single product or country.

A few Republicans have expressed misgivings about the tariffs and emergency powers and voted to overturn them.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has criticized some of the Trump tariff decisions and voted to overturn the emergency declaration for Brazil last week, said he’s concerned about what the case could mean for the power of Congress.

“I worry less about what President Trump is doing now and more about what President Harris would do with that same sort of authority,” Tillis said, referring to Trump’s 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.

Congressional action

A Supreme Court decision to uphold Trump’s tariffs could make it even harder for Congress to potentially undo those tariffs and other presidential actions, experts said.

They noted that the Supreme Court already defanged a major congressional tool to rein in the president’s emergency powers directly in a 1983 decision in an immigration case known as INS v. Chadha. The court invalidated the so-called legislative veto, which experts said extended to the same framework under the National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to underpin the tariffs.

Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, along with IEEPA and other post-Watergate reforms, as a means of clearly defining the president’s emergency powers, Michael Thorning, associate director of governance at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said.

That 1983 decision leaves the legislative veto “essentially inoperative at the moment, until Congress acts to change it,” Thorning said.

“The authority granted to the president has not changed in scope or magnitude, but Congress’ ability to undo actions taken by the White House has changed,” Thorning said. “Congress is at a bit of a disadvantage because it essentially created an escape hatch for itself where it could vote to overturn an emergency and now can’t anymore.”

That means that instead of Congress being able to override emergency declarations on its own, they have to face a presidential veto, experts said.

That played out in the first Trump administration, when both chambers of Congress voted to override a national emergency declaration at the U.S. border with Mexico in 2019, only for Trump to veto the provision.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a lead sponsor of Senate efforts to overturn the national emergency declarations in the current Congress, said he would continue to push for votes to override them, even if the Supreme Court determines that the tariffs are legal.

“If the court were to uphold that, they would sort of be solving that legal challenge, but again, from a policy matter, we still need to challenge emergencies that are bogus,” Kaine said.

Reynolds said a decision in favor of the Trump administration would also undermine the political case to overturn the emergency declarations.

“I expect that many Republicans in particular would point to that and say, ‘Look, the Supreme Court has said it is OK, and we are just going to go along with it,’” Reynolds said.

Tillis also said that a decision in favor of the Trump administration would “pretty much end the discussion” around overturning the emergency declarations underpinning the tariffs. It also wouldn’t bode well for broader legislation regarding the president’s emergency powers.

Even if a Republican-led Congress passed a measure to reclaim power over tariffs, Trump would have the power to veto it and keep that control for the executive branch.

“You’d have to take veto-proof congressional action to fix it if you wanted to claw back power. And that never happens,” Tillis said. “It hasn’t happened for the 80 years that we’ve conveyed too much power to the Article II branch, because we always make the mistake of living in the moment and not thinking about the long-term consequences.”

And many other lawsuits have been filed alleging inhumane conditions at immigration detention centers across the country.","A new report from Sen. Jon Ossoff (D–Ga.) has found more than 80 cases of medical neglect and inadequate food and water in immigration detention centers across the country, the Associated Press reports. Detainees have been denied insulin and other needed medications; one went days without treatment after suffering a heart attack.

These findings follow a July 30 report, also from Ossoff's office, that uncovered 510 credible cases of human rights violations at immigrant detention facilities, including mistreatment of children and pregnant women.

With President Donald Trump's rush to deport a million people each year, immigration detention centers have seen skyrocketing numbers of detainees. As of September 21, the total number of immigrants imprisoned in the centers was 59,762—up from 39,238 on January 26, according to TRAC Reports, a government watchdog group. To accommodate the swell, the Trump administration has relied on a network of more than 605 detention centers nationwide, including state-run facilities such as Florida's Alligator Alcatraz, private prisons and jails, and hotels, hospitals, airports, and military bases.

The increased bedspace has been funded, in part, by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, which appropriated nearly $75 billion to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to create more detention capacity, hire more personnel, and maintain the facilities. But even with the funding, reports of overcrowding, inadequate food and water, and medical neglect have persisted, culminating in ICE's deadliest year since 2005.

Amid the ongoing federal government shutdown, DHS's entire Office of Detention Oversight remains closed. More broadly, while the rest of the immigration-control apparatus is growing, DHS's oversight offices have been seeing steep staffing cuts. Without internal oversight, only a few lawmakers such as Ossoff have looked to hold negligent immigration officials accountable.

Outside the government, several civil liberties groups have been challenging the immigration bureaucracy in court. Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union and others urged ICE leadership to end the detention of pregnant immigrants, having received reports from more than a dozen pregnant women who were shackled, restrained, or held in solitary confinement or who received substandard prenatal care, food, and water, ""leading to dangerous infection or miscarriage."" And many other lawsuits have been filed alleging inhumane conditions at immigration detention centers across the country.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/11/10-31-25-v1-a.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:03:16.033159

""Congress has said that this is who is entitled to public service loan forgiveness.

The lawsuit, which also includes the nation's two largest teachers unions and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, comes less than a week after the U.S. Department of Education published a rule change to PSLF.

Effective July 1, 2026, the department says the change will allow it to deny loan forgiveness to workers whose government or nonprofit employers engage in activities with a ""substantial illegal purpose."" The job of defining ""substantial illegal purpose"" will fall not to the courts but to the education secretary.

PSLF was created by Congress in 2007, and signed by then-President George W. Bush, to cancel the federal student loan debts of borrowers who spend a decade working in public service, including teaching, nursing and policing.

According to the lawsuit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, the plaintiffs fear that a city or county government's resistance to the administration's immigration actions, for example, or anti-DEI policies, could lead the secretary to exclude that government's public workers from loan forgiveness. They worry that a local nurse or first responder could be denied loan forgiveness because their local leaders defied the Trump administration.

The complaint argues the rule is ""an attempt to target organizations and jurisdictions whose missions and policies do not align with [the Trump administration's] political positions on immigration, race, gender, free speech, and public protest.""

""Politically motivated retaliation, like what the administration has done here, should have no place in America,"" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, one of the organizations representing the plaintiffs.

The plaintiff group also includes the National Council of Nonprofits, which said in a statement upon the rule's release:

""Nonprofits operate food banks, serve veterans, assist domestic violence survivors, deliver meals to seniors, respond to disasters, and much more. Nonprofits must be able to identify and meet those needs without political interference, fear of retribution, or exclusion from a program designed to support their employees.""

The Education Department has not yet responded to NPR's request for comment on the lawsuit. However, it has forcefully defended the rule change in its responses to public comments that were submitted when the proposed rule was under review.

""This rule provides strong, clear standards anchored in law, not ideology,"" the Education Department wrote in response to the concern that different administrations might apply this new standard of legality differently.

""Taxpayer funds should never directly or indirectly subsidize illegal activity,"" Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement when the rule was released. ""The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program was meant to support Americans who dedicate their careers to public service – not to subsidize organizations that violate the law.""

The complaint argues PSLF has allowed many local governments to retain employees, including lawyers and engineers, who could earn more in the private sector. Albuquerque's leaders say that losing access to PSLF ""would likely create an untenable staffing crisis.""

In a statement, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu added: ""The City is joining with cities, unions, and nonprofits across the country to protect a program that helps Boston's workforce and millions of Americans in public service careers pay for college.""

What activities does the administration consider to be illegal?

One key question raised by this rule change, and the lawsuit, is: How will the Education Department define activities with ""substantial illegal purpose""?

According to the rule itself, such activities could include:

""aiding and abetting violations of Federal immigration laws""

""supporting terrorism or engaging in violence for the purpose of obstructing or influencing Federal Government policy""

""engaging in the chemical and surgical castration or mutilation of children in violation of Federal or state law""

""engaging in the trafficking of children to another State for purposes of emancipation from their lawful parents in violation of Federal or State law""

""engaging in a pattern of aiding and abetting illegal discrimination""

""and engaging in a pattern of violating State laws.""

If the secretary determines that an employer has behaved with ""substantial illegal purpose,"" according to the rule, the employer can either engage with the department and accept a corrective action plan or risk losing access to PSLF for its employees for 10 years.

In response to public comments, the Education Department has said, ""[it] would have no basis to remove eligibility from nonprofits engaged in work related to immigrant communities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial justice if those organizations are following the law.""

But the plaintiff cities, which sit on the U.S. Justice Department's ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" list, say the Trump administration has already accused them of impeding the enforcement of federal law, and that this rule ""represents yet another attack on politically disfavored local governments and nonprofits that have local laws, policies, and missions that are anathemas to the Administration.""

""The actions of these cities are legal,"" says Persis Yu, of Protect Borrowers, another organization representing the plaintiffs. What's more, she says, ""whether or not these activities are legal, is not a [determination] that the secretary of education has either the right or the expertise to be making.""

The new rule is the culmination of a presidential action, issued in March, in which President Trump accused the Biden administration of abusing PSLF, and said the program ""has misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.""

What did Congress intend when it created PSLF?

The plaintiffs argue Congress was clear about what should qualify as ""public service"" when it wrote the law, and that this new rule goes against lawmakers' intent.

""The Higher Education Act defines public service jobs as including government or a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization. It does not provide any discretion or wiggle room within that definition,"" Yu says. ""Congress has said that this is who is entitled to public service loan forgiveness. The secretary doesn't have the authority to change that.""

In response to public comments, the Education Department has disagreed, writing that ""[it] rejects the suggestion that this rule exceeds its legal authority. The [Higher Education Act] grants the Secretary explicit power to regulate title IV programs. PSLF is a title IV program, and its proper administration requires clear, enforceable standards.""

Another lawsuit was filed in tandem Monday, by a coalition of 21 state attorneys general, arguing on behalf of Democratic-leaning state governments that worry their public employees could likewise be denied loan forgiveness because of state leaders' decisions to support immigrants, promote DEI or provide gender affirming care.

The coalition of attorneys general warned in a press release that the rule would result in ""widespread confusion, fear, and instability in the public workforce, forcing states to confront severe staffing shortages, higher turnover, and skyrocketing costs to maintain essential services.""

Grace Warner, a volunteer who just arrived that morning to spot at the ICE facility, was immediately concerned.

“We’d never seen a bus like that there before,” she said. If GEO Group, a major private prison and ICE contractor was there, then immigration agents must be too.

Five miles away, she soon learned, federal, state, and local law enforcement, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, were raiding cannabis farms. She drove to one of the farms, owned by a company called HempNova Lifetech Corp.

Outside, Warner was immediately approached by a spokesperson from the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office, which is barred from participating in most federal immigration enforcement by Oregon sanctuary laws.

“This is not an ICE raid,” Warner recalled the officer saying. “This is just a drug bust.”

That explanation would be echoed by spokespeople for other law enforcement agencies.

By the end of the operation, however, activists monitoring the facility saw federal agents loading people onto the GEO bus. Seventeen workers from the raids were detained and, as night fell, hurtled north toward the Northwest ICE Processing Center, in Tacoma, Washington, an ICE detention center owned by GEO Group. (GEO Group referred a request for comment to ICE, which did not respond.)

According to emails obtained by local researchers at Information for Public Use and shared with The Intercept, local and state police were involved the raids at many levels: According to an internal sheriff’s office email ahead of the operation, seven of the locations raided had Jackson County sheriff’s deputies listed as the “primary” officials; a local police official was the “primary” at another site; a state trooper on a ninth site; and an official from the DEA on the 10th.

When asked by The Intercept, however, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office denied knowing of any ICE activity that day.

“The DEA was the lead agency for this investigation,” Sheriff Nathan Sickler said. “The focus of this case was not immigration violations. While there were individuals taken into custody by ICE, we had no part in those activities.”

“We did not detain anybody for immigration purposes.”

Who Knew What When?

Oregon’s sanctuary laws, which prevent local coordination on federal immigration enforcement without a signed judicial warrant, are a point of pride.

Though local agencies denied any direct cooperation with ICE — and, in case of the sheriff’s office, denied knowing about ICE’s involvement — federal authorities appeared to have pre-planned immigration enforcement as part of the raids in the Medford area. Under Donald Trump’s administration, situations like this are raising concerns about how Oregon’s sanctuary laws are being upheld.

“When collaborating with federal agencies, it is not good enough to trust things to be business as usual without verifying,” said Kelly Simon, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon. “We know the agenda, and it’s on our local leaders to take no part in it.”

Asked if local law enforcement detained workers during raids, Jackson County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Aaron Lewis said it was “not outside the realm of possibility.”

The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office was assisting with a large, ongoing federal drug investigation through a regional “Illegal Marijuana Enforcement Team,” said Sickler, the sheriff.

“We follow the Oregon laws,” Sickler said. “We don’t communicate with ICE for those purposes.“

Capt. Kyle Kennedy, a spokesperson for the Oregon State Police, didn’t comment on whether the agency had any knowledge of ICE involvement or planning before the raid but said State Police had seized one of the raided properties and arrested people there, then handed over control to the DEA.

“OSP did not have a role at the off-site location where the presumed transfer of DEA custodies to ICE may have occurred,” Kennedy said. (The DEA declined to comment.)

In the Medford area raids, however, federal agents had anticipated ICE’s involvement ahead of time. Not only was the GEO bus staged in Medford before the raid, the Federal Protective Service had also been called in beforehand to provide extra security.

A Federal Protective Service official wrote in an incident report obtained by The Intercept that the support was necessary because of the potential for “collateral” detainees — the term used for undocumented immigrants who are not the targets of criminal enforcement, but are swept up in raids. The federal security was there, according to the official writing the report, to ensure ICE could carry out its activities in the event of demonstrations. (The Federal Protective Service declined to comment.)

The DEA has been ramping up its role in immigration enforcement. In January, Benjamine Huffman, then-acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, wrote a memo authorizing the DEA to carry out the “functions” of an immigration officer. Since then, collaboration has been close. A raid at a rural Kentucky restaurant in May, led by the DEA, was also shrouded in the language of “active investigation” and led to immigration detentions with no explanation of how it happened.

For three months, no further information was released about the July 30 raids and the ICE detentions, including the role played by local police.

Regional media has yet to cover the raids and detentions, and communication from government officials has remained opaque, leaving community members without answers.

“Oregon has one of the longest standing and strongest sanctuary laws in the country,” said Simon from the ACLU of Oregon. “It is imperative that our local law enforcement agencies are taking great care to protect local resources from being commandeered and used for this administration’s cruel deportation machine.”

ICE Detentions

The raids near Medford were part of a DEA-led federal drug investigation into psychoactive products sold at smoke shops around the country. Local, state, and federal agencies were serving a warrant targeting a licensed cannabis company called HempNova Lifetech Corp., according to a copy of the warrant shared with The Intercept.

Sickler, the Jackson County sheriff, said the raids were part of an investigation into, among other things, illegal trade of cannabis vape cartridges. (HempNova did not respond to a request for comment.)

According to a list of seized items from one raid, the DEA found cannabis products packaged for brands that sell gummies and vape cartridges online and across the country.

The list of “primary” officials for each of the raids came in an email from Jackson County Sheriff’s Deputy Jesus Murillo-Garcia ahead of the operation. Out of 10 raid locations connected to the investigation, Jackson County Sheriff’s deputies are listed as the “primary” officials on seven. Central Point Police Department, from a nearby city, had an officer in charge of one, and the Oregon State Police brought in their SWAT team to lead operations on one location. (Central Point Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.)

Sickler described his office’s involvement as “area liaisons” to help “out of area” agents.

The authorities seized videotapes, tested and destroyed plants, and broke into safe boxes. Three people connected to the HempNova farms were booked at the Jackson County jail and later extradited on undisclosed federal charges to North Carolina, which has been a focus of the nationwide DEA investigation.

Seventeen other workers were loaded into unmarked vans, according to activist observers on site, and eventually transferred to ICE.

Detainees’ families scrambled to locate their loved ones. At one raid led by the Jackson County sheriff, an immigrant worker sent a video to his family that showed him being zip-tied. The family went to the sheriff’s office to locate the worker and got no answers: The officials at the office said they couldn’t discuss the case.

The family then called 911 to file a missing person report. Dispatch records obtained by local researchers reveal confusion at his whereabouts.

“That doesn’t make sense,” the dispatcher says at one point when confronted about the disappeared family member. “I am not seeing anything here.”

The emergency dispatcher called the Jackson County jail with the family on the line, but the administrator there was perplexed. Neither was certain where the workers went.

“He never came to the jail,” the jail administrator said in a recording of the call shared with The Intercept. “I think they took a group up to Washington — I don’t know.”

According to activists, who monitored the raids and the federal facility in Medford, the agents loaded two groups of people from the vans onto the idle bus at the federal facility, which set out for Washington shortly thereafter.

One protester was arrested at the Medford facility for laying down in front of the bus.

For weeks, it was unclear how many — let alone who — was detained by ICE and sent to Washington. Eventually, Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition, which runs a statewide hotline, confirmed that a detainee arrested during the July 30 raids arrived at the Washington ICE facility.

Only two months later was The Intercept able to confirm the number of the people bused across state lines to ICE’s detention facility.

Blurring the Mission

In the past, federal law enforcement officials working on issues surrounding Oregon’s cannabis industry said their focus was on “human trafficking.”

Since the Huffman memo expanded the purview of DEA operations, however, the line between drug and immigration enforcement is blurring.

“I think it’s fair to say that ICE is doing whatever it can to raise its arrest numbers,” said David Hausman, co-director of the Deportation Data Project and a law professor at University of California, Berkeley. “Overall, that is sweeping in more people who would never have been priorities for enforcement in the past.”

In Oregon, cannabis farms often operate outside established legal markets. Oversupply and cratering prices left farmers to turn to more profitable gray and black markets. Inconsistent regulation across the country created loopholes for businesses to sell psychoactive products — marketed as hemp-derived — across state lines.

In a recent statewide report in Oregon, all “hemp“ flowers bought and tested by the Oregon and Cannabis Commission were in excess of legal limits on THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis that is banned in some state, complicating interstate trade.

Why the DEA picked the raid at HempNova is unclear. Federal enforcement in southern Oregon’s cannabis industry is rare, and raids and investigations are handled largely by local law enforcement agencies.

Simon, of the ACLU of Oregon, warned of the consequences of the blurring missions of local and federal law enforcement agencies.

“What we have seen from this administration is the emphasis on crime as a pretext to make immigration arrests,” she said. “It would be twisting the intent of Oregon sanctuary law to rely on the pretext of some other purpose being present to justify participating in immigration enforcement.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot_20250730_173841_Studio-e1762019547893.jpg?fit=1078%2C540&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-03 11:03:48.073057

The officers who arrested Figueroa do not appear injured in video footage reviewed by the Tribune.","Dayanne Figueroa was on her way to get coffee before heading to work when she encountered a chaotic scene in West Town: heavily armed, masked federal agents making arrests on a residential street.

People yelled as vehicles honked their horn — a sign now used to alert neighbors that immigration federal agents are in the area — and witnesses said federal agents had arrested several landscaper workers presumed to be in the country without authorization.

As Figueroa tried to drive through the 1600 block of West Hubbard Street on Friday, Oct. 10, an unmarked vehicle driven by federal agents collided with Figueroa’s as it tried to speed away from a hostile crowd, multiple videos reviewed by the Tribune show.

Seconds after the crash, agents abruptly stopped their vehicle and exited with weapons in hand pointing at Figueroa, a U.S citizen. Agents then forcibly opened her door and pulled her out of the vehicle by her legs without identifying themselves, presenting a warrant or informing her that she was under arrest. As bystanders yelled, “You hit her! We have it on video!” agents ignored the crowd and forced Figueroa into a red minivan and drove away.

Her car was left behind in the middle of the road, her coffee still in the cup holder, and her keys in plain view.

The Department of Homeland Security later released a statement claiming that Figueroa was at fault, saying “she crashed into an unmarked government vehicle and violently resisted arrest, injuring two officers.”

Figueroa was released the same day a few hours later without charges.

Figueroa’s arrest highlights growing concerns about the use of force against U.S. citizens and due process. Federal enforcement actions in Chicago have increasingly drawn scrutiny amid reports of aggressive tactics and blurred lines between immigration enforcement and public safety, including incidents involving deploying tear gas in residential areas and arrests of bystanders filming agents or for following the unmarked vehicles.

While DHS says its operations are being impeded and that there will be consequences for interfering with federal agents, many individuals who are detained are released without charges.

On Oct. 9, federal prosecutors on Thursday dismissed felony charges against an Oak Park man with intellectual disabilities accused of assaulting federal officers during a protest outside the Broadview immigration holding facility. A day earlier, a federal grand jury refused to indict a Chicago couple arrested during a violent protest outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview in September. And a WGN producer violently arrested by ICE in Lincoln Square on Oct. 10 was detained for seven hours by federal immigration authorities before being released without charges, according to her attorney.

Meanwhile, federal agents face questions from judges over possible violations of court orders limiting the use of force against civilians and media in Illinois.

According to Figueroa, after getting arrested, she was transported to multiple undisclosed locations, and repeatedly denied contact with family or legal counsel.

“I was in shock and terrified. The video evidence is clear: Agents crashed into me. I was not involved in any protest or related activity, and I intend to seek justice for how I was treated,” Figueroa told the Tribune.

For hours, her family couldn’t locate her. Only after coming across a video online did they realize that Figueroa had been taken by masked federal agents through video circulating the web. They were able to ping her through her iPhone location at the ICE processing center in Broadview.

Her mother said she was shocked and “desperately worried.” Figueroa had kidney surgery in August, and the way agents pulled her out of the vehicle and threw her on the ground “deeply concerned me,” her mother, Teresita Figueroa, told the Tribune.

But what stunned Teresita Figueroa the most was that despite her daughter being a U.S. citizen, the family couldn’t locate her. She said no authorities, including the Chicago police, were able to give them clarity on why her daughter was arrested.

Teresita Figueroa said her daughter is a loving mother of a 5-year-old boy and an aspiring lawyer working as a paralegal. Her record shows nothing more than a few minor traffic violations, the Tribune found. Her family started a fundraiser to cover medical and legal expenses.

“I was extremely worried because I know ICE agents are heartless and reckless. They had just killed a man in Franklin Park. I worried that they could hurt my daughter,” Teresita Figueroa said. “Those hours (looking for her) were agonizing.”

Daniel Hogan, a witness who recorded the collision involving Dayanne Figueroa, called 911 after the agents left. Figueroa’s car was left damaged and blocking other vehicles in the middle of the street, he said. Chicago police later located her car, parked it and traced her license plate to identify Figueroa.

“Of course she resisted,” Hogan said about the moment the agents grabbed her. “She did nothing wrong. They never told her why they were taking her. They came at her with guns. She was scared.”

In an email statement, Chicago police confirmed they had attended to a call and said they were investigating the crash but did not provide further details. The police’s news affairs office also confirmed that CPD took a traffic report from Figueroa in which she said her car was sideswiped by a Jeep she attempted to pass, and that no injuries were reported.

Dayanne Figueroa was released from ICE custody that same day, at around 4 p.m., and returned home shaken.

Teresita Figueroa said she picked up her daughter from an ambulance in a parking lot in Lombard, a suburb west of Chicago. Her daughter was “very injured, in shock, and bleeding from her surgery,” she said. They had to rush Dayanne Figueroa to a nearby hospital to get checked.

DHS, however, maintains that Figueroa was taken into custody because she “violently resisted” arrest.

In a statement to the Tribune, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin alleged that Figueroa “used her vehicle to block in agents, honking her horn,” and that she “stuck an unmarked government vehicle” as agents were departing.

“In fear of public safety and of law enforcement, officers attempted to remove her from the vehicle. She violently resisted, kicking two agents and causing injuries. This agitator was arrested for assault on a federal agent,” McLaughlin said.

A spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not answer questions about the nature of the injuries McLaughlin said the agents suffered or whether the agency reviewed video footage before McLaughlin issued her statement. The officers who arrested Figueroa do not appear injured in video footage reviewed by the Tribune.

McLaughlin said the confrontation “reflects a growing and dangerous trend of illegal aliens violently resisting arrest and agitators and criminals ramming cars into our law enforcement officers.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ctc-us-citizen-arrested-ICE-22_245503650.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-03 13:05:27.268215

Court: Grand Court (Cayman Islands)

Subject: Application to stay proceedings on the ground of forum non conveniens

Judges: Doyle J

Summary

The decision highlights the need to obtain reasoned expert evidence in support of applications to stay proceedings on forum non conveniens grounds.

The Plaintiffs existed under the laws of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) respectively, while the Defendant was Cayman incorporated. The Plantiffs alleged breaches of duties by a former manager and unlawful means conspiracy, unlawful interference with the Plaintiffs' business and dishonest assistance in breaches of fiduciary duty by the Defendant. The Defendant applied to stay the Cayman proceedings on forum non conveniens grounds in favour of the KSA or DIFC. Applying the Spiliada test, the Defendant's stay application was dismissed.

Further details

Under the Spiliada test, first it is necessary to show that the foreign forum is 'available', meaning it has jurisdiction (personal and subject matter). Next, the court must consider whether it is the most appropriate, by reference to connecting factors. Even if more appropriate, the Cayman court can retain jurisdiction if the plaintiff shows by cogent evidence that there is a real risk that it will not be able to obtain substantial justice. The Defendant, being incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, was served as of right and had the burden of showing the Spiliada test was satisfied.

It is worth bearing in mind certain dicta highlighted by Doyle J: 'An expert must explain the basis of his or her evidence when it is not a personal observation or sensation; mere assertion or ""bare ipse dixit"" carries little weight … If anything, the suggestion that an unsubstantiated ipse dixit carries little weight is understated; in our view such evidence is worthless …' and 'what carries weight is the reasoning, not the conclusion': Kennedy v Coria (Services) LLP [2016] 1 WLR 597; [2016] UKSC 6.

The Defendant sought to rely on the DIFC being an alternative available forum due to a shareholders agreement and arbitration clause referring to arbitration under DIFC/LCIA Rules in Dubai at the DIFC. However, the Defendant was not a party to the arbitration agreement and had not adduced expert evidence on DIFC law and DIFC and Dubai arbitration, law and procedure. Accordingly, the Defendant failed to discharge its burden under the Spiliada test. Further, the argument was raised late and it would not be fair to permit the Defendant to take the DIFC point.

Both parties adduced expert evidence on whether KSA was an available alternative jurisdiction. The Court found the Defendant's expert evidence to be unsupported by authority and, in parts, textually inaccurate, and preferred the Plaintiffs' expert evidence, which was supported by detailed reasoning and properly translated materials.

The Plaintiffs' expert demonstrated that KSA was not an available jurisdiction because:

the Defendant had no residence in KSA;

the claims did not involve any obligation that originated or was enforceable in KSA; and

there were no contractual provisions pointing to enforcement in KSA.

The Defendant relied on Al-Aggad v Al-Aggad [2024] 4 WLR 35, arguing that where there is a conflict in expert evidence that the court cannot resolve, principles of comity require the court to assume that the foreign forum is capable of delivering justice. The Court rejected that argument, holding that the Defendant had conflated the availability of a forum with access to justice, and had failed to prove that KSA was, in fact, an available alternative forum.

Two federal judges ruled Friday that the Department of Agriculture must partially disburse funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and ordered the Trump administration to provide an update by today. Food banks and nonprofits nationwide are scrambling to meet the needs of 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, whose SNAP benefits were cut off over the weekend.

On Friday, President Trump held a lavish Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago just hours before tens of millions of people lost SNAP benefits. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy wrote on social media, “The way he rubs his inhumanity in Americans’ face never ceases to stun me. He’s illegally refusing to pay food stamp benefits… …while he throws a ridiculously over the top Gatsby party for his right wing millionaire and corporate friends.”

Meanwhile, nearly 13,000 air traffic controllers are working without pay due to the shutdown. CNN reports there have been 98 “staffing trigger” reports at airports since Friday, meaning air traffic controllers had to alter operations due to staff shortages.

Israel is continuing to carry out attacks in Gaza, shelling eastern areas of Deir al-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp. Israel has killed at least 236 Palestinians since the ceasefire went into effect on October 10. Officials in Gaza have accused Israel of also violating the ceasefire by allowing into Gaza just 24% of the aid trucks promised under the deal.

On Sunday, Hamas returned the bodies of three more Israeli soldiers who were killed during the October 7 attack.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces and settlers killed two Palestinians early today. Israel also detained at least 15 Palestinians in overnight raids. On Friday, mourners gathered near Ramallah for the funeral of 15-year-old Yamen Samed Hamed, who was killed in an Israeli raid. This is Laila Ghannam, the governor of Ramallah.

Gov. Laila Ghannam: “The genocide continues, not only in Gaza, but in all of Palestine, because they want to say to all the world, 'We are in control. We occupy all the world, not only Palestine.' There are daily executions. This is a child who was executed, like our children, our women and our elders were executed in cold blood, because those who do not fear punishment will misbehave. The world should take a stand.”

The former top lawyer of the Israeli military has been arrested for her role in the leak of surveillance video that showed Israeli soldiers gang-raping a Palestinian prisoner at the Sde Teiman prison last year. The military lawyer, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, was arrested after being reported missing on Sunday. She resigned last week. Five of the Israeli soldiers seen in the video were criminally prosecuted. At the time, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the soldiers should be treated like “heroes, not villains.”

On Saturday, the U.S. bombed another boat in the Caribbean, killing at least three people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the boat was carrying drugs, but offered no proof. The U.S. has now bombed 15 boats, killing at least 64 people, over the past two months. U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk has denounced the U.S. attacks. Türk’s spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, spoke on Friday.

Ravina Shamdasani: “These attacks and their mounting human costs are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”

In related news, The Washington Post reports the Justice Department has told lawmakers that the War Powers Resolution does not apply to the boat strikes because U.S. service members have not been put in harm’s way. Former State Department lawyer Brian Finucane told The Washington Post, “It’s a wild claim of executive authority.”

This comes as the U.S. continues to amass more ships and aircraft near Venezuela. During an interview on “60 Minutes,” CBS’s Norah O’Donnell questioned Trump about Venezuela.

Norah O’Donnell: “On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro’s days as president numbered?”

President Donald Trump: “I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.”

Norah O’Donnell: “And this issue of potential land strikes in Venezuela, is that true?”

President Donald Trump: “I don’t tell you that. I mean, I’m not saying it’s true or untrue.”

President Trump is threatening military intervention in Nigeria, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians. In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote in part, “The U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, 'guns-a-blazing,' … If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth replied to the post by writing, “Yes sir.” Speaking to reporters yesterday, President Trump again vowed to take action in Nigeria.

President Donald Trump: “They’re killing record numbers of Christians in Nigeria. And they have other countries very bad also, you know, the — that part of the world, very bad. They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers. We’re not going to allow that to happen.”

But organizations monitoring violence in the region say there is no evidence to suggest that Christians are killed more than other religious groups in Nigeria. This is Malik Samuel, a senior researcher at Good Governance Africa.

Malik Samuel: “This is not a Christian genocide, because the facts don’t support it. If you look at the areas where this conflict is rife, even in the — even if you take Borno state alone, you look at northern Borno, many of these communities are Muslim-dominated. So most of the victims of Boko Haram violence are Muslims.”

The head of the Red Cross says history is repeating itself in Sudan’s Darfur region after reports of mass killings by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group in the city of El Fasher. It comes as Sudan’s government says the RSF has killed at least 2,000 people since the paramilitary group has seized control of El Fasher, but witnesses say the death toll could be much higher, as tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the city.

As the Trump administration works to bring the nation’s largest food aid program back online, attention is shifting to just how expansive the program has become and to the administration’s push to ensure illegal immigrants aren’t among its recipients.

Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), meant to be a lifeline for low-income households, was set to expire over the weekend as the government shutdown entered its second month.

CHARTS ILLUSTRATE THE SCALE OF SNAP AS MILLIONS FACE POTENTIAL BENEFIT LAPSE

The sweeping program, which supports more than 40 million Americans, was among the first priorities Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins targeted for review, citing concerns about eligibility and oversight.

""We sent letters to every governor in America being very clear that no illegal aliens can use SNAP, zero, zero, zero. We asked every state for the first time in history, this was in February, to send us their data,"" Rollins said during an interview on ""Fox & Friends Weekend.""

She added that so far only 29 states have complied with the request, but Rollins said even that limited data has already revealed significant misuse.

""We have found thousands and thousands of illegal use of the EBT card, we have been moving people off of SNAP, we've got about 700,000 people that we've moved off SNAP since the president took office, and we've arrested about 118 people,"" Rollins said.

She added that investigators also discovered about 5,000 dead people who were still receiving benefits.

""It is time to drastically reform this program, so that we can make sure that those who are truly needy and truly vulnerable are getting what they need and the rest of the corruption goes away so that we can serve the American taxpayer,"" she added.

‘THAT ENDS NOW:’ WHITE HOUSE VOWS REMOVAL OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM TAXPAYER BENEFITS

Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) says about 41.7 million Americans, or one in eight households, rely on SNAP benefits each month.

The highest share of beneficiaries live in New Mexico, Washington, D.C. and Louisiana, followed by Oregon, according to USDA data.

Under former President Joe Biden, federal spending on SNAP reached record highs, $128 billion in 2021 and $127 billion in 2022, as pandemic-era aid expanded food assistance. Last year, SNAP cost $99.8 billion, with monthly benefits averaging $187 per participant, according to federal figures.

FOOD STAMP BENEFITS FOR 42 MILLION AMERICANS IN JEOPARDY AS SHUTDOWN DRAGS ON

Adults ages 18 to 59 made up the largest share of SNAP recipients at 42%, according to USDA data. Many participants also relied on other government assistance, with 61% receiving income from programs such as Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or state aid.

With millions of Americans depending on SNAP for food assistance, the program has become a focal point in the legal and political battles over government spending during the shutdown.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, has hearings on Dec. 8-9 in the human smuggling case against him in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence. The hearing was originally scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. A brief entry from the judge in the electronic docket does not explain the reason for the change after a nonpublic status conference between the judge and the attorneys on Friday. However, the two sides have been fighting over what documents and testimony the government will be required to provide to Abrego Garcia as he tries to prove the charges against him were motivated by a desire to punish him for the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

Here’s what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump’s Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.

What are the charges?

Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.

What is the motion to dismiss about?

Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive” and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern.” Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn’t matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.

“The relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,” McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are “plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.”

What is the main motion to suppress evidence about?

Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.

In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.

Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane “consistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.” And the trooper, they said, had “no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.”

Is he being deported?

Abrego Garcia currently can’t be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",https://www.pressdemocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Deportation_Error-Abrego_Garcia-What_to_Know_78226-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-11-03 11:03:39.411357

Episode Transcript

Jerry Maatman: Thank you, loyal blog listeners and readers, for being here again for our next episode of the Class Action Weekly Wire. I'm Jerry Maatman, a partner at Duane Morris, and joining me today is my colleague, Tyler Zmick. Thanks so much for being on our podcast today.

Tyler Zmick: Great to be here, Jerry. Thank you for having me.

Jerry: Today, we're diving into a recent class action settlement in Illinois under the Biometric Information Privacy Act, known as BIPA, and a case that centered around a dispute between 7,700 current and former employees of Speedway over biometric data collection. Last Wednesday, the court here in Chicago gave final approval to a class action settlement worth $12.1 million. Tyler, let's break it down and give our listeners a quick overview of what this litigation was all about.

Tyler: Sure thing. So, this is actually one of the older BIPA class actions that was filed back in 2017 by a lead plaintiff named Christopher Howe. Mr. Howe alleged that Speedway, the convenience store and gas station, required its employees to scan their fingerprints to clock in and out of work without providing informed consent, which is required by the statute. And so, therefore, the lawsuit claimed that Speedway violated BIPA, and the statute, as we all know, requires companies to get written, informed consent from individuals before it collects their biometric data, including fingerprints or facial scans. And the plaintiff alleged that he never received any kind of explanation about the biometric collection, and did not provide any written consent.

Jerry: So, this is a classic BIPA case, kind of that got-you situation, where either you did or you didn't provide informed consent to workers regarding the collection of their biometric data. But here, the settlement certainly is very significant from a monetary standpoint, and it follows on the heels of pretty extensive litigation, as you had mentioned, back to 2017. In your mind, what were some of the key turning points in the litigation that led to this settlement?

Tyler: Right, so, as you mentioned, getting to the settlement in this particular case was a very long journey. The case hit a major milestone last September of 2024, when the Northern District of Illinois denied Speedway's motion for summary judgment and granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. In its summary judgment motion, Speedway had argued that the fingerprint scans used with the timekeeping system did not qualify as biometric data under BIPA, because they were just partial prints, not full fingerprints. The court rejected that argument, stating that partial fingerprints are still covered under the statute. And the court also dismissed Speedway's argument that its potential damages, which ranged from $14.4 million to $72 million, were disproportionate to the harm, and therefore, a class could not be certified. The court basically said that, look, if a company's misconduct is so extensive that the penalties may be high, that is still no excuse for a defendant to claim that its damages are so excessive just because it violated the statute that many times.

Jerry: Despite all that, Speedway, however, was able to settle the case for $12.1 million. What can you tell us from the public filings about the terms of the settlement?

Tyler: So, as you mentioned, Jerry, the settlement includes a $12.1 million settlement fund, which will be divided among the 7,700 class members who worked at Speedway gas stations in Illinois between 2012 and 2017. The class members will each receive an equal prorated share, minus administrative costs, attorneys' fees, and incentive award for the class representative, and importantly—and this is somewhat noteworthy—the settlement includes an attorney fee award of $4.5 million for the plaintiffs' counsel. The court approved that amount, saying that the amounts are reasonable given the complexity and length of the litigation.

Jerry: I know our listeners recognize your name for thought leadership in the BIPA area, probably knowing as much, if not more, about BIPA rulings and BIPA settlements than any attorney in the Chicago area. What is your take in terms of the value of the settlement, the amount of money that the plaintiffs were able to garner here, compared and benchmarked towards other BIPA-related settlements?

Tyler: In my opinion, this settlement is fairly typical of a large BIPA class action, especially one involving a fingerprint-based timekeeping system, which, is more straightforwardly biometric than maybe other fact patterns will present. But this is a typical settlement when you consider the risks and costs involved of continuing litigation and a potential appeal. As we've seen in this case, litigation can drag on for years, and there is a degree of unpredictability. So, in this case, for the plaintiff and class members, a $12.1 million settlement ensures that they get a large amount of compensation without any further risks, and without the expense of trial and potential appeal. And the fact that there were no objections to the settlement from class members is a strong indicator that the settlement was viewed as fair by those involved.

Jerry: Well, not unlike taxes, the cost of settlements and class action litigation keeps rising. What does this tell employers and companies dealing with BIPA-related litigation about the state of class action settlements in this area and what the plaintiffs' bar is trying to do with BIPA-related settlements?

Tyler: Well, that's a great question. BIPA class actions are not being filed to the extent that they have been filed in previous years. That being said, BIPA continues to be a major issue in Illinois, and we are still seeing many class actions come up under the statute. So, as always, companies that collect biometric data, or potentially biometric data, need to be very diligent about complying with the statute's notice and consent requirements. And this case really highlights the significant financial risks that companies face if they fail to follow the law to the T, especially since damages for these older cases can be awarded per violation.

Jerry: In sum, what would you say are the key takeaways for companies doing business in Illinois from this settlement, and what are the takeaways and learning lessons that they ought to have about it?

Tyler: Employers, I would say the key takeaway is simple: make sure you're getting informed written consent from employees before collecting any biometric data, ideally during onboarding, day one of an employee's work with the company. That means explaining how the data will be used, stored, and deleted, and informing employees of any changes in company policies or procedures regarding biometric data.

Jerry: Well, thanks so much, Tyler. We'll be watching this settlement and others, and in the upcoming Duane Morris Class Action Review to be published in the second week of January of 2026, you'll be one of our featured authors with your analysis of the state of BIPA litigation and settlements throughout the year. So, thanks so much for joining us on the podcast, and for giving us your insights to this particular settlement.

Another 42 percent of respondents blame Democrats in Congress for the shutdown.

Core party constituencies were most likely to blame the other party for the shutdown, suggesting each party’s base is supportive of their respective party’s approach to the shutdown.

“Each party could look at this data and say, ‘Let’s not blink,’” GOP pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies told NBC News. McInturff conducted the survey with Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates.

“Health care, a central focus of the government shutdown debate, is an area where Democrats continue to hold the upper hand,” Horwitt told the news outlet.

The survey was conducted heading into the fifth week of the shutdown, as there continues to be no meaningful progress toward a deal to reopen the government.

Democrats have insisted they would not support a GOP proposal to reopen the government without first extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year, raising health care premiums for millions of Americans.

Republicans, meanwhile, say they won’t negotiate health subsidies until Democrats vote to reopen the government.

With Trump home from his trip last week to Asia, some Democrats are renewing their push for a meeting with the president. Some have said if they just sit down with the president, they’re confident they could come to a deal quickly.

Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, and a majority say he’s fallen short on changing business as usual in Washington. At the same time, the Democratic Party continues to suffer from low ratings from voters as it seeks to offer an alternative.

Meanwhile, protecting democracy and constitutional rights is a top issue to voters, alongside costs, as Trump continues an expansive agenda of executive actions on immigration and other key policy areas. And a majority of voters believe he’s done more to undermine the Constitution than defend it.

This poll was conducted Oct. 24-28, with a majority of respondents (52%) blaming Trump and congressional Republicans for the shutdown — but historically high numbers blame congressional Democrats, too (42%).

Meanwhile, the share of registered voters with positive views of capitalism has dropped under 50% for the first time in seven years of NBC News polling on the issue — a shift that comes as some democratic socialists, like New York mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani, gain prominence in the Democratic Party.

Overall, 44% of registered voters say they have a positive view of capitalism, while 28% view it negatively. That’s a dip from how the economic system had been viewed in previous polls, which showed slim majorities viewing capitalism positively.

Trump administration faces Monday deadline to respond to judge's SNAP order

The Trump administration is staring down a noon deadline on Monday to update a federal judge who ruled late last week that the Agriculture Department must disburse Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds.

The deadline comes as tens of millions of Americans continue to go without their November SNAP benefits due to the shutdown.

Across the country, the shutdown’s impact was visible in long lines at food banks. This weekend in Texas and California, stadium parking lots were converted into mass distribution sites where families picked up boxes of produce, frozen meat and other household staples.

If congressional lawmakers don’t find a way to reopen the government by Wednesday — the 36th day of the government’s closure — the ongoing shutdown will set a record for being the longest in U.S. history. It would surpass the shutdown that began on Dec. 22, 2018, during Trump’s first term, and lasted 35 days.

'Meet the Press'

In a wide-ranging interview, Gov. Gavin Newsom slammed President Donald Trump’s push for mid-decade redistricting efforts in Republican states across the country, accusing the president of “rigging” next year’s congressional election and warning that Trump “is not screwing around.”

“He’s changing the rules. He’s rigging the game because he knows he’ll lose if all things are equal,” Newsom told moderator Kristen Welker. “He did not expect California to fight fire with fire.”

Asked if there was still room for Democrats to consider former first lady Michelle Obama’s “When they go low, we go high” philosophy, Newsom said, “I would love to go back to that, but politics has changed. The world has changed. The rules of the game have changed.”

“We want to go back to some semblance of normalcy, but you have to deal with the crisis at hand,” the governor said. “It has been just 10 to 11 months of this presidency. We have three more years’ time to batten down the hatches, and it’s time for us to change if we want things to change. And that’s why our communication strategy has shifted.”

This tight-knit community was recovering from a cultlike leader. Then measles got in.

By and large, the people who live in Hildale, Utah, as well as in neighboring Colorado City, just across the border in Arizona, are fiercely private. High walls surround many of the homes to avoid the prying eyes of strangers.

Measles got in anyway.

As of Friday, 161 cases had been confirmed in Utah and Arizona, the bulk concentrated right along the border in the twin towns collectively known as Short Creek. It’s now become the site of the second largest measles outbreak in the U.S. this year.

But the Short Creek community is also grappling with its recent past — one of polygamy, child removal and a cultlike leader now imprisoned for the sexual assault of minors.

“We had so much trauma,” said Donia Jessop, the mayor of Hildale and a former Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints member. “Getting kids vaccinated or a booster was not the first thing on our mind.”

Los Angeles trailed the Toronto Blue Jays for most of Game 7 — including in the ninth inning — but a solo home run by Miguel Rojas pushed it to extras before Will Smith’s 11th-inning solo shot gave the Dodgers a 5-4 lead they would not relinquish.

They became the first team to win consecutive World Series titles since the New York Yankees won three straight from 1998 to 2000.

Arab American Institute

In the days before the election for mayor of New York City, a group of rabbis issued a “A Call to Action” attacking public figures like Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani whom they say “refuse to condemn violent slogans, deny Israel’s legitimacy, and accuse the Jewish state of genocide.” The rabbis’ letter then leaps to the unfounded conclusion that Mamdani’s support for Palestinian human rights and his critique of Israeli behavior is acting to “delegitimize the Jewish community and encouraging and exacerbating hostility toward Judaism and Jews.”

In addition to this logical fallacy, there is an inherent danger in conflating Israel with the religion of Judaism and, by extension, conflating criticism of Israel or Political Zionism with antisemitism. This matter has long been a subject of debate, in particular, within the Jewish community.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the idea of Zionism was being debated by European Jews, there were competing currents of thought, even amongst those who agreed that the Jewish people had a connection with the biblical land of Israel. Some saw the connection as spiritual; others had a more secular cultural bond. While some in these two camps sought a partnership with the Arabs who inhabited the land, the view that came to dominate the new movement advocated, instead, for an exclusive Jewish state in Palestine. It was called Political Zionism and, tying itself to British colonial ambitions in the Middle East, this movement described the Arabs of Palestine in the same way the British defined those whom they subjugated in other lands—objects of contempt who were undeserving of rights.

In the early 1920s, a British journalist reported witnessing a group of European Jews carrying flags bearing the Star of David marching through the streets of Jerusalem chanting “Jerusalem is ours,” and “We want a Jewish State.” The journalist observed that Jerusalem’s inhabitants—Christians, Muslims, and Jews—were mostly befuddled. The flag with the star was foreign to them, as were the slogans. Arabs who objected to the march were accused of attacking Judaism because the flags included a Star of David. They were not. They were objecting to the European Jews’ claim that Jerusalem was theirs, as well as the marchers’ stated goal of ignoring Arab rights and supplanting them with a colonialist-supported foreign state.

As the British designs on Palestine and their pledge to the Political Zionist movement became known, the Arabs of Palestine came to understand the portent of that early Jerusalem march. During the next three decades, a bloody conflict unfolded.

While American Jews had some sympathy for their co-religionists in Palestine, the majority did not embrace Zionism or Israel as their self-identity. This was true even after the 1948 War and Israel’s Declaration of Independence.

In the 1960s, several factors combined to make a change in American Jewish attitudes toward Israel: the US was in the midst of the Cold War; the McCarthyite anti-communist surge that was tinged with antisemitism; and the anti-Vietnam war and the civil rights movements that combined to challenge the American identity. In this context, the successful 1960s hasbara film, “The Exodus” and Israel’s victory in the 1967 war played significant roles in moving American Jews to demonstrate greater affinity with Israel.

But affinity and financial support were not enough for Political Zionists. They continued to push the notion that Zionism and Judaism were the same. In the 1970s, leaders of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a group that had long been in the vanguard of defending Jews against bigotry, co-authored a book entitled, “The New Anti-Semitism,” advancing the case that because, in their view, Israel was so central to Judaism and Jewish identity, being against Israel was the newest form of hatred against Jews.

It was decades before this dangerous conflation took hold. Efforts by the powerful pro-Israel lobby to pass legislation in Congress equating criticism of Israel with antisemitism were repeatedly stymied by both Republicans and Democrats. When the arena shifted to the states, the pro-Israel forces were more successful. To date, more than three dozen states have passed such controversial bills, threatening protected speech.

In the wake of the public outrage that followed Hamas’s October 7th, 2023 attack, the ADL and its allies in government and media saw the opportunity to press hard make the case that the student protests against Israel’s war on Gaza were threatening to the identity of Jewish Americans.

It didn’t matter to them the protests were against Israeli actions not Jews, nor that polls were showing that Jewish Americans were deeply divided over Israeli policies. Instead, they supported efforts by Republicans to have the protests banned and pushed universities to punish students who engaged in criticism of Israel. Thousands of students were arrested, and many were suspended from their universities and had their degrees withheld. Faculty who supported the students were silenced or terminated, and some foreign students were held for deportation because they had been critical of Israel.

Despite the fact that attacks against both Arab American and Jewish American students increased, the ADL and Republicans in Congress deployed a weaponized definition of antisemitism that slighted Arab concerns or judged them as extremism worthy of criminalization. Meanwhile Jewish concerns were prioritized as legitimate and worthy of full-throated support and action.

One such scene stands out:

During the early campus protests against Israel’s war on Gaza, US television captured a scene which was deeply troubling in its implications. A young Jewish woman with a large Israeli flag draped around her neck like a cape was shown walking right into the middle of a pro-Palestinian demonstration. She was followed by a reporter and camera. Despite her deliberate provocation and the fact that she was ignored by the pro-Palestinian protesters, the woman could be heard saying to the reporter, “I just want to feel safe.”

Enter Zohran Mamdani. He is an elected member of the New York State legislature whose entry into the mayoral contest electrified voters. His charisma and agenda to make New York more affordable has won support from young voters, the city’s working class, recent immigrants, and liberals. After decisively winning the Democratic primary, New York’s financial elites and political establishment mobilized to defeat Mamdani in the general election. While polls are showing him still holding a substantial lead over his main opponent, billionaire donors have poured tens of millions into ads that ironically have used anti-Muslim tropes to defame and smear the candidate and his community.

While there are many issues at play in this contest, the dominant media narrative has been that Mamdani’s criticism of Israel is making the city unsafe for Jews. This is easily disproven by the most recent poll of Jewish voters showing Mamdani tied with his nearest competitor—and leading by two to one among Jews between the ages of 18 to 45.

Mamdani’s support of Palestinians and his agreement with almost all US and international human right groups (including Israeli organizations) that Israel is committing genocide is not antisemitic. This shouldn’t threaten Jews. In fact, the threat to Jews comes from those, like the ADL, who falsely equate all Jews with Israel’s deplorable behaviors. Or the rabbis who use false charges to incite against a candidate whose one crime has been to tell the truth.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.

Here's what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump's Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.

Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive"" and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern."" Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn't matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.

“The relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,” McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are ""plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.”

Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.

In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.

Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane “consistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.” And the trooper, they said, had ""no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.""

Abrego Garcia currently can't be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/0ce336e4-2eba-4f94-88b6-77e59b2e30aa/wirestory_27c2822466b717f10318c3268127a518_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-11-03 12:03:19.392427

Weissman, Allison Lombardo, Peter J. Quaranto",,,,,https://www.justsecurity.org/123833/tariffs-revenue-congress-president/,"In stark contrast to these long historical trends, as a result of the IEEPA tariffs, tariff revenue has roughly doubled in recent months as a share of overall federal revenue, and more than doubled in dollar terms.
If the IEEPA tariffs endure indefinitely, they are expected to raise trillions of dollars in revenue over the next decade.
Moreover, revenue-raising has been a central justification for the IEEPA tariffs, not just incidental to the President’s other stated goals of reducing trade deficits and drug trafficking.
But considering that Congress abandoned tariffs as a revenue tool long before that, it hardly follows that they delegated that tool to the President through IEEPA.
Such major changes to the raising of revenue can only come from Congress, and Congress did not make that choice.","The Supreme Court will soon hear oral argument in Learning Resources v. Trump, three consolidated lawsuits challenging the President’s authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Through a series of executive orders since taking office earlier this year, the President has relied on IEEPA to impose new global tariffs on imported goods from nearly all countries, as well as additional tariffs on goods from Mexico, Canada, and China. The Court will consider whether IEEPA—which allows the President to “regulate … importation” in response to a national emergency—delegates the power to impose tariffs to the President, and if so, whether that delegation violates the separation of powers. The outcome of the case could have enormous impacts on the way the nation raises revenue and redefine the balance of power between Congress and the President.

Much of the briefing before the Supreme Court centers the debate around whether the IEEPA tariffs are an exercise of the Constitution’s taxing power or commerce power. This seems to be the wrong question; after all, as noted by the D.C. Circuit in one of the cases below, “both of those powers belong to Congress, not the President.” The more relevant question is whether Congress, when enacting IEEPA, delegated to the President the authority to raise revenue—whatever the underlying constitutional source of that power.

The history of tariffs and Congress’s deliberate decision to abandon tariffs as a major source of revenue early in the 20th Century helps give context to the language of IEEPA, enacted in 1977, and its predecessor statute, the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), enacted in 1917. As noted by the Federal Circuit in its opinion below and amici curiae before the Supreme Court, tariffs were the primary source of revenue for the nation until ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913. Following the Revenue Acts of 1913 and 1916 (which reintroduced a federal income tax and slashed tariff rates), and again after the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 (which allowed the President to lower tariff rates as part of foreign trade agreements), tariff revenue plummeted as a share of total revenue and declined as a share of the economy. Over the past 70 years, tariffs have never accounted for much more than 2 percent of total federal revenue, with average effective tariff rates in the single digits.

This shift away from tariffs toward income and payroll taxes marked a deliberate policy choice by Congress, following decades of debate, to embrace a more progressive and more stable method of funding the government, including important new functions like Social Security. The context in which IEEPA was enacted in the 1970s thus demonstrates that the word “regulate” cannot reasonably be read to allow the President to unilaterally and significantly adjust the level and composition of federal revenue, and, as explained in depth by many of the briefs, IEEPA is rather best read as placing additional guardrails on the President’s emergency powers to impose sanctions and embargoes as originally enacted in TWEA.

In stark contrast to these long historical trends, as a result of the IEEPA tariffs, tariff revenue has roughly doubled in recent months as a share of overall federal revenue, and more than doubled in dollar terms. Meanwhile, effective tariff rates have climbed to 18 percent, the highest since 1934. If the IEEPA tariffs endure indefinitely, they are expected to raise trillions of dollars in revenue over the next decade.

Moreover, revenue-raising has been a central justification for the IEEPA tariffs, not just incidental to the President’s other stated goals of reducing trade deficits and drug trafficking. This is consistent with the President’s stated policy goal of using tariffs to replace income taxes. Notwithstanding that it would be impossible to raise enough tariff revenue to fully replace the income tax system, the President has repeatedly called for a return to the Gilded Age era in which the government was fully reliant on tariffs. In particular, a key administration goal in imposing the IEEPA tariffs has been to raise revenue to offset the cost of income tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress over the summer. Yet none of those tariffs were taken up or enacted by Congress. Instead, the IEEPA tariffs were imposed unilaterally by the President, claiming that Congress delegated him the power to do so nearly 50 years ago. But considering that Congress abandoned tariffs as a revenue tool long before that, it hardly follows that they delegated that tool to the President through IEEPA.

The Constitution allows for tariffs to be used as a source of revenue to replace (in full or in part) the income tax, and indeed—as noted by tax law professors in their amicus brief tracing the origins of tariff authority and legislation—Congress relied on tariff revenue through the nation’s early history. But the power to do so rests squarely with Congress, and Congress has not passed any law enacting—or even contemplating—indefinite tariffs of varying rates across the world. The power claimed here cannot be overstated when it comes to the nature of the federal tax system and especially in light of the prominent policy debates on this very issue that Congress settled.

***

Simply put, Congress did not write IEEPA to allow a President to replace the income tax system with a patchwork of tariffs that they can impose, adjust, or suspend at will. Such major changes to the raising of revenue can only come from Congress, and Congress did not make that choice.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/capitolbuildingsocialmedia.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 10:01:31.141408

House speaker says that issuing Snap contingency funds is 'not as easy as hitting go send on a computer'

Mike Johnson has said that issuing payments to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) beneficiaries in the midst of the shutdown is “not as easy as hitting go send on a computer”.

In recent days, two federal judges ordered the administration to use the program’s contingency funds to pay to Snap recipients. Today, Johnson said this was more complicated than it looked.

“It costs over $9bn to fund Snap for a month, and we only have, I think it’s $5.2bn in the contingency fund. So you have a big shortfall,” he said. “You got to go through and recalculate partial payments to the 42 million recipients of the program.”

Johnson noted that the president was not appealing against the rulings from the respective judges. “He wants that to be done,” Johnson said. “But he doesn’t see the mechanism to do it. So you have treasury, you have USDA, you have the other agencies involved that are working overtime, literally around the clock over the weekend, trying to figure out how to do this. But everybody needs to know, it’s not the full amount, assuming they could get this done and processed.”

Per that last post, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer quipped on social media today.

“Maybe I should file a complaint with the FCC against the Trump White House for editing his unhinged 60 Minutes interview,” the top Democrat wrote on X. “It will use the exact same language Trump lodged against Vice President Harris.”

The CBS News program 60 Minutes heavily edited down an interview with Donald Trump that aired on Sunday night, his first sit-down with the show in five years.

Trump sat down with correspondent Norah O’Donnell for 90 minutes, but only about 28 minutes were broadcast. A full transcript of the interview was later published, along with a 73-minute-long extended version online.

The edits are notable because, exactly one year before Trump was interviewed by O’Donnell at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday he had sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to help her chances in the presidential election.

While many legal experts widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment, CBS settled with Trump for $16m in July. As part of the settlement, the network had agreed that it would release transcripts of future interviews of presidential candidates.

At the beginning of Sunday’s show, O’Donnell reminded viewers that Paramount settled Trump’s lawsuit, but noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing”.

Ahead of election day across the country, my colleague Carter Sherman, has been covering how reproductive rights will be back on the ballot in this off-cycle year.

Carter notes the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia could have sweeping consequences for abortion access in two states that have become havens for women fleeing abortion bans. In Pennsylvania, what should have been a relatively sleepy judicial-retention election has evolved into the most expensive race of its kind in nearly 50 years, largely due to heated fighting over abortion. With voters weighing whether to keep three Democratic justices on the state supreme court, advocates fear that liberals may lose control of the bench and, ultimately, lose abortion access in the purple state.

As Trump decries filibuster, Johnson continues to defend it as important 'safeguard'

When asked by reporters about the president’s insistence for lawmakers to abolish the filibuster, Mike Johnson said that he had spoken to Donald Trump over the weekend and shared his thoughts with him.

“I hear my Senate Republican colleagues, some of the most conservative people in Congress, who say it’s an important safeguard. It prevents us, it holds us back from the Democrats’ worst impulses,” Johnson said. “What would the Democrats do if they had no filibuster impediment, no speed bump at all?”

The House speaker added that he speaks “frankly and honestly” with the president and noted that he was very “passionate” about this issue. “I think what you see in this, this, this debate we’re having on our own side is a reflection of the anger that we feel, the real desperation that we feel, because we want the government to be reopened,” Johnson said.

House speaker says that issuing Snap contingency funds is 'not as easy as hitting go send on a computer'

Mike Johnson has said that issuing payments to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) beneficiaries in the midst of the shutdown is “not as easy as hitting go send on a computer”.

In recent days, two federal judges ordered the administration to use the program’s contingency funds to pay to Snap recipients. Today, Johnson said this was more complicated than it looked.

“It costs over $9bn to fund Snap for a month, and we only have, I think it’s $5.2bn in the contingency fund. So you have a big shortfall,” he said. “You got to go through and recalculate partial payments to the 42 million recipients of the program.”

Johnson noted that the president was not appealing against the rulings from the respective judges. “He wants that to be done,” Johnson said. “But he doesn’t see the mechanism to do it. So you have treasury, you have USDA, you have the other agencies involved that are working overtime, literally around the clock over the weekend, trying to figure out how to do this. But everybody needs to know, it’s not the full amount, assuming they could get this done and processed.”

Johnson says 'extremism on the left' is the direct cause of American suffering

Throughout today’s press conference, Mike Johnson has continued to blame Senate Democrats for shuttering the government for 34 days. He, and many congressional Republicans, have claimed that the reason that lawmakers on the left have consistently rejected the House-passed funding bill is due to pressure from the progressive wing of the Democratic party.

“They fear that personally for their own political future,” Johnson said today. “And they care more about that than they care about Snap benefits flow into hungry families, about air traffic controllers being paid so they can keep the skies safe, border patrol, troops and all the rest … It is extremism on the left that is the direct cause of American suffering right now.”

Trump says that he would reluctantly prefer Cuomo to win NY mayoral race

In an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes, Trump said that he’s “not a fan of Cuomo one way or the other”, but he would rather see the former governor win against the progressive frontrunner and state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani to be the next mayor of New York City.

“If it’s gonna be between a bad Democrat and a communist, I’m gonna pick the bad Democrat all the time, to be honest with you,” Trump said.

Early voting in the closely watched mayoral race ended on Sunday. More than 735,000 New Yorkers cast their ballots ahead of Tuesday’s election.

Supreme court set to decide whether Trump's sweeping tariffs are legal

Looking ahead, on Wednesday, the supreme court will hear arguments on whether Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries are legal. It’s set to be one of the most consequential rulings on the expanse of Trump’s presidential power in his second term.

My colleague, Eduardo Porter, has this helpful breakdown on the question at the heart of this case. A dozen states have challenged the president’s contention that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 gives him the power to impose tariffs on imports from every country in the world to defend the nation from a several “threats” facing the US.

Eduardo notes:

Justices will focus much of their attention on whether IEEPA authorizes the president to levy a tariff – a word that is not mentioned in the text of the law and is, moreover, a form of taxation, over which, per the constitution, Congress has exclusive power.

IEEPA gives the president authority “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the president declares a national emergency with respect to such threat”.

Yet as the plaintiffs noted, using this “to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the US he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the president has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy”. Rather than solving national emergencies, Trump is using emergency powers to manufacture one.

Trump continues to push for eliminating filibuster, despite Republican pushback

The president has, once again, called for lawmakers to abolish the filibuster, as the government shutdown continues, and is set to enter its 34th day.

A reminder that this is the 60-vote threshold needed in the Senate to end debate on a bill, and a bring the legislation to the floor for a vote.

“TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER, NOT JUST FOR THE SHUTDOWN, BUT FOR EVERYTHING ELSE,” Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday. “REMEMBER, THE DEMOCRATS WILL DO IT IMMEDIATELY, AS SOON AS THEY GET THE CHANCE. OUR DOING IT WILL NOT GIVE THEM THE CHANCE.”

The president repeated his wishes in an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes. “The Republicans have to get tougher. If we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want. We’re not gonna lose power,” he told Norah O’Donnell. Congressional Republican leaders have said there is no intention to scrap the procedural measure. House Speaker Mike Johnson called it the “safeguard” in the upper chamber.

Donald Trump has no public events scheduled today, per the official White House schedule.

However, he’ll take part in two virtual campaign events for the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, in an attempt to assert some influence over these pivotal elections while the Democratic candidates push ahead in the polls (although the race looks tighter in New Jersey).

On Sunday, the president weighed in on Truth Social, questioning why residents in either state would vote for either Mikie Sherill or Abigail Spanberger.

“They want transgender for everybody, men playing in women’s sports, High Crime, and the most expensive Energy prices almost anywhere in the World? VOTE REPUBLICAN for massive Energy Cost reductions, large scale Tax Cuts, and basic Common Sense! Under President Trump, ME, Gasoline will come down to approximately $2 a Gallon, very soon,” he wrote.

My colleague Lauren Gambino has filed this report on the California proposition to redraw its congressional district boundaries. Here is an extract from her story:

California’s Proposition 50 began as a warning from the nation’s largest blue state to its largest red one: don’t poke the bear. But when Texas moved ahead with a rare, mid-decade gerrymander, pushed by Donald Trump as Republicans seek to shore up their fragile House majority in the midterm elections, California made good on its threat.

Now, California voters appear poised to approve a redistricting measure placed on the ballot in August by Democrats and the state’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who have cast it as a chance to check Trump’s power …

Proposition 50 asks voters to temporarily scrap the state’s independently-drawn congressional district lines in favor of new maps carved up to help Democrats win five additional safe seats – a tit-for-tat response to Texas, where Republicans secured five new, friendlier districts earlier this year …

Early returns and polling suggest the ballot measure is on track for a comfortable victory. Though it can be difficult to predict turnout in an off-year special election, several recent surveys showed it passing by more than 20 points.

Trump says Maduro’s days are numbered but ‘doubts’ US will go to war with Venezuela

Donald Trump has sent mixed signals about potential US intervention in Venezuela, playing down concerns of imminent war against the South American nation but saying its leader Nicolás Maduro’s days were numbered.

The president’s remarks, made during a CBS interview released on Sunday, come as the US amasses military units in the Caribbean and has conducted multiple strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels, killing dozens.

Asked during the 60 Minutes program if the US was going to war against Venezuela, Trump said: “I doubt it. I don’t think so.” However, when asked if Maduro’s days as president were numbered, he replied: “I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.”

Maduro, who faces indictment on drug charges in the US, has accused Washington of using drug trafficking as a pretext for “imposing regime change” in Caracas to seize Venezuelan oil.

More than 15 US strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific have killed at least 65 people in recent weeks, with the latest taking place on Saturday, prompting criticism from governments in the region.

Washington has yet to make public any evidence that its targets were smuggling narcotics or posed a threat to the US.

Donald Trump has said he feels bad for the British royal family after King Charles stripped his brother Andrew of his title as prince amid the continuing fallout over Andrew’s connections with the late, convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday evening, Trump was asked about King Charles’s decision to strip his brother of his peerages and the title of prince.

“It’s a terrible thing that’s happened to the (royal) family,” the US president said. “That’s been a tragic situation. It’s too bad. I feel badly for the family.”

Andrew was accused by Virginia Giuffre of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager and claims she was trafficked by Epstein to have sex with the former prince. Andrew has strenuously denied the allegations.

Pressure is building on Andrew to give evidence before a powerful US congressional committee. Members of the House Oversight Committee have called for the former prince to reveal what he knew about the actions of Epstein.

Trump's planned weapons tests won't include 'nuclear explosions', US energy secretary says

The US energy secretary, Chris Wright, has said the weapons testing that Donald Trump ordered last week will not include nuclear explosions.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions,” Wright told Fox News yesterday.

“So you’re testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry, and they set up the nuclear explosion,” Wright added.

Wright, whose agency is responsible for testing, said the planned testing involves “all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.”

The confusion over Trump’s intention started minutes before he held a critical meeting in South Korea with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump took to his Truth Social platform and appeared to suggest he was preparing to discard a decades-old US prohibition on testing the nation’s nuclear weapons.

As we mentioned in the opening summary, two federal judges have ruled that the government cannot suspend food aid used by about 42 million low-income Americans during the shutdown.

Here is more on the story, courtesy of my colleague Lauren Gambino:

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits, as issuing food stamps costs the public purse between $8.5bn and $9bn every month.

The Trump administration contends the agency lacks authority to pay them until Congress passes a spending bill that will ending the enduring government shutdown, which began on 1 October.

Trump lambasted the decisions on Friday, writing on Truth Social that he does “NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT”.

“I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible. It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” he wrote.

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay.”

US government shutdown nearing record for the longest in history as Trump delays food benefits to millions

Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics.

Republicans are claiming that the US president, Donald Trump, is “desperate” to end the government shutdown, which has now entered its 33rd day, as lawmakers struggle to find common ground on previously bipartisan issues such as food aid and health care.

The last shutdown, which started in December 2018 and was brought about by disagreements over money to fund a wall along the US-Mexico border, lasted 35 days – the longest in American history.

Republicans have only 53 Senate seats, meaning they need at least seven Democrats or independents to reopen the federal government. But in repeated votes since federal agencies shut on 1 October, just three Democrats have been willing to support funding legislation.

Trump continues to exert an iron grip on the shutdown, which sees Democrats and Republicans stuck over passing a spending plan that would reopen federal agencies. He is resisting political and even federal court pressure to ease the burden on vulnerable Americans while protesting that he has no power to end the impasse.

“I mean, the Republicans are voting almost unanimously to end it, and the Democrats keep voting against ending it,” Trump told 60 Minutes in an interview on Sunday. “You know, they’ve never had this. This has happened like 18 times before. The Democrats always voted for an extension, always saying, ‘Give us an extension, we’ll work it out.’”

Two federal court judges ruled on Friday that the Trump administration must use $5bn in contingency funds to keep paying food assistance Snap benefits for up to 42 million low-income Americans. The payments stopped Saturday under the shutdown, posing the risk of hunger for millions of people.

As my colleague Ed Pilkington reports in this story, despite the two court orders, it remains unclear when or whether the administration will restart the payments. Trump has said he is waiting for clarification from the federal judges on where the money should come from.

Stay with us as we bring you the latest developments from Washington.

The administration, however, has reportedly come up with a legal argument for why the War Powers Resolution does not apply. As I explain here, that argument is incorrect and dangerous.

Background

On Sept. 2, the Trump administration began a campaign of lethal airstrikes against people it has labelled as “narcro-terrorists,” individuals alleged to be smuggling drugs on vessels in both the Caribbean and the Pacific. Based on the information disclosed by the administration, as of Nov. 2, the United States has conducted 15 such strikes killing 65 people. In addition, the U.S. military rescued two survivors from a strike in the Caribbean who were later repatriated to their home countries. (The U.S. military handed off the search for a third survivor in the Pacific to Mexico which eventually halted rescue efforts.)

The strikes—premeditated killings outside of any plausible armed conflict—have been widely condemned as unlawful or even criminal, including by a number of former U.S. government lawyers with experience in counterterrorism direct action and the use of military force. (See here, here, and here.) The Trump administration is also conducting this bombing campaign without congressional authorization—instead relying solely on the President’s purported authority under Article II of the Constitution. As a consequence, this military action is governed by the War Powers Resolution. And the administration is reportedly poised to breach this law as well.

In contravening the restriction of the War Powers Resolution, the Trump administration would circumvent legislative safeguards on military action and usurp Congress’s constitutional authority over the use of military force.

The War Powers Resolution and the 60-Day Clock

The statutory framework governing the unilateral use of military force by a president, such as the ongoing maritime strikes, is the War Powers Resolution. Congress enacted this law over President Nixon’s veto in 1973 to reassert the body’s constitutional prerogatives with respect to war and peace in the final stages of the Vietnam War. In essence, Congress sought to forestall any president from taking the country to war without congressional authorization or even without congressional awareness (as had allegedly been the case for aspects of the wars in South-East Asia, such as the incursion into Cambodia).

To this end, Section 4(a) of the Resolution establishes reporting requirements to prevent the president from taking the country to war whether or not in secret. In the absence of a declaration of war or other statutory authorization, the executive branch is subject to multi-tiered obligations to report to Congress within 48 hours of certain activities by U.S. armed forces.

First, under subsection 4(a)(1) the Executive must report when U.S. military forces are introduced into “hostilities” or introduced into “situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.” Such hostilities reports are the focus of this essay.

Second, even if U.S. forces are not engaging in hostilities, subsection 4(a)(2) requires the Executive to report the introduction of “combat equipped” forces into a country (the executive branch defines “combat-equipped” as forces equipped with crew-served weapons such as machine guns requiring more than one person to operate and mortars).

Third, pursuant to subsection 4(a)(3), the president must also report a substantial enlargement of such combat equipped forces in a country where such forces are already present.

Notably, under Section 5(b) of the 1973 Resolution, the submission of a report under the first of these scenarios — introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities or situations of imminent hostilities — also starts a 60-day clock for the withdrawal of U.S. armed forces from such hostilities unless Congress declares war or otherwise enacts specific statutory authorization for the use of force.

As an aside: The War Powers Resolution provided a mechanism in section 5(c) for Congress to order the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities through a concurrent resolution—that is, a resolution passed by both houses of Congress but not presented to the president for his or her signature or veto. Particularly following the Supreme Court’s 1983 decision in INS v. Chadha that ruled unconstitutional the legislative veto, section 5(c) is widely viewed as unconstitutional. In the wake of Chadha, Congress enacted expedited procedures for joint resolutions requiring the removal of U.S. armed forces from hostilities, which does require presentment to the president. The Senate recently voted on just such a joint resolution to block further strikes in the Caribbean, which failed to pass. A vote on another bipartisan Senate resolution to bar military action in Venezuela is expected soon.

Although Congress did not define “hostilities,” or “imminent involvement in hostilities,” in the text of the statute, the legislative history shows that Congress intended those terms to be construed broadly to establish a low threshold for both the reporting and withdrawal provisions of the War Powers Resolution. The House Foreign Affairs Committee’s report on the Resolution explains:

The word hostilities was substituted for the phrase armed conflict during the subcommittee drafting process because it was considered to be somewhat broader in scope. In addition to a situation in which fighting actually has begun, hostilities also encompasses a state of confrontation in which no shots have been fired but where there is a clear and present danger of armed conflict. “Imminent hostilities” denotes a situation in which there is a clear potential either for such a state of confrontation or for actual armed conflict. (bolded emphasis added)

Unsurprisingly, the executive branch has espoused different, narrower interpretations of these terms that are less likely to constrain the president’s ability to use military force without congressional authorization. In the most oft-repeated formulation, the State Department’s Legal Adviser informed Congress in a 1975 letter that its working definition of “hostilities” meant “a situation in which units of the U.S. armed forces are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile forces.” “Imminent hostilities” means, according to the letter, “a situation in which there is a serious risk from hostile fire to the safety of United States forces.”

As a matter of statutory interpretation, it would be dubious to assign greater weight to the post-enactment views of the executive branch compared to the pre-enactment interpretation of the legislature that passed the statute over the president’s veto.

In practice, administrations of both parties have routinely treated military actions such as airstrikes, in which US forces were not in harm’s way, as “hostilities” for the purposes of the War Powers Resolution (see a catalog of dozens of such reports at the War Powers Reporting Project). Examples of such standoff strikes treated and reported as hostilities include:

The Clinton administration reporting Tomahawk missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 in retaliation for al Qaeda’s bombing of US embassies;

The Obama administration reporting strikes on Houthi radar facilities in Yemen in 2016;

The first Trump administration reporting strikes against the Syrian government in 2017 and 2018 in retaliation for the use of chemical weapons;

The War Powers Resolution and the Maritime Strikes

The Trump administration is relying solely on the President’s supposed authority under Article II of the Constitution as Commander-in-Chief and Chief Executive to bomb these supposed drug smuggling vessels. Thus, consistent with section 4(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the White House reported the first airstrike (which occurred on Sept. 2) to Congress in a Sept. 4 letter. This report triggered the start of the Resolution’s 60-day clock—set to expire on Nov. 3.

But as this deadline approached, the Trump administration shifted its view on whether these strikes constitute “hostilities” under the 1973 law, according to reporting by the Ellen Nakashima and Noah Roberston in the Washington Post and Charlie Savage and Julian Barnes in the New York Times. The head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice reportedly informed a small group of lawmakers that the maritime strikes did not constitute “hostilities.”

An anonymous senior administration official told the Washington Post that the War Powers Resolution doesn’t apply to the maritime strikes because, “even at its broadest … [it] has been understood to apply to placing U.S. service-members in harm’s way.” According to this official, “[t]he operation comprises precise strikes conducted largely by unmanned aerial vehicles launched from naval vessels in international waters at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.” Thus, “the kinetic operations underway do not rise to the level of ‘hostilities,’” according to the administration’s view.

Libya Redux?

The Trump administration’s effort to circumvent the War Powers Resolution’s 60-day deadline by arguing that U.S. airstrikes “do not rise to the level of ‘hostilities’” echo (perhaps unintentionally) arguments made by the Obama administration in 2011 with respect to the military intervention in Libya. In that situation, (as reported by Charlie Savage in Power Wars) executive branch lawyers were divided over whether the United States would be legally required to curtail military engagement in the intervention as a result of the 60-day clock. Despite the opposing view of the Office of Legal Counsel, the Obama administration ultimately adopted the position that U.S. operations—including airstrikes—did not amount to “hostilities” due to a combination of four factors.

1) The U.S. mission was limited, and involved U.S. forces playing a “supporting role” for NATO in implementing a U.S. Security Council Resolution.

2) The exposure of U.S. armed forces to harm was limited, including because of the absence of ground troops.

3) The risk of escalation was limited, again due to the absence of U.S. ground forces.

4) Military means used by the United States were limited, with airstrikes being “confined, on an as-needed basis, to the suppression of enemy air defenses to enforce the no-fly zone, and to limited strikes by Predator unmanned aerial vehicles against discrete targets in support of the civilian protection mission.”

The Obama administration’s interpretation of “hostilities” was not well received, including by the U.S. Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved legislation on a bipartisan basis stating that:

United States military operations in Libya since April 4, 2011, which have included non-kinetic support to the NATO-led operations, including intelligence, logistical support, and search and rescue assistance, United States aircraft assisting in the suppression and destruction of air defenses in support of the no-fly zone, and precision strikes by unmanned aerial vehicles, constitute hostilities within the meaning of the War Powers Resolution, and may be carried out only under the conditions specified in section 5(b) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(b)).

In addition, several Republican Senators, including Rand Paul, Mike Lee, Ron Johnson, and John Cornyn, wrote to President Obama, taking the position that U.S. military operations in Libya constituted “hostilities” and that by virtue of the War Powers Resolution, they would be required to terminate within 60 days. Over on the House side, in 2011, Republicans who now serve in the Senate – Bill Cassidy, Shelley Capito, and Tim Scott – and the cabinet – Secretary Kristi Noem – voted for a bipartisan measure that would have directed the President to terminate the operations “pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution.” A few days later, the Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner sent a letter to the President stating the administration would be “in violation of the War Powers Resolution unless it asks for and receives authorization from Congress or withdraws all U.S. troops and resources from the mission.”

On its face, the multi-factor theory as to how the Libya intervention did not constitute “hostilities” appears less permissive than what we know of the Trump administration’s argument with respect to its maritime strikes.

Flaws with the Administration’s Reported Interpretation of Hostilities

There are many flaws with the Trump administration’s reported interpretation of hostilities. As indicated in the legislative history, Congress understood the term “hostilities” to apply broadly, more broadly than “armed conflict.” The Obama administration’s prior attempt to restrictively interpret the term garnered strong bipartisan congressional opposition.

Further, as noted above, the executive branch under presidents of both parties (including the current president) have treated airstrikes—even involving standoff weapons where the risk to U.S. forces was minimal—as “hostilities” and reported them to Congress accordingly under the Resolution. Indeed, the Trump administration itself seems to have implicitly taken this position when it submitted its Sept. 4 War Powers Report to Congress.

There is also significant tension,between the Trump administration claiming on the one hand that the United States suffered an “armed attack” and U.S. armed forces are engaged in a “non-international armed conflict” with respect to these strikes and simultaneously arguing that the strikes are not “hostilities.” That is tenuous on its own. What’s more, as discussed above, the legislative history of the War Powers Resolution shows that Congress included “hostilities” because it is a broader term than “armed conflict.” So, for the administration to claim U.S. forces are in an armed conflict but not hostilities would be nonsensical to those members of Congress who passed the legislation.

Implications

The implications of the Trump administration’s reported interpretation of “hostilities” are significant.

First, the U.S. government can continue its killing spree at sea, notwithstanding the time limits imposed by the War Powers Resolution.

Second, the executive is arrogating to itself greater power over the use of force that constitutionally is he prerogative of Congress. The administration’s theory places a broad swath of common U.S. military action—standoff strikes with little risk to U.S. forces—outside the scope of the War Powers Resolution and its restrictions. And the White House is doing so while it postures not only for further killing at sea, but also for possible military action against Venezuela.

Third, this legal theory could further complicate congressional efforts to rein in unauthorized military action by this and future presidents. Significant congressional tools in this area depend on fast track mechanisms linked to the War Powers Resolution, which turn on the term “hostilities.” Going forward, the executive branch may take the position that legislation to require the removal of U.S. armed forces from “hostilities,” is defective or ineffective to the extent that standoff strikes do not constitute “hostilities.”

Conclusion

That the Trump administration would resort to creative lawyering to circumvent the limits of the War Powers Resolution is hardly a surprise and was indeed forecasted by my former State Department colleagues Rebecca Ingber and Jessica Thibodeau. It nonetheless is yet another legal abuse and arrogation of power by the executive. And it is a power grab in the service of killing people outside the law based solely on the President’s own say so.

Congress needs to push back against this attempt by the White House to further encroach upon its constitutional prerogatives on the use of military force. The legislative branch should reject the executive’s strained legal interpretation of the War Powers Resolution, including possibly in legislation. Congress should also continue efforts to halt these killings at sea and block an unlawful attack on Venezuela.

The administration’s creative lawyering here should also serve as another reminder of the need for longer term structural reform of the War Powers Resolution, such as, for example, that proposed in the bipartisan National Security Powers Act. Such legislative reform should include defining “hostilities” in order to limit the sort of legal gamesmanship this and previous administrations have engaged in with respect to the time limits imposed on unauthorized military action.

At least one Halloween parade was canceled. ""There were a lot less parades,"" Ernesto, a resident of a largely Latino Chicago neighborhood, told NPR. He requested his last name be withheld, out of fear of his employer retaliating against him for speaking to the media. ""The fear,"" he says, ""has been more palpable with each passing day.""

Last week, Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker called for federal agents to pause ""Operation Midway Blitz"" (the Chicago immigration enforcement campaign) during the Halloween weekend. ""If you are unwilling to cease operations and leave our city, can we at least agree that our children should not be victims, especially on Halloween?"" Pritzker asked.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the request ""shameful.""

""We're absolutely not willing to put on pause any work that we will do to keep communities safe,"" she responded in a press conference.

On Friday, clashes between protesters and immigration agents erupted near a middle school in Evanston, a suburb north of Chicago. Witnesses shared video footage of an agent holding a man down and repeatedly hitting him in the head.

In a statement to NPR, a DHS spokesperson said that ""agents observed they were being aggressively tailgated by a red vehicle. As agents tried to make a U-turn, the red car crashed into Border Patrol. A hostile crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, and began verbally abusing them and spitting on them. As Border patrol arrested one individual, who actively resisted arrest, pepper spray was deployed spray to deter the agitator and disperse the crowd. Three U.S. citizens were arrested as a result of their violence against law enforcement.""

DHS also told NPR that five undocumented immigrants from Mexico were arrested during the operation. According to the agency, all five were in the U.S. without papers, and had criminal histories, including trespassing charges and multiple illegal entries into the U.S.

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, a Democrat, responded to the incident in a press conference on Friday.

""Just today, ICE agents have assaulted Evanston residents, beaten people up, grabbed them, abducted them, taking people off the street once again because of the color of their skin,"" he said. ""It is an outrage.

(AP) — Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, has hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday in the human smuggling case against him in Tennessee.

U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.

Here's what to know about the latest developments in the case:

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.

Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump's Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.

What are the charges?

Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.

The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.

A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.

What is the motion to dismiss about?

Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of “selective or vindictive prosecution.”

In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found “some evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive"" and said many statements by Trump administration officials “raise cause for concern."" Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.

The two sides have been sparring over whether senior Justice Department officials, including Blanche, can be required to testify in the case.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn't matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.

“The relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,” McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are ""plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.”

What is the main motion to suppress evidence about?

Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.

In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.

Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane “consistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.” And the trooper, they said, had ""no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.""

Is he being deported?

Abrego Garcia currently can't be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

Who is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?

Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.

The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane “consistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.” And the trooper, they said, had “no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.”

Is he being deported?

Abrego Garcia currently can’t be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a “well founded fear” of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.

The administration’s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.

Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.

Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.

Groups call on those in power to stop scapegoating human rights

“Now is the time for a full-throated defence of the European Convention on Human Rights and Human Rights Act. No one has human rights, unless we all have human rights.”

Almost 300 organisations and charities have expressed their support for the UK’s human rights protections to mark the 75th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The statement, which was organised by Liberty, calls out the way human rights and the Convention have been used as a political scapegoat over recent years – which it said has had “devastating real world consequences”.

The 292 signatories to the statement include Amnesty, Shelter, Mind, Parkinsons UK, End Violence Against Women Coalition, Centre for Military Justice and Ben and Jerry’s.

In the statement the groups highlight the many ways the convention has helped ordinary people since it was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 – from victims of sexual violence to LGBT+ service personnel, public interest journalists to mental health patients and victims of serious injustice (from Hillsborough to Windrush).

The statement also calls on the Government – whose party predecessors were architects of the Human Rights Act – to make the positive case for the UK’s human rights protections. It says this would improve services for UK citizens at home, as well as increase the UK’s international cooperation abroad.

Sam Grant, Liberty director of external relations, said:

“There are people in powerful positions who want us to believe that we would be better off without the ECHR – don’t believe them. For decades our human rights laws have underpinned all of our daily lives by giving us the ability to speak freely, love who we want, and live in peace. These rights were hard-won and we must not allow governments now or in the future to take them away.”

Andrea Simon, End Violence Against Women Coalition executive director, said

“We cannot end violence against women and girls without defending the human rights protections we have long fought for. The Human Rights Act and ECHR are crucial tools in our fight to end violence against women and girls, providing victims and survivors with access to support, safety and justice when they are failed by the state. The ECHR means police have a duty to investigate VAWG, and that frontline support services can demand that local authorities protect women and girls at immediate risk, by providing alternative housing for survivors of domestic abuse. Violence against women and girls is entirely preventable, and it relies on a world with human rights for all.”

Emma Norton, Centre for Military Justice director, said:

“The ECHR and the Human Rights Act have brought enormous benefits to so many, including service personnel and their families: ensuring justice when they have been let down by the State, particularly in the context of gender based violence, securing dignity and recognition for our LGBT+ service personnel, and keeping soldiers safe.”

Full statement:

The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is fundamental to our democracy and enables ordinary people, of all backgrounds, to hold the state and public bodies accountable. These rights are needed more than ever in an unstable world, with growing political polarisation and authoritarianism, environmental instability and technological upheaval, to ensure the dignity of us all.

The ECHR was born out of the horrors of World War II, with the UK playing a leading role, setting minimum standards which governments across Europe agreed to abide by. This has improved respect for human rights across Europe (no signatory has used the death penalty for 25 years) and facilitated cross-border cooperation on issues of joint interest, like crime and human trafficking.

In the UK, the ECHR and the Human Rights Act (HRA) have protected the rights of ordinary people every day up and down the country; from victims of sexual violence to LGBT+ service personnel, public interest journalists to mental health patients and victims of serious injustice (from Hillsborough to Windrush).

The ECHR helped bring peace finally in Northern Ireland, through the Good Friday Agreement, and has improved the quality of public services. We reject the narrative that human rights are not in the interests of the public – everyone in our society would be much worse off without these key protections.

In recent months, following a trend established over several years, the ECHR and HRA have increasingly come under fire from some leading politicians and media organisations. This has often been based on myths, over-simplifications, inaccuracies, and scaremongering, particularly around migration. Leaving the ECHR would not solve policy problems like the backlog of asylum cases, or people risking their lives through Channel crossings, but would bring about years of legal uncertainty, undermine our international position, and cause harm to the rights of both migrants in the UK and our wider communities.

We call on politicians to stop using our human rights as a scapegoat, level with the British public about the significant costs of ECHR withdrawal (such as the impact on the Good Friday Agreement) and end the escalating, irresponsible rhetoric targeting migrant and minoritised communities, which has devastating real-world consequences for people who are often already made vulnerable by wider social and economic marginalisation and stigmatisation.

We also call on the Government, whose party predecessors were architects of the HRA, to make the positive case for our human rights protections and how they empower ordinary people across the UK. It is an important part of our country’s safety net, not an inconvenience which must be tolerated. Its rights are common-sense, pragmatic protections which improve services at home and increase international cooperation abroad.

Now is the time for a full-throated defence of the ECHR and HRA. No one has human rights, unless we all have human rights.

Over nearly nine months, the lawsuit challenging President Trump’s attempt to slash foreign aid funding has ricocheted around the federal judiciary but still has not reached a final resolution. It has been reviewed by 21 judges, spawned thousands of pages of filings and lumbered forward even after the administration dissolved the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government office responsible for disbursing much of the contested funding.

With Congress offering little resistance to Mr. Trump’s expansion of executive power — even at lawmakers’ own expense — the courts have become a final obstacle to some of his most aggressive moves.

The long, twisted journey of one of the dozens of lawsuits that have been filed against pieces of the Trump agenda offers insights into the ways the judicial system, clogged by the flood of suits and deliberative by design, has been unable to keep up with the president’s moves. And while Mr. Trump has racked up plenty of courtroom losses, he ultimately has not been seriously restrained.

Mr. Trump took office in January pledging to drastically downsize foreign aid spending. But the money at issue had been appropriated by Congress and set aside for specific projects. The Global Health Council and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, along with similarly situated groups, sued in February, soon after the president declared he would re-evaluate every award, keeping those dollars from beneficiaries abroad.

Despite a series of interim rulings, the courts have not yet settled the core legal issues at stake. Yet even so, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to choke off $4 billion in foreign aid appropriations that President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had signed into law last year.

The administration has maintained in court that all foreign aid is an expression of the country’s foreign policy, which is ultimately up to the president to set. In public, Mr. Trump has referred to foreign aid as a wasteful “left-wing scam,” contended that the United States gives billions to “countries that hate us” and stated in the executive order that he was targeting foreign aid that was “in many cases antithetical to American values.”

After the justices’ most recent order in September, the case has returned to courts in Washington, where litigation is moving ahead slowly, stymied in part by the government shutdown. But advocates say that at this point even if Mr. Trump loses in court, much of the damage is done.

Lauren Bateman, a lawyer from the advocacy organization Public Citizen who represented some of the nonprofits, said that each visit to the Supreme Court was “representative of the length to which the administration is going to withhold lifesaving foreign assistance.”

Just 24 days after Mr. Trump took office, a federal judge in Washington dealt him what initially appeared to be a major blow.

Judge Amir H. Ali found that his “blanket suspension” of foreign aid grants was most likely unlawful, and that the ensuing chaos had a “catastrophic effect on the humanitarian missions” of many groups involved. The judge ordered the government to reverse the freeze and begin paying out some $2 billion for work the groups had completed before the court stepped in.

One of Mr. Biden’s final nominees, Judge Ali started work three weeks before the start of Mr. Trump’s second term. As the president spent much of January signing stacks of executive orders, the judge and his colleagues fielded dozens of lawsuits challenging them.

Judge Ali’s order stirred hope among public interest groups that the courts might provide a firewall against some of the president’s most aggressive moves. Believing the same, Mr. Trump’s allies mounted a campaign to discredit Judge Ali, blasting him for exceeding his authority and circulating threats to have him impeached.

As a practical matter, the initial ruling dealt with the narrow, most immediate issue: the spending freeze that Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had put in place to keep funds locked away while they orchestrated a downsizing.

The spending freeze alone appeared intended to cause chaos. The accounts of aid organizations ran dry with workers stranded overseas. Amid the freeze, associates of Elon Musk were simultaneously scrambling payment systems and sidelining or firing State Department workers. Many of the civil servants who once processed payments were unreachable.

“Basically all of their supply chains were shut off overnight, all the money stopped flowing, everything was halted,” said Stephen K. Wirth, a lawyer representing the aid organizations. “There was food rotting in ships, on docks. There was medicine expiring. It was unbelievably disruptive.”

The Trump administration appealed and quickly reached the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court’s three liberal justices, sided with Judge Ali and rejected the funding freeze.

The Trump administration began gradually abiding by Judge Ali’s order and paying out contracts, eventually surpassing $1 billion in back payments, according to court filings.

Soon after, on March 10, the judge went further, addressing not only back payments but ruling that all of Mr. Trump’s efforts to cut foreign aid most likely violated the Constitution and federal law. He ordered the government to spend all the funds that Congress had set aside for foreign aid.

That same day, Mr. Rubio announced that more than 80 percent of U.S.A.I.D.’s programs would be cut, terminating thousands of contracts and effectively shuttering the agency. Even programs with longstanding bipartisan support, such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, were in jeopardy. The groups complained in court, but Judge Ali remained narrowly focused on the funding as the government sped ahead of the litigation.

It was becoming clear how much room the Trump administration still had to maneuver.

U.S.A.I.D. and its staff, which once oversaw a vast apparatus of grants and contracting, was decimated. And as litigation dragged on, the 2024 appropriations law that had created the foreign aid funding was inching toward expiration at the end of September.

Lawyers for the Justice Department once again appealed, arguing that it was in Mr. Trump’s constitutional authority to hold back money Congress had appropriated, a process known as impoundment.

A three-judge panel, including two Republican appointees, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed. In August, the court ruled that only the comptroller general, not a constellation of outside groups, could sue to recover the money on Congress’s behalf.

The brief legal momentum the aid organizations had built stalled, an experience repeated across the system as appeals courts have repeatedly undone rulings by lower court judges blocking the Trump agenda.

In a major twist, on Aug. 29, the appeals court revisited and clarified its ruling. It allowed the groups to try again in the lower court with an argument that did not involve constitutional claims.

Once again, the Trump administration tried to sidestep the legal challenge by racing ahead before it could be fully resolved.

In a letter to Congress that night, the administration announced it would bypass lawmakers entirely, employing a legally dubious budgetary maneuver known as a pocket rescission. Daring Republicans in Congress to intervene, the administration indicated that anything short of a formal objection to cutting the spending by the end of the fiscal year would be taken as tacit approval.

The lawsuit was hardly over. But while some congressional Republicans complained about the move, none appeared willing to defy the president or fight to keep the funds.

On Sept. 3, Judge Ali stepped back in, writing that the move appeared to be only the latest way to circumvent Congress. He ordered the government to dole out more than $10 billion in expiring funds across the dozens of categories in which the aid groups operate.

The Trump administration appealed but gave some ground. It agreed to spend about $6.5 billion by the deadline but dug in its heels on the rest, much of which was set aside for development assistance, democracy promotion and peacekeeping.

The administration raced back to the Supreme Court for a third time, asking for a quick emergency order in its favor.

On Sept. 26, the justices granted one, blocking Judge Ali’s order and allowing the Sept. 30 deadline to pass with the funds still frozen.

In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the case had wandered into “uncharted territory.” Such a consequential decision, which could bankrupt aid providers and unleash starvation and disease abroad, should not have been made without full consideration before the court, she said.

Indeed, in just two paragraphs, the majority stated that harm to the president’s ability to conduct foreign policy from siding with Judge Ali would “outweigh the potential harm” to the groups being denied funding. But it stressed that the order was preliminary and should “not be read as a final determination on the merits.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/30/multimedia/00dc-onecase-3-mfpw/00dc-onecase-3-mfpw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 08:18:47.501980

According to Marouf’s older son, about five vehicles surrounded Marouf’s car when ICE agents pulled him over.
But on Sept. 22, when ICE agents arrested Marwan Marouf, they gave him a letter notifying him that his green card application was denied.
Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge.
In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport undocumented people who crossed the Texas-Mexico border.","On the evening of July 1, Luis Medrano called Houston police for help after his wife had gotten violent and punched him twice in the face during a schizophrenic episode in which she was hearing tormenting voices, according to a police report.

Medrano, 50, a Mexican immigrant who met his wife when they crossed the Rio Grande with a group of about a dozen other migrants more than three decades ago, had tried to take his 47-year-old wife to the hospital, but she refused to go. So he did what he’d done three times before: called the police so they would take her to a hospital.

But this time, the officer arrested her on suspicion of assault and booked her into jail. And after a prosecutor dismissed the case, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE, picked her up from jail and eventually deported her to Mexico.

“My children blame me for all of this,” Medrano said. “But believe me, this was not my intention; I only wanted to get her help.”

In Texas, which has the second-largest population of undocumented immigrants in the country — with more than 1.6 million of the estimated 13.7 million nationally — the local criminal justice system has become the main funnel sending undocumented immigrants into ICE custody, according to a Texas Tribune analysis of federal government data.

Medrano’s story is emblematic of how the Trump administration has intensified its immigration enforcement compared to Trump’s first term, which focused largely on the southern border amid a record number of asylum seekers. The administration’s focus has now shifted to Democrat-led states such as California, Illinois and New York, where witnesses have recorded masked ICE agents using force in some cases to arrest people at worksites, immigration courts, commercial parking lots and at their homes.

From Trump’s inauguration to July 29, ICE made 138,068 arrests nationwide, 24% of them in Texas.

The Tribune analyzed ICE’s enforcement data from September 2023 to late July 2025, comparing the last 18 months of the Biden administration with the first six months of the Trump administration’s second term. The data, obtained through a public records request to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security by the Deportation Data Project, a group of immigration lawyers and professors, shows that in Texas:

ICE’s average daily arrests have more than doubled from 85 under Biden to 176 under Trump.

Daily arrests have jumped about 30 percentage points in the ICE regions that include Houston and Dallas.

About 52% of ICE arrests have been of people in local jails, down from 61% during the Biden administration.

Arrests of people who had not been convicted of a crime have increased from 42% under Biden to 59% under Trump.

The Harris County Jail leads the country in ICE detainers — a request from immigration agents to hold a person for deportation — while jails in Dallas, Bexar and Travis counties have also been in the top 10.

The data is the most detailed information to be made publicly available since Trump’s return to the White House and offers a glimpse into its aggressive immigration enforcement in the nation’s interior.

Legal observers have noted the administration has stopped consistently publishing detailed immigration data that his predecessors routinely shared with the public — in some cases, previously published data has been deleted from government websites. For example, a Department of Justice report that showed immigrants in Texas commit crimes at a lower rate than U.S. citizens disappeared from the DOJ website soon after Trump took office.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, responded to questions from the Tribune by citing an Oct. 30 social media post by DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin that said “70% of illegal aliens ICE has arrested have criminal convictions or pending criminal charges.

“And that doesn’t even account for those wanted for violent crimes in their country of origin or another country, INTERPOL notices, human rights abusers, gang members, terrorists,” the post says. “The list goes on. The media continues to act as a PR firm for criminals.”

Paul Pirela, a Houston-based immigration lawyer, said the data reveal that the Trump administration’s strategy is simple: “Deport as many people as possible and as fast as possible.”

Cesar Espinosa, executive director of the immigration activist group FIEL in Houston, said his organization can gauge how quickly the Trump administration is working compared to the Biden administration by the number of phone calls they get.

During the Biden administration, he said, “We might get one or two calls with somebody getting picked up by ICE every month, every other month. Now we’re averaging about 15 to 20 calls a day.”

That’s because Texas has been among the most receptive states to the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, said Rocio Paez Ritter, a sociology and criminology associate professor at the University of Arkansas.

“What is happening in Texas is that there seems to be a system in place that makes it easier to help ICE deport people, compared to other states like California, where there is more resistance,” she said.

Less than half of arrested immigrants had criminal convictions

In its first term, the Trump administration focused on the southern border as hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many from Central and South America, came seeking asylum. The administration implemented policies such as the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as the “remain in Mexico” policy, under which more than 70,000 non-Mexican people were forced to wait in Mexico until their asylum cases wound through U.S. immigration courts.

But the second Trump administration has been even more aggressive in clamping down on undocumented immigrants in the nation’s interior, setting a goal for ICE of at least 3,000 arrests a day. The data show that in the first six months of this term, ICE averaged 727 arrests a day, more than doubling the 304 daily arrests under Biden.

To help meet that goal, Congress approved $170 billion for immigration enforcement in July aimed at expanding immigrant detention centers and hiring as many as 10,000 additional ICE agents by the end of the year — which would more than double its current staffing of 6,500 agents — and enticing recruits with a $50,000 signing bonus.

“So as those new officers come on, that is inevitably going to lead to a major increase in arrests, and as detention centers come online, more people will be detained, and so immigration enforcement is going to get more aggressive over the next two years,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, a group in Washington, D.C., that advocates for immigrants. “I don’t see this as just an initial surge followed by a slowdown. I think the goal of this administration is pedal to the metal at all points.”

During last year’s presidential campaign, Trump promised “the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,” and administration officials have repeatedly said they are going after “the worst of the worst.”

But during its first six months, the data show that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who don’t have a criminal record than the Biden administration did in its final 18 months. In Texas, 58% of people ICE arrested under Biden had criminal convictions, compared to 42% under Trump, according to the data, which doesn’t specify the type or seriousness of those crimes.

The rhetoric that the Trump administration is going after hardened criminals gives the impression that the administration is focused on the general public safety, said Charis E. Kubrin, a professor of criminology at the University of California, Irvine.

“Are like 95% of these people arrested the worst of the worst? I don’t think so,” she said. “So the net keeps widening for who is being caught up in these practices and policies.”

César Cuauhtémoc García-Hernández, an immigration law professor at Ohio State University, said the deportation quotas the administration set for itself are pushing them to look beyond people convicted of crimes.

“There simply are not enough migrants in the United States who have committed serious crimes to reach the kinds of detention and deportation numbers that the president and high-ranking and immigration officials in his administration have committed to,” he said.

Two Texas arrests: One on the street, one at an ICE check-in

The data shows that even though the Trump administration has mostly depended on local jails to find and arrest undocumented immigrants, ICE agents have also conducted more non-custodial arrests on the streets, in homes and during ICE check-ins. Some immigrants who have been allowed into the country are required to report to ICE offices periodically while their immigration cases — such as asylum requests — are pending.

Under the Biden administration, 80% of ICE arrests came from county jails and federal and state prisons. Under Trump, that number has dropped to 64.1% — which underscores the increasing ICE activity outside of the criminal justice system.

One of the people arrested recently was Marwan Marouf, who was on his way to work after dropping off his 15-year-old son at a Dallas high school in September. According to Marouf’s older son, about five vehicles surrounded Marouf’s car when ICE agents pulled him over.

Marouf, a Palestinian born in Kuwait with Jordanian citizenship, came to the U.S. on a student visa to study electrical engineering at Louisiana State University, then landed a job as an electrical engineer in Dallas. That’s where he met his wife, a fellow Jordanian who was visiting her sister. A year later, they married and had their first child, Mohammed Marouf, now 27.

The elder Marouf became active in the local Muslim community, volunteering to mentor young people and deliver sermons at a local mosque. He also volunteered with other religious groups, including local Christian and Jewish leaders, his son said.

As part of his volunteer work, he donated to a Palestinian-led charity called the Holy Land Foundation, which the Bush administration shut down in 2001 and later prosecuted its leaders, accusing them of funneling millions of dollars to Hamas, which the U.S. government has designated as a terrorist organization.

Marwan Marouf, like many others, said he donated to the charity believing the group’s efforts were solely to support Palestinian people affected by the Israel-Palestine war.

So when he applied for his green card in 2014, immigration officials notified him that they planned on denying his application. Five years later, their U.S.-born son sponsored his parents for a green card — his mother’s application was approved in 2020.

But on Sept. 22, when ICE agents arrested Marwan Marouf, they gave him a letter notifying him that his green card application was denied. Since then, he’s been in custody at the Bluebonnet Detention Center, about a three-hour drive from Dallas. His lawyers are attempting to fight his deportation.

“We’re very spiritual, so we know God has a greater plan for us,” Mohammed Marouf said.

Marwan Marouf has never been charged in connection with his donation to the now-defunct charity. But a statement attributed to McLaughlin, from Homeland Security, said: “A green card is a privilege, not a right. If you are pushing Hamas propaganda, supporting terrorist organizations, and conducting other anti-American actions, you will face consequences.”

A month before Marouf’s arrest, ICE agents detained Austin resident Yony Perez-Oduardo, 42, but they didn’t have to go looking for him.

Perez-Oduardo had entered the country in Brownsville in May 2022 and when Border Patrol arrested him, he was placed in the Migrant Protection Protocols and was allowed to remain in the country while his asylum request was pending, as long as he checked in with ICE in San Antonio.

Meanwhile, his 40-year-old wife, Ana and their 14-year-old daughter — who came to Texas through a Biden administration program that allowed Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to enter the U.S. under a parole program that Trump has since shut down — eventually received green cards, making them legal permanent residents.

Meanwhile, Perez-Oduardo continued to do his semiannual check-ins with ICE, waiting for a decision on his asylum case. On Aug. 12, Perez was arrested at an ICE office in San Antonio as his wife and daughter watched.

“They took him away and our girl had to witness it,” said his wife. “It traumatized her.”

ICE deported Perez-Oduardo to Mexico in the past month, his lawyer said, because it’s a faster process than trying to deport him to Cuba. If he fought his deportation, he could have been kept in detention for months and banned from the country for a decade, said his lawyer, John Tutton. Perez-Oduardo may have a chance to eventually return to the U.S. because his wife has sponsored him for a green card, his lawyer added.

Texas’ immigration crackdown began four years ago

After his wife was arrested in Houston, Medrano told the judge he didn’t want his wife to be prosecuted on the assault charge. When he tried to post bail for her release, Harris County Jail officials told him ICE had placed a detainer on Gonzalez so agents could deport her after her case was settled.

When prosecutors dismissed the case, she was immediately transferred to an immigrant detention center, then deported to Mexico on Oct. 1. Medrano, who was also undocumented, followed her, leaving their four U.S.-citizen adult children behind. They have since relocated to San Luis Potosí, where they have some distant relatives.

In 2017, the Harris County Sheriff’s Office agreed with ICE to let its agents have access to the jail to investigate inmates’ immigration status.

“This agreement has allowed our agency to redeploy deputies who previously were performing ICE duties in the jail to local law enforcement duties that enhance public safety,” said Jason Spencer, a Harris County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson.

Unlike California, which has the most undocumented immigrants in the nation, Texas has followed the Trump administration’s lead in cracking down on undocumented people under Gov. Greg Abbott.

Since 2021, the state Legislature has approved more than $11 billion for border enforcement and building border walls — all part of Abbott’s signature Operation Lone Star, which since 2021 has sent thousands of state troopers and National Guard soldiers to the Texas-Mexico border.

In 2017, the Legislature approved a bill that outlawed any local policies that prevent cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement, a law that has forced immigrant-friendly cities and counties to work with ICE, even if local leaders oppose it.

In 2023, the state passed one of the nation’s most aggressive immigration enforcement laws, allowing state police to arrest and deport undocumented people who crossed the Texas-Mexico border. The Biden administration, El Paso County and immigrant rights organizations sued the state to overturn the law, which is on hold while the case remains pending in the courts.

And in this year’s legislative session, lawmakers approved a law requiring Texas sheriffs to enter into formal agreements with ICE that allow them to deputize some deputies to work as immigration agents. Also this year, Abbott ordered state police to work with federal immigration agents to arrest undocumented immigrants: Between late January and early September, troopers arrested 3,131 people across the state, most of them on suspicion of improper entry into the country.

In Harris County, which leads the country in ICE detainers, Abbott recently launched a violent crimes task force that includes state troopers and local police, and said residents should expect a higher law enforcement presence “swarming” the area.

“The Trump administration is relying quite heavily on partnerships with local law enforcement agencies in Republican-led states, because those are the places that are willing to work hand in hand with ICE,” said García-Hernández, the Ohio State professor.

Those partnerships can help turn a misdemeanor arrest into a deportation.

Once a person is in jail for any offense, ICE agents can check their immigration status, and if they’re undocumented, ask sheriffs — who commonly run the jails — to hold the person for them so they can be transferred to ICE custody and deported.

“Sometimes it’s been as simple as a traffic ticket for not wearing a seat belt or a DUI or other charges,” said Pirela, the Houston immigration lawyer.

Medrano said he and his wife, who have lived most of their adult lives in the U.S., will struggle to establish new lives in Mexico.

“Before all this, we had a comfortable life,” said Medrano, who worked as a construction contractor most of the time that they lived in Houston.

The event took place just steps from the intersection of Asbury Avenue and Oakton Street, where the Evanston Police Department reported ICE detained two or three people Friday afternoon.

Rev. Michael Nabors of Evanston’s Second Baptist Church introduced several faith leaders and public officials, including Mayor Daniel Biss, Cook County Commissioner Josina Morita and U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston). He said Friday’s altercation between community members and federal agents demanded an immediate response.

“After the melee occurred just across the street, the mayor and I were sitting on a porch and talking, and I said to him, ‘You know, we need to have a community gathering right away.’ We thought about next week, we thought about tomorrow,” Nabors said. “The mayor said, ‘No, we need to have something tomorrow. We need to respond right away.’”

Biss announced that EPD has opened an investigation into what he called “horrendous crimes” committed against community members by federal agents. EPD officers also recorded the badge numbers of federal agents at the intersection Friday afternoon, which Biss called the “first step toward accountability.”

Opening his remarks, Biss said that “24 hours ago, this neighborhood was under attack.” He urged residents to stay alert to federal enforcement activity in Evanston, invoking the story of his grandmother, a Holocaust survivor who “started hearing about the horrors that were occurring across Europe” in 1940.

“And you know what she said? That can’t be. That’s not possible. They’re blowing it out of proportion,” Biss said. “By the time she knew the truth, it was too late to move. It was too late to protect herself, and she and her siblings and her parents were put on a cattle car. The day they got off that cattle car was the last day her parents lived.”

He added that although Evanston residents are “scared,” they “do not give up.”

Skokie resident Rebecca Sambol echoed the mayor’s sentiment.

“I’m 68 years old. In my wildest dreams, did I think this was going to happen in our country? Never,” she said. “But the beautiful thing is that it’s bringing people out to fight back, and I think people will continue to fight. I’m terrified that we’re not going to win, but we can’t give up.”

State Sen. Karina Villa (D-West Chicago) noted that during its recent veto session, the Illinois General Assembly passed legislation encouraging universities, hospitals and childcare centers to develop response plans for potential ICE activity.

In her speech, City Clerk Stephanie Mendoza — Evanston’s first Latina elected official — compared recent events to her upbringing in Tennessee, where she said deportations were commonplace.

“It’s so shameful. We are so tired,” Mendoza said. “What’s happening in Evanston today? I lived like this in Tennessee. This was a daily occurrence, where I went to school and my classmates came to tell us that their parents were gone. This is normal to me, and if we allow this to continue, it will be normal to our children.”

Still, Mendoza said that by “terrorizing children” who look like her, federal agents are inadvertently mobilizing a new generation of community leaders.

Ninth Ward resident and Democratic Party of Evanston President Kathy Hayes, who lives “down the street” from the site of Friday’s altercation, said the vigil reminded her of previous social justice movements in Chicago.

“It reminds me of my cousins in the ’60s, when my aunts were so worried about them going to Grant Park and getting beat up,” Hayes said. “It reminds me that we still have a lot of work to do. And it really reminds me that from the inception of this citizenry — if you want freedom, if you want peace, you have to fight for it. It’s a journey, not a destination.”

The vigil also featured speeches from several faith leaders, including rabbis and pastors. Many invoked the notion of a “beloved community,” popularized by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement, to criticize federal immigration enforcement activity.

Rev. Luke Harris-Ferree, pastor at Evanston’s Grace Lutheran Church, recounted a conversation with their child to emphasize the importance of community resistance.

“Yesterday, I was picking up my four-year-old from preschool, and I didn’t know how to explain to her why the helicopters were hovering overhead. But what I did know how to explain to her is why all of her neighbors were out in the street,” Harris-Ferree said. “I could tell her about how her neighbors were showing up for each other. And she knew that she was cared for in this community and that her friends would be, too.”

But on Wednesday, the justices will consider for the first time whether to say “no” to Mr. Trump in a lasting way.

At issue is the legality of his signature economic policy: the use of emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. The outcome of the case could significantly affect the global economy, American businesses and consumers.

Experts say the case is a tossup that poses difficult legal and political considerations for the justices, made all the more tense by Mr. Trump’s efforts to personalize the dispute.

Mr. Trump had mused about attending the court’s argument this week, and has spoken repeatedly of the case’s importance to him. On Sunday, he said he decided against going to court, but stressed that he considered the stakes to be monumental.

The case “is one of the most important in the history of the country,” Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “If a president was not able to quickly and nimbly use the power of tariffs, we would be defenseless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our nation.”

Observers of the court said the justices would be keenly aware that Mr. Trump would perceive a legal defeat as a personal blow.

“You can’t help but think that that’s going to be hovering over the decision-making process in this case,” said Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who was the solicitor general during the Obama administration.

The Supreme Court’s six conservative justices have so far been receptive to Mr. Trump’s claims of presidential authority. Among other things, they have allowed the administration to withhold funds appropriated by Congress, kick transgender troops out of the military and pursue aggressive immigration-related policies — but all on a temporary, emergency basis.

The tariffs case is the first time the justices have weighed the underlying legal merits of a key administration priority in Mr. Trump’s second term.

Other such cases are on the horizon. Next month, the court will consider Mr. Trump’s efforts to seize control of independent agencies. And in January, the justices will weigh his attempt to remove a member of the Federal Reserve Board. The administration has also asked them to consider the legality of the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship.

Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former top Justice Department lawyer under George W. Bush, said that because the legal issues were so closely contested in the tariffs matter, some justices could weigh broader implications across the set of presidential cases, concerned about either handing Mr. Trump too much power — or too many defeats.

“At the end of this term, we’ll see wins and losses for Trump on presidential power,” he said. “This is the case I think is the closest, so I don’t know which way it will cut.”

In a sign that the court recognizes the importance of the tariffs case, the justices set a brisk schedule for the parties to submit written briefs and present oral arguments. They now seem likely to rule swiftly rather than wait until the end of the term next summer, as is their usual practice for the most consequential decisions.

The case has divided the conservative legal community.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes. But soon after taking office, Mr. Trump declared that a 1977 law gave him the power to impose tariffs unilaterally during emergencies.

He used the statute to announce tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China, Canada and Mexico, saying the levies were a punishment for failing to stop the flow of fentanyl. In April, he again relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act when he announced tariffs on imports from more than 100 trading partners, saying they were needed to address trade deficits with the rest of the world.

The administration’s on-again, off-again taxes on imports have roiled small businesses, prompting lawsuits from state officials and six companies, including the wine importer V.O.S. Selections and the toy manufacturer Learning Resources, whose cases are before the court on Wednesday. Mr. Trump’s actions, they say, were unlawful, cut into their profits and forced them to lay off employees and raise prices.

The 1977 statute gives the president certain tools to “deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat” to “the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States.” That includes the power to “regulate” imports.

The president’s lawyers say that language gives him broad authority to impose tariffs when he believes an emergency exists.

But the law does not mention the words “tariffs,” “taxes” or “duties.” If the word “regulate” meant “tax,” the small businesses told the court, the president “could tax everything from autos to zoos.”

From the start, the administration has insisted that the consequences for the country are too significant for the court to resist Mr. Trump. They say that rolling back the tariffs — and potentially refunding money already collected — could lead to economic ruin akin to the Great Depression, an interruption of trade negotiations and diplomatic embarrassment.

“I think the more deals we’ve done, the more money coming in, it gets harder and harder for SCOTUS to rule against us,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in August, using an acronym for the Supreme Court.

But prominent legal figures opposed to the tariffs, including retired federal judges and a founder of the conservative Federalist Society, said the case was not a close call. While past presidents have invoked the emergency statute to impose sanctions or to freeze a country’s assets, Mr. Trump is the first in 50 years to rely on it to impose tariffs.

“Emergency powers are meant to be used in emergencies,” said Michael W. McConnell, a former federal appeals court judge nominated by President George W. Bush, who is leading the coalition of small businesses. “No Supreme Court would want to provoke a confrontation with a president of the United States unnecessarily, but on the other hand, the law is the law.”

The president’s order argued that the tariffs were needed as a response to “large and persistent” trade deficits.

Tara Leigh Grove, a University of Texas at Austin law professor, said the justices could find it a stretch to characterize longstanding trade deficits as an emergency. On the other hand, she said, the statute is broad and appears to give a president a lot of discretion.

“The justices will be struggling with whether they want to second-guess any presidential decision about an emergency,” she said.

The case will also force the justices to address two doctrines favored by the conservative legal movement, both of which appear to work against the president’s claims. The “major questions doctrine” says Congress must use clear language to authorize executive actions that could transform the economy. The Supreme Court relied on the doctrine to invalidate many of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s key initiatives, including his student loan forgiveness program.

The other — the “nondelegation doctrine” — says that Congress cannot transfer unlimited legislative powers — like its taxing authority — to the executive branch.

D. John Sauer, the solicitor general, said the president’s use of the statute to impose tariffs was not an unlimited delegation of power. The law requires declared emergencies to expire in a year and reporting to Congress about the tools used in the meantime. Even so, he said the president’s power to declare an emergency was not subject to review by the courts.

“Judges lack the institutional competence to determine when foreign affairs pose an unusual and extraordinary threat that requires an emergency response,” he wrote in a court filing.

Mr. Sauer also pointed to a recent concurring opinion from Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in another case that suggested the two doctrines play little to no role in the context of national security and foreign policy emergencies.

The challenges to Mr. Trump’s tariffs reached the Supreme Court after judges in three different lower courts ruled against the administration but allowed the import taxes to remain in effect while litigation continued.

In a 7-to-4 ruling in late August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the emergency statute did not authorize “tariffs of the magnitude” the president announced.

“Whenever Congress intends to delegate to the president the authority to impose tariffs, it does so explicitly,” the majority said, declining to decide whether the statute might allow Mr. Trump to impose more limited tariffs.

The appeals court did not divide along ideological lines. Close observers of the court have pointed to a dissenting opinion from Judge Richard G. Taranto, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, as a possible guidepost for the Supreme Court’s conservatives, should they back Mr. Trump.

Judge Taranto argued that Congress intentionally used broad language to give presidents flexibility, embodying “an eyes-open congressional grant of broad emergency authority in this foreign affairs realm.”

Mr. Sauer referred to Judge Taranto’s dissent 10 times in his filing.

Professor Grove said the Supreme Court would face what she described as “legitimacy dilemma” as they weigh the implications of their decision for the president’s legacy and the economy.

Under the Trump administration, immigration agents no longer routinely check or consider a detained immigrant’s status as a crime victim before deporting or detaining them.
“It was my husband.” “My husband told me it was such a coincidence that he was there when we arrived,” she said.","Carmen’s abusive husband came home drunk one night last summer. He pounded and kicked the door. He threatened to kill her as her young son watched in horror. She called police, eventually obtaining a restraining order. Months later he returned and beat her again. Police came again and he was eventually deported.

Thinking she finally escaped his cruelty, Carmen applied for what is known as a U-Visa. The visa provides crime victims a way to stay in the United States legally, but the Trump administration has routinely ignored pending applications.

During a regular immigration check-in in June, Carmen was detained. Two months later, she was put on a plane with her 8-year-old son, who just completed second grade. She was headed to her home country, terrified her husband would find her.

Lawyers for Carmen along with several immigrant victims of human trafficking, domestic violence and other crimes last month sued the Trump administration in the Central District of California for detaining and deporting survivors with pending visa applications, some of whom have been granted status to stay and sometimes work.

They argue that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement implemented a policy in the early days of the administration that upended decades-long standards aimed at protecting victims with pending applications for a class of visas known as survivor-based protections.

Congress created those visas to ensure immigrant victims would report crimes to law enforcement and be safe, but lawyers for the victims argue the administration has reneged on those promises.

“These laws have existed because they keep us all safe, and there is a process and legal rights that attach when you seek out those protections,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, who is one of the lead attorneys on the case.

Carmen’s real name and certain details about her case weren’t included in the lawsuit because her lawyers say her life is still at risk.

But others were.

Immigration agents arrested Kenia Jackeline Merlos, a native of Honduras, during a family outing near the Canadian border. The Portland, Ore., mother of four U.S. citizen children had been given deferred status allowing her to reside in the U.S. after a man pulled a gun and threatened to kill her. Merlos has been in detention for about four months in Washington state. She was released late last month, weeks after a judge threw out her case.

Yessenia Ruano self-deported after immigration agents told her she would be removed, despite her pending T-Visa application for trafficking survivors. Ruano, a teacher’s aide in Wisconsin, fled El Salvador and had been trafficked in the United States. A mother of twins girls, she had been living in the U.S. for 14 years, fighting a removal order. Rather than have her children see her arrested and removed, she decided to leave.

Under the Trump administration, immigration agents no longer routinely check or consider a detained immigrant’s status as a crime victim before deporting or detaining them. The policy only makes an exception if it will interfere with law enforcement investigations.

The administration’s actions affect nearly half a million immigrants who are awaiting a decision on a pending application for survivor-based protections, the most common of which is the U-Visa. Because Congress capped the number of visas that can be issued annually at 10,000, it can take a person 20 years to have their application processed.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, defended the practice of deporting those stuck in limbo, saying every unauthorized immigrant ICE removes “has had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

The lawsuit argues the administration violated procedural rules in referencing the executive order “Protecting the American People Against Invasion” as the main justification for the policy.

The invasion, it states, is “fictional” but the rhetoric has allowed Department of Homeland Security Sec. Kristi Noem and the immigration agencies to wage an “arbitrary, xenophobic and militarized mass deportation campaign that has terrorized immigrant communities and further victimized survivors of domestic violence, human trafficking and other serious crimes who Congress sought to protect.”

The lawsuit is one of several challenging the agencies’ practice as the administration focuses its enforcement campaign in Democratic-led cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C.

“They just detain and deport them,” said Rebecca Brown, with Public Counsel, one of the groups litigating the case. “It’s is a policy of arrest first, ask questions later.”

In Carmen’s case, according to a sworn declaration filed in the lawsuit, she arrived in 2022 to the United States and sought asylum. A judge denied her case. She scraped together money and found an attorney to file an appeal. She later learned he didn’t correctly fill out the forms and the case was denied. In the meantime, she did regular check-ins with immigration officials as the abuse worsened.

“I was terrified of these appointments, but I never missed a single appointment,” she said in the declaration.

The night her husband tried to knock down the door, her son was hysterical. The restraining order helped for a while, but a few months later, he showed up again.

Law enforcement eventually placed an ankle monitor on her husband, but he came to her son’s soccer games, stalking them and watching from afar.

Carmen submitted the U-Visa in March and learned he had been deported that same month. Finally, she thought she would be free.

Months later, she was summoned to an immigration check-in. She arrived alone. Officials told her to return the next day for an appointment with ICE. When she did, an officer told her she was being detained and would be deported.

Was there someone who could care for her son, the officer asked.

“I didn’t have anyone,” she said in the statement.

A family member brought her boy to the facility and the two were transferred to a recently reopened family detention center in Texas. There, her son, distraught, slept all hours of the day.

“My son suffered so much,” she stated. “He would try to sleep in the morning so the day would go faster and he wouldn’t have to endure the many hours imprisoned.”

After a month at the facility, Carmen’s new attorney informed authorities of the pending application and asked for her release because her son suffered from medical issues, as did she. The request was denied, as were others to pause the removal.

At the end of July, she and her son were deported.

“I had nowhere to go,” she stated.

She emerged from the plane to her nightmare.

“I saw a man standing across from us and my heart sank,” she said. “It was my husband.”

“My husband told me it was such a coincidence that he was there when we arrived,” she said. “I knew he was lying. He had found that we were being deported and he was there to take us.

“I had no choice, I had nowhere else to go and there was no one speaking up for me.”

Now she says she is even more trapped than before.

He took her passports, so she can’t travel. She must ask permission just to leave the house, and if she is allowed to, give him constant updates while she is away. At night, he takes her phone and checks it, interrogating her about every call she made.

“I never know what will make him angry,” she said. “We live in constant fear.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/222782c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fac%2Fe8%2F12897f6a4be0afe4dc442170cdef%2Fice-domestic-violence-02.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 06:17:07.005623

In a Hyde Park yarn shop on Sunday, residents came together, not to knit, but to assemble whistle kits, the kind that are being handed out in neighborhoods across the city to alert people when federal agents are in the area.

""No, I think they haven't gone far enough, because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges who were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" Trump said.

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss appeared on CNN on Sunday morning to push back on allegations that two of the three U.S. citizens who were violently arrested in the north suburb on Friday purposely crashed into a federal agents' vehicle.

And then, they started literally beating up innocent bystanders. It's an outrage, and it's something we've got to stand up against.""

Meanwhile, in west suburban Addison, some remain on edge. One week after agents were seen breaking an SUV's windows and arresting two people at La Huerta supermarket, they were back again on Sunday, causing an immediate reaction from rapid response teams in the area.

""We are a diverse community, and I do feel they are targeting Addison specifically because we do have a huge immigrant population. And they are here to intimidate and terrorize the community,"" said rapid responder Maria Sinkule.

In response some Evanston community members have set up ""rapid response"" teams, organizing to warn residents when federal agents are spotted and working to slow the agents as they travel through the region.

One agent who was restraining a man on the ground Friday appeared to punch him in the head as it was pressed against the asphalt. The Department of Homeland Security later said the officer delivered ""defensive strikes"" after the man ""grabbed the agent's genitals and squeezed.""

Some witnesses claimed online that the agents caused the crash by suddenly braking in front of the sedan, though federal officials disputed that account. City leaders swiftly condemned the agents' actions.

In a news conference shortly after the episode, Mayor Daniel Biss said immigration agents had ""beaten people up"" and ""abducted them.""

""It is an outrage,"" Biss said. ""Our message for ICE is simple: Get the hell out of Evanston.""

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agents were being ""aggressively tailgated"" and the sedan hit them as they tried to make a U-turn.

""A hostile crowd then surrounded agents and their vehicle, verbally abusing and spitting on them,"" the agency said. ""One physically assaulted a Border Patrol agent and kicked an agent. As he was being arrested, he grabbed the agent's genitals and squeezed them. The agent delivered several defensive strikes to free himself.""

The mayor has urged more people to join the rapid response team, and city officials have passed ordinances declaring city property to be ""No ICE Zones."" Last week the Evanston Police Department began sending a supervisor to any reported immigration enforcement scene to document what happens and collect evidence for the Illinois attorney general's Civil Rights Division, said Police Cmdr. Ryan Glew.

Glew said officers received calls from both federal agents and bystanders. A supervisor arrived after the arrests were made, and several people were treated by paramedics for exposure to pepper spray.

""When we responded, those efforts were focused on stabilizing the situation and preventing further conflict between ICE agents and community members,"" he said.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute Middle School, was part of the crowd that formed after the collision.

""This was awful. There were ICE agents and CBP agents pointing guns at community members, spraying pepper spray in the face of community members,"" she said at the news conference.

""This was terrifying to community members,"" Harned said. ""It was horrifying to a student who happened to be in a car and witnessed it. It is not OK.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211440965_2AChicago1103_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-11-03 06:17:14.704866

Now that Trump’s returned, his administration is working to fulfill that promise, even as resistance to his immigration policies galvanizes his opponents. Have Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests and deportations become a Republican liability? Perhaps Americans aren’t as disturbed by immigration enforcement as many in the media would have you believe.

“Biden’s Border Fiasco”

What Bloomberg Opinion termed “Biden’s Border Fiasco” in August 2023, a month in which nearly 200,000 migrants were apprehended at the Southwest border, grabbed most of the immigration headlines during the last administration.

But even as the unauthorized population swelled, imposing crushing fiscal costs on communities, Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, was tightening restrictions on ICE’s ability to detain and deport illegal immigrants—including criminals.

Texas and Louisiana challenged those Mayorkas restrictions, but the Biden administration successfully fought all the way to the Supreme Court to preserve the secretary’s authority to not arrest criminal aliens.

Consequently, ICE “interior removals” of criminals in the United States plummeted, from nearly 78,500 in FY 2019 to fewer than 27,000 in FY 2022.

The Backlash

Then, reality intervened. The murders of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, and others by illegal immigrants—some released by DHS at the border—spurred outrage, including an outburst during Biden’s 2024 State of the Union address.

Democrats never recovered, and Republicans took control of Congress and the White House in November in large part due to immigration concerns.

Trump tapped Tom Homan, a DHS careerist turned campaign surrogate, to lead the administration’s immigration-enforcement efforts.

Illegal entries slowed to a trickle, falling from just over 56,500 apprehensions at the Southwest border in December to just fewer than 4,600 in July.

Attention Turns to the Interior

Border Patrol hasn’t released any illegal migrants since April, and as DHS has achieved “operational control” of the border, media attention has turned to ICE operations in the interior.

Homan and ICE have given them plenty to talk about.

Riots in L.A. In June, ICE launched what Al-Jazeera termed “military-sized raids” in Los Angeles, triggering “protests” that devolved into chaos as rioters assaulted local law enforcement.

Over the objections of L.A. Mayor Karen Bass (D) and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), Trump called out the National Guard and Marines to protect agents and federal property, prompting a lawsuit by the state. On September 2, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer declared the deployment illegal.

L.A. residents who alleged they’d been unlawfully targeted for immigration stops filed suit, and on July 11, U.S. District Court Judge Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong imposed limits on factors officers could rely on in initiating “detentive” questioning.

That order barred ICE from relying on certain characteristics, including “apparent race or ethnicity” and “presence at a particular location”, when making stops in the U.S. Central District of California, America’s most populous. The L.A. region alone is home to more than 20 million residents, 2 million here illegally.

On September 8 the Supreme Court enjoined that order, with Justice Kavanaugh noting in concurrence that under the Court’s “precedents, not to mention common sense” the factors Judge Frimpong listed “can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

“Midway Blitz”. ICE rolled on, launching “Operation Midway Blitz” in Chicago in early September.

DHS claims the operation has resulted in 3,000 arrests in Illinois and neighboring states, including alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, child sex offenders, murderers, and drug traffickers. It’s also triggered the sorts of protests that played out in L.A. in June.

Some have turned violent, with DHS contending ICE’s officers have been targeted by “vehicular assaults”.

Protests ramped up after an October 6 early morning raid at a Chicago apartment building in which agents allegedly “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters” while making 37 arrests.

In response to Midway Blitz, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) compared ICE enforcement to “Nazi Germany”, while Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) declared city property “ICE Free Zones”.

Again, Trump called out the National Guard, Democratic officials filed lawsuits, and a U.S. district court judge imposed a temporary restraining order on troop deployments.

On October 28, Judge Sara Ellis of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an order requiring “all Federal Agents operating in Operation Midway Blitz to place an identifier conspicuously on their uniform where one can easily view it and the Agent's equipment does not obscure it”.

She also directed CBP to “strive to ensure” agency officers assisting in Midway Blitz carry body−worn cameras, a directive she applied specifically to El Centro Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino (who is quarterbacking Midway Blitz, though it’s an inapt analogy in football terms) and to provide the court with “all CBP use of force reports relating to Operation Midway Blitz from” September 2 through October 25, and to continue to do so on an ongoing basis.

Judge Ellis also ordered Chief Bovino to appear in her court “in person, week days at 5:45 PM”, which prompted DOJ to file with the Seventh Circuit a petition for a writ of mandamus and a stay of that particular requirement, which the department termed and “extraordinary and extraordinarily disruptive requirement”.

On October 29, the Seventh Circuit issued an administrative stay of the order directing Chief Bovino’s appearance pending briefing.

Portland. A litigation cycle similar to the ones in Los Angeles and Chicago has also played out over National Guard deployments in Portland, Ore., where protests at an ICE facility have been ongoing since early June.

At times, they’ve turned violent, with Portland police declaring a riot on June 14.

As I recently reported, a district court judge had blocked Trump from sending the National Guard from federalizing and deploying troops to Oregon on October 4, an injunction a divided three-judge Ninth Circuit panel stayed on October 23 in an order currently on hold pending consideration whether the case should be reconsidered by a larger, 11-judge, en banc panel of the circuit court.

A Historical Perspective

Media critics now contend, and the president’s supporters fear, Trump’s “mass deportation” plans are turning off an electorate that still largely supports immigration enforcement.

There’s support for their respective contentions and concerns.

Following its most recent polling, the New York Times reported that while “the share of registered voters who favor deporting immigrants living in the country illegally — 54 percent — has remained unchanged”, 52 percent nonetheless oppose Trump’s handling of immigration and “51 percent said his actions around immigration enforcement had gone too far”.

From my more than three decades of immigration experience, starting with the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in California in the 1990s, trust me when I say that it’s a familiar trend—but not likely as straightforward as it appears.

First, ICE enforcement now isn’t much different than INS enforcement was in the past; if anything, it’s less robust.

In a 1984 opinion, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor concluded “the average INS agent arrests almost 500 illegal aliens” annually.

If ICE were maintaining that pace, arrests would top 3 million per annum, four times their current rate.

And those “military-style raids” that triggered massive protests in Los Angeles? Court filings indicate they resulted in “2,805 immigration arrests” over six weeks, .14 percent of the area’s illegal population.

The Chicago apartment raid? The Sun Times reports residents there have long suffered “unlivable conditions”, quoting one woman who complained, “It was a nasty mess before ICE came. . .. So don’t nobody keep putting that s--- on ICE, because that was not ICE.”

But, what has changed since 1990s is the rise of “sanctuary jurisdictions”, which refuse to honor ICE detainers for criminal detainees or allow immigration officers into their jails and prisons.

Those laws were rare until recently, because they primarily protect criminals and force immigration officers to make the sorts of dangerous “street arrests” protestors are railing against.

Homan promised a “worst first” deportation plan that starts with criminal deportations, and that’s about what he’s delivered. Of the 46,015 aliens in ICE detention, 64 percent have criminal convictions or pending charges. An untold number of the rest are under final removal orders.

Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) contends that if ICE “was only going after dangerous criminals, there would be no debate”.

His state, however, has among the worst sanctuary laws, and he’s done nothing about them. Nor have Newsom and Bass.

“The State of the Parties”

Note that in the latest Harvard/Harris poll, 78 percent of voters—including 69 percent of Democrats—supported “deporting immigrants who are here illegally and have committed crimes”. That’s three points higher than in August Harvard/Harris polling, even after the L.A., Chicago, and Portland protests.

Most at-large arrests, criminal or immigration, are confrontational and sometimes violent. Americans eschew confrontations of any sort, so it’s no surprise Trump’s immigration support has dipped. But does that benefit his political opponents?

Republican party pollster and strategist Patrick Ruffini has his doubts.

In an October 24 article in The Intersection captioned “The state of the parties”, he examined polls of issues important to U.S. voters and attempted to interpret what they show.

He conceded at the outset that “on the surface, people are more aligned with the Democrats than the Republicans on their prioritization of the top issues”, highlighting polling revealing (among other issues) that, while 27 percent of voters thing the government should be focused on immigration, 71 percent think the GOP is focused on that issue and 17 percent think Democrats are.

That suggests Trump’s political opponents’ are more aligned with the electorate than his party is.

The Democratic Party also bests the Republicans on such topics as “shares my views on most issues” (D+2), “cares about people like me” (D+5), and “offers stability, not chaos” (D+3).

Where the Democrats fall short, according to Ruffini, “is . . . execution, where Republicans have a massive advantage on things like ‘has a good plan and follows through on it’ (R+8), ‘strong and decisive’ (R+20), and ‘says what they really think, even when it’s not popular’ (R+24).”

“Many of these characteristics”, he aptly notes, “are ones that are personally associated with Trump. They may not extend to other Republicans once he’s gone. But as long as he’s here, voters associate the party with strength, decisiveness, and action.”

In perhaps his most controversial point, Ruffini then argues that “a better ability to get things done overrides a lot of things, including extremism”.

That’s not an idle opinion, as he next cites polling showing majorities across all education levels “would rather support” a party “better at getting things done, even if its views are sometimes too extreme” over one “that’s more mainstream, even if it’s not as good at getting things done”.

The Gaps Between Voters’ Concerns and Democrats’

Ruffini’s focus isn’t immigration per se, but his findings are readily applicable to voters’ perspectives on what’s happening with respect to the immigration enforcement actions described above.

Which likely explains why Trump’s media critics both decry the president’s immigration-enforcement operations and their effectiveness in stoking tales of alleged internecine feuds among the president’s advisors—the rhetorical equivalent of complaining a restaurant’s food is awful and its portions too small.

They want to show Trump’s immigration actions are both extreme and fruitless, which logically no one would support.

In that vein, rarely does a day go by that I don’t field a question from some outlet seeking to undermine (or prove) DHS’s claim that “more than 2 illegal million aliens” have been deported or left since Trump returned.

In my mind (and likely in the minds of more than a few Americans), the real focus should be on whether the unauthorized population has risen or fallen under Trump II, and it’s beyond cavil that it’s the latter.

But, want proof about what Americans think? Ruy Texeira in The Liberal Patriot on October 30 included a poll conducted by the “Welcome Party”, one of several of what he describes as “Democratic-aligned organizations focusing on the party change imperative and promulgating useful analyses and suggestions”.

Results of that poll showed a -21 percent gap between how much voters think Democrats should prioritize “securing the border” and how much they do prioritize it. Conversely, that poll revealed a +26 percent gap between Democrats’ focus on “protecting the rights of undocumented immigrants” and what voters think they should be doing in that regard.

In other words, voters believe the president’s political opponents are too focused on protecting illegal aliens currently here and too little concerned about border security.

The Welcome Party polled 17 different issues, and those two responses show the biggest gap between what voters wanted and what they think Democrats want—and those were the only immigration-related questions on that list.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2025-07/ICE-arrest2.png,N,,2025-11-03 08:18:54.963492

Ro Khanna on Friday demanded urgent congressional action to avert “another endless, regime-change war” amid reports that President Donald Trump is weighing military strikes inside Venezuela.

Such strikes, warned Khanna (D-Calif.), would be “blatantly unconstitutional.”

“The United States Congress must speak up and stop this,” Khanna said in a video posted to social media. “No president, according to the Constitution, has the authority to strike another country without Congress’ approval. And the American people have voted against regime change and endless wars.”

Khanna’s remarks came in response to reporting by the Miami Herald and the Wall Street Journal on internal Trump administration discussions regarding possible airstrike targets inside Venezuela.

The Herald reported early Friday that the administration “has made the decision to attack military installations inside Venezuela and the strikes could come at any moment.” The Journal, in a story published Thursday, was more reserved, reporting that the administration “has identified targets in Venezuela that include military facilities used to smuggle drugs,” but adding that “the president hasn’t made a final decision on ordering land strikes.”

Citing unnamed US officials familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that “the targets would send a clear message to Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro that it is time to step down.”

Following the reports, the White House denied that Trump has finalized plans for a military strike on Venezuela. Trump himself told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday that he has not made a final decision, signaling his belief he has the authority to do so if he chooses.

Last week, the president said publicly that land strikes are “going to be next” following his illegal, deadly strikes on boats in waters off Central and South America.

Trump has said he would not seek approval from Congress before attacking Venezuela directly.

A potentially imminent, unauthorized US attack on Venezuela and the administration’s accelerating military buildup in the Caribbean have thus far drawn vocal opposition from just a fraction of the lawmakers on Capitol Hill, currently embroiled in a shutdown fight.

Just three senators — Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) — are listed as official backers of a resolution aimed at preventing Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization. Other senators, including Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), have spoken out against Trump’s belligerence toward Venezuela.

“Trump is illegally threatening war with Venezuela — after killing more than 50 people in unauthorized strikes at sea,” Sanders wrote in a social media post on Friday. “The Constitution is clear: Only Congress can declare war. Congress must defend the law and end Trump’s militarism.”

Dylan Williams, vice president of government affairs at the Center for International Policy, wrote Friday that “most Americans oppose overthrowing Venezuela’s leaders by force — and an even larger majority oppose invading.”

“Call your senators and tell them to vote for S.J.Res.90 to block Trump’s unauthorized use of military force,” Williams added. “The Capitol switchboard can connect you to your senators’ offices at 202-224-3121.”

A similar resolution led by Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) in the US House has just over 30 cosponsors.

Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) announced his support for the House resolution on Thursday, saying in a statement that “Trump does not have the legal authority to launch military strikes inside Venezuela without a specific authorization by Congress.”

“I am deeply troubled by reports that suggest this administration believes otherwise,” said Neguse. “Any unilateral directive to send Americans into war is not only reckless, but illegal and an affront to the House of Representatives’ powers under Article I of our Constitution.”

“The American people oppose being dragged into yet another endless war, this time in Venezuela, and our constitutional order demands deliberation by the U.S. Congress — period,” Neguse added.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243694769.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 08:18:26.003150

Recklessness and heartlessness coming out of Washington. A careless, chaotic, reckless economic policy coming out of Washington. She did not mention Donald Trump.

The Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, pitched her closing argument on Saturday to more than 7,000 supporters at a campaign rally in Norfolk, home to the world’s biggest naval base.

To the joy of the crowd she was joined on stage by former president Barack Obama, who eviscerated the Trump presidency with barbs, sarcasm and biting critiques. Spanberger, by contrast, is betting that the antidote to Trumpism is unflashy competence and a focus on the cost of living.

The former CIA officer and three-term congresswoman has not attended any of the No Kings protests that featured millions of anti-Trump voters and seldom mentions him by name. “I feel like if I say it too much, it’s like Beetlejuice,” the 46-year-old joked recently to the Associated Press. “He’s gonna show up.”

It is a different approach a year after Kamala Harris hammered a warning about stopping Trump to save democracy only for him to sweep back into power. On Tuesday Democrats hope to start hauling themselves up off the canvas by winning gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia.

History will be made in Virginia where Spanberger and the Republican lieutenant-governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, are vying to become the state’s first female governor. The commonwealth, as it is known, is also seeking to reassert its claim to be the most progressive state in the south after four years under Republican Glenn Youngkin.

Virginia is second only to California in the size of its federal workforce. Spanberger has vowed in stump speeches to stand up for the thousands of employees laid off by Trump’s department of government efficiency, or Doge.

“We need a governor who will support the thousands upon thousands of Virginia families whose livelihoods have been disrupted or destroyed because of Doge and now this government shutdown,” she said in Norfolk, against a backdrop of a giant Stars and Stripes and supporters waving mini-US flags and campaign signs.

“We do not need someone who has said that losing a job isn’t a ‘real issue’ when we have Virginians who have dedicated themselves to service to our country who have lost their jobs because of bad policies and a reckless administration.”

The “someone” in question was Earle-Sears, 61, who has been criticised for not taking the government shutdown seriously. The marine veteran has vowed to cut taxes, root out wasteful government spending and be tough on crime. A Jamaican-born immigrant, she has accused Democrats of playing “the race card”.

Her campaign was boosted by an endorsement from Trump and a down-ticket scandal involving the Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, who reportedly sent violent text messages about a political rival in 2022.

But polls show Earle-Sears trailing by about seven percentage points in a state that Obama won in 2008 – the first Democrat in 44 years to do so – and that Trump has lost three times. Indeed, Virginia had been moving left for years on issues such as reproductive rights, gun safety and the death penalty until Youngkin’s 2021 victory put a Republican back in the governor’s mansion.

Earle-Sears has sought to emulate the Youngkin playbook with a focus on culture war issues such as abortion, parents’ rights and transgender athletes. She ran an ad that attacks Spanberger for voting “to let boys share locker rooms with little girls” and “let children change genders without telling their parents”.

Echoing a spot from Trump’s campaign last year, a narrator says: “Spanberger is for they/them, not us.” But this time the messages appear to be falling flat.

Brian Jones, a partner at Black Rock Group, told an audience at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington that Republicans “jumped right to where they thought they could replicate some of the success of President Trump on the trans issue. It’s my sense that it hasn’t broken through. I don’t know if people are tired of the message or it’s just not as effective.

“My sense is that Winsome Sears has not been effective in driving a credible message on Spanberger, [who has] done a nice job on the bio front presenting herself as somebody who is this committed centrist.”

Spanberger’s brand was reinforced on Saturday when Obama extolled her ability to reach across the aisle despite Washington’s deepening polarisation. He told the crowd: “Abigail is ranked as the most bipartisan member of Congress from the Commonwealth. She has had bills signed into law by both President Trump and President Biden. That is not easy to do.”

As Democrats continue to debate how to fight back, Spanberger has not been drawing the huge crowds that follow progressive Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But those who did attend the rally in Norfolk took a pragmatic view of her candidacy in a purple state such as Virginia.

Kacie Schappert, 46, a doctor’s assistant attending with her 14-year-old daughter, said: “Some things I agree with, some things I don’t but at this point regardless Democrats need to come together and fight the craziness that’s going on. We have to vote for the people that are most going to do that for us. She’s a woman; she’s in a state that can go either way; she has to be moderate.”

The party that lost the White House is often the more energised in off-year elections and 2025 promises to be no different. A vendor outside the rally was selling merchandise with slogans such as “Anti Trump Grandmas Club”, “Are we great yet?”, “Cats against Trump”, “Elect a clown, expect a circus”, “Gulf of Mexico: est 1550”, “No Kings in America”, “No kings since 1776” and a silhouette of dog defecating on the word “Trump”.

Standing in a queue outside the sports arena, June Ameika, 61, a pilates and yoga teacher whose husband served in the navy for 30 years, said: “What’s going on in our country at the moment is absolutely frightening and so it takes all of us to come out and show support and be visible.

“Every election is about sending a message. We have to let Trump know that his behaviour is despicable, breaking the law is despicable, and we’re not going to stand for it. Donald Trump has basically no regard for the democracy of this country and that’s fundamental going forward.”

Spanberger is currently embarked on her second statewide bus tour of the campaign. On Thursday, she spoke at a “Latinos for Spanberger” event at a Mexican restaurant in Alexandria, delivering her stump speech in both English and Spanish – a language she used to conduct arrests during her days as a federal agent working narcotics cases.

She accused the Trump administration of terrorising communities with its hardline approach to immigration. “I am a law-and-order Democrat – I’m a former intel officer and a former federal agent – but it is not law and in order to have your citizens, your community members, live in fear,” she said.

Some attenders were government workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began a month ago. Anna, 45, a Latino single mother who did not wish to give her last name, said: “I try to save, but it’s not going to last long. Instead of going out and contributing to the global economy, now it’s more restricted. I cannot spend a lot of money on certain things. It’s hard.”

Anna said she would vote for Spanberger because of immigration, abortion and LGBTQ rights and urged Latino voters, who swung towards the Republicans last year, to return to the Democratic fold. “I hope people are opening their eyes. Latinos have to unify. I hope those who were in the middle and went towards Trump will now switch.”

Spanberger presented herself as a bulwark against the chaos and cruelty emanating from Washington. She promised to work tirelessly to lower costs in housing, energy and healthcare and to improve public schools. She did not dwell on Trump and his attacks on institutions.

Lauren Spears, 55, who works part-time at a school, said: “I love her background: CIA, law enforcement, congresswoman. I love that she is reasonable, moderate, very smart. She is a wonky policy kind of person and is good at compromise, which is what our government desperately needs.”

Republicans have poured late money into the race but Trump has given only tepid support for Earle-Sears and has not campaigned with her in person – a clue that he suspects she cannot win. She has struggled to pull off the Trump-lite approach that Youngkin mastered four years ago by nodding to Maga without fully embracing it.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9c53d67c955d151bd8952d72265e0ba6e445644/240_0_3682_2946/master/3682.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6bd77cfd0533e01913ee98d75d420229",N,,2025-11-03 08:18:44.325567

Notably, the bill creates the Illinois Bivens Act, which allows individuals to sue over civil immigration enforcement actions that violate state or federal constitutional rights.

Defendants may be liable for civil damages for false imprisonment, including statutory damages of $10,000, the bill states. These damages can increase based on various factors in the defendant’s conduct, including the use of facial coverings, crowd control measures like tear gas, vehicles with a non-Illinois license plate or no license plate at all and body cameras.

Having cleared the Senate with a 40-18 vote and the House with a 75-32 vote, HB 1312, sponsored by Senate President Don Harmon (D-Oak Park), now awaits Gov. JB Pritzker’s approval. The bill also received support from State Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview), State Sen. Mike Simmons (D-Chicago) and State Rep. Hoan Huynh (D-Chicago).

HB 1312 also prohibits employers from taking retaliatory actions against employees for “disclosing or threatening to disclose in good faith a violation of the Illinois Bivens Act,” amending the Whistleblower Act.

According to the bill, retaliation includes contacting — or threatening to contact — immigration authorities, or reporting an employee’s or their family member’s immigration or citizenship status to any federal, state or local agency, the bill states.

Lawmakers included additional legislation prohibiting civil immigration arrests in and around state courthouses, with a 1,000-foot safe zone that includes parking facilities and nearby streets. This protects good-faith attendees of court proceedings, with violators liable for civil damages for false imprisonment, including actual damages and $10,000 in statutory damages.

Hospitals, schools and licensed daycare centers must adopt and submit policies regulating law enforcement interactions and protecting patient information under the new legislation. This includes designating a point of contact to be notified of “all law enforcement presence or information requests” at hospitals, according to the bill.

HB 1312 states that schools should develop procedures for attempted campus entry by law enforcement agents and provide information on how community members should respond on school websites by Jan. 1, 2026.

The bill also includes a severability clause — if any one part is invalidated, the rest remains valid. Once signed by Pritzker, HB 1312 would immediately apply these new standards across Illinois.

NGOFEEN: Harpinder.
Mine's Ngofeen HARPINDER: Ngofeen.
You I, everybody listening to this podcast, who pays their taxes, it costs us upwards of $200 a day per person in ICE detention.
When you are in ice detention, you are not provided the same rights as you are if you're in criminal detention.","HOST: You’re listening to Rights and Wrongs, from Human Rights Watch. I’m Ngofeen Mtutubwele. This week, what it’s like to be detained by ICE: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

NGOFEEN: What do you want people to know about your experience in ICE detention?

HARPINDER: I don't think people are aware of what people go through inside. We were legally in the U.S.

HOST: In this episode, you’re going to hear from two people–someone detained on the inside, and from a lawyer on the outside. We recorded this interview in September 2025. The story takes place in Florida.

NGOFEEN: Okay, there we go. Um, how do I pronounce your name correctly, just for starters.

HARPINDER: I was gonna ask you the same thing. Mine's Harpinder.

NGOFEEN: Harpinder. Okay. Mine's Ngofeen

HARPINDER: Ngofeen.

HOST: In 2016 Harpinder, his wife and their two children immigrated from the U.K. to the U.S. They entered on an E-2 investor visa. They bought a business, a barbecue franchise, that also did catering…

HARPINDER: We were really good at catering, I have to say, as a family. You know, we were rockstar status with easy cater. 4.9 out of five over thousands of caterings. You know, we, we did really good - we took a personal interest in it, and, um, as all business owners do, there's nothing special there. But, you know, we went that extra bit.

Host: But Covid hit, and they fell behind on their state taxes. Harpinder met with tax authorities and worked out a payment plan. By 2025 he was on an EB-5 visa, which allows for permanent residency - green card. But his tax problems complicated things, and he had to meet regularly with an immigration officer. At first he did those meetings in person. Then the probation officer was giving the vibe of, ‘I see you’re paying, don’t worry about it, you don’t have to come in, you can do it remotely’. And then he gets a phone call from the officer. Hey, we actually need you to come in. So, on this particular day, February 11th, 2025, he comes in in person…

Harpinder: I mean, I remember feeling I was… You know the family was just recover from the flu and I was kind of a little bit under the weather.

So normally his office is, as you go through the main door, it's on the right hand side. And then today he said to me, ‘we're gonna go this way.’

‘Okay, we're going this way’. And next thing you know, I saw these two guys, and, uh, he’s already got the handcuffs out. Hey, we're from ICE. You've overstayed. You've overstayed since 2018. And he, and he slapped the cuffs on me.

And I'm going, ‘we haven't overstayed you've made a mistake. Here we are, we're in status’.

NGOFEEN: I've never been hand cuffed. Um, but like, what does that feel like?

HARPINDER: It's horrible. It's absolutely, you know, you just feel this sense that you're falling, that there's nothing to catch you. Now there's like, there's no, um, you know, they're not listening anymore and you are not you anymore.

[The sound of a car driving on the interstate]]

HOST: The ICE officers put Harpinder in a van and start driving. While he’s in the car, his mind is spinning. Thinking of all the logistical things he’s supposed to get done. There’s that catering gig he’s supposed to show up for today - how will the rest of the family take care of that. Then there’s the tax bill obviously hanging over the whole family, over him -- legally dealt with, payment plan that he’s following and all -- but still a huge responsibility. … And then, there’s his kids…

[sound of phone vibrating]

His son starts calling.

HARPINDER: So he, he kind of, he kind of sensed something was up that I've been there too long. And then when he started to freak out was when we were driving down the 408 into Central Orlando and he, and he's calling, he's calling and calling and calling and like they, they just kept hanging up the phone and I said to them, I said, ‘You know, if you just tell him what's happened to me, he can start contacting lawyers and, and he'll stop calling you. But at the moment he's gonna carry on until he gets an answer’. It’s just, any son would, especially my one. He, he's, he's, he's, he's crazy. Not, you know, crazy, crazy. But he is, he is lovable, crazy.

HOST: He arrives at some place he doesn’t know. And, once there…

HARPINDER: We're waiting. And they put me in a cell with, with other people. And some of those people were frantic, crying, some were like laughing, and some of the people were in tears. You know, one had left his son who was like four or five years old. He is really close to his son.

NGOFEEN: So you are already handcuffed at your wrists…

HAPRINDER: Yep.

NGOFEEN: ... and then someone comes, tells you, ‘stand up’ or you stay seated?

HARPINDER: No, they, they, they get you out of the cells and, and, and they take everyone out in a and they line up, um, and they bring these boxes out with these chains and cuffs in them. Heavy boxes. And as they're pulling one out after the other, it makes that little rasping sound or the chains tangled up. The way those chains rasp and the way they, the way they behave when they, when they're shackling you up.

You just feel so, I mean, I, I used to hear that chain and it used to just get to me, it used to like, you know, get me to a point where I'm never gonna come out of this. I, you know, I couldn't, you know, it's really hard to express. Just that noise. It's unbelievable, you know?

They shackle your ankles, so one leg at a time and they, they kind of like nudge you in the back. They don't even verbalize - make you lift your leg up, you know, like you would do like, like a horseshoe thing. They put one cuff on you and then that's got a chain on it onto the next leg. Then they would do one around your waist, make you turn around, um, and then they'd uncuff you from the front.

NGOFEEN: Like a belt almost? Same chain, like…

HAPRINDER: Yeah. Yeah. So, and then that was it. And then they chucked us on a bus. Um, you know, you can't even make the step up to the bus with the, with the chains around your ankles and, you know, you just shuffling along trying to find a seat, and it's just this bus of desperation, you know, like just people that just lost all hope.

HOST: Seven, eight hour bus ride.

NGOFEEN: What to you is like an example of a day in detention that sort of like typifies what you experienced there?

HARPINDER: So if, if you'd allow me, there's three different types of experience, um, that I

NGOFEEN: Please.

HARPINDER: So the first one was when we were in processing. So after waiting outside that facility for three hours in the bus. We were brought in, um, and we were put in a room, uh, which is just pure concrete.

Um, there's like a little ridge that people could sit on, but it's all concrete.

And there's, uh, an open toilet at the back. Um, and it says on there maximum capacity: 25. And we were at that time, 42 of us. And then a few hours later, we were about 50 or so in that one room. And that stayed for four days like that. So you're trying to find somewhere to sit, trying to find somewhere to lie down.

And people were taking turns, you know, people sleeping around where people were doing, you know, toilet and things.

NGOFEEN: How big, like the room, like how would you describe it?

HAPRINDER: Smaller than like, you know, like a master bedroom, smaller than a master bedroom. like literally if, if we had everyone sitting down, everyone else was standing up. So you could probably have about 20, 22 people sitting down and everyone else that was lying out on the floor.

Um, so, you know, you were kind of head one way, head the other way, head one way, head the other way when, when we were trying to lie down to get some kind of sleep. I was using my shoes for a pillow.

One toilet, um, no water. They said there's water in the tap on the toilet, but, who's gonna, you know, and like, you know, we were asking for fresh water. It just depended on the guard.

And, you know, you'd get fed, um, just tiny portions. Um, no medication. I had no medication. They even, I didn't, even, when they brought me into that facility, they took my asthma inhaler from me as well. So I had no, no, you know, I take insulin, I, you know, all this kind of stuff and heart meds and pancreas meds, and none of those were made available for me and I had no idea of, you know, what time or day it was.

So disorientated. And every two hours they'd come in and do a count, you know, like it's, we're not spawning in here. We're not, you know, there, there's no, it's, it's concrete everywhere. You've got the keys to the door, you put us in here, why do you need to count us every two hours?

NGOFEEN: And so you're eating in the, in the cell, not like out in like a cafeteria type …

HARPINDER: Yeah. In the cell. Most of the time it was in polystyrene, um, containers.

HOST: That’s those white take-out containers…

Harpinder: And we're still in shackles and like they didn't unshackle you from the waist or anything, so you, you're having to kind of stooped down and eat like a dog out of a bowl, um, out this polystar container. So you kind of like, just all, you know, hunkered up together and you're eating like a bowl. Some people bent over as much as they can and try to, you know. It's like we're not human anymore.

HOST: From the processing center, which was called Krome, in Miami, they move to the next, second type of facility.

HARPINDER: They call it the camp. So you come outta processing and they put you in a camp, a big warehouse designed for 48, uh, detainees. There was like a hundred of us in there. So temporary beds were put out and, you know, you share four showers, four toilets, between a hundred people.

You couldn't get sunlight. You know, there, there were, we were all quarantined. People were suffering everywhere. Three people, actually, one person died of tuberculosis from our unit, and two were isolated. We had no hand wash. We had no, you know, hand sanitizer. Um, you know, you couldn't take, um, you couldn't go to the toilet in privacy. Someone sitting right next to you, um, showering open in front of everyone.

The guards are - they don't, they don't care about you. They don't care. And from what I gather, those guys were getting paid 50 bucks an hour. Uh, one of them was bragging that he was making $16,000 that month. And it's like on the heads of us, you know, and, and it, you know, by treading on us. And it's just, you know, if I, if I was earning that kind of money in a job, I'd be smiling all day at work. I really would. But they, they just treated us even worse.

HOST: Let’s take a moment and talk about the treatment of the guards.

Harpinder: I remember there, there was two officers in particular, I dunno if I can mention them by name, um, but they would come in at five in the morning, um, for a six o'clock shift just because they enjoyed riling everyone up banging on the doors, shouting, screaming.

NGOFEEN: What do you mean when you say they're, they're banging on walls and yelling?

HARPINDER: No, they, they, they would, they would kick doors. They would, they would go by, you know, hit the doors with whatever they had. Um, like, you know, just screaming at five o'clock in the morning. Um…

NGOFEEN: What are they screaming?

HARPINDER: just, you know, like, uh, ‘wah’. You know, like that. ‘Come on’. And it's just like, like I, I dunno what they got out of it. I just don't get it. Um, you know, ‘woo-hoo’.

And then they, they picked on, um, two guys, two black guys in particular. Um, one just, one guy, like sweetest guy. He is from Uganda. Kakanyero. They, they, they picked on him like you wouldn't believe. Particularly with Kakanyero, they would be like, ‘Hey, fat boy, fat boy.’ You know, like just shouting at him, top of their voices. Then it, then that went to kaka boy, and, you know, and, and that means poop in, in, in Latin language.

And, and he's saying, look, you know, I, you guys might not, whatever, but he goes, I come from Uganda. I come from a strong lineage of, you know, and man, I'm proud of my name, man, and don't, don't ridicule my name. You know, I'm, I'm here not as a prisoner. I'm not here as a, we're detainees. We, we are not being here for punishment.

We are here until you guys process us and they just wouldn't stop on him. They really wouldn't.

To the point where, you know, Kakanyero went on suicide watch after they, they kept on harassing him.

Um, and, and, you know, this is, this isn't a job, that's not part of your job to put people down and, then one day like this, this guy that's just so, such a stone wall of ignorance and hate, uh, comes up to me one day and says that, ‘Hey, so you are the barbecue guy’. I'm like, ‘dude, what, what is this? You know, what do you want from me? Leave me alone. I'm, I'm the barbecue guy? I'm the guy that also asked you to open the door so I could take a breath of oxygen’. But in, in, in the, so, you know, I, I, when, when he said that to me about the restaurant thing, I said, ‘dude, me and you are not gonna connect. I'm not having any kind of conversation with you. You are what you are and, and you are gonna be that.

I'll be out of here one day. I'll be, whether it's here or whether it's back in the uk, I'll be alive. I'll be with my family at one point and, and we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll come back from this, but you are gonna be here for the rest of your life’. I said to him, and I said, ‘that's all you're worthy of. Don't talk to me, just leave me alone.’

HOST: Third type of facility: Federal.

HARPINDER: The worst, the worst experience of all was in the federal prison in Miami. That was just, it takes everything and it destroys you. There was a group of us that had been together since February and when we walked into that federal prison that night, soon as we walked in and we're going deeper and deeper into the prison and then they opened the, the, that floor up. And this, you know, it's typical, it's just like a movie scene where people are like banging on the doors, looking at you through the little glass on their cells. Um, and I just remember looking at my friend Marlon, and I was thinking, we are in big trouble here. This is not. None of this was [00:21:30] for us, but this is, this is a level that we, I don't think I'm gonna be able to handle this. This is like, wow.

And then, you know, a lot, some of us were lucky enough to get bunked together, but I had to go bunk with a person that I'd never seen before who did have an edge to him and… to, to be in it and, and to just, you know, that utter despair every night when they, to lock that door knowing that you just can't go out. We had a little tiny slit window that looked out over the Southern, um, cityscape of Miami, which is quite beautiful.

Um, but, you know, I remember sleeping the other way. I just didn't wanna look at it. I, you know, I thought ‘America's kind of turned, its back on me. I don't wanna look at it. I don't wanna look how beautiful it is. I don't wanna’. It was just burning me, you know? And I, I, and I remember one conversation we had with my friend, the Cuban guy who we were bunking with, and he said, you know, he said, ‘this is America, Harry, we're gonna be fine’.

And after a while I said, you know, what America is this toilet that's not working. That's America. Outside's not for me or us. We're in here because that isn't for us. This is our reality: toilet that doesn't work. We've got a guard screaming in your face telling you, I just don't give a f.

We had no AC for the last two weeks in that cell. Um, you know, banging on the door, just asking for, just let me, you know, I, I'd lie down and try and gasp air through the bottom of the door, just 'cause the outside had AC but we, you know, we didn't have any in our cell. Just desperate acts like that and then when, when you, when you relay that to another human being, whose safekeeping is in their hands, whether they, whether they like it or not, whether they, that's their, in their job description that they want to be a part of or not. The true facts are that if something happens to me, it's their responsibility, but they just don't care.

You know, when I talk about the guards, 99% of them were, the way I describe them. There were some nuggets. There were some good people in there, very few. But there were,. Mr. Wilson, I remember from Krome. I said to him, look, is there any chance I can get, you know, my inhaler? Because, uh, and he says, you shouldn't be without your inhaler. And I could see he was visually upset by, you know, the, you know, the way we were being treated. And he took me to, you know, see if we could go and find it.

And so like there was just bin after bin after bin of these, you know, anonymous brown envelopes full of people's, you know, valuables, you know, mementos, money, you know, all this kind of stuff. But no, no process. There's no, there's no order to anything. Everything's just haphazard and random. And I just saw this one thing that had a trail of towns that this bin had gone through.

And I thought, it's gotta be this one dug around in there and I found my inhaler and I put it in my pocket and, and you know, that first breath of beautiful air, you know.

HOST: Harpinder was deported … back to the UK. He hasn’t seen his family since. When we come back, the outside, from an attorney.

AD BREAK.

HOST: Now that we’ve heard what Harpinder’s detention was like on the inside, let's talk to a lawyer on the outside to make sense of all this. This is woman from my home state of Tenneesee, a straight talker who basically summarized how this whole system works.

KATIE: My name is Katie Blankenship. I am an immigration attorney and I am the director of Sanctuary of the South.

We have clients in detention centers throughout the country, as well as a large number of non detained clients.

Alright, there are three ways that ICE can have a detention center, three ways ICE can run it. They're on site. It's ICE agents all day, but they do contract out to private prison. They fully contract out with a private prison group.

Or three they enter into, and this is like a whole alphabet soup, what's called an IGSA and Intergovernmental services agreement with a small municipality. Think Baker County, Florida.

You I, everybody listening to this podcast, who pays their taxes, it costs us upwards of $200 a day per person in ICE detention.

Where does that money go? That money goes to the private prison companies. Most of the time ICE opens these centers that are in contract with the local municipalities in very remote places of the country. Now, the remoteness of these facilities is very intentional.

There's very little legal services in these areas. There's very little access to any sort of resources or immigrants rights, protection, or know your rights, which are any of the things that you would get where there's a larger municipality or even contact to legal services. When you are in ice detention, you are not provided the same rights as you are if you're in criminal detention. So they can pick me up, they can take me to any detention in the country. They don't have to tell me where I'm going. They don't have to tell me where I am when I get there. They don't have to tell me how to contact legal services. I have had families come through and literally be separated intentionally, sent to the most remote different parts of the country just to be cruel. Just to separate people and have them in as remote place as possible.

What also happens, and that's critical, is that in these smaller communities, they are poor communities, right? A tiny, tiny little place does not have a lot of money.

NGOFEEN: The, the, you're talking about like the remote communities…

KATIE: The rural communities. So let's talk about like Baker County, Florida's a perfect example. Baker County is in a little town called McClinney, Florida.

There's hardly anything there except for a courthouse that has the mural of the KKK.

McClenney, Florida's a tiny town in north Florida. There is nothing around there except Jacksonville's about an hour away. Tallahassee's about an hour and a half away.

There is not a single immigration lawyer in a 60 mile radius. None. Doesn't exist. Baker County, because it is such a small town, because it has such a small budget on its own, courted ICE, created this facility and propped up their entire county budget on the ice detention center. And this happens in the, and this is the same thing that's happened in Stewart Georgia, in Glades County, Florida, throughout Louisiana, like this is, this happens over and over again.

So this county is now completely reliant on these funds, right? They have now created a budget that is completely reliant upon these funds. And what is their impetus when considering what provisions to provide, how to run this facility, and then consider what happens when they make those decisions and have no immigration training, have no understanding of the immigration system, do not understand the difference between civil and punitive detention.

Right, they don't know any of that, but they do know that if they don't have that money, the county collapses. Even with the ICE money, they're hardly making through. We would see, you know, city commissioner meetings from Glades County, Baker County over and over again. You'd see they weren't even in the black when they were getting the ICE money.

So what are they gonna do? They're gonna provide as ittle as possible. They're gonna give the worst medical care, they're gonna give the cheapest, they're going to, they're gonna be understaffed. It's over and over and over again. So if you couple the idea that it is more profitable to be cruel with an an anti-immigrant animus, that has been so profusely and disgustingly successful, that has mostly come from the right wing Republican party, but every, every political leader in this country is guilty of it. Obama deported the most people under. You know, there is, every one of our leaders has disappointed us on this issue. And to not understand that we are destroying lives and frankly, destroying the fabric of this country for money and profit and power at the expense of human beings.

NGOFEEN: So, um, in theory, assume ICE detains someone legally, what would be the legal way to treat them? like what are the standards and where, like where do those standards come from?

KATIE: Well, they start and they really start and end with the United States Constitution. So immigrants on anybody on American soil has constitutional rights. End of story. That's not debatable. There's been a lot of stuff in the news under this administration. They don't have due process. They don't have anything. BS, no completely, completely false, flag on the field.

So they have different. Right. Their, their rights are differently considered, right? There are some rights that yes, American citizens have that immigrants might not have, but basic Bill of Rights: right to due process, right to free speech, right, to be free of cruel and unusual punishment. All applies, a hundred percent.

So this is where our, this is where the law really stops and starts for the standards available to immigrants and detention. They also have a right to counsel. There's a big difference, right? If I'm arrested for a DUI, I have a right to a counsel that the government pays for. If ICE comes to my door and takes me into detention, I have a right to an attorney that I pay for.

That's the biggest difference. There's no free counsel, but a person in detention has a right to call their lawyer, they have a right to confidential conversations. Those rights can be violated and federal lawsuits can be filed.

We have, we have one right now ongoing. Besides that, the National Detention Standards set out specific, just, they're exactly what they say in the name. They are the standards by which people are supposed to be de detained. when in ice custody. And those detention standards are violated all day every day.

The national detention standards set forth all sorts of critical things like what happens if somebody has a serious mental health issue? What happens if somebody has suicidal ideation? What happens if the guards use force? They're supposed to be reports about, they're supposed to actually get permission. It's supposed to be reviewed. There's supposed to be documents in the file. I can't tell you the last time I've seen something like that in somebody's file.

Right, there are specific criteria set forth also in the national de detention standards of medical emergencies. You know, I have a client, Maksym Chernyak, who died at Krome. After being there for two weeks, less than two weeks, begging for medical attention, and they failed to do anything they're supposed to do by their own standards and just frankly, their oaths of do no harm.

You know, we've, we're filing a federal lawsuit for wrongful death on his behalf because he would be alive today if not for ICE. We firmly believe that. So there are frameworks in place, but when we are operating in a lawless system, what good are these laws?

HOST: Katie says that her client of Katie’s was a Ukrainian refugee who entered the country in 2024 and was granted humanitarian parole. After having seizures and not receiving medical care for about four hours, he was found braindead. He was 44 years old.

Katie: There is a feeling right now, It is almost impossible, impossible to win. At all. To get any sort of relief. Asylum cases are being denied at a rate I haven't seen before, on cases I would typically win, mostly because judges are too scared not to go with the Trump playbook because he just fired 125 of them.

There is no more bond. Bond is basically over.

NGOFEEN: Tell us what bond is.

I think this foray into the weeds is really important because, but like everything with this situation, it is in the weeds that the humanity gets choked out

KATIE: Well, typically for the entire time there's been ice detention centers, there are two ways that people typically get out while their case is pending.

Alright. One is bond and one is parole bond. It's very simple. Bond is an immigration court, only an immigration judge can grant bond.

Parole is ICE only ICE can grant parole.

Bond is over. Um, forever. I mean,

for years a ton of people have been eligible for bond. A bond is a serious thing. I have to file a bond motion. I have to put forth proof of this person's value to the community.

Show that they are not a risk of flight. They have no history of violence. Show why they're important to their community, present multiple levels of support from their community, a sponsor in the community. Money so that they can be tracked way. I mean, it's like, this is not a simple thing. The judge has done a, a considerate like evaluation of a case. Bond is over.

And then to double the pain, the Trump administration in DC has sent clear instructions to ICE that there basically is no more parole. They have said in memos it will no longer, uh, it must now be done on a case by case basis.

'Cause typically there's just sort, there's all sorts of people that, sure, you're gonna process them for their case, they're gonna show up, but there's no need to keep 'em in detention.

HOST: So what does that legalese mean practically?

So every humanitarian parole request I submit. I've done for people with stage four kidney failure, we've submitted parole requests for pregnant women, we have submitted parole requests for mothers who, just, uh, recently had, gave birth.

I mean, it is … there's just no words for it.

NGOFEEN: What should people know? Like, and I really do mean like these are conversations that I am having. I'm sure you are having, but I'm actually having with, I had like, I've had three conversations this week with friends where we're like, okay, if something happens to somebody, what should we do? Do we like go out there and be like, ‘you can't do this because X, Y, Z.’

Do we need to like have a rights card? Like what are some of the types of things that. People can do if they're in the state where they can, you know,

KATIE: Okay, so let's take it in a couple phases. Let's say you're at, um,you are witnessing an ICE raid or an ICE action. You should maintain a safe distance, but record and narrate. Record and narrate. Record and narrate. If the officers approach you and say, are you recording? You say, yes, it's my right to do so.

If they tell you that it's illegal or not to do that, you should stop. 'cause you, you will get arrested and they will destroy the footage you've gotten most likely. So try your best. To, um, adhere to the instructions of the law enforcement officers, but while documenting as much as you can, and then you need a plan for getting that out there, having local contacts in the press is a great idea.

Most every co, most every community in the country has some sort of immigration coalition going on right now. You should find them.

but you're gonna wanna document and yes, know your rights cards actually is a brilliant idea. There's a huge amount of false information that goes out to our immigrant communities, and the biggest thing to take away is if ICE doesn't have a judicial warrant.

Goodbye. It is [00:39:30] illegal Judicial warrant or no. Or it, no, they can't come into your house. They can't do any of that.

And um, also just Google this judicial warrant versus ICE warrant. It will give you an image, it will show you, there'll be multiple resources on this. Print them out. Right. If you are, if you or your loved ones are at risk of ICE, print these out and have a copy that you can see it, your children can see it.

Your friends and family can see it. So [00:40:00] you know the difference. Because if ICE knocks on your door and they have an ICE warrant and not a signed and dated judicial warrant, they don't come in. They don't have to. You do not have to let them in.

Here’s what i would quite literally do. I would say and do nothing. I would not open the door. I would not talk to them. I would draw my shades. I would not say anything. I don’t care what they yelled at my door. I’m not gonna answer, I’m not gonna give them any reason to think I’m home.

If for some reason you make any sort of verbal contact with them, you should ask them to show them your judicial, show you their judicial warrant, not in person. They have to slide it under the door. They have to walk up to your window and hold it up to you, and you're looking for three things. You're looking for the [00:40:30] judge's signature, that it's properly dated and it clearly identifies you and your home.

That they're actually in the right place with the right person doing, and those warrants will often be limited in scope. So you wanna read it, you this is, this is your, these are your rights a hundred percent. To fully understand this, if they only present an ICE warrant or a judicial warrant that's not signed, goodbye.

You don't say anything else. You say, I know my rights. I'm not opening. Close the blinds, turn the lights out [00:41:00] and wait for them to leave. Um, and ideally you have legal counsel that you can call and say, here's what's happening.

HOST: One last practical thought from Katie.

If you are truly invested in helping your immigrant communities, then you need to invest in your community. So there should be some sort of plan within community groups that are supporting each other.

Let's say [00:41:30] there's an ICE raid at the Home Depot down the street in your town. There should be a phone. That people are calling. There should be some sort of alert system that's going out to folks and there should be some sort of emergency plan for when folks get detained that there is help to get them legal counsel at least immediately just to triage and even 'cause the minute you have a lawyer, even in this completely effed up system, the difference of a lawyer is huge, right?

It's a huge deal. They know that somebody's eyes are on this person. They cannot just be disappeared. So have a have. Go ahead and identify your legal resources. Know who to call. Have contacts for the family to call.

If I was doing deep community planning right now, I'd be talking about, okay, there's a raid in our town. Where is the safe place people can go? We've identified the Rotary Club, the church and the school. There are private signs in each of these rooms where people can go. That's what's gonna happen for the [00:42:30] people who are detained.

We are getting in touch with their families. We're making sure the children can get to school safely and we're getting them in touch with legal counsel. Katie Blankenship, thank you so much for your time.

The Department of Homeland Security made at least eight arrests across Evanston and Skokie on Friday, including both protesting citizens and those it said lacked legal status, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to The Daily.

Before the holiday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker wrote a letter to top Trump administration officials asking them to pause federal immigration enforcement throughout Halloween weekend in and around homes, schools, parks and other community gathering spaces.

“Illinois children should not be robbed of their innocence,” Pritzker wrote. “Let them enjoy a time-honored American tradition safely and peacefully. Please let children be children for one holiday, free from intimidation and fear.”

At a Thursday news conference in Indiana, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called the request “shameful” and said the department was not willing to halt operations.

On Friday morning, a block from Chute Middle School, there was a collision involving a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle. Agents pulled the driver out and detained them as several community members gathered at the scene, multiple sources confirmed to The Daily.

The DHS confirmed the arrest of three U.S. citizens and said pepper spray was deployed against an individual who resisted arrest. Federal immigration agents also punched people and sat on someone’s neck, Mayor Daniel Biss said.

A couple hours later, community members gathered at Chute to call for community resilience in response to the heightened enforcement.

“Our message for ICE is simple: Get the hell out of Evanston,” Biss said at the news conference.

Local Democrats echoed his message.

In an emailed statement to The Daily, Ald. Juan Geracaris (9th), who represents the ward where the Friday collision occurred, called for basic human rights and due process. He described those taken by immigration enforcement agents as “husbands and fathers that are trying to provide for their families.”

“I’m still trying to process the violence ICE agents brought to our city and struggle to find words to describe how horrific it is,” Geracaris wrote. “They brought violence to people observing and bearing witness to their illegal actions. They are not here to make our city safe. It’s been heartening to see people stand up for their neighbors and come to their defense. Our community is strong and brave and we have each other’s backs.”

In a news release, Illinois’ 9th Congressional District candidate Bushra Amiwala said immigration raids were “tearing apart families” and “motivated by hate” rather than public safety.

“The video captured of this latest incident confirms that ICE is — totally unprovoked — using unnecessary force against civilians,” Amiwala said regarding footage of the confrontation following the Friday crash. “They’re intentionally hurting people. There is no due process here. ICE is giving the middle finger to our Constitution.”

On Saturday, DHS Assistant Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reposted a circulating video on X showing a Border Patrol agent pinning a person on the ground and striking them multiple times.

In the post, McLaughlin claimed the agent’s actions were motivated by self-defense after the person grabbed the agent’s genitals. At the start of the video attached to the post, one of the person’s hands is clearly behind their back and the other is out of view.

Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who, Biss confirmed, was present throughout operations in Evanston on Friday, reposted McLaughlin’s X post.

“Assaults on our agents have legal consequences. DON’T DO IT,” the post read.

On Friday, Biss addressed both Bovino and Noem directly on X, telling them to leave the city.

U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston), who also spoke at the Friday news conference, condemned immigration enforcement agencies’ Friday operations.

“On Halloween, a day meant for family, community, and celebration, Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have instead chosen to terrorize our community,” Schakowsky said in the statement. “This cruelty is not only unacceptable, but it is inhumane and criminal.”

In an email sent to Evanston community members Friday, the city reiterated its position as a “Welcoming City” and directed residents to resources on its website. Real-time updates surrounding immigration enforcement activity in Evanston can be found on The Daily’s live blog.

Stephanie Suaine and her mom, Dora Suaine, who is Rodriguez’s sister, arrived at the hospital but weren’t allowed to see him.
The men later called hospital security to escort Rodriguez’s family to the waiting room, Stephanie Suaine said.
Dora Suaine caught a glimpse of her brother bleeding from the head with a bandage wrapped around the wound, she said.
“I just want to see how he’s doing,” Dora Suaine said in Spanish with her daughter translating.","A man is hospitalized in suburban Melrose Park after he was detained by federal immigration agents Sunday morning, his family says.

Ricardo Rodriguez, 53, was riding his bike to get groceries when federal agents stopped him, according to Rodriguez’s niece Stephanie Suaine. Videos circulating on social media show an agent placing Rodriguez in a chokehold and striking his head at least once before two more agents approach and appear to put Rodriguez in handcuffs.

“My uncle got up and they punched him ... they’re still choking him,” Stephanie Suaine said as she watched the video. “It makes me mad because he’s old already, they shouldn’t be treating old people like that.”

Rodriguez, who immigrated to California from Mexico in the 1980s as a teenager and later moved to Melrose Park, began complaining of chest pains, prompting agents to bring him to the emergency room at Gottlieb Memorial Hospital on Sunday morning, Stephanie Suaine said.

I’m “just wanting to see my uncle, see if he’s doing fine, the way they were hitting him and everything,” she said.

Stephanie Suaine and her mom, Dora Suaine, who is Rodriguez’s sister, arrived at the hospital but weren’t allowed to see him. They asked two masked men in plainclothes standing outside his hospital room if they could go in, and they were told no. Stephanie Suaine asked the men if they were with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the men said they were with “an agency,” but they didn’t elaborate, she said.

In a video showing part of the interaction shared with the Sun-Times, Stephanie Suaine asks if the men are the ones who detained and hit Rodriguez, and the men say no.

The men later called hospital security to escort Rodriguez’s family to the waiting room, Stephanie Suaine said.

“They haven’t told us nothing, they don’t let us see him,” she said. “They didn’t tell us nothing at all.”

The men said they didn’t know what would happen to Rodriguez when he was released from the hospital, and his family fears he’ll be deported or held in federal custody. When Dora Suaine, a U.S. citizen, asked if she could go with her brother if he was deported, the men asked to see her proof of citizenship, she said.

Dora Suaine caught a glimpse of her brother bleeding from the head with a bandage wrapped around the wound, she said.

“I just want to see how he’s doing,” Dora Suaine said in Spanish with her daughter translating. “I feel bad because he’s my brother and I love him. We are very connected.”

About 8 p.m. Sunday, Rodriguez’s family didn’t have much information on his condition or prognosis. They thought he may be in the intensive care unit, but they weren’t sure.

In the hospital waiting room Sunday night, Dora Suaine wept quietly, hugging people who came to see how her brother was doing. At one point, a security guard asked a visitor what he was doing there and told him he couldn’t see Rodriguez because there was a “restriction” on his room.

“You can’t go up there, you can’t even try to go up there,” the security guard said before warning the family and friends that visiting hours were over and they would have to leave soon. The Suaines left shortly after 8:30 p.m. and planned to come back in the morning.

A supporter suggested the security guard ask ICE to leave and the security guard responded, “We can’t do that.”

A Loyola Medicine spokesperson confirmed ICE officers brought a detainee to the hospital.

“Loyola Medicine treats federal agencies like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) the same way we treat all law enforcement personnel. If they need to enter our facilities, they coordinate with our Security team,” spokesperson Allison Peters said in a statement. “This morning, ICE personnel came to Gottlieb Memorial Hospital to accompany a patient in their custody who required medical care. We cannot share any information on patients.”

Rodriguez grew up in Zacatecas, Mexico, and works in construction building houses. He doesn’t have a criminal record, Stephanie Suaine said. She described her uncle as “funny” and “calm.”

“When I tell you he would give you his shirt off his back, he would,” she said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/892ce93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/786x449+0+94/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F88%2F2fc1725746c0adead4e0f5f8fd44%2Fscreenshot-2025-11-02-at-9-03-49-pm.png,N,,2025-11-03 02:57:34.513104

He added, in an interview with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell on “60 Minutes,” that his mass deportation agenda, one of his central campaign promises in 2024, has been “held back by the judges, by the liberal judges, that were put in by [former President Joe] Biden and by [former President Barack] Obama.”

His remarks come even as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been photographed and taped at times using violent methods to detain immigrants across the country.

In the ""60 Minutes"" interview, which was taped on Friday, the president addressed concerns that his deportation agenda was arresting landscapers, farmers and other laborers, not just the criminals and ""the worst of the worst"" undocumented immigrants that he promised to deport during his presidential campaign.

""Look, I need farmers and I need landscapers more than anybody,"" Trump told O'Donnell.

Asked whether he intends to deport people who do not have a criminal record, the president told O'Donnell, ""We have to start off with a policy, and the policy has to be, you came into the country illegally, you're going to go out.""

The Pittsburgh ""ICE Out of Home Depot"" demonstration took place at the East Liberty outpost of the construction-supplies retail chain. Home Depot stores and parking lots around the country have recently been the site of ICE actions under the Trump administration, in which day laborers and others have been detained and deported.

“We’re out here today because it’s absolutely despicable that businesses like Home Depot and others will allow ICE to take our neighbors and co-workers, our community members,” said Hannah Fitzgerald, an organizer of the event created by a coalition of locally based groups.

Organizers said they were unaware of any ICE actions at this particular Home Depot, and that it was chosen for its central location in the region.

Home Depot has repeatedly denied that it cooperates with ICE. In response to a message seeking comment on Sunday’s demonstrations, a company spokesperson issued the following statement: “We aren’t notified that immigration enforcement activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations. We’re required to follow all federal and local rules and regulations in every market where we operate.

The East Liberty rally was part of the national Disappeared in America campaign, which planned similar events this weekend in other U.S. cities.

The Pittsburgh demonstration began at the corner of North Highland Avenue and Station Street, with passing motorists frequently honking in support.

It concluded with protesters marching to the doors of the Home Depot, where organizers said they planned to present the store’s manager with a list of demands for the company. These included that Home Depot condemn ICE raids; close its stores and parking lots to ICE agents; and protect customers and workers from ICE actions.

Marchers were denied entry to the store, however, by two uniformed and armed state constables. Instead, marchers chanted, “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here” for a few minutes and left the parking lot when Pittsburgh police arrived.

There were no arrests.

The rally fell at the end of a week during which the Department of Homeland Security announced it was on pace to deport a record 600,000 people in one year by the end of January.

Speakers at the rally included Guillermo Perez, secretary-treasurer of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement.

Perez was among the speakers who cited the death of Carlos Roberto Montoya, a native of Guatemala who in August was struck by a vehicle and died while fleeing an ICE raid at a Home Depot in Monrovia, Calif. (The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, told CNN that it was not pursuing Montoya.)

Perez noted the critical role immigrants, including undocumented workers, play in the economy, especially in construction.

“Home Depot’s in a really strong position to make a statement about the value of immigrant workers, particularly in the construction industry,” he said. “So we're here today to say, ‘Ya basta!’ No more, Home Depot. Stop allowing ICE to operate in your stores and your parking lots, and stop terrorizing your own customer base.”

Perez and other speakers maintained that Home Depot, like any property owner, is free to deny access to its stores and parking lots to law-enforcement agents who do not have warrants.

Along with LCLAA, organizers of the protest included the Pittsburgh Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance, Casa San Jose, Pittsburgh Socialist Alternative, Never Again Action, and the Anti-Trump Action Committee.

Other speakers included Pastor Ross Carmichael, of St. Andrew Lutheran Church; Christie Kliewer, of ATAC; and Symone Saul of Never Again Action, whose website calls it “a Jewish-led mobilization against the persecution, detention, and deportation of immigrants in the United States.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c4a8fe3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+92/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F23%2Fdf%2Ff806a918411689ce40a5cec8ce69%2Fice-protest-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:57:47.762037

Aurinia’s lawsuit alleges that Dr. Tidmarsh sent messages threatening revenge against Mr. Tang, after he had asked Dr. Tidmarsh to resign from three companies.","Judge Immergut said she needed more time to fully consider the “voluminous” evidence and three days of testimony she heard in a trial last week after state and city officials sued to fight the federal government’s deployment plans in Oregon. She said would issue a final ruling on the case by 5 p.m. local time on Friday.

But in explaining the injunction, Judge Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the federal government had not proven its case based on what she had reviewed so far. She also said that the evidence so far indicated that the proposed deployment violated the Constitution’s 10th Amendment, which says that powers the Constitution does not give to the federal government belong to the states.

At the trial, Justice Department lawyers argued that the president’s planned use of federalized soldiers was justified for two of three reasons allowed under a statute known as Title 10. The protests in Oregon represented a rebellion or a planned rebellion against the federal government, and the demonstrations have prevented ICE officers from doing their jobs without additional help, government lawyers argued.

The other reason the president is allowed to use Guard troops under federal law would be to defend against a foreign invasion.

But Judge Immergut wrote on Sunday that federal lawyers had not proven either a rebellion was imminent or that ICE could not enforce the law using existing resources.

The mostly peaceful protests in Portland have occurred for nearly five months. They have occasionally turned violent, with demonstrators blocking cars from entering or exiting the ICE facility, and federal officers responding by firing pepper balls and tear gas.

President Trump announced on social media in late September that he planned to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to respond to the demonstrations against federal immigration policy.

Oregon and Portland sued to stop the deployment, and Judge Immergut issued a temporary restraining order blocking the use of Oregon soldiers on Oct. 4. Later that day, the Department of Defense sent 200 California National Guard soldiers to Oregon and told members of the Texas National Guard to prepare to work in Oregon. Judge Immergut then issued a second temporary restraining order blocking the use of any National Guard soldiers in Oregon. The second temporary restraining order was scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time on Sunday.

Lawyers for Oregon, Portland and California argued that the federal government already had the resources to handle crowd control at the ICE building, and that federal agents had used force indiscriminately. The lawyers used staffing records and nightly reports from the Portland Police Bureau and the federal government to portray the protests as largely under control before the president’s announcement inflamed and expanded the crowds.

And they framed the debate as one that cuts to the core of constitutional principles.

“This is, I think, one of the most significant infringements on state sovereignty in Oregon’s history and now California’s history,” Scott Kennedy, a senior assistant attorney general for Oregon, told the judge in his closing argument.

Justice Department lawyers offered a different account of events in Portland. They argued that federal workers at the ICE building had been too distracted by the protests to meet the administration’s demand: to double the daily immigration arrests made in the region.

Witnesses from the Federal Protective Service and ICE testified that federal officers had often been outnumbered by protesters, who had threatened and doxxed them, and thrown rocks and shot off fireworks at them. They also said that federal officers had received no help from the Portland Police Bureau.

“We’ve seen agitators target the Portland ICE building with violence, intimidation and threats over and over,” Eric Hamilton, a Justice Department lawyer, said in his closing argument on Friday. “This is a rebellion against immigration authority.”

Judge Immergut disagreed with that argument in her preliminary injunction. She noted that the deputy regional director of the Federal Protective Service, the federal law enforcement agency responsible for guarding government buildings, had testified that neither he nor his boss had been consulted about the proposed Guard deployment or had asked for the soldiers.

If the judge’s final ruling upholds her Sunday decision, federal lawyers are expected to appeal the verdict. A similar case involving the president’s deployment of Texas National Guard soldiers to Illinois is before the U.S. Supreme Court.

Mr. Trump was pressed on the potential escalation against Venezuela as the U.S. military continues an offensive that has included 15 strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific in the past month. A broad range of legal specialists on the use of lethal force have said that the strikes were illegal extrajudicial killings.

The Trump administration has described the strikes as a counterdrug mission, but U.S. officials privately concede they are part of a larger drive to oust Mr. Maduro. Mr. Trump previously confirmed that he had authorized the C.I.A. to conduct covert action in Venezuela.

“On Venezuela in particular, are Maduro’s days as president numbered?” asked the CBS journalist Norah O’Donnell.

“I would say yeah,” Mr. Trump responded. “I think so, yeah.”

When asked about the possibility of land strikes on Venezuela, he declined to answer. “I don’t talk to a reporter about whether or not I’m going to strike,” he said.

During the wide-ranging interview, recorded at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, Mr. Trump was also pressed on his deportation campaign, the government shutdown and his recent demand for the U.S. military to resume conducting nuclear tests.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump’s energy secretary, Chris Wright, appeared to clarify that the testing would not involve actual nuclear explosions, but rather that “the other parts of a nuclear weapon” would be tested to ensure they are working properly.

But the president did not make that distinction in the CBS interview.

“Are you saying that after more than 30 years, the United States is going to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing?” Ms. O’Donnell asked Mr. Trump.

“I’m saying that we’re going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes,” Mr. Trump said.

Detonation tests are not common anymore. The only nation that has been regularly doing nuclear tests in the past quarter-century is North Korea, and its last explosive test was in September 2017.

China has rapidly expanded its nuclear stockpile and deployed missiles in new silos, but it has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996. Russia has not conducted a confirmed test since 1990, although it recently declared that it had tested two exotic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons.

Mr. Trump claimed without evidence on Friday that those nations were testing nuclear weapons covertly. “Russia’s testing nuclear weapons, and China’s testing them, too,” he said. “You just don’t know about it.”

Days after meeting China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, in South Korea, Mr. Trump said in the CBS interview that he would not allow Nvidia to sell its most advanced chips to China. “We will let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced,” Mr. Trump said.

Jensen Huang, the head of the Silicon Valley chip-making company, said on Friday that he was eager for it to resume selling advanced semiconductors in China. Trump had suggested before his meeting with Mr. Xi last week that the two leaders would discuss Nvidia’s most powerful A.I. semiconductors.

Mr. Trump also discussed his domestic agenda, including his deportation campaign.

Mr. Trump said he did not believe the tactics of U.S. immigration authorities had gone too far, even when he was pressed about videos showing deportation officers and federal agents shoving a young mother, deploying tear gas in Chicago and smashing car windows. “I think they haven’t gone far enough because we’ve been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges,” Mr. Trump said. “You have to get the people out.”

When asked about his deportation campaign targeting people with noncriminal records, Mr. Trump said, “I need landscapers, and I need farmers more than anybody, OK?”

But he added that his administration’s efforts on immigration must start with a policy. “And the policy has to be, ‘You came into the country illegally. You’re going to go out,’” he said.

Mr. Trump did not provide clarity on his administration’s strategy for helping Republicans and Democrats in Congress reach a deal to end the government shutdown. He said he would not be “extorted by the Democrats,” who have said they will not provide Republicans with the votes to reopen the government until they include additional money for health care programs.

Mr. Trump also repeated his call for Republicans to end the Senate filibuster, something Senate G.O.P. leaders have rejected. Many Republicans worry that any further weakening of the Senate rule that requires most legislation to win 60 votes would backfire if Democrats regained control.

“Republicans have to get tougher,” Mr. Trump said during his interview.

Mr. Trump was also asked to clarify whether he would try to run for a third term, which is barred by the Constitution. The president said he doesn’t think about such a move, even though he has publicly mused about the prospect. He said the Republican Party had an “unbelievable bench” of presidential contenders, noting he liked both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Mr. Trump also offered praise for Bari Weiss, the newly appointed editor in chief of CBS News, calling her “a great new leader,” though he added, “I don’t know her.”

CBS’s owner, Paramount, said in July that it had agreed to pay President Trump $16 million to settle his lawsuit against “60 Minutes.” The Trump administration then approved Paramount’s sale to Skydance. Skydance later appointed Ms. Weiss, who also runs The Free Press, a website she founded that is often critical of liberals and the mainstream media.

Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.

“I think the tests we’re talking about right now are systems tests,” Mr. Wright said in an interview on the Fox News show “The Sunday Briefing.” “These are not nuclear explosions. These are what we call noncritical explosions.”

Mr. Wright said Americans in places like Nevada, where the United States has a nuclear test site bigger than the state of Rhode Island, should not expect to see a mushroom cloud.

On Wednesday — minutes before he met with President Xi Jinping of China in South Korea — Mr. Trump said in a social media post that he was ordering the Pentagon to step up testing of nuclear weapons.

“We’ve halted it years — many years — ago,” Mr. Trump later told reporters, referring to the last U.S. explosive test of a nuclear weapon in 1992. “But with others doing testing, I think it is appropriate that we do also.”

Mr. Trump claimed without evidence, in a “60 Minutes” interview on Friday that aired Sunday, that those nations were testing nuclear weapons covertly. “Russia’s testing nuclear weapons, and China’s testing them, too,” he said. “You just don’t know about it.”

Asked again on Friday whether the United States would “start detonating nuclear weapons for testing” after more than 30 years without doing so, the president responded: “I’m saying that we’re going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do.”

But detonation tests are not common anymore: The only nation that has been regularly doing nuclear tests in the past quarter-century is North Korea, and its last explosive test was in September 2017.

China has rapidly expanded its nuclear stockpile and deploying missiles in new silos but it has not tested a nuclear weapon since 1996. Russia has not conducted a confirmed test since 1990, although it did recently declare that it had tested two exotic delivery vehicles for nuclear weapons: a nuclear-powered cruise missile and an undersea torpedo, called Poseidon, that could cross the Pacific to the West Coast of the United States. (The United States itself routinely tests unarmed missiles.)

In 1993, the Clinton administration announced plans for a treaty in which nations would forgo nuclear blasts. Although the 1996 test-ban treaty never officially went into force, it created a global norm of not testing the destructive bombs.

Washington is currently undergoing an effort to replace its warheads with updated versions. The overall cost of the sprawling program over three decades is estimated at $1.7 trillion.

Mr. Wright on Sunday said that testing was underway on the new nuclear systems.

“And again, these will be nonnuclear explosions,” Mr. Wright said. “These are just developing sophisticated systems so that our replacement nuclear weapons are even better than the ones they were before.”

Dr. Tidmarsh, a drug industry veteran who joined the agency in July, said in an interview Sunday that he believed the new program injected politics into the drug review program, superseding decisions based on science.

Late on Sunday, a pharmaceutical company lodged explosive claims against Dr. Tidmarsh in a lawsuit claiming that the regulator had acted vengefully against its board chairman and investor, Kevin C. Tang, who had previously asked Dr. Tidmarsh to leave several companies. The lawsuit claimed that Dr. Tidmarsh attempted to extort him. Dr. Tidmarsh denied the allegations, saying he had no interest in revenge against Mr. Tang, a San Diego investor.

At the F.D.A., Dr. Tidmarsh was placed on leave Friday pending the outcome of an investigation by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services that is looking into some of the same claims.

On Sunday, he offered his resignation, and Emily Hilliard, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said it had been accepted. Ms. Hilliard said on Sunday that the administrative leave had been imposed earlier “after the office of the general counsel and the office of the inspector general were notified of serious concerns about his personal conduct.”

But Dr. Tidmarsh continued to maintain on Sunday evening that he was still on administrative leave.

Dr. Tidmarsh said he was told Friday that the leave was related to a complaint lodged by Mr. Tang, a major investor in Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, a Canada-based company that makes the drug voclosporin, a treatment for a type of lupus affecting the kidneys. The complaint involved a post that Dr. Tidmarsh wrote on LinkedIn in September that criticized the drug as having little benefit and “significant toxicity.” Aurinia defended the drug’s benefits over its risks in response to the post.

The company’s stock dropped about 20 percent, but has gone up since then.

Aurinia’s lawsuit alleges that Dr. Tidmarsh sent messages threatening revenge against Mr. Tang, after he had asked Dr. Tidmarsh to resign from three companies.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Maryland, was first reported by STAT News. The F.D.A. was not named in the lawsuit.

Dr. Tidmarsh said in an interview that he had not thought of Mr. Tang since starting at the F.D.A. “He was irrelevant to me,” Dr. Tidmarsh said.

One of the companies, American Laboratories, made ingredients for a thyroid product that Dr. Tidmarsh “pushed F.D.A. to effectively remove” from the market within weeks of starting work at the agency, according to the lawsuit. It also claimed that Dr. Tidmarsh, through his lawyer, attempted to solicit a bribe by asking Mr. Tang to continue payments from American Laboratories to a company associated with him until 2044.

Dr. Tidmarsh said that he did not “send anything to” Mr. Tang and that he “gave up everything” to go into government. He said he pursued the thyroid medications because they were marketed without F.D.A. approval, something that the agency had scrutinized for years.

The lawsuit claims that the LinkedIn post cost Aurinia about $350 million in value.

The tumult at the F.D.A. is just the latest in a series of ousters, firings and high-profile disagreements under the nation’s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Several of his top staff members were pushed out or resigned in recent months.

The most high-profile so far was the firing of Susan Monarez after she had served only a month as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She told senators that she was fired after she had refused to sign off on recommendations from Mr. Kennedy’s vaccine advisory panel, which he has filled mainly with vaccine skeptics.

In the interview, Dr. Tidmarsh also described a “toxic environment” that he attributed to Dr. Vinay Prasad, the F.D.A.’s chief medical and scientific officer, who also oversees vaccines and gene therapies. Dr. Prasad had frustrated scientists within the agency for overriding some staff decisions on drugs and also on Covid vaccines. He was ousted from the agency in July but brought back.

Dr. Tidmarsh said his concerns stemmed from the F.D.A.’s announcement in mid-October that it would approve a slate of drugs in record time. The program was meant to convey quick authorizations to drugs that reflected the administration’s priorities, which included addressing unmet medical needs or supporting lower pricing. Candidates for the program included a drug meant to help people break their addiction to vaping and another meant to help children who were born deaf.

“The effort was going to basically change the entire paradigm of the legal underpinnings of drug approvals that have for decades supported the actions on the safety and effectiveness of drugs,” Dr. Tidmarsh said. “There was insufficient legal support for what they wanted to do, and so I didn’t agree.”

Dr. Tidmarsh said the issue came to a head last week when officials met to make the agency’s first official decision under the new program. The process would typically take months, with extensive review and formal opportunities for debate among agency scientists. But at the meeting, officials were expected to decide in a day.

“I didn’t know the legal underpinnings so all I did is say, ‘I don’t think this is a decision,’” he said. “‘I see this as practice run,’ because no one had given anything about the process, the legality of it.”

In September, Mr. al-Shara visited New York and became the first Syrian president to address the United Nations General Assembly in 58 years.

The U.S. special envoy for Syria, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., said on Saturday that Mr. al-Shara will be in Washington to “hopefully” sign an agreement to join 88 other countries in the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State. He was speaking at the Manama Dialogue, an annual security conference in the Gulf nation of Bahrain.

Speaking at the same conference, Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shaibani of Syria confirmed on Sunday that Mr. al-Shara would visit the U.S. capital in November and said the reconstruction of Syria would be among the topics to be discussed, according to Syrian state media.

Mr. al-Shara led the rebel offensive almost a year ago that ended more than five decades of dictatorship under the Assad family. A former Islamist rebel once linked to Al Qaeda, Mr. al-Shara has since redefined himself as a statesman and expanded Syria’s foreign relations in a bid to help his country rebuild after a brutal and destructive civil war that lasted nearly 14 years.

In December, the U.S. government dropped the $10 million bounty on Mr. al-Shara’s head. In July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the revocation of the terrorist designation for Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the rebel group that Mr. al-Shara led before he overthrew President Bashar al-Assad.

Mr. al-Shara founded the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda before breaking ties with the terrorist group in 2016.

Now he and his government appear set to join the U.S. and dozens of other countries in fighting another terrorist group.

Though the Islamic State lost its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019, it continues to have a presence in the country, especially in the vast desert region in the center, and carries out occasional attacks.

As Syria goes through a rocky political and security transition after the war, there are fears that the terrorist group could re-emerge and try to free thousands of its former fighters who are held in Syrian prisons guarded by U.S.-backed Syrian Kurdish forces.

Ismaeel Naar and Zolan Kanno-Youngs contributed reporting.

A spokeswoman for the White House budget office did not respond to a request for comment. Late Friday, President Trump predicted that food stamp aid would “unfortunately be delayed” in November, and warned that the payments would not begin until he received “appropriate legal direction” from the court.

The legal saga began earlier that day, when Judge McConnell told the Trump administration that it must tap an existing, emergency reserve in order to pay for SNAP starting Saturday, when its typical budget was set to run out. Absent that intervention, the administration’s actions would have cut off assistance to the roughly one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program.

But the thrust of the judge’s order raised logistical questions. The SNAP reserve totals about $5 billion, less than the roughly $8 billion needed to pay full SNAP benefits each month. Even if they used the money, officials at the Agriculture Department had also warned they might have to slash benefits by more than half, and that it could take weeks to pay them out because of technical constraints.

So, on Saturday, Judge McConnell clarified his ruling, citing the president’s request, and offered the Trump administration a timeline.

He said the government “must make” a partial payment by Wednesday, but he also encouraged federal officials to explore the use of a second source of money that might allow it to pay SNAP benefits more quickly and in full. He pointed specifically to a pot of funds at the Agriculture Department largely composed of tariff revenue, which the government had used earlier in the shutdown to preserve another federal nutrition program.

The judge said that the two funding sources, combined, could reduce any delay in delivering SNAP benefits, and alleviate “irreparable harm” facing families — and he ordered the administration to make those full payments by Monday.

It remained unclear how the Trump administration might proceed — or, potentially, if it might appeal the ruling. The Justice Department appeared to signal the mere possibility in a late Friday filing with the court, hinting that it was “considering whether any emergency relief is required.”

She lives in Lafayette and is the daughter of an immigrant.

My friend has been taken by ICE.

For a while, we didn’t know where Ali was, and those hours and days of wondering were excruciating. Now, despite knowing his location, fear remains. Will he be given due process? Can he be transferred back to Colorado to be nearer to his family and community? How will his family survive with their main earner detained indefinitely in another state?

In recent years, the community at Christ the Servant Lutheran Church in Louisville has been living out Jesus’ directive to “welcome the stranger.” As director of faith formation, I have organized volunteers into an Immigrant Host Team to welcome and accompany new residents in Louisville and the surrounding areas. We support families with start-up costs and navigating school, healthcare and employment opportunities.

In exchange, we have tasted flavors from around the world, learned new phrases in new languages, and heard the harrowing stories of persecution that have led each family to seek asylum in the United States. We spend about a year closely intertwined with each family until they are settled in our community. Once they are independent, we remain friends, but begin to welcome another family.

We started working with Ali, his wife and four young children in June 2024 and have watched them move from being newcomers to being thriving community members. In the last six months, the family has been fully independent. Until I got a call from Ali’s wife on Oct. 10.

Ali had been detained by ICE without cause in the course of his job as a long-haul trucker. He stopped at a weigh station in northern Indiana where, after his inspection, ICE was waiting for him. He has been moved among multiple detention centers and is now in a jail in Missouri that is doubling as a detention center.

As the daughter of an immigrant, I have always been attentive to the challenges that face newcomers in our community. The process for entering the U.S. is a complex road with many obstacles in a setting with constantly changing rules. Added to this are the general challenges of adapting to a new culture, acquiring a new language, and finding pathways to work that match the rich skills immigrants bring (but whose experience and education are often not recognized). And now, what had been an arduous but knowable pathway has turned into chaos.

Ali and his family have become a part of our community. This month, their kids have headed to pumpkin patches; they are working hard in school, biking and playing at the park in the crisp autumn air. Their mom is working at a local store and shopping for groceries next to you and me. And their dad, until Oct. 10, had been providing for his family as a trucker.

Ali and his family entered the U.S. lawfully and have applied for asylum. Ali worked with the U.S. military in Afghanistan and fled for his life after the Taliban took over; being deported back means certain death. He has had his work permit for over a year. All his paperwork in order. We are led to believe that these things matter and provide protection, but that is not the current reality. Ali and so many others are having their rights trampled, and they are suffering dearly for it.

As I share Ali’s story with others, I am often met with bewilderment. People have trouble understanding the overreach of ICE. They are shocked to learn that many people being detained are lawfully present in the United States and have “followed all the rules.”

Furthermore, permanent residents and citizens are being arrested and detained without cause. I urge my neighbors and other Coloradans to pay attention. We must be vigilant, and we must act together against these attacks on our fellow humans. We cannot remain silent in the face of such oppression.

Welcome the stranger — and those strangers become friends. I fear for my friend, Ali. I fear for his family. Even more, I fear for my country. A country of immigrants whose promise of hope and justice is being trampled.",https://i0.wp.com/boulderreportinglab.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BRL_OpinionGraphic1.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-03 02:57:52.069786

Trump also insisted to Norah O’Donnell that China wouldn’t invade Taiwan while he is president. He said the subject didn’t come up during his meeting on Oct. 30 with China’s President Xi Jinping.

And Trump repeated his call to end the Senate filibuster, which allows a minority of lawmakers to block contentious legislation, as a way to end the government shutdown.

Here is what to know about the interview conducted Oct. 31 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida:

Trump: ICE agents 'haven't gone far enough'

O’Donnell asked Trump whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had gone too far in tackling a mother, using tear gas in a Chicago neighborhood, and smashing car windows.

""No. I think they haven't gone far enough because we've been held back by the judges, by the liberal judges that were put in by Biden and by Obama,"" Trump said.

O’Donnell followed up by asking if Trump was OK with those tactics.

""Yeah, because you have to get the people out,"" Trump said. ""You have to look at the people. Many of them are murderers. Many of them are people that were thrown out of their countries because they were, you know, criminals.""

Trump on China talks: 'I can't give away my secrets'

O’Donnell said it could become a flashpoint in international relations if China encroaches on Taiwan’s shipping lanes, its airspace, or cyberspace. She asked what Trump would do in response.

Trump refused to detail what would happen but said Xi understands the consequences would be significant. Trump said his counterpart’s understanding is so clear that the subject didn’t come up during their trade meeting in South Korea.

""I can't give away my secrets,"" Trump said. ""I don't want to be one of these guys that tells you exactly what's gonna happen if something happens.""

Trump insisted Xi knows what would happen if China attacked Taiwan.

""He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences,"" Trump said.

Trump says Maduro's days in Venezuela are numbered

The Trump administration has sunk several Venezuelan boats allegedly carrying drugs and has deployed an aircraft carrier to the region.

Trump refused to say whether he sought to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s regime, but said his days are numbered.

""I would say yeah. I think so, yeah,"" Trump said.

Trump refused to speak about reports that he is considering an attack on Venezuelan land, in addition to the strikes on ships.

""I’m not saying it’s true or untrue,"" Trump said. ""But I would be inclined to say that I would do that because I don’t talk to a reporter about whether or not I’m going to strike.""

Trump urges end to filibuster

The government shutdown will become the longest in history on Nov. 5. Trump said he expects Democrats to eventually agree to reopen the government.

Democrats have held out to restore Medicaid funding cuts during the summer and extend subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.

""They’ve become crazed lunatics,"" Trump said. ""I’m not going to do it by extortion.""

Trump urged Republicans to abolish the Senate filibuster to avoid the parliamentary block on ending the shutdown without cooperation from Democrats. But GOP leaders are opposed to ending the filibuster for legislation.

""The Republicans have to get tougher,"" Trump said.

Trump denies retribution in prosecuting critics

The Justice Department secured indictments against Trump critics, including former national security adviser John Bolton, former FBI Director James Comey, and New York Attorney General Letitia James. But Trump denied directing the Justice Department to prosecute his critics.

""No, not in any way, shape or form,"" Trump said.

Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel pursued his opponents on their own.

""The honest people that we have go after them automatically,"" Trump said. ""I think I’ve been very mild-mannered.""

Trump calls Mamdani 'communist' in New York mayor's race

New York City’s mayoral race ends Nov. 4. Trump has lobbied against the election of Zohran Mamdani, the front-runner in the polls against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Trump cut off O’Donnell as she described Mamdani as a ""democratic socialist,"" the banner he campaigns under, by arguing that he is a ""communist.""

""Communist, not socialist,"" Trump said. ""He's far worse than a socialist.""

Trump said the federal government wouldn't support New York if Mamdani were mayor. ""It’s going to be hard for me as president to give money to New York,"" he added.

O’Donnell asked what he thought of people comparing Mamdani to Trump as a charismatic leader breaking old rules.

“You don’t protect us by taking away our civil liberties – that’s not protecting anybody,” the unnamed protester said after a clash with police and state troopers.","BROADVIEW — Gatherings Saturday outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in suburban Broadview began with a somber Mass for All Saints Day, continued with a lively costumed protest and ended with clashes with local and state police.

During the morning Mass, a delegation of local faith leaders including longtime activist Sister JoAnn Persch once again requested to enter the Broadview processing facility to make contact with detainees and allow them to take Communion if desired.

The request was made to Illinois State troopers, Sarah Rand, a spokesperson for the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, said Saturday. The troopers called federal immigration agents within the facility, who denied the coalition’s request for access.

This was the second such attempt the group has made, the first made at an Oct. 11 event, as they try to reopen the facility to the kind of pastoral care that Persch and others delivered to immigrants in the processing center for nearly two decades.

Persch and the late Sister Pat Murphy, both of Sisters of Mercy, were allowed to access the facility to pray over and with immigrants and their families. Circumstances changed in the last few years, however, and now no one is allowed to enter, raising concerns about conditions within the processing center, the Rev. Juan Vargas, associate pastor of Our Lady of the Rosary Parish said after the Mass Saturday morning.

The coalition emailed and hand-delivered letters requesting to enter the facility on Oct. 24 and Oct. 30, according to a news release. Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson also sent a letter on the group’s behalf and neither party has received a response.

“Unfortunately we were denied entrance,” Vargas said. “But we still had our moment of spiritual communion with everyone who’s been detained and who showed up in this moment.”

Members of the coalition have been told they need to follow “protocols” to enter and are being denied access for their own safety, Vargas said. In a statement to the Sun-Times, a Homeland Security spokesperson said Secretary Kristi Noem must personally approve entry into the facility.

“But what about the safety of the people who are there? They’re human as well,” he said. “We’re trying to follow all the procedures, sending emails, but then there’s no letting us know well what is the next step?”

The coalition estimated more than 2,000 people attended the 10 a.m. Mass and about 800 people were given the Eucharist, according to Vargas and Rand. The “people’s Mass,” as some called it, began with liturgical dancers and then attendees gathered around a few tents set up in one of the designated “free speech zones” erected by local and state police on either side of the street leading into the facility at 1930 Beach St.

Speakers from Catholic and other Christian churches from across the area read liturgies and gave a blessing for those affected by federal immigration raids conducted under President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz across the Chicago area.

During the Mass, an attendee was arrested by local police after they refused to leave the roadway when asked, said an attendee named Reina, who declined to share her last name for safety reasons.

Around noon, the crowd shifted as Mass attendees began to leave and people in Halloween costumes took their place for a noon costume party and protest. Later-arriving attendees were younger and more lively, but many signs held by the two groups carried the same sentiment: “ICE out of Chicago.”

State Police Use Pepper Balls On Protesters

Many people came dressed up in costumes or inflatable suits for Halloween including a Jeff Koons-inspired balloon animal, a unicorn, skeletons and a Chicago-style hot dog.

Both groups also set up ofrendas for Día de Los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead, encouraging people to bring photos of loved ones who died while crossing the border or during clashes with ICE, Vargas said. Photos of Silverio Villegas Gonzalez, a Franklin Park man who was shot and killed by immigration agents after trying to flee arrest in September, were added to the displays.

Protesters began what they called a “Jericho walk,” walking back and forth in a continuous line across the crosswalk set up by local authorities to allow protesters to cross between the two sides of the protest zone. The action is meant to recall the Biblical story in which the Israelites conquered Jericho when the city’s walls fell after the Israelites marched around the city for six days, organizer Rachel Cohen said.

This summer and into the fall, protesters have sought to block the road leading into the Beach Street facility as a way to stop or disrupt immigration agents’ ability to take people in and out of the processing center. The walk was an extension of that disruption, which has morphed as local authorities seek to contain protesters to the sidewalk and grass area on either side of the road, Cohen said.

“Every ICE agent that leaves this facility is going out into our community to disappear our neighbors off the streets,” Cohen said. “The point of protests like this one is to interrupt, it’s not just to express displeasure. It is to slow down the operations of this facility because every minute that we do that is a minute well spent protecting our neighbors.”

As protesters were walking, state troopers and Sheriff’s officers wearing face shields and holding batons approached protesters, with a few giving orders to move. The crowd parted on one side and some protesters lined up along the curb on one side of the street, linking arms. Police pushed the group back, arrested one person and later detained another person farther back in the crowd.

Cook County Sheriff’s police said in a statement Saturday that four people had been arrested during the protests, with all of them being charged with disorderly conduct. A spokesperson for Illinois State Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the use of pepper balls.

Protesters later gathered in the roadway behind plywood signs carrying messages like “free our neighbors.” After marching down the street, they were met with a line of state troopers. The confrontation culminated in police firing pepper bullets at protesters at the front of the crowd and ramming into the protesters holding wooden signs.

At least one officer began firing pepper balls at the feet and legs of protesters at the front of the line. During this exchange, a reporter with Block Club Chicago, identified with a helmet reading “PRESS,” was hit in the thigh with a pepper ball.

Police took the signs away from those holding them and the standoff continued for over four hours. By about 6 p.m., police ordered protesters to leave or risk being arrested, subjected to chemical agents or “other reasonable force.” After a few clashes with police, protesters left the facility.

The Republican president had sued the Paramount-owned organisation over a 2024 pre-election interview with his Democratic opponent, former vice-president Kamala Harris.

Asked by interviewer Norah O’Donnell if raids conducted by his Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have “gone too far,” the 79-year-old president replied: “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”

He claimed “liberal judges” appointed by Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden had “held back” immigration operations, according to the interview extract posted on X.

Ms O’Donnell noted documented instances of ICE agents tackling suspected immigrants, deploying tear gas in neighbourhoods and smashing open car windows.

“You’re okay with those tactics?“ she asked.

“Yeah, because you have to get the people out,” Mr Trump said.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by:

Filed for public inspection on October 31, the DHS proposal lays out changes that would require the submission of biometrics—including fingerprints, facial images, iris scans, voiceprints, and even DNA—by anyone filing or associated with an immigration benefit request, without regard to age.

The rule also expands biometric collection authority following an alien’s arrest, codifies new reuse requirements, and authorizes broader DNA testing, use, and storage to verify family relationships and prevent fraud.

Under the new standards, even U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents petitioning for family members would be required to submit biometrics, adding criminal history checks as part of compliance with child protection and marriage broker laws.

The administration argues that enhanced biometrics will strengthen identity management, national security vetting, and fraud prevention. Notably, age restrictions for biometric collection are being removed—meaning children, including infants encountered at the border, may be fingerprinted and scanned to prevent trafficking and accurately establish family claims.

The regulation also authorizes the use of DNA samples and partial DNA profiles to confirm biological relationships and eligibility for certain immigration benefits, with data retained for use in law enforcement databases.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

The proposal paves the way for “continuous vetting,” where migrants, even long-term residents, can be rechecked and required to submit biometrics throughout their stay in the United States until citizenship is obtained.

In practice, this means that immigration benefit holders, sponsors, and family members face recurring screening and surveillance that could last years, with the government empowered to share biometric data with federal, state, local, and some foreign government agencies under expanded authority.

Immigrants and their advocates are likely to raise alarm over privacy risks, the scale of government tracking, and the lack of clear limits on how new technologies—such as facial recognition and automated voice analysis—are deployed and stored.

For U.S. citizens, the rule brings new scrutiny to family sponsorships, with background checks now standard for Americans seeking to reunite with relatives. For survivors of domestic violence, VAWA self-petitioners will see streamlined requirements with biometrics now used in place of police clearances and affidavits for good moral character.

The rule is designed to limit identity theft, improve system reliability, and give Homeland Security new tools to flag threats or criminal activity missed under the current name-based checks. DHS estimates that as many as two million people a year already submit biometrics but, under the new rule, that figure will grow as new groups are added—including U.S. citizen petitioners, children, and more forms previously exempt.

As written, the rule signals a historic expansion of biometric surveillance in American immigration law, with far-reaching consequences for privacy and government oversight.

MIGRANT tensions in TT reached their peak last week.

Following the Ministry of Homeland Security’s October 27 statement, many Venezuelans – both documented and undocumented – began giving up their rental homes, selling what little they own, and leaving their jobs in factories, farms and workshops.

On October 27, the Ministry of Homeland Security issued a statement ordering the detention and deportation of all irregular migrants.

The Ministry said: “All illegal immigrants detained are to remain at the Immigration Detention Centre until their repatriation. No further Orders of Supervision shall be issued.”

According to the Ministry, the measure aims to “control illegal migration.” But for the Venezuelan community, it represents fear, desperation, and an urge to flee.

The fear of being detained or deported has sparked a new wave of internal displacement and plans to leave for other countries in the region.

The Hispanic Cultural Centre La Casita in Arima, on October 29 called on the government and society to remain calm and avoid what it described as a “migrant hunt.” Its director Andreina Briceño Ventura-Brown warned that the situation is spreading fear and misinformation.

“The misinformation is misleading the population and undermines the protection process. Many people who hold UNHCR cards may still face harassment or persecution because they are considered irregular under local laws. That is one of our biggest concerns,” she said.

On Facebook and WhatsApp, posts by Venezuelans selling appliances, motorbikes, or furniture are multiplying as they prepare to leave. Mariana Lopez, a 34-year-old Venezuelan living in Arima, said she didn’t wait any longer:

“I sold my things and gave up the rent. I don’t want to be caught and sent back. I’ll go to Brazil even if I have to start from zero.”

Jesus Andrade, a mechanic in San Fernando, also made a tough choice:

“I quit the workshop. I’d rather leave before they detain me. The hardest part is leaving my job, but fear weighs more.”

Others denounced the government’s lack of compassion.

Rosa Medina, a mother of two, said: “They talk about human rights, but they show no humanity to us. Many of us have been here for years working and paying taxes.”

Eduardo Ramirez was more direct: “This government wants Venezuela’s gas but treats Venezuelans here like garbage. It’s double standards.”

Even those with legal status say they are suffering unfair situations. One Venezuelan family with work permits shared: “We have all our papers in order, but our children can’t go to school. There are spaces in classrooms, but the process for student visas is stuck at the Ministry of Homeland Security. They don’t respond, and meanwhile, the kids lose classes.”

This exodus goes beyond TT. Many Venezuelans are making plans to move to countries like Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia, where governments have begun opening their doors to Venezuelan workers and small investors.

Some are already preparing documents, while others are selling their belongings to afford tickets or ground transportation to those destinations.

Shipping agencies operating between Trinidad and Venezuela confirmed an increase in ticket requests.

In Venezuela, travel agencies also reported a rise in bookings to South America, especially to Manaus and Boa Vista (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), and Georgetown (Guyana). Some travellers are inquiring about mixed routes that combine flights with ground travel.

Speaking to Newsday on October 31 from Venezuela, travel agent Luis Arias explained that in recent weeks, “requests from Venezuelans in TT wanting to travel from Venezuela to Brazil, Argentina and Guyana have tripled.”

He added, “Entire families are buying one-way tickets. Many say they prefer to leave now before it’s too late.”

Before closing its operations in TT in August 2025, the latest reports from the UNHCR indicated that the country hosted 3,282 recognised refugees, 31,260 asylum seekers, and 5,517 people in need of international protection. In total, more than 40,000 people were under some form of humanitarian assistance or protection – the vast majority of them Venezuelans.

Social media remains filled with posts such as:

“Selling fridge and bed – leaving for Brazil.”

“Urgent sale of motorcycle, need to leave before November.”

For many, TT was once a land of opportunity. Today, Venezuelans are selling their belongings, giving up their rentals, and abandoning their jobs – running from fear.",https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/23198098.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:16:42.236854

This shooting follows the recent comments by Stephen Miller that federal immigration agents have federal immunity in the conduct of their duties.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot and seriously injured Carlos Jimenez, a 24-year-old U.S. citizen, on Thursday. He was released from the West Valley Detention Center on bond yesterday. His court hearing had been scheduled for 2 p.m. yesterday, but was pushed until around 6:30 p.m. He is being charged with “assault on a peace officer,” according to a criminal complaint reviewed by Jimenez’s attorneys Cynthia Santiago of Abogada Santiago and Robert Simon of The Justice Team Law Firm.

Jimenez saw federal immigration agents surrounding a car on Vineyard Avenue on his way to work Thursday morning, according to his attorneys,

“He was just telling these officers ‘hey, there’s a bunch of kids about to be across the street, cuz they’re going to school,’” said Simon.

The school bus stop was in the area where the agents were blocking the road, according to Santiago.

“He was just thinking about the kids and the community that he knows,” said Santiago.

Kids were going to start to head to the area where federal agents were parked in about 10 minutes, explained Santiago.

“Once he drove away from that area because of the threats–the gun being pulled on him–he heard the gun shot,” said Santiago.

Jimenez was shot with at least one bullet through the back passenger window, and it pierced through his right shoulder and lodged itself in his flesh.

This all happens within a matter of a minute or two. He had just said goodbye to his partner–this happened down the street from his home.

“That’s when he reached his home to tell his family he had been shot. His wife took him to the hospital. He was not fleeing. He called 911 on his way to the hospital to seek assistance, and then when they reached the hospital, they were detained by Ontario PD,” said Santiago.

“You have people there that are there in his community, that come out guns blazing, with pepper spray, ask questions second,” said Simon.

What would be helpful in this case, and other similar to it would be livestreaming body camera videos that could be released immediately, similar to what a Chicago judge ordered federal immigration agents to wear, said Simon.

L.A. TACO initially reported at least three individuals were detained by federal immigration agents that day.

According to court documents reviewed by Jimenez’s lawyers, there were three people in the vehicle stopped by federal immigration agents— in the documents they reviewed, federal agents did not have a warrant for those individuals and there was no probable cause listed. It appears they were detained in a roving patrol.

Jimenez' lawyers are asking for the public’s assistance in identifying those three individuals as they are witnesses to the shooting of Jimenez.

Jimenez’ partner was temporarily detained when they arrived at the hospital by the Ontario Police Department until the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Homeland Security Investigation agents arrived, according to Jimenez' attorneys.

FBI and HSI agents questioned Jimenez partner for a few hours, she was never arrested, her phone was confiscated during this time, according to Santiago.

Initially, Jimenez was taken to the Kaiser hospital and then to a trauma center.

He was discharged from the hospital into federal custody with a bullet still in his shoulder and was detained in the West Valley Detention Center.

“They handcuffed him while he still had a bullet in his shoulder,” said Simon, “Was bleeding, needed medical attention, detained him, and essentially just had ibuprofen rather than the medication that he needed. That is his current state that he got released from the detention center.”

He was given an upper bunk bed in the detention facility. His bunk mate saw he was injured and graciously traded bunks with him so he could have the lower bunk.

His lawyers have been imploring the Attorney General's Office and the Ontario Police Department to investigate the case and release body camera footage due to the fact that Jimenez still has “evidence” related to the case in his shoulder.

In a statement to L.A. TACO Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that Jimenez sustained a “non-life-threatening gunshot wound.”

Jimenez is the most recent example of an individual shot at by federal immigration agents and is the third instance this year in the state of California. Ricardo Parias was shot by federal immigration agents in Los Angeles on October 21. Francisco Longoria was shot at by federal immigration agents in San Bernardino in August. A man was shot by ICE agents in Phoenix on October 29.

This shooting follows the recent comments by Stephen Miller that federal immigration agents have federal immunity in the conduct of their duties.

“As the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement to L.A. TACO.

The statement further noted, “Jimenez, a U.S. citizen, sustained a non-life-threatening gunshot wound when the officer was forced to defend himself from the suspect's vehicle. Jimenez was discharged from Riverside Community Hospital following treatment for the injury. He was subsequently arrested by HSI and booked into the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. He is being held pending charges of assaulting, resisting, or impeding.”

Jimenez works at a food pantry feeding the unhoused and other vulnerable communities. He is a father to three children. His family is requesting funds to help with his medical bills at their GoFundMe page. The first GoFundMe account was removed by GoFundMe due to a report that they were soliciting funds for a crime.

Jimenez’ next court date is scheduled for November 25.",https://lede-admin.lataco.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2025/11/DSC02751.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 18:01:55.111786

The head of the Department of Justice’s powerful Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), T. Elliot Gaiser, told select Senate and House lawmakers on Thursday that the US strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean did not trigger the law’s requirements because they don’t meet the definition of hostilities and did not require a declaration of war from Congress, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Gaiser was drawing on a classified legal opinion produced by his office that justifies the strikes by equating drug cartels with terrorists and focuses on the death caused by the drugs brought to American shores, the sources said. Gaiser emphasized the fact that the US military wasn’t being attacked in response to the strikes as part his argument that America was not at war, the sources said.

The US military has carried out at least 15 known strikes against alleged drug-smuggling vessels since early September, killing a total of 64 people, according to a CNN tally. The latest known strike occurred on Saturday in the Caribbean, killing three people.

Some legal experts have said the military strikes could violate US and international law. Democratic lawmakers, and at least one Republican, have criticized the administration for not being more forthcoming with details on the legal justification for the strikes.

The Trump administration notified Congress in early September that it had struck an alleged drug vessel. Under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, that notification started a 60-day clock, after which the administration has to either cease the use of military force, get an extension on the clock or a war authorization from Congress, according to legal scholars.

But Gaiser told lawmakers that the administration does not need to seek an extension of that 60-day clock, which expires on Monday, because the law doesn’t apply in this case, the sources said.

CNN first reported on the existence of the OLC opinion, which legal experts said appears to justify an open-ended war against a secret list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers. The opinion appears designed to give the president power to designate drug traffickers as enemy combatants and have them summarily killed without legal review, those experts said. Historically, those involved in drug trafficking were considered criminals with due process rights, with the Coast Guard interdicting drug-trafficking vessels and arresting smugglers.

CNN has requested comment from the White House and the Justice Department on the congressional briefings and the administration’s legal rationale for striking the alleged drug boats.

The Washington Post first reported on Gaiser’s briefing of lawmakers.

President Donald Trump issued an executive order on the first day of his second term designating certain drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, giving the US military greater leeway to attack them. The administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats have coincided with increased pressure on the regime of Venezuelan autocrat Nicolás Maduro.

In 1994, Arizona was one of several states that sued the federal government over costs related to illegal immigration. The state argued the federal government failed to control illegal immigration, which led to state expenses for public education for undocumented children, incarceration costs and medical care. The lawsuit was later rejected by a circuit court.

However, several years later, Arizona legislators pushed Congress to develop an additional legal immigration pathway in the state.

In 2007, the Arizona House of Representatives called on the United States Congress to develop “market-based visa programs for essential workers.”

Immigration advocates who push for market-based solutions are typically looking to avoid annual caps placed on visa programs by Congress and give certain areas more visa availability than others.

One year later, representatives in Arizona pushed for a guest worker program in the state that would allow employers to recruit and hire Mexican workers. The program was never implemented.

Even as some legislators pursued legal immigration pathways, in 2010, the state passed a law designed to crack down on illegal immigration by expanding the power of state and local law enforcement.

The law required state and local police to verify immigration status during routine stops or arrests if they had “reasonable suspicion” of a person’s unlawful presence in the country.

The law also made it a state crime for undocumented immigrants to apply for or hold jobs, and prohibited local governments from creating “sanctuary” policies. Additionally, the law required immigrants to carry federal registration papers with them.

The law gave state and local officers power to arrest, without a warrant, anyone believed to have committed an offense that would make them deportable.

“The provisions of this act are intended to work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present,” the law reads

The law was quickly challenged and heard in the U.S. Supreme Court. The nation’s high court struck down three provisions of the Arizona law in a 5-3 decision.

The U.S. Supreme Court struck down Arizona’s provision to prevent undocumented immigrants from obtaining jobs and it struck down the provision requiring immigrants to keep documentation on hand. The high court also struck down the provision in the law that allowed local law enforcement to arrest someone without a warrant.

“It is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the status, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States must be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national sovereign, not 50 separate states,” Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the court’s majority opinion.

Since this landmark case, state-based immigration proposals in Arizona have been few and far between. However, immigration advocacy groups throughout the state now provide legal, financial and educational services to immigrants throughout Arizona.

Arizona Justice for our Neighbors, an advocacy group founded in 2018, partners with the mayor of Tucson, local churches and volunteers to offer free or low-cost legal services for immigrants.

“We ensure that the people we serve are treated with dignity and respect,” the website reads. “Our advocacy work includes education, training, and technical assistance in the efforts to dismantle oppression by restoring belonging and justice within the immigration justice system.”

In 2022, Arizona voters passed a resolution allowing undocumented immigrants in-state tuition for colleges and universities throughout the state.

TURNING POINT TESTS POST-KIRK INFLUENCE WITH ARIZONA RECALL EFFORT

Earlier this year, U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., proposed increasing legal pathway options and allowing providing a pathway to citizenship for dreamers and long-term undocumented residents.

“We don’t have to choose between border security and immigration reform. We can and should do both. Americans deserve the right to feel safe and know their border is secure, but for decades, Congress has tried and failed to take action because politics got in the way. It’s time to push forward and enact a plan that works,” Gallego said.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/AP25120043113517.jpg?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-11-02 18:01:15.471300

In just the first three weeks of the government shutdown, ICE spent $4.5 million of taxpayer dollars to run recruitment ads, while DHS spent more than $5.3 million on ads encouraging self-deportation and praising President Donald Trump, according to new advertisement tracking information from Equis and Priorities USA.

“We’re seeing that some of these campaigns have actively started during October, clearly after the shutdown started, which is key to this story,” Natalia Campos Vargas, the deputy research director for messaging at Equis, tells Rolling Stone. “During the government shutdown where employees are being furloughed, these government entities are still spending millions of dollars on advertising on TV and digital platforms.”

According to the new memo, which looks into ad spending on Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram, Google, Snapchat, X, cable TV, and broadcast TV, the government even increased ad spending during the shutdown. Specifically, DHS increased spending on YouTube ads, going up from $292,000 alone in September to $332,000 in just the first three weeks of October.

The ICE ads specifically target recruitment in sanctuary cities like Seattle, Boston, and Chicago, pushing a $50,000 signing bonus to police officers as part of funding authorized in Trump’s so-called Big Beautiful Bill to focus on immigration enforcement. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says in some advertisements targeting local police officers. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

In a statement to Rolling Stone, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the funding came from this bill, and that “hiring law enforcement officers is mission critical in order to fix the crisis the Biden administration manufactured by letting millions of criminal illegal aliens come into the country… Nothing will slow us down from recruiting more officers.”

Editor’s picks

McLaughlin also said in her statement that Trump and DHS Sec. Kristi Noem “will always stand by law enforcement” and are making sure they are paid during the shutdown.

DHS ads seem to target those with interests associated with the Latino community, according to the Equis research. What’s most striking is that on Meta platforms, Instagram, and Facebook, DHS has used “interest targeting” to focus on audiences interested in topics such as Latin music, Mexican cuisine, Mexican soccer teams, and Mexican pop music. It’s also unclear how much the government is spending on advertising outside of. the country.

“We are not able to track money spent outside of the United States, but we do know that the DHS is also running ads in Mexico,” says Campos Vargas. “We don’t know how much money is spent or where it is being spent.”

Last week, Rolling Stone reported that numerous streaming services and platforms — from Max and Pandora to Univision and Spotify — were running ICE recruitment ads and pro-self-deportation ads on their services. Earlier this week, the Indivisible Project launched a campaign to encourage folks to cancel Spotify Premium subscriptions and protest the platform over its running of ICE ads. It promoted said boycott on Instagram and YouTube, which has also run similar advertising.

“Spotify is exploiting the work of artists to line their pockets while recruiting for ICE – a secret police force that is terrorizing American communities,” Ezra Levin, the organization’s co-founder, said in a press release. “Spotify is actively amplifying the Trump regime’s drive to authoritarianism.”

A spokesperson for the music platform iterated to Rolling Stone that the ad is “part of a wider campaign from the U.S. government running across multiple platforms.” It’s true: similar ads have been seen on Spanish-language television, digital radio stations, YouTube, LinkedIn, and other services, and follows the Trump administration’s investment of $30 billion to hire at least 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year, according to The Associated Press.

When reached for comment earlier this month, McLaughlin told Rolling Stone that there was “nothing offensive or partisan” with removing what it called criminals from the United States. “The ICE recruitment campaign is a resounding success with more than 150,000 applications rolling in from patriotic Americans answering the call to defend the Homeland by helping arrest and remove the worst of the worst from our country,” McLaughlin said at the time.",https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ice-spending.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,N,,2025-11-02 14:16:51.361833

Police in a Chicago suburb are collecting videos and other evidence to send to the Illinois attorney general’s office after a car crash involving a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle led to a violent arrest caught on video showing an agent repeatedly punching a man in the head while pinned to the ground.

Immigration agents arrested three people after a sedan collided with the rear of the U.S. Border Patrol vehicle around noon Friday in the city of Evanston. The episode drew a crowd of onlookers and quickly escalated.

Videos posted to social media show some in the crowd appearing to try to interfere with the arrests. Federal agents are seen at times deploying pepper spray, punching a man who approaches the officers, and pointing a gun in the direction of another woman who opened the agents’ vehicle door, where a detainee had been placed.

One agent who was restraining a man on the ground Friday appeared to punch him in the head as it was pressed against the asphalt. The Department of Homeland Security later said the officer delivered “defensive strikes” after the man “grabbed the agent’s genitals and squeezed.”

Some witnesses claimed online that the agents caused the crash by suddenly braking in front of the sedan, though federal officials disputed that account. City leaders swiftly condemned the agents’ actions.

In a news conference shortly after the episode, Mayor Daniel Biss said immigration agents had “beaten people up” and “abducted them.”

“It is an outrage,” Biss said. “Our message for ICE is simple: Get the hell out of Evanston.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agents were being “aggressively tailgated” and the sedan hit them as they tried to make a U-turn.

“A hostile crowd then surrounded agents and their vehicle, verbally abusing and spitting on them,” the agency said. “One physically assaulted a Border Patrol agent and kicked an agent. As he was being arrested, he grabbed the agent’s genitals and squeezed them. The agent delivered several defensive strikes to free himself.”

The mayor has urged more people to join the rapid response team, and city officials have passed ordinances declaring city property to be “No ICE Zones.” This week the Evanston Police Department began sending a supervisor to any reported immigration enforcement scene to document what happens and collect evidence for the Illinois attorney general’s Civil Rights Division, Police Cmdr. Ryan Glew said.

Glew said officers received calls from both federal agents and bystanders. A supervisor arrived after the arrests were made, and several people were treated by paramedics for exposure to pepper spray.

“When we responded those efforts were focused on stabilizing the situation and preventing further conflict between ICE agents and community members,” he said.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute Middle School, was part of the crowd that formed after the collision.

One early project of Sanctuary Campus Network was to develop an immigration-focused Know Your Rights training and slide deck that was adapted specifically for the campus environment.
Sanctuary Campus Network is broken up into five regions, and members meet regularly in smaller groups.
Tending the Soil to Build a Fertile Organizing Space Organizing on campus, like organizing more generally, does not always look like what it looks like in the movies.
Negotiating Long-Term Struggles Amid High Turnover One of the main challenges of campus activism is the churn of leadership in student groups.","Photos of Palestine solidarity encampments have disappeared from the news, replaced by pictures of immigration agents kidnapping university students and community members, but the campus-based battle to force universities to divest from Israel and weapons manufacturing is still underway.

This a long-term, smoldering battle. “The campuses are definitely as active as they were a year ago from my purview,” says Akin Olla, communications director for the anti-militarist youth organization Dissenters. But, he adds, “The actions look different and are generally less media-friendly.”

While this struggle continues, its shape has shifted, as students who were initially on the front lines of pro-Palestine activism experience additional vulnerability due to the Trump administration’s attacks. Many of these students are Muslim immigrants or from immigrant families, while others are queer or trans and confronting a different series of attacks. As a result of these changes, the shape of the work has changed. For one thing, faculty who spoke to Truthout said that campus student groups are working more in coalition to provide some shielding to targeted students, like Students for Justice in Palestine or Muslim student associations.

Faculty across the United States continue to organize: They’re supporting students and their movements; organizing their own events; building aboveground and underground safety networks in response to the presence of immigration police on campus; and pushing their own unions and scholarly associations to take political positions.

Attacks on International Students and Faculty

Since Donald Trump took office in January 2025, people on campuses have experienced a series of rollercoaster events around the status of international, immigrant, and undocumented students and staff. In March, there were a series of high-profile kidnappings of students on visas and green cards like Rümeysa Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil in retaliation for their activism on Palestine. These widely publicized kidnappings were accompanied by the sudden revocation of 6,000 student visas around the U.S., the majority of which were not related to activism or political opinions.

The dramatic crisis of the spring has given way to other forms of exclusion: This summer, the administration made a dramatic reduction in the number of student visas that were issued, leading to a 30-40 percent drop in international students attending school in the U.S. this fall. Then on September 19, the Trump administration issued an executive order about H-1B visas that initially made it seem as if H-1B visa holders would no longer be able to come and go from the U.S. without their employers paying a $100,000 fee. There are currently around 120,000 faculty and university workers holding H-1B visas across the U.S., many of whom travel internationally professionally as part of their research.

There does not seem to be an end in sight to attacks on immigrant, undocumented, and international students, faculty, and staff, nor does there seem to be an obvious line that will not be crossed as the administration escalates its attacks. Jenna Loyd, co-founding member of Sanctuary Campus Network, says that in addition to a spillover from the administration’s attacks on immigrants more broadly, the logic is to “attack the whole idea of universities being international spaces.”

Universities Are Not Left-Wing Bastions

Contrary to Republican talking points, universities are not hotbeds of radical leftism. In reality, governing boards react swiftly and punitively to events that rock the boat.

At a small private liberal arts college in the Northeast, a political theorist is facing dismissal for her activism. “Laura,” who chose not to give her real name because she is on the job market, found herself on the wrong side of her institution when she organized a series of speaking events about Palestine. The events featured high-profile speakers and highlighted the interconnectedness of Palestine to other issues, including campus repression of free speech, in an effort to build more solidarity with Palestine on campus.

Faculty active in the pro-Palestine struggle are generally frustrated at the lack of support and activism from their colleagues. Many faculty, says Laura, have an “easy posture of learned helplessness” around difficult issues, insisting disingenuously that the university is not a political space. “It’s racism masked behind civility politics,” Laura says.

At the University of Central Florida, Talat Rahman, faculty union president and professor of physics, says that there is unfortunately not nearly as much support for organizing against the genocide as for resisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), although the two causes are interrelated. Rahman says there is a lot of fear on campus, but that “people can only be afraid for so long. At some point you have to live with your own conscience.”

It’s no coincidence that the attacks on students and immigrants on campus began with those speaking out against the genocide in Palestine, says Bill V. Mullen, professor emeritus of American Studies at Purdue and secretary-treasurer for American Association of University Professors local 6741. “The opposition to the war against Palestinians has become a hammer to destroy academic freedom…. Whatever your position might even be on Palestine and Israel, you have to acknowledge that this is the mechanism that’s being used to try to reshape higher education. The discussion of Palestine is actually a discussion about our work conditions.”

In other words, the repression of pro-Palestine protesters on university campuses, under Joe Biden and under every previous presidential administration, created the opportunity for the anti-immigrant attacks by the Trump administration, as well as other attacks against diversity, equity, and inclusion, and independent governance.

Creating Sanctuary at the Grassroots

Despite mission statements extolling the benefits of diversity and care for their students, campus administrations have offered little other than platitudes to protect international and undocumented students, leaving it to faculty staff and students to organize and protect each other. The overwhelming majority of university administrations are too risk-averse to offer real support to students facing an expanded immigration dragnet, so some faculty are responding to administrative compliance with ICE and the Department of Homeland Security by forming their own support networks.

One national coordinating group is the new and growing Sanctuary Campus Network, which aims to pool ideas and resources so that faculty on any single campus don’t need to reinvent the wheel. The network has been holding large Zoom meetings on the first Friday of each month since December 2024. These meetings often involve a training or presentation from a partner organization, like Muslims for Just Futures or Palestine Legal.

One early project of Sanctuary Campus Network was to develop an immigration-focused Know Your Rights training and slide deck that was adapted specifically for the campus environment. The network encouraged members to give the presentation on their own campuses to disseminate this information as widely as possible while reducing the time that individual faculty need to spend developing materials.

Similarly, the network has a large drive of materials for printing and use by faculty, like signs that can be placed on office or classroom doors indicating that these are private spaces (and therefore closed to immigration agents without a signed judicial warrant). The goal is to use these signs to indicate to students and others who may be targeted which faculty are supportive and where they will be harbored in the event of a raid on campus.

Sanctuary Campus Network is broken up into five regions, and members meet regularly in smaller groups. Rachel Ida Buff, a writer and working historian currently teaching at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, who is part of the Midwest region, says that these regional meetings have been “really, really useful,” and validating, allowing faculty to commiserate, share tactics, and build camaraderie with each other. These regional network meetings are especially important as a space to build a collective effort since the number of active faculty on an individual campus may be quite small.

Tending the Soil to Build a Fertile Organizing Space

Organizing on campus, like organizing more generally, does not always look like what it looks like in the movies. Laura says that a big part of her role in mentoring student activists is teaching that “activism is not always the flashiest thing.” Instead, it’s often about “illuminating how power functions” and other less obvious goals, she says.

Dana Morrison, member of Faculty and Staff for Justice in Palestine at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, explained that one of the group’s goals is politicization. On regional public campuses like West Chester, most students work and many live far from campus, leading to a relatively apolitical campus. “How do you [participate in coordinated national events] if on your own campus, nobody has even uttered a political thing in the public space?” Morrison says that “you have to have the soil correct for anything to happen.”

It’s not just students on campus who are sometimes relatively apolitical. Sanctuary Campus Network co-founding member A. Naomi Paik pointed out that some faculty have little experience with activism and are just learning to organize. There are places to learn, however: A focus of the network as well as of the American Association of University Professors has been to offer trainings on the various components of organizing, and there are usually at least a small group of faculty members on each campus who do have this experience.

Mullen, who helped organize the second National Day of Action for Higher Education on April 17, 2025, as part of the Coalition for Action in Higher Ed (CAHE), says “overcoming hopelessness is a crucial organizing problem.”

The Day of Action featured scores of actions on a diverse range of campuses, as well as a full day of online programming organized by CAHE. Mullen says that one of the goals of this year’s events was to bring Palestine more directly into the focus of higher ed organizing. CAHE is beginning to transition to an organization from an ad hoc coalition, and is already planning for April 17, 2026.

Negotiating Long-Term Struggles Amid High Turnover

One of the main challenges of campus activism is the churn of leadership in student groups. Campaigns like divestment struggles are long, much longer than the average tenure of a student activist. Several faculty members mentioned that student organizations that led earlier protests on their campus are in a process of reformation after all the leaders graduated at once.

Faculty have much lower rates of turnover and can be present for a longer campaign, but activist faculty are careful about their role in relationship to students. Morrison says that she and her colleagues are careful to develop campaigns of their own rather than drive campus-wide divestment campaigns. “If we were to define the campaign, name the target, and all that kind of stuff, we’d be taking up space in terms of how we teach students,” she says. Faculty would end up teaching students that their participation is not important.

Instead, Morrison’s Faculty and Staff Justice in Palestine chapter organized a successful divestment campaign focused on their labor union. Other faculty have engaged in pressure campaigns within their scholarly associations, like the Sociologists for Palestine campaign.

On some campuses, student groups have merged with off-campus community groups so that students who’ve graduated can stay involved. This is the case with the Dissenters chapter at North Carolina State University, says Chelsey Dyer, assistant teaching professor of anthropology who serves as the faculty adviser for the group. Dyer says this joint community/campus structure also allows her and other involved faculty to show up to the group more as peer activists than specifically as faculty mentors.

Similarly, Buff says campus sanctuary organizing on her campus in Milwaukee has benefited from collaborations with deeply rooted immigrant organizing in the city, and that Buff herself has benefited from looking to other activists as peers rather than often-fearful faculty colleagues.

The struggle to protect international, immigrant, and undocumented students is deeply entwined with the longer-term struggle for a free Palestine and to build a more liberatory version of higher education itself. Mullen puts it this way: “If both parties have been willing to consent to supporting a mass killing of a population, it’s not a shock that both parties participated in the firing of college presidents and the arrests of students.”

The odds are daunting, but faculty like Mullen emphasize that building cross-campus and national networks reduces their isolation — and their fear.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2213497759.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 15:16:56.720450

The Intercept described these contractors as “private bounty hunters” when it published a DHS document detailing the proposal on Saturday. The “Request for Information” document, which is intended for prospective vendors, states that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has “an immediate need for Skip Tracing and Process Serving Services,” which would use “Government furnished case data,” according to the outlet.

Skip-tracing involves “gathering, analyzing, and verifying information to locate individuals who have disappeared, whether intentionally or unintentionally,” according to Thomson Reuters.

ICE is also “exploring an incentive based pricing structure,” and could even provide “monetary bonuses” for performance, according to the obtained document. One way an ICE says contractors might get a cash bonus, according to The Intercept, is by identifying a person’s correct address on the first try

The Independent has contacted ICE for comment.

Federal immigration activity has ramped up this year after President Donald Trump vowed to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history. The uptick in immigration raids and presence of federal immigration agents in several major cities has sparked protests throughout the country, including in Los Angeles and Chicago.

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker even appealed to the Trump administration this week, asking officials overseeing the federal immigration operations in Chicago to pause their activities during Halloween weekend

“Illinois families deserve to spend Halloween weekend without fear. No child should be forced to inhale tear gas or other chemical agents while trick or treating in their own neighborhood,” Pritzker said in a statement.

““Illinois children should not be robbed of their innocence,” he continued. “Let them enjoy a time-honored American tradition safely and peacefully. Please let children be children for one holiday, free from intimidation and fear.”

Noem slammed Pritzker for making the request at a press conference on Thursday.

“The fact that Governor Pritzker is asking for that is shameful and I think unfortunate that he does not recognize how important the work that we do is,” Noem said.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/29/17/49/Immigration-ICE-Shake-up-w6msu3h3.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-11-02 16:16:44.691973

Rae Lindenberg, a resident, shouted against the agents’ presence, urging them to leave the neighborhood. The agents arrived in Lakeview to apprehend a construction worker, prompting protests from locals like Courtney Conway, who felt the agents were creating fear and turmoil in their community.

Since the start of President Trump’s immigration crackdown in September, Chicago’s neighborhoods have banded together to resist enforcement, using social media to share information about the agents’ movements. This community effort has helped slow down the agents, and in some cases, forced them to retreat. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the professionalism of their officers amid the unrest.

In response to increased arrests, tens of thousands of residents are actively tracking immigration agents in real-time via online groups, sharing details such as vehicle information and targeted neighborhoods. Protesters often follow the agents, sounding horns and whistles to alert others. However, confrontations have escalated, leading to instances where agents have used tear gas, Tasers, and even firearms, resulting in injuries and at least one fatality.

U. S. District Judge Sara Ellis has mandated that agents use body cameras and provide warnings before using tear gas. Local communities are taking protective measures, such as parents standing guard at schools and residents locking their doors.

The group was escorted by Illinois State Police officers who relayed the clergy's request to ICE officials.
Persch, who is 91, has been a fixture outside the Broadview facility for decades, praying for the rights and dignity of detained immigrants.
The Broadview gathering came just three weeks after a smaller Mass on Oct. 11, when ICE first denied the group entry.
""I am here today because I am also an immigrant,"" said Garcia-Maldonado, preaching outside the ICE facility.","For the second time in less than a month, federal immigration officials have refused to allow Catholic leaders to administer Communion to immigrants held inside the Broadview ICE Detention Center near Chicago — even as more than 2,000 faithful gathered outside the facility on Saturday morning, Nov. 1, to pray, sing and demand access for clergy.

The Mass, organized by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, drew a crowd that spilled across the sidewalks of the industrial stretch outside the detention center. Aztec dancers opened the ceremony, followed by a solemn procession of more than 50 priests from the Chicago Archdiocese, deacons and women religious, who joined worshippers for an outdoor celebration of the Eucharist.

But as the crowd prayed for those inside, the group's main request — to bring Communion to detainees — was again rejected by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, echoing its refusal to the group on Oct. 11.

Chicago Auxiliary Bishop José María Garcia-Maldonado and Mercy Sr. JoAnn Persch led a small delegation toward the detention center's main checkpoint, requesting to bring Communion to the detainees. The group was escorted by Illinois State Police officers who relayed the clergy's request to ICE officials.

""The answer was no,"" Persch told the crowd upon returning to the outdoor altar, her voice steady but disappointed. ""Sisters and brothers detained in this horrendous situation, we asked to come and bring you comfort,"" she said.

Persch, who is 91, has been a fixture outside the Broadview facility for decades, praying for the rights and dignity of detained immigrants. Until recently, she had been allowed inside to offer Communion. That changed, she said, under the current administration's tightened access policies.

Members of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership and its supporters argue that ICE's continued denials violate the right to religious freedom and contradict the agency's own detention standards, which guarantee access to worship for those in custody.

""Although ICE claims that their Broadview facility upholds national detention standards guaranteeing the right to worship, testimonies from those detained and their families tell a very different story, one of spiritual neglect and isolation,"" the coalition said in its public statement.

In a recent interview with the National Catholic Reporter, Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago has also criticized ICE's decision, describing it as ""a violation of religious freedom"" and emphasizing, ""There is no harm to the government in allowing us to minister.""

The Broadview gathering came just three weeks after a smaller Mass on Oct. 11, when ICE first denied the group entry. After that initial rejection, leaders of the coalition said they worked diligently to comply with federal guidance for religious visitation.

""We attempted for a second time to bring Communion to migrants detained there. ICE turned us away,"" said Jesuit Fr. David Inczauskis, who served as master of ceremonies for the All Saints' Day and Día de los Muertos Masses. ""They told us they needed one week's notice. We let them know 10 days in advance,"" he said of the group's arrival at the center.

The group submitted a formal letter to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE Oct. 24, requesting permission for a small group of ministers to enter Broadview on Nov. 1. Mayor Katrina Thompson of Broadview also sent a letter of support the following day. ICE acknowledged neither request before the event, organizers said.

Instead, on Oct. 28, ICE officials sent a written denial citing ""safety and security concerns"" and ""the transitory nature"" of the Broadview facility — a justification the leaders of the coalition dispute. ""ICE representatives further insisted that Broadview is not a detention center, even though many reports confirm that people are often held there for several days without beds,"" the coalition said in a statement.

The group followed up with an additional letter on Oct. 30, delivered both by email and in person to ICE's downtown Chicago office. They were told no one was available to meet with them and were warned that permission to enter Broadview would likely not be granted. No response followed.

""I am here today because I am also an immigrant,"" said Garcia-Maldonado, preaching outside the ICE facility. ""My story is a story many of you here relate to. Being here today is a part of the holiness we are called to live. This is our faith.""

Though ICE agents did not engage directly with the demonstrators, witnesses said federal vehicles drove repeatedly along the access road, an act many interpreted as intimidation, organizers said.

""Perhaps they don't want to allow us in because they know the conditions inside are inhumane and they know we would denounce that,"" said Inczauskis.

""Our request is so simple, to do something the Catholic Church does every day. We are united in Christ. We will not stop denouncing the evil of detention and deportation. We cannot be silent in the face of oppression. We will persist until justice flows freely like a river,"" the priest said.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-11/Pic%204%20Broadview%20ICE%20RESIZE.jpg?h=82f92a78&itok=immsHI73,N,,2025-11-02 15:17:00.211132

After learning one of her neighbors in the Fairview neighborhood was “abducted” on Oct. 17 in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, Sahinoglu came to a recent Village Board meeting to say it doesn’t take an expert to recognize what ICE is doing is wrong.

“My heart is broken. It shouldn’t feel any different when it’s the guy who cuts the lawn in the neighborhood next to you who’s taken, versus the neighbor who you’ve had dinner with and whose kid has jumped on your trampoline, but somehow it does feel different when it’s literally closer to home,” Sahinoglu said. “And those of us with privilege have an obligation to speak up.”

Sahinoglu was one of several people who stood before Skokie trustees on Oct. 21 to express their rising concern about ICE’s local activity and demand village officials’ take stronger action against the federal government’s operations.

Trustees voted unanimously in March to update Section 58 of its code, reaffirming, among other things, that village staff cannot provide information about individuals in custody to immigration detainers or provide them access to village facilities without a criminal warrant.

But Skokie’s interim corporation counsel Barbara Mangler clarified that the Village does not have jurisdiction to enforce that ordinance when ICE operations occur on property owned by other municipalities, like the Skokie Public Library and local school districts.

The agenda for the Village Board’s next meeting on Nov. 3 shows that trustees will discuss a recommendation from staff to add more language to its code that “strengthens and clarifies restrictions on Village-owned property for civil immigration enforcement.”

Prior to the public session, The Record checked in with Skokie’s public agencies to gain insight on the scope of ICE’s operations in Skokie and what measures they are taking in response.

Multiple agencies told The Record that immigration agents have apprehended Skokie residents. Residents have also testified in public settings about local ICE detainments.

Mayor Ann Tennes addressed the community on Halloween, Friday, Oct. 31, when immigration operations were confirmed in Evanston, Skokie, Wilmette and other surrounding communities.

“Today’s been a hard day in our community,” she said. “There’s been an enhanced presence of federal immigration enforcement. … This has been terribly distressing, difficult and frightening.

“Skokie is a community of immigrants, and we’re also a community that supports one another. Time and again we step up and stand together.”

ICE, however, in an email to The Record on Oct. 31 denied that its agents have made any arrests in Skokie.

“No ICE arrests have occurred in Skokie during Operation Midway Blitz,” ICE Communications Director Tanya Roman wrote.

‘We help anybody’

The Village Board first passed an ordinance in 2017 that prohibited village staff from collecting individuals’ immigration status, engaging in immigration action without a criminal warrant and refusing village services based on a person’s immigration status.

Amanda Sabri, a social worker in Skokie’s Department of Health and Human Services, said the mayor and village manager tasked the Human Relations Commission in July with outlining the rights that ordinance enshrines and other resources that may be helpful for local immigrants.

That information, which the commissionfinalized into a flyer in October, is now published online and was distributed to residents, area school districts and service groups like the Early Childhood Alliance, said Michael Charley, Skokie’s director of Health and Human Services.

The village’s health department does provide residents with legal, food and rental assistance, and staff have connected the local business community with training from local groups like the Illinois Workers in Action about what to do if ICE visits their business, Charley said.

Moving forward, Sabri said the Human Relations Commission’s Community Engagement Subcommittee will work on programming that focuses on “social cohesion” to help make the local immigrant community feel welcomed and connected to Skokie.

“In general, the Village just wants to reaffirm our long-standing commitment of inclusion, dignity and respect for all,” Charley said.

“Our board stands behind that and as ICE activity started I think the Village Board wanted to not only remind but just reassure Skokie’s public that we have our own Chapter 58 of the village code that says it doesn’t matter what your immigrant status is, we help anybody in the community.”

The library, parks and schools

The Skokie Park District “is following the Village of Skokie’s policy” regarding ICE operations and has had no reports of ICE personnel on park property, said Jim Bottorff, the Skokie Park District’s director of communications, in an email.

Jane Hanna, the Skokie Public Library’s communications manager, said its existing policies prevent staff from sharing information about patrons without a subpoena, and its security team are within their rights to intervene if there is a disruption to the safe, appropriate use of the library

The library parking lot and building, however, are public property, which means “there’s little the library can do in terms of preventing ICE from coming in,” Hanna said.

“That being said, our staff have received guidance from our administration on how to respond if there are ICE agents on the property and one of the core values of librarianship is protecting patron privacy, so we are definitely committed to that,” Hanna said.

Ruth Sinker, communication manager for Skokie School District 73.5, said she is only aware of one family in the district who has had a member detained by ICE so far.

The district recently sent an update to parents outlining how staff will respond if ICE comes to a D73.5 building. The response includes asking for a signed judicial warrant to protect the disclosure of a student’s citizenship status without proper authorization.

Takumi Iseda, director of communications for Niles Township High School District 219 (Niles West, North and Central high schools), said there have been no confirmed reports of ICE on campus, but school staff have received updated information on procedures and federal laws to follow related to immigrant rights.

‘Enormous financial and emotional stress’

Both D219 and D73.5 have intergovernmental agreements with Niles Township. The two school districts administer funds to the government entity to support the social programs, like childcare services or rental assistance, that the township provides to qualifying families.

Bonnie Kahn Ognisanti, Niles Township’s supervisor, said the state limits who can receive assistance. The office can provide emergency eviction prevention to people with refugee status, a demographic that reportedly accounts for about a third of the township’s cases.

But since ICE has operated in Skokie and the surrounding communities, Ognisanti said the township has utilized more “flexible” funding sources, like intergovernmental agreements, to provide wrap-around services to local families struggling after a breadwinner was detained.

“We’ve helped people with immigration issues (before), but never because ICE was involved — never,” Ognisanti said, noting that the kind of stress her team is seeing since ICE’s Operation Midway Blitz began in September is new.

“We were never needing to help a family because a loved one was detained and removed, creating just enormous emotional and financial stress on that family and the community that surrounds the family and cares about them,” Ognisanti said.

The township is typically connected with families impacted by ICE via referrals from other social workers or even grassroots organizations. While Ognisanti said her office has helped Skokie families who have had a member detained by ICE, she declined to share how many.

Committed to creating a safe place that will always puts the needs of everyone in its community first, Ognisanti said her office is careful not take any actions that could potentially identify or endanger its users, many of whom are afraid to get help for fear of detainment.

To that end, the office doesn’t keep a list of those impacted by ICE. For a Know Your Rights workshop the township is helping facilitate with the North Shore Legal Aid Clinic, Ognisanti had attendees sign up using their initials only.

Ruth Orme-Johnson, director of social services at the township, said she would like to see ICE call off their immigration blitz so the community can return to a sense of “normalcy and safety.”

“So many of the people who are picked up (by ICE) are folks who have lived here for decades, people with small businesses, people who have owned houses and had multiple generations,” Orme-Johnson said. “It’s just incredibly corrosive to the social fabric for some of these immigrant communities, and therefore, for all of us.”

‘Make it crystal clear’

On Oct. 21, Skokie resident Kimberly Polka placed her phone underneath an overhead projector in the Skokie council chambers to show trustees a recent confrontation in Evanston she filmed between herself and an ICE agent.

Polka said the agent confronted her when she saw them near an unattended landscaping truck. She urged the Skokie Village Board not to allow federal agents to use village-owned property to detain members of the community, emphasizing that “silence is complicity.”

“Please make it crystal clear that ICE is not permitted to use our village property in their campaign of cruelty and terror,” Polka said. “November 3 is too long; Will County has done it. Evanston has done it — Chicago, Cook County, Lake County. We are behind the ball.”

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order on Oct. 6 prohibiting ICE from using city-owned properties and requiring spaces that may be used for immigration federal enforcement operations to be identified with clear signage.

The Cook County Board, Lake County Board, City of Evanston have all since followed suit, approving similar measures in October. On Oct. 28, Wilmette residents pleaded with village officials to act swiftly — two days later ICE agents were confirmed operating in the area.

As Skokie’s Human Relations Chapter already forbids staff from assisting with immigration enforcement by providing access to village facilities, it remains to be seen what more language trustees can add to its code that will ensure local residents feel more safe and secure from ICE operations.

“I should not have to hesitate before asking my children’s 70-year-old Mexican grandparents to take them to the library or around the corner to the park or run an errand because I worry about them being stopped, questioned, or even worse, detained simply based on the color of their skin,” said Kristina Fleck, another Skokie resident, on Oct. 21.

“That is not the definition of safe access to our services,” Fleck said.

Here's what happened next. | CNN,Nicquel Terry Ellis,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/ice-protest-arrests-illinois,"Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are deploying tear gas during protests in neighborhoods.
To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility.
So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.
Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.
Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.","As demonstrations outside an immigration enforcement facility near Chicago have ramped up over the past couple of months, so has the number of protesters being led away in restraints and facing a court date.

Since September, protesters have rallied weekly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview against President Donald Trump’s intensified immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago.

Early on, federal agents guarding the building deployed tear gas and shot pepper balls in clashes with protesters and arrested some of them, including some charged with felonies on suspicion of assaulting or blocking officers.

But by early October, state, county and local law enforcement officers took a larger role in policing the protests at the facility. These agencies have made 68 arrests in connection with Broadview protests since October 3, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said on October 28.

The arrests sometimes expose a tension between demonstrators’ desire to exercise their constitutional free speech rights and the intention of authorities – who say some protesters have resisted their attempts to keep paths to the building clear – to let ICE agents and others travel safely to and from the facility.

CNN talked to some arrested demonstrators or, in one case, a protester’s representative, to ask about their experiences in getting arrested on accusations ranging from petty to felony offenses. Here are their stories.

Chicago woman held for hours after a crowd scuffle with police

A’Keisha Lee was standing and chanting with a crowd of protesters near the Broadview ICE facility on October 17 when she saw a swarm of police officers hop out of police vans wearing helmets and carrying batons, she said.

“I was sickened,” the 30-year-old Chicago resident recalled. “And I remember feeling really scared.”

The officers walked toward her and the other demonstrators in a “militarized fashion” and began pushing them back, she said. Video of the encounter shows Lee at the front of the crowd when officers with Illinois State Police patches on their sleeves pushed in an apparent attempt to clear them from a paved area, and some demonstrators tried to hold their ground.

Chaos ensued. There was yelling, people falling, and some who appeared to get hurt in the scuffle, Lee said.

She was hit in the face with a baton, and wasn’t sure whether the strike was intentional, she recounted. She’d later discover a bruise on her face.

Lee fell to the ground, and officers helped her up, according to Lee and the video, which was distributed by Reuters. An officer then detained her, putting zip ties around her wrists, she said; that moment is not shown in the Reuters video. Lee couldn’t understand why she was being arrested.

“I was asking them to let me go,” Lee said, “and reinforcing that I hadn’t did anything I wasn’t allowed to do.”

She was escorted to a curb to sit, and moments later placed in a police vehicle that took her to the Broadview Police Department. Lee’s mind raced as she rode in the police car. She worried about going to jail and whether the conditions would be clean and safe. She also worried about whether she’d be treated differently as a Black woman in the legal system.

At the police station, she was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell with other female protesters for about five hours before being released.

Illinois State Police had arrested her on two Class A misdemeanor counts of resisting a police officer – punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 – Cook County court records show. She also was cited on suspicion of disobeying a police officer, a petty offense that carries a fine. Her court appearance is scheduled for November 25.

The court documents do not offer details about what led to the arrest, but Lee denies resisting and says it was never made clear to her how she was disobeying police.

“From my understanding, it was in my rights to be there,” she said.

Illinois State Police did not directly answer CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including Lee’s assertion that she did nothing wrong or why officers pushed back this crowd. However, they did issue a statement generally addressing the approach of the state, county and local officers who’ve been policing the protests since early October – a group they call the “Unified Command.”

These officers in Broadview “give loud, clear, consistent, and repeated directions and commands to crowds and provide individuals numerous opportunities to comply with the law,” state police said.

“It’s important to note that since the establishment of the Unified Command, there have been no violent confrontations between ICE and protesters in Broadview involving the use of chemical agents, which is a significant departure from operations prior to their presence,” the statement reads.

Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are deploying tear gas during protests in neighborhoods.

“I think how this country has treated immigrants is one of our original transgressions,” Lee said. “And this is the first tester for what we will allow as a people.”

Lee, who works for a local nonprofit, worries about the fate of her court case; however, she stands by her decision to protest.

“There’s always a fear of being treated like an example when these things happen,” Lee said. “But I do believe that I did not break the law.”

He was arrested while trying to enter the ICE facility

Sean Mills says he is not happy about how immigrants have been treated since the Trump administration started aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration earlier this year.

To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility. He shows up every Friday and Saturday – sometimes wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders – and joins other protesters outside the facility.

But on October 17, Mills was arrested for the first time in his life, he said, after he tried to enter the building. Mills had become increasingly concerned with claims by local activists that the facility’s conditions were inhumane. So, Mills wanted to view the building’s interior himself.

“I just had the urge to walk over and test my luck,” Mills said. “I walked over to see if I could investigate as a citizen and enter the facility to ask questions and document.”

Officers surrounded Mills near the facility’s entrance, and one told him he was not allowed inside, Mills said. That same officer told Mills to “go back immediately” or be arrested, according to Mills.

“I tried to explain myself a little bit further,” Mills said, adding he told the officers he was a concerned citizen who wanted to go inside. “And I think about five or 10 seconds later, he (the officer) said ‘OK, you’re under arrest.’”

Mills was shocked because he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. He also felt the officers had not given him enough time to explain himself before restraining his hands with what he believes were zip ties.

Three other protesters who also were trying to enter the building were arrested, he recalled.

“I think it’s just an over-policing example, because I walked up there with my hands out to my side, declared myself very openly, and said I’d like to enter the facility,” Mills said. “One hundred percent it was just to show an example of us.”

Mills was escorted to a nearby curb, where he waited roughly 10 minutes for a police van that took him to the Broadview police station, where he was processed and given a citation, he recounted.

Illinois State Police cited him on suspicion of disobeying a police officer – a petty offense punishable by a fine – Cook County court records show, and is scheduled to appear in court November 25.

The court documents do not offer a narrative of the arrest. State police did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including about Mills’ claim that he did nothing wrong. Instead, they provided the same general statement they gave for Lee’s arrest.

Mills has no regrets protesting and getting arrested because he’s standing up for his beliefs.

“It’s a shame that us peaceful protesters are being targeted instead of being encouraged to exercise our First Amendment rights,” Mills said.

Mills objects to law enforcement officers being able to stop and ask people about their immigration status based at least in part on their apparent ethnicity. A US Supreme Court ruling in a California case last month appeared to clear the way for a person’s ethnicity to be a factor behind immigration stops by law enforcement.

Mills also does not support ICE’s roundups throughout Chicago of people accused of being in the country illegally.

“We are doing the least that we can do to keep our neighbors safe, which is so important to us right now,” Mills said.

School cafeteria worker tackled after threatening agents, authorities say

Paul Ivery is a Chicago-area man with an intellectual disability who works at a high school cafeteria and admires and respects the police and first responders in his community – even saluting officers when he passes them – people who know him say.

So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.

The case would draw numerous supporters, including his own mayor, to one of Ivery’s court hearings in an attempt to persuade a judge he wasn’t a threat. Ivery declined to be interviewed for this story, but a family representative, court filings and bystander video help chronicle a case that the government wanted prosecuted one moment but dismissed the next.

Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.

Ivery would later tell investigators he was there to “protest against ICE” because he believed that “ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,” a criminal complaint filed against Ivery in federal court said, without elaborating on his motivation.

Ivery was also upset that federal agents had been deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at protesters at Broadview, according to Sakiwama.

At some point during the protest, Ivery approached a US Border Patrol agent and shouted something at him, according to the complaint. While the agent couldn’t recall what was said, Ivery would admit to investigators later that he said, “I’ll (expletive) kill you right now,” and, “do something,” according to the document.

After the shout, Ivery ran and jumped on top of an occupied vehicle as agents chased him, the complaint says.

Video from a bystander shows Ivery jumping off the vehicle, and an agent tackling him as he hits the pavement. Ivery yells as several agents restrain him. Nearby, other agents fire chemical irritants into the ground to keep bystanders away, appearing to cause some people to cough, the video shows.

An onlooker asks Ivery for his name. Ivery yells it and says, “Help me!” Minutes later, after agents tied his hands behind his back and sat him up, an agent helps Ivery drink from a water bottle. Ivery is eventually pulled to his feet and led into the back of an unmarked vehicle.

The complaint alleges that as agents were restraining Ivery, he grabbed an agent’s helmet and pulled it down, hurting the agent’s chin and exposing the agent to pepper spray.

Ivery was arrested and charged in federal court with felony assault on a federal officer, according to court documents.

Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.

Ivery was held for several days. But by October 1, prosecutors asked to have him released from jail and put on house arrest pending trial, acknowledging his disability, CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported.

At a hearing that day, a judge released Ivery on his own recognizance. Many of Ivery’s supporters, including Oak Park Mayor Vicki Scaman, were there to back him, according to WLS.

In a letter to the judge, Scaman said Ivery is a “valued member of our community” who stops and salutes police when he sees them on the street. She wrote that Ivery is not a threat to the community, and she hoped the judge would consider Ivery’s “special needs diagnosis.”

On October 9, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge altogether, and the judge ordered the dismissal the next day. The court records did not say why the case was dismissed.

The US attorney’s office for Illinois’ northern district did not respond to CNN’s request for information about the dismissal. Ivery’s court-appointed attorney declined to be interviewed about the specifics of the case.

“I am happy for Mr. Ivery and the just resolution of his case and hope that others who are also having their First Amendment rights trampled by the government receive justice as well,” Ivery’s attorney and federal public defender Johanathan Brooks said in an email to CNN.

That 7-point enthusiasm edge in the survey is on par with the 9-point enthusiasm edge Democrats enjoyed in the 2018 midterms.
Thirty-nine percent of registered voters view ICE positively and 50% view it negatively.
White voters are split in their view of ICE, while two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters view the agency negatively.
And it’s pretty clear that Americans are not taking them for granted these days, and that’s true for whether they’re Republicans, Democrats or independents,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.","Democrats have an early lead in next year’s battle for control of Congress amid an ongoing government shutdown, as more voters say President Donald Trump has not lived up to their expectations on several major issues that propelled him back to the White House in 2024, according to a new national NBC News poll.

Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, and a majority say he’s fallen short on changing business as usual in Washington. At the same time, the Democratic Party continues to suffer from low ratings from voters as it seeks to offer an alternative.

Meanwhile, the issue of protecting democracy and constitutional rights are top issues to voters, alongside costs, as Trump continues an expansive agenda of executive actions on immigration and other key policy areas. And a majority of voters believe he’s done more to undermine the Constitution than defend it.

The president’s overall approval rating in the survey sits at 43%, a 4-point decrease since March, while 55% disapprove of his job performance.

And one year before the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats lead Republicans in the fight for Congress by 8 points, 50%-42%, the largest lead for either party on the congressional ballot in the NBC News poll since the 2018 midterms. Democrats had a negligible 1-point edge, 48%-47%, in the March survey.

“We will learn a lot in just a few days’ time in New Jersey and Virginia, among other elections, and what impact these results may have on the government shutdown,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll along with the Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.

“What we know is that this is an electorate that remains deeply unhappy with the status quo,” Horwitt said.

Democrats’ lead on the congressional ballot is among the larger advantages they have enjoyed in any public polling in 2025. This poll was conducted Oct. 24-28, with a majority of respondents (52%) blaming Trump and congressional Republicans for the monthslong government shutdown — but historically high numbers blaming congressional Democrats, too (42%).

One key question that has arisen during past government shutdowns is whether the politics of the moment persist throughout an election cycle, once a funding impasse has been resolved.

Shutdowns can produce “unstable” moments in politics, McInturff said. “And in our experience, they tend to fade away,” he continued.

A majority of voters still have negative views of the Democratic Party, and just 28% say they have positive views, essentially unchanged from a record-low rating in March. And Republicans retain strong advantages with voters on key issues including border security and crime, though Democrats have caught up on the economy.

Voters, particularly Democrats, are also fired up about the next election. Asked to rate their interest in the 2026 elections on a 10-point scale, 66% of voters responded “9” or “10” — higher interest one year out than voters registered in the weeks preceding four of the five recent midterm elections.

For Democrats, 74% rate their interest at “9” or “10,” while 67% of Republicans and 50% of independents say the same. That 7-point enthusiasm edge in the survey is on par with the 9-point enthusiasm edge Democrats enjoyed in the 2018 midterms.

All together, it’s clear Trump is shaping up to be a major factor in next year’s midterm elections, with 70% saying they want their vote to send a message about support for or opposition to the president — the highest number in NBC News polling dating back nearly 30 years. A plurality of voters (40%) say they want their vote to send a signal of opposition to Trump, while 30% say they want to send a signal of support for Trump.

The high election interest and focus on Trump also come as millions of Americans have participated in “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration. In this survey, 43% say they consider themselves supporters of the No Kings protest movement — with the group largely composed of Democrats but also including around 4 in 10 independents.

Economic warning signs

Speaking on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” last December, before he took office, Trump distilled his 2024 victory down to two key factors: “I won on the border, and I won on groceries.”

The new poll numbers show some warning signs for the president on both issues, especially the economy — as well as on a top voter issue of protecting democracy and constitutional rights, too.

On economic issues, sizable majorities of registered voters say Trump and his administration have fallen short of their expectations on the cost of living (66%), looking out for the middle class (65%) and the economy (63%), with approximately one-third saying he has lived up to their expectations.

Majorities of independents, as well as voters across ethnicities, age groups and economic circumstances, all say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy. A chunk of Republicans also agree, concentrated among those who don’t view themselves as “MAGA Republicans.”

The October 2025 results mirror NBC News’ polling in August 2010, months before midterm elections that were seen as a repudiation of President Barack Obama. At that time, two-thirds of Americans said Obama and his administration had fallen short of their expectations on the economy, as the country struggled through the aftermath of the Great Recession.

Today, 61% say that their family’s income is falling behind the cost of living, while 31% say it’s staying even and only 6% say it’s going up faster than the cost of living — about in line with NBC News polling from the last four years.

How the parties handle different issues

The poll also found voters essentially split on the question of whether Democrats or Republicans would do a better job handling the economy, with 38% backing Republicans and 37% backing Democrats.

That’s the smallest lead Republicans have had on this question in NBC News polling since December 2017, which was the last time Democrats registered an advantage. In September 2023, around the same period in the last election cycle, Republicans had a 21-point edge.

Republicans posted sizable leads on three core issues: border security (a 31-point edge over Democrats), crime (+22 points) and immigration (+18 points), maintaining key advantages they’ve enjoyed in recent elections.

Democrats have an 8-point edge on protecting constitutional rights and an 11-point edge on protecting democracy. That’s a turnaround from 2023, when Republicans had an 8-point lead on the issue of protecting constitutional rights and a 1-point edge on democracy.

And Democrats’ 23-point lead over Republicans on handling health care is tied for their highest mark on the issue since July 2008.

Divides on immigration

While Trump’s Republican Party enjoys significant advantages over Democrats on immigration-related issues, the president’s deportation program — and his administration’s tactics and use of executive power for that program and other goals — have sparked some public dissent.

A narrow majority, 51%, say that Trump has lived up to expectations on border security and immigration.

Yet 54% say that the Trump administration’s “deployment of federal agents and National Guard troops to various cities around the country to fight crime and immigration” are largely not justified, while 44% said that the deployments were justified.

The poll also tests voter sentiment about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose agents are on the front lines of the administration’s deportation program. Thirty-nine percent of registered voters view ICE positively and 50% view it negatively. White voters are split in their view of ICE, while two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters view the agency negatively.

The share that feels positively about ICE is roughly in line with previous NBC News polls from 2020 and 2018. But the share with negative views has spiked, with those who view the agency “very” negatively nearly doubling since 2020, from 22% then to 40% now.

Constitutional rights and democracy

The issues of protecting constitutional rights and democracy also show up in the poll as top concerns among voters.

The survey asked respondents to rank their most important issues, offering other choices including overall cost of living, electricity and health care costs, political violence, immigration and border security and abortion.

About a quarter of voters said that protecting democracy or constitutional rights was the single most important issue in deciding their congressional vote next year. But costs also loomed large, with 16% choosing cost of living, 10% choosing the cost of health care premiums and 4% choosing the cost of electricity.

Another 10% said immigration and border security are their top issue, while 9% said dealing with political violence and 7% said abortion.

“The fundamentals of our country and democracy, the Constitution, normally these are theoretical things that people don’t think about and take for granted. And it’s pretty clear that Americans are not taking them for granted these days, and that’s true for whether they’re Republicans, Democrats or independents,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

Fifty-two percent of voters said Trump has done more than previous presidents to undermine the U.S. Constitution than to protect it, while 31% say he’s done more to protect the Constitution.

Dim views of both parties

There are clear opportunities for Democrats in Trump’s polling struggles. But even as they hold leads over Republicans on the congressional ballot and on some key issues, the party’s overall standing hasn’t improved fromrecord lows.

Just 28% of registered voters say they have a positive view of the party, compared to 27% in March, while 53% view the party negatively. The Republican Party has higher marks: 37% view it positively and 46% view it negatively.

As in March, one big difference between the two parties — and one reason why the Democrats have lower marks overall — comes from how voters view their own parties.

Seventy-eight percent of Republicans say they view their party positively and just 8% say they view it negatively. But for Democrats, 59% view their party positively and 22% view it negatively.

Independents, meanwhile, have dim views of both parties, with less than a quarter of those voters holding positive views of either the Democratic or Republican parties.

Gaza peace efforts

The poll also tested views on one of Trump’s major foreign policy efforts: his attempts to broker peace in Gaza, where Israel and Hamas have spent two years at war.

Voters are split on Trump’s handling of the war in general: 47% approve, 48% disapprove. That’s a dramatic improvement from how voters judged then-President Joe Biden’s handling of the war, which was at 34% approval in November 2023 and 27% in April 2024.

But U.S. voters are deeply skeptical that Palestinians and Israelis will be able to form a lasting peace agreement. A previous ceasefire negotiated at the end of the Biden administration fell apart earlier this year, and Israel conducted strikes in Gaza soon after the poll concluded, with Israel and Hamas trading accusations of breaking the current ceasefire.

Just 21% say they think Palestinians and Israelis will form a lasting peace, while 69% say they won’t — as high as that number has been in five instances of this poll question stretching back to 1993. Another 10% are unsure.

When asked about whether U.S. troops should participate in any peacekeeping force in Gaza, 41% say they favor the use of those American boots on the ground while 54% disapprove.

The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251031-nbc-news-poll-dem-gop-control-2x1-cs-093e5f.jpg",N,,2025-11-02 11:01:34.299779

Contrasting ICE with Border Patrol, McNulty said, “Their mode of operation, generally, is based on targeting.
Border Patrol is based on trying to stop anybody trying to cross the border.","Cameras rolling, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino sailed down the Chicago River in a convoy of government boats. His men held rifles as videographers filmed the stunt later posted to their social media.

The Trump administration had just launched an operation in the city to pursue “the worst of the worst” criminal undocumented immigrants. Homeland Security used the footage for a music video set to Alice in Chains’ “Rooster” ending with Bovino smiling into the distance.

In Chicago, the Sept. 25 moment was widely mocked. Would the federal government be hunting migrants at Navy Pier? Boarding boat tours to find undocumented architecture enthusiasts? Patrolling the Riverwalk?

But more than a month after Bovino and the crew of camouflaged agents he calls the “green machine” arrived in Chicago to assist Trump’s immigration crackdown dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, the scene signaled a profound shift in how the federal government arrests undocumented immigrants far from the border.

Instead of carefully targeted arrests long practiced by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, President Donald Trump’s administration has deployed roving groups of masked Border Patrol agents, who work within U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These agents have roamed throughout Chicago and its suburbs with the mission of arresting as many undocumented immigrants as possible, often while camera operators film for future government promotional videos.

Allegations have mounted that Border Patrol agents under Bovino’s command are indiscriminately throwing tear gas in Chicago neighborhoods and using inappropriate force against residents during protests over the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement push, leading to a federal judge requesting Bovino to debrief her daily on his agents’ actions.

“What we’re seeing now is what the rest of the nation can expect,” said Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “This is the new model.”

Since Bovino and his agents arrived, the number of arrests has risen sharply, but so have reports of excessive force and unlawful detentions, including of U.S. citizens. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday while speaking in Gary that agents have arrested 3,000 people in the operation, which began in early September.

While the agency’s actions have generated significant legal challenges for the government and public pushback from angry residents, the Trump administration is doubling down on the approach.

Trump is reassigning at least half the top leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices around the country in a major shake-up of the agency responsible for carrying out the president’s vision for mass deportations, The Associated Press reported.

The Trump administration’s move to sack ICE middle managers around the country and potentially replace some of them with Border Patrol officials suggests White House support for the aggressive mass deportation raids.

“This is one team, one fight,” said U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “This operation is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago. ICE and Border Patrol have already arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members.”

Historically, ICE handles the government’s deportation efforts within the country’s interior while Border Patrol works along the border and ports of entry. While ICE has its own legacy of alleged human rights abuses and constitutional violations, its operations tend to be more targeted and focused, experts told the Tribune.

While ICE has its own legacy of alleged human rights abuses and constitutional violations, its operations tend to be more targeted and focused, experts told the Tribune.

Border Patrol by contrast is known for aggressive pursuits of immigrants far from the big-city spotlight, along the rural Mexican border, where drug cartels and harsh desert conditions generate danger — conditions that are in stark contrast to Chicago’s neighborhoods, where homes are adorned with Halloween decorations and schools hosting fall festivals.

The Border Patrol’s arrival in Chicago drew confusion from some residents who noted the city is hundreds of miles from Canada and more than 1,000 away from the Rio Grande. But McLaughlin says, “While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 air miles of the border, the legal framework provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act … and other laws allows them to operate anywhere in the United States.”

But unlike ICE’s once-targeted operations, Border Patrol’s arrests now appear arbitrary. Agents drive up and down residential streets and stop mostly brown people seemingly at random — landscapers, pedestrians, construction workers — demanding to know, “Where were you born?” or “Are you a U.S. citizen?”

Experts warn that this aggressive approach will likely fuel greater abuses of civil and human rights, heighten public anger and lead to more warrantless arrests, straying far from the previous stated focus on “the worst of the worst.”

For weeks, residents have reported the presence of heavily armed federal agents conducting high-profile sweeps across neighborhoods from Little Village to the western suburbs. Videos show officers in military-style gear confronting pedestrians, blocking intersections and deploying tear gas in confrontations spanning eight different neighborhoods.

Within the Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Border Patrol have a long-standing rivalry with different cultures and approaches around immigration enforcement, experts told the Tribune.

“I think of Border Patrol and ICE as two siblings that don’t always like each other,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former top official at ICE.

Border Patrol historically has a far bigger budget and a bigger staff. ICE officers often wear suits and deal more with longer-term case management, while Border Patrol are uniformed officers who often patrol dark roads in the countryside along the border.

Contrasting ICE with Border Patrol, McNulty said, “Their mode of operation, generally, is based on targeting. Border Patrol is based on trying to stop anybody trying to cross the border. It’s just a wider-net approach.”

Katherine Hawkins, a legal analyst with the Project on Government Oversight, explained more differences between ICE and Border Patrol.

“ICE officers are very on board with deporting people, but they usually do it in a certain way where it’s focused on people who have come into contact with the criminal justice system,” Hawkins said. “It tends to be focused on going after particular individuals. They might stake out someone’s house.”

But that isn’t what the Trump administration wants, Hawkins said.

“I think they’ve realized that Border Patrol gives them extra manpower and probably less pushback when they’re told to just go round up everyone,” she said.

Trump campaigned for president on a platform pledging mass deportations of immigrants while restricting future influxes into the country. How to best implement his desire is a logistical challenge due to limited detention space, manpower and constitutional safeguards that slow down government officials’ wishes.

Scott Shuchart, a former high-ranking ICE official, said immigration enforcement has always focused on a debate over how to best use the government’s manpower.

“Are the resources going to be deployed to get people who are dangerous or are they going to be deployed to get the easiest people?” Shuchart said. “I think what we’re seeing is one side finally winning that argument.”

A recent Supreme Court decision allowing agents to take the ethnic background of a person into consideration in some circumstances has cleared the way for more aggressive patrolling, Shuchart said, referring to what some are calling “Kavanaugh stops.”

In September, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around Los Angeles. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court’s emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how federal immigration agents can carry out brief stops for questioning, The Associated Press reported.

“A lot of what Border Patrol was doing was illegal until a couple months ago. It was racial profiling,” Shuchart said. “Then the Supreme Court decided racial profiling doesn’t count if they’re working-class Latinos.”

A significant part of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration revolves around using social media to claim undocumented immigrants are driving crime in big cities even though statistics show they are less likely to commit violent crimes than U.S. citizens.

Dan Herman, a former senior adviser to the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said much of the current approach favored by Bovino and the White House is more about sending a political message.

“What we are seeing is, when you put law enforcement in a role that is not what they’ve been trained or equipped or have the appropriate authorities for, you can have mistakes and improper behavior, unprofessional behavior,” Herman said. “It’s really about the theater of these things.”

Bovino himself is an example, Herman said.

In the first week of January, before Trump’s inauguration, Bovino sent 60 agents hundreds of miles to Bakersfield, California, to make 78 arrests at farms and businesses. His staff acknowledged congratulatory comments on social media and posted photos of an encounter with someone whose car window was shattered after refusing to open it, The Associated Press reported.

“He was trying to get the attention of the new administration and show he was interested in spectacle, not security,” Herman said. “I think the administration is trying to reward that attitude, and there’s a reason they’ve used him as their incident commander in these high-profile operations.”

Border Patrol’s presence has consequences far beyond the immigrants being targeted. Local restaurants and businesses in Latino areas and their neighboring communities are experiencing deep financial woes as customers stay home.

Chicago’s rapid-response volunteers, who monitor enforcement operations and document abuses, have become targets. Many have been arrested for recording agents, following agents or alerting people of federal agents in a neighborhood.

Residents have angrily confronted Border Patrol agents throughout the city in several confrontations, leading the feds to deploy tear gas in neighborhoods from working-class East Side to wealthy Lakeview.

“What immigration enforcement looks like now is not just arrests,” Tsao said. “It’s public intimidation.”

Tsao noted that U.S. citizens are not required to carry proof of citizenship, but many people of color have begun doing so anyway out of fear. “I know people who carry their passports everywhere or keep photos of them on their phones,” he said. “That’s what this climate has created.”

For Tsao and others, the concern extends beyond one city. “Chicago is showing the rest of the country what this new era of immigration enforcement looks like,” he said. “The border has come to the interior. The border has come to Chicago.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-border-patrol-chicago15_239722112.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-02 09:17:01.336159

Finucane was the War Powers Resolution lawyer at the State Department in the Obama and first Trump administrations.
In both cases, he said, the actions were considered hostilities activating the War Powers Resolution.
In the Sept. 4 notice, President Donald Trump said he was submitting it “to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.” As the deadline approaches, there is no sign that the administration is curtailing its strikes.
On Friday, Warner and other leading Democrats who focus on national security demanded that the administration brief the full Senate on the strikes.","A top Justice Department lawyer has told lawmakers that the Trump administration can continue its lethal strikes against alleged drug traffickers in Latin America — and is not bound by a decades-old law requiring Congress to give approval for ongoing hostilities.

T. Elliot Gaiser, head of the Trump administration’s Office of Legal Counsel, made his remarks to a small group of lawmakers this week amid signs that the president may be planning to escalate the military campaign in the region, including potentially hitting targets within Venezuela.

The president needs lawmakers’ approval for sustained military action under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which was passed in the wake of the Vietnam War to prevent another drawn-out, undeclared conflict.

A 60-day clock started ticking after the administration informed Congress on Sept. 4 that it had conducted a strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean two days earlier. It has followed that with other strikes and has killed dozens of people.

The 60-day window closes Monday, and until now it had been unclear what the administration would do.

Gaiser said the administration did not believe the strikes met the definition of hostilities under the law and did not intend to seek an extension of the deadline nor Congress’s approval of ongoing action, according to three people familiar with the matter, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“The administration appears to be blowing through the 60-day limit,” a senior congressional aide said.

Asked for comment, a senior administration official said the War Powers Resolution did not pertain to the current situation, because, “even at its broadest … [it] has been understood to apply to placing U.S. service-members in harm’s way.”

The official said the administration does not believe U.S. troops are in danger in the ongoing operation, so the law did not apply. “The operation comprises precise strikes conducted largely by unmanned aerial vehicles launched from naval vessels in international waters at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,” the official said in an email.

In essence, the official said, “the kinetic operations underway do not rise to the level of ‘hostilities.’”

National security experts challenged the administration’s interpretation.

“What they’re saying is anytime the president uses drones or any standoff weapon against someone who cannot shoot back, it’s not hostilities‚” said Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser to the State Department who is now a senior adviser for the U.S. program at the International Crisis Group. “It’s a wild claim of executive authority.”

If the government ignores the Monday deadline, he said, “it is usurping Congress’s authority over the use of military force.” Under the Constitution, only Congress can declare war.

Finucane was the War Powers Resolution lawyer at the State Department in the Obama and first Trump administrations. During that time, standoff strikes were carried out on Houthis in Yemen in 2016, as well as against Syrian military facilities in 2017 and 2018 in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons against civilians. In both cases, he said, the actions were considered hostilities activating the War Powers Resolution.

Both Democratic and Republican administrations over the years have “used creative interpretations of the law to skirt the deadline,” Finucane said, but they were not targeting civilians who are not at war with the United States. “When the U.S. was bombing Libya in 2011, there was an armed conflict,” he said. “That’s not the case here.”

Finucane noted that by notifying Congress on Sept. 4 that it had conducted a strike on an alleged drug smugglers’ vessel, the administration appeared to have taken the position that the strike triggered the 1973 law and that Congress’s approval would be needed to continue action beyond 60 days.

In the Sept. 4 notice, President Donald Trump said he was submitting it “to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.”

As the deadline approaches, there is no sign that the administration is curtailing its strikes. It has carried out more than a dozen strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, and has surged an array of military assets into the region.

The Navy has eight warships in the Caribbean, about 10 percent of its deployed fleet. That includes several destroyers and two amphibious ships. A submarine and a Special Operations vessel carrying helicopters also are in the region, and an aircraft carrier and several more destroyers are on the way. The military has flown helicopters and bombers close to Venezuela multiple times and moved F-35s and other aircraft to Puerto Rico.

Trump has said repeatedly that the boat strikes may expand to include targets on land, at times suggesting he may hit Venezuelan territory. “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” he said.

On Friday, however, when asked whether he was considering strikes within Venezuela, he told reporters, “No, it’s not true.”

The assertion that the administration is not bound by the War Powers Resolution or obliged to seek Congress’s permission to continue its campaign is consistent with Trump’s aggressive expansion of powers at the expense of the other two branches of government, observers said.

Separately, in a classified Office of Legal Counsel opinion, considered binding by the executive branch, the administration has argued that the strikes advance an important national interest and do not rise to the level of war under the Constitution and, therefore, do not require congressional approval, according to one U.S. official.

This week, top administration officials excluded senior Democrats when they briefed a handful of Republican senators who are considering whether to support a bipartisan measure that would block direct attacks on Venezuelan territory.

“In any normal administration, somebody would be fired for this kind of abuse,” Sen. Mark R. Warner (Virginia), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a news conference.

On Friday, Warner and other leading Democrats who focus on national security demanded that the administration brief the full Senate on the strikes.

Sen. Roger Wicker (Mississippi), the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined in a rare bipartisan rebuke the same day. He and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Jack Reed (Rhode Island), made public two letters they had sent to the Pentagon weeks before, requesting legal documents, attack orders and a list of targets. The Defense Department, they wrote, had exceeded the amount of time required by law to provide some of the materials.

House members were visibly frustrated after a separate classified briefing on Thursday, arguing that administration officials failed to answer basic questions about the legal basis and intelligence supporting the attacks. Pentagon lawyers had been scheduled to attend the meeting, multiple lawmakers said, but were abruptly pulled back without explanation.

“The administration is, I believe, doing an illegal act and anything that it can to avoid Congress,” said Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (New York), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who attended the briefing.

Several lawmakers said Thursday that the Pentagon relayed that it did not need to know the identities of those being targeted in the attacks or whether those killed had been trafficking drugs.

“What they told us is they have to show a connection to a designated terrorist organization or their affiliate, and as long as they can show that connection, they believe they are authorized to strike,” Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) said in an interview.

But such connections could be as much as “three hops away” from a known drug trafficker, Jacobs told reporters after the briefing.

Lawmakers said the military official leading the House briefing, Rear Adm. Brian Bennett, rejected Democrats’ observation that the way the administration was selecting targets resembled “signature strikes.” That is a practice the CIA used for years in Afghanistan and Pakistan when it launched drone attacks on individuals or groups whose identities were unknown but who were targeted based on a pattern of behavior or other characteristics associated with terrorist activity.

Jacobs also said that the administration privately acknowledged that cocaine was the primary drug trafficked in this part of the world — contradicting Trump’s claims that the strikes are protecting U.S. citizens from the spread of fentanyl.

“They tried to make a very convoluted argument about why cocaine was facilitating drug trafficking,” she said. “It seems to me they don’t actually understand how fentanyl works.”

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) told reporters after the briefing that he warned the administration about its expansive use of military force.

“The last word that I gave to the admiral is I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in, and the peril you are putting our troops in,” Moulton said.

In the order, the Court stated that it believes Hamdi’s legal team has raised serious questions regarding whether his detention was retaliation for protected speech under the First Amendment. The judge also indicated that some form of court-ordered protection “may be appropriate” if ICE continues to hold him. The Court ordered the government to respond and has set a hearing date.

Importantly, the Court ordered ICE not to transfer Hamdi out of California without his consent or a further court order, preserving his access to counsel and maintaining the status quo.

CAIR-CA attorneys met with Hamdi earlier this week at the Golden State Annex detention facility in McFarland, CA, and subsequently filed a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus and an Emergency Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) seeking to block his transfer and secure his release.

“This is an important first step,” said CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush. “The Court has recognized that this case raises serious constitutional concerns and has acted to ensure Sami cannot be quietly moved away from his lawyers. The fight continues for his freedom and for the protection of free speech for everyone.”

Despite a federal court ruling recognizing Souvannarath’s claim to citizenship, he is now detained in Laos.
According to the press release, when his father was naturalized and given sole custody, Souvannarath legally acquired U.S. citizenship.
Despite being a U.S. citizen, ICE detained Souvannarath at Camp 57, a detention facility inside a maximum-security prison.
Representing himself, Souvannarath filed a habeas petition with federal court seeking recognition of his U.S. citizenship and release, the press release stated.","BATON ROUGE, La. – U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has deported Chanthila Souvannarath, a man who has claimed U.S. citizenship for more than two decades. Despite a federal court ruling recognizing Souvannarath’s claim to citizenship, he is now detained in Laos.

On Oct. 23, Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana authorized a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from removing Souvannarath from the United States. Nevertheless, ICE proceeded with his deportation to Laos, according to a press release.

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand. After entering the United States before his first birthday, he obtained permanent residence. According to the press release, when his father was naturalized and given sole custody, Souvannarath legally acquired U.S. citizenship.

Despite being a U.S. citizen, ICE detained Souvannarath at Camp 57, a detention facility inside a maximum-security prison. Representing himself, Souvannarath filed a habeas petition with federal court seeking recognition of his U.S. citizenship and release, the press release stated.

“This should shock the nation,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “The deportation of an individual with a substantial claim to U.S. citizenship represents a catastrophic failure of the immigration system and a flagrant violation of constitutional rights.”

Bridget Pranzatelli, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project, emphasized the violation of judicial authority. “This should alarm everyone. Federal agencies cannot simply ignore the other branches of government. ICE—like every other federal and state enforcement agency—is bound by the orders of the court,” she said. “We call for the immediate return of Mr. Souvannarath and for ICE to be held accountable for his flagrantly illegal removal.”

The ACLU of Louisiana, RFK Human Rights, and the National Immigration Project are jointly investigating legal options to challenge ICE’s actions and secure Souvannarath’s return.
