Simmons announced today that federal prosecutors in the district filed 176 new immigration and immigration-related criminal cases from July 24 through July 31, 2025.

In one such case, Texas Department of Public Safety Troopers requested assistance from El Paso Border Patrol Agents after receiving information from a concerned citizen about an apartment possibly being used to house illegal aliens. After agents arrived at the residence to perform an investigatory inquiry, an individual later identified as Jose Alfredo MACIAS-Mendoza answered the door and the agents encountered a total of 12 individuals in the apartment. All 12 individuals stated they were in the United States illegally. It was determined that MACIAS was being paid by an organization to oversee and harbor the illegal aliens and he was charged with alien smuggling. Records reveal that MACIAS himself had previously been deported from El Paso to Mexico on April 19, 2024.

Jose REYNA-Aguilera was encountered at the El Paso County Detention Facility by a Deportation Officer assigned to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Criminal Apprehension Program. Record checks revealed that REYNA is a citizen and national of Mexico without immigration documents allowing him to remain in the United States. REYNA’s immigration records established that he had been removed from the United States to Mexico on three prior occasions and was previously convicted of illegal reentry in October 2009 and April of 2011.

Deportation Officers encountered Daniel NAVA-Morales at the El Paso County Detention Facility. Immigration records reveal that he was illegally in the country having first been removed from the U.S. to Mexico on August 4, 1998. That removal order has been re-instated 6 times with NAVA last being removed to Mexico on January 18, 2024. His criminal history includes convictions for illegal entry in 1999 and 2021, where he was sentenced to 3 years probation each time, and impersonating a United States Citizen, where he was sentenced to 11 months imprisonment in 2007. He is being charged once again with illegal reentry.

In Del Rio, Texas, Azaraias Prudencio ALVARADO-Almendarez, a Honduran national who had previously been convicted of a sex offense against a child in Florida, was charged with illegal reentry. ALVARADO has a criminal history beginning in 2007 with convictions for burglary and two “hit and runs,” one of which was a felony resulting in injury. ALVARADO has been deported 3 times, the last time being to Honduras on June 21, 2024.

El Salvadoran National Celso RIVAS-Gonzalez was arrested by Border Patrol Agents on July 26, 2025, for illegal reentry. RIVAS has two prior removals from the United States and a criminal history that includes aggravated sexual assault of a child in 2020, harassment in 2021, and felony indecency with a child - sexual contact in 2024. RIVAS has been deported twice, the last time being on February 19, 2025.

Katia Yolanda SOLANO-Alvarenga, a native and citizen of Honduras, was found 3.29 miles west of Paso Del Norte Port of Entry in El Paso, Texas without documents allowing entry or residence in the United States. SOLANO was previously deported on October 7, 2024. Additionally, SOLANO was convicted and confined for 300 days for assault causing bodily injury in Dallas Texas, on March 28, 2003.

Honduran citizen Marcos Josue BANEGAS-Castro was found at the 7300 block of Alameda Avenue in El Paso Texas. It was determined that he was in the United States illegally without immigration documents. It was further determined that BANEGAS had previously been deported to Honduras on March 14, 2025.

These cases were referred or supported by federal law enforcement partners, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ICE ERO), U.S. Border Patrol, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with additional assistance from state and local law enforcement partners.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas comprises 68 counties located in the central and western areas of Texas, encompasses nearly 93,000 square miles and an estimated population of 7.6 million people. The district includes three of the five largest cities in Texas—San Antonio, Austin and El Paso—and shares 660 miles of common border with the Republic of Mexico.

These cases are part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).

Civil rights lawyers who have monitored the cases said the move is another sign of the Trump administration’s retreat from the department’s mission of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups.

Dhillon, Trump’s appointee to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, has made no secret of her distaste for such measures.","The Trump administration has halted litigation aimed at stopping civil rights abuses of prisoners in Louisiana and mentally ill people living in South Carolina group homes.

The Biden administration filed lawsuits against the two states in December after Department of Justice investigations concluded that they had failed to fix violations despite years of warnings.

Louisiana’s prison system has kept thousands of incarcerated people behind bars for weeks, months or sometimes more than a year after they were supposed to be released, records show. And the DOJ accused South Carolina of institutionalizing thousands of people diagnosed with serious mental illnesses — sometimes for decades — rather than provide services that would allow them to live in less restricted settings, as is their right under federal law.

Federal judges temporarily suspended the lawsuits in February at the request of the states and with the support of the DOJ.

Civil rights lawyers who have monitored the cases said the move is another sign of the Trump administration’s retreat from the department’s mission of protecting the rights of vulnerable groups. Since January, President Donald Trump’s DOJ has dropped racial discrimination lawsuits, abandoned investigations of police misconduct and canceled oversight of troubled law enforcement agencies.

“This administration has been very aggressive in rolling back any kind of civil rights reforms or advancements,” said Anya Bidwell, senior attorney at the public-interest law firm Institute for Justice. “It’s unquestionably disappointing.”

The cases against Louisiana and South Carolina were brought by a unit of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division tasked with enforcing laws that guarantee religious freedom, access to reproductive health services, constitutional policing, and the rights of people in state and local institutions, including jails, prisons and health care facilities for people with disabilities.

The unit, the Special Litigation Section, has seen a dramatic reduction in lawyers since Trump took office in January. Court records show at least seven attorneys working on the lawsuits against Louisiana and South Carolina are no longer with the DOJ.

The section had more than 90 employees at the start of the year, including about 60 front-line attorneys. By June, it had about 25, including around 15 front-line lawyers, according to a source familiar with its operation. Sources said some were reassigned to other areas of the department while others quit in protest against the direction of the office under Trump, found new jobs or took early retirement.

Similar departures have been seen throughout the DOJ.

The exodus will hamper its ability to carry out essential functions, such as battling sexual harassment in housing, discrimination against disabled people, and the improper use of restraints and seclusions against students in schools, said Omar Noureldin, a former senior attorney in the Civil Rights Division and President Joe Biden appointee who left in January.

“Regardless of your political leanings, I think most people would agree these are the kind of bad situations that should be addressed by the nation’s top civil rights enforcer,” Noureldin said.

A department spokesperson declined to comment in response to questions from ProPublica about the Louisiana and South Carolina cases. Sources familiar with the lawsuits said Trump appointees have told DOJ lawyers handling the cases that they want to resolve matters out of court.

The federal government has used settlement talks in the past to hammer out consent decrees, agreements that set a list of requirements to fix civil rights violations and are overseen by an outside monitor and federal judge to ensure compliance. But Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, Trump’s appointee to run the DOJ’s civil rights division, has made no secret of her distaste for such measures.

In May, Dhillon announced she was moving to dismiss efforts to impose consent decrees on the Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis police departments. She complained that consent decrees turn local control of policing over to “unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats.”

A DOJ investigation in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer accused the department of excessive force, unjustified shootings, and discrimination against Black and Native American people. The agency issued similar findings against the Louisville Metro Police Department after the high-profile killing of Breonna Taylor, who was shot in 2020 when officers forced their way into her home to execute a search warrant.

Noureldin, now a senior vice president at the government watchdog group Common Cause, said consent decrees provide an important level of oversight by an independent judge. By contrast, out-of-court settlements can be subject to the political whims of a new administration, which can decide to drop a case or end an agreement despite evidence of continuing constitutional violations.

“When you have a consent decree or a court-enforced settlement, the Justice Department can’t unilaterally just withdraw from the agreement,” Noureldin said. “A federal judge would have to agree that the public interest is served by terminating that settlement.”

“I Lost Everything”

In the case of Louisiana, the Justice Department issued a scathing report in January 2023 about the state confining prisoners beyond their sentences. The problems dated back more than a decade and remained widespread, the report said. Between January and April 2022 alone, more than a quarter of everyone released from prison custody was held past their release dates. Of those, 24% spent an additional 90 days or more behind bars, the DOJ found.

Among those held longer than they should have been was Robert Parker, a disc jockey known as “DJ Rob” in New Orleans, where he played R&B and hip-hop music at weddings and private parties. Parker, 55, was arrested in late 2016 after violating a restraining order brought by a former girlfriend.

He was supposed to be released in October 2017, but a prison staffer mistakenly classified him as a sex offender. That meant he was required to provide prison authorities with two addresses where he could stay that complied with sex offender registry rules.

Prison documents show Parker repeatedly told authorities that he wasn’t a sex offender and pleaded to speak to the warden to clear up the mistake. But nobody acted until a deputy public defender contacted state officials months later to complain. By the time he walked out, Parker had spent 337 extra days behind bars. During that period, he said, his car was repossessed, his mother died and his reputation was ruined.

“I lost everything,” he told ProPublica in an interview from a nursing home, where he was recovering from a stroke. “I’m ready to get away from Louisiana.”

Louisiana’s detention system is complex. Unlike other jurisdictions, where the convicted are housed in state facilities, inmates in Louisiana can be held in local jails overseen by sheriffs. A major contributor to the so-called over-detentions was poor communication among Louisiana’s court clerks, sheriff’s offices and the state department of corrections, according to interviews with attorneys, depositions of state officials, and reports from state and federal reviews of the prison system.

Until recently, the agencies shared prisoner sentencing information by shuttling stacks of paperwork by van or truck from the court to the sheriff’s office for the parish holding the prisoner, then to corrections officials. The document transfers, which often crisscrossed the state, typically happened only once a week. When the records finally arrived, it could take staff a month or longer to enter the data into computers, creating more delays. In addition, staff made data errors when calculating release dates.

Two years ago, The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Parker could pursue a lawsuit against the former head of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, James LeBlanc. That lawsuit is ongoing, said Parker’s attorney, Jonathan Rhodes. LeBlanc, who resigned last year, could not be reached for comment, and his attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.

In a statement, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill acknowledged that the state’s process to determine release dates was unreliable but said the issue had been overblown by the Justice Department’s investigation, which she called “factually incorrect.”

“There were simply parts of it that are outside state control, such as clerks & courts,” Murrill stated.

Murrill said correction officials have been working with local officials to ensure prisoner releases are computed in a “timely and correct fashion.” Louisiana officials point to a new website that allows electronic sharing of information among the various agencies.

“The system has been overhauled. That has dramatically diminished, if not completely eliminated this problem,” Murrill stated. She did not address questions from ProPublica asking if prisoners were being held longer than their release dates this year.

Local attorneys who are handling lawsuits against the state expressed skepticism about Murrill’s claims.

William Most, an attorney who filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people who had been detained past their release dates, noted that as late as May 2024, 141 people who were released that month had been kept longer than they should have been, 120 of them for more than 30 days.

“I have seen no evidence suggesting the problem in Louisiana is fixed,” Most said. “And it seems unwise to dismiss any cases while that’s the situation.”

Trapped in Group Homes

South Carolina’s mentally ill population is grappling with similar challenges.

After years of lawsuits and complaints, a DOJ investigation determined that officials illegally denied community-based services — required by the Americans with Disabilities Act and a 1999 Supreme Court decision — to over 1,000 people diagnosed as seriously mentally ill. Instead, the state placed them in group homes that failed to provide adequate care and were overly restrictive, the department alleged.

The DOJ report didn’t address why the state relied so heavily on group homes. It noted that South Carolina’s own goals and plans called for increasing community-based services to help more people live independently. But the investigation concluded that the availability of community-based services varied widely across the state, leaving people in some areas with no access. And the DOJ said the state’s rules for deciding when someone could leave were too stringent.

South Carolina funds and oversees more than 400 facilities that serve people with serious mental illness, according to a state affidavit.

Kimberly Tissot, president of the disability rights group Able South Carolina, said it was common for disabled adults who were living successfully on their own to be involuntarily committed to an adult group home simply because they visited a hospital to pick up medicine.

Tissot, who has inspected hundreds of the adult facilities, said they often are roach-infested, soaked in urine, lacking in adequate medicine and staffed by untrained employees. Her description mirrors the findings of several state and independent investigations. In some group homes, patients weren’t allowed to leave or freely move around. Subsequently, their mental health would deteriorate, Tissot said.

“We have had people die in these facilities because of the conditions,” said Tissot, who worked closely with the DOJ investigators. Scores of sexual abuse incidents, assaults and deaths in such group homes have been reported to the state, according to a 2022 federal report that faulted South Carolina’s oversight.

South Carolina has been on notice about the difficulties since 2016 but didn’t make sufficient progress, the DOJ alleged in its lawsuit filed in December.

After two years of failed attempts, state lawmakers passed a law in April that consolidated services for disabled people into a new agency responsible for expanding access to home and community-based treatments and for ensuring compliance with federal laws.

South Carolina’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, has argued in the DOJ’s lawsuit that the state has been providing necessary services and has not been violating people’s constitutional rights. In January, his office asked the court for a delay in the case to give the Trump administration enough time to determine how to proceed.

His office and a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities declined to comment, citing the ongoing DOJ lawsuit.

Tissot credits the federal attention with creating a sense of urgency among state lawmakers to make improvements. While she said she is pleased with the latest progress, she warned that if the DOJ dropped the case, it would undermine the enforcement of disabled people’s civil rights and allow state abuses to continue.

“It would signal that systemic discrimination will go unchecked and embolden institutional providers to resist change,” Tissot said. “Most importantly, it abandons the people directly impacted.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2222469463-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 04:57:53.817334

According to Yoo, Bush possessed incredibly expansive emergency powers to deal with people who threatened national security.
Overall, despite how closely Trump is following the war on terror blueprint for superseding legal processes, Yoo seemed troubled by Trump’s actions.
Indeed, during the Bush administration, Yoo expressed that “no treaty” and no law by Congress could limit the president’s power.
Of course, characterizing these similarities between the Bush and Trump regimes as “superficial” is a convenient narrative for these lawyers to adopt.","After months of outrage and denouncements from judges, lawmakers, and the general public, 252 Venezuelans sent from the U.S. to a prison in El Salvador have finally been released. For six months, those imprisoned at El Salvador’s notorious Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT) were denied core human rights, including the right to due process. Former prisoners said they were subject to cruel and inhumane treatment, including state-sanctioned torture. Though Trump has taken the denial of due process to a further extent than recent administrations, he is justifying his deportation strategy using legal frameworks established by the George W. Bush administration during the so-called “war on terror.”

In May, NPR interviewed Berkeley law professor John Yoo about President Donald Trump’s decision to send deportees to CECOT. The decision to specifically interview Yoo was, of course, significant. As Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel during the George W. Bush presidential administration, Yoo authored a series of legal opinions now infamously known as the Torture Memos. These memos facilitated the Bush administration’s program of torture and indefinite detention during the war on terror by arguing for its legality. According to Yoo, Bush possessed incredibly expansive emergency powers to deal with people who threatened national security. Such people were not protected by the Geneva Conventions, and if they were sent to the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, they had no access to habeas corpus rights and could be imprisoned indefinitely without trial.

As Ailsa Chang, the host of Yoo’s recent NPR interview, pointed out, these arguments are eerily similar to Trump’s policy against people his administration is sending to CECOT. In fact, one of Trump’s first moves towards accelerating deportations was to expand the migrant detention center in Guantánamo, taking advantage of the site’s legal isolation that Yoo constructed for the purposes of waging an all-out “war on terror.” As Chang notes, Trump also used the Alien Enemies Act to justify expanded presidential power to remove supposedly “dangerous” people from the country and imprison them indefinitely with no legal recourse. Members of the Trump administration also say they’re looking into suspending habeas corpus altogether, with Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem going so far as to incorrectly define habeas corpus as “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country.”

Despite the obvious similarities between the two presidents’ actions, Yoo claimed in his interview that these connections are “superficial,” and that what Trump is doing cannot be compared to Bush’s war on terror. Yoo said that he himself was arguing for expanded presidential powers as strictly wartime measures, while Trump is falsely claiming the pretense of a “war” against violent gang members. Yoo also claimed that, in his memos, he never denied anyone who set foot in the U.S. their habeas corpus rights, only those who were captured abroad. Trump, on the other hand, has deported people on U.S. soil with no due process.

Overall, despite how closely Trump is following the war on terror blueprint for superseding legal processes, Yoo seemed troubled by Trump’s actions. “I think the circumstances and the context of what we’re talking about after 9/11 and this are very different,” he said.

Yoo is not the only U.S. official who has distanced himself from Trump’s ever-expanding presidential power despite contributing to such an interpretation. Take Alberto Gonzales, who served as Bush’s Attorney General and supported Yoo’s legal interpretations. The Republican has openly criticized Trump as “the most serious threat to the rule of law in a generation,” and opted to support Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. In an interview with PBS discussing the danger of Trump’s push against the rule of law, interviewer Amna Nawaz, like Chang with Yoo, pointed out the parallel between Trump and Bush’s “abuse of executive power” that Gonzales enabled. In response, Gonzales argued that the differentiating factor was Trump’s habit of “surrounding himself with loyalists” who give him the answer he wants to hear, as though the Torture Memos did not serve the same purpose.

Indeed, even in trying to mark this difference, Gonzales could not deny the similarities were still present, saying, “I was very loyal to President Bush.” He could only distinguish between the Trump and Bush legal teams using a character assessment: “Nonetheless, hopefully, you have lawyers in place that make a good faith attempt to interpret the law and are honest with the president saying, ‘You don’t have the authority to do this.’”

Jack Goldsmith, who served as Assistant Attorney General for Bush, similarly distinguishes between Trump and Bush’s legal approaches with claims of good faith interpretation on Bush’s side. While he did admit in a May op-ed in the New York Times that Trump’s “claims of untouchable national security authority echo arguments made after the Sept. 11 attacks by George W. Bush’s administration,” the difference Goldsmith identified in another piece is that the Office of Legal Counsel, which he, Yoo, and Gonzales worked with, “has been basically set aside and the White House is interpreting law.”

Notably, however, Goldsmith also distinguishes the Trump administration by claiming “the basic rule appears to be if the president wants to do something, it’s lawful.” Again, while the extent may be greater than the Bush administration’s, the idea that Bush’s legal team did not craft the arguments to serve him best politically is seriously flawed and misleading at best. This was acknowledged by some of Bush’s lawyers themselves. During the formation of the war on terror legal framework, one legal advisor warned Yoo of the “desire to identify legal authority establishing the right of the United States to treat the members of the Taliban Militia in the way it thinks best” rather than the way the law permits. Indeed, during the Bush administration, Yoo expressed that “no treaty” and no law by Congress could limit the president’s power. Contrary to Yoo’s recent claim that he never denied anyone who set foot in the U.S. their habeas corpus rights, this included indefinite detention and torture of even U.S. citizens arrested on U.S. territory, such as Jose Padilla.

Of course, characterizing these similarities between the Bush and Trump regimes as “superficial” is a convenient narrative for these lawyers to adopt. Whether these lawyers are being intentionally misleading or truly believe their own words, the reality is that the war on terror’s legal framework, the very one they built, serves as the foundation of Trump’s deportation strategy. While the differences are noteworthy, they should not distract from this fact, but serve to demonstrate how Trump’s legal framework built on Bush’s to push presidential power and further suppress habeas corpus rights.

The very fact that Trump is exploiting Guantánamo’s legally unique nature, the one Yoo and Gonzales contributed to creating, demonstrates this reality. So does the Trump administration’s declaration of several gangs and cartels as terrorist organizations. The war on terror model of indefinite detention with no due process rests on the narrative of keeping the country safe from terrorists. As Yoo argued in the Torture Memos, once a person was determined to be affiliated with a certain organization, that person was not protected under international human rights law nor were they eligible for a U.S. trial. Of course, once an organization is recognized as a terrorist group, the accusation of affiliation that spurns an arrest does not necessarily need to be true. This was certainly the case in Guantánamo, where many people were swept in simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. It remains true in the Trump era, where simply having a tattoo landed people in CECOT. Now that those allegations of torture are coming in from former CECOT prisoners, the parallels only become more impossible to deny.

By classifying these similarities as “superficial” and distancing themselves from Trump by claiming that the Bush administration’s legal framework was made in good faith, Bush’s former legal team once again avoids accountability for the harm they have caused. The fact that they may disagree with Trump’s application of the war on terror model does not negate the fact that these men are significantly responsible for constructing it. The combination of expansive presidential emergency power, securitization of certain classes of people, and the denial of their human rights is a powerful force in the hands of a leader who wants to imprison people without interference. It is exactly the power that Bush’s lawyers helped put in his hands, and now, Trump has seized it as well.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2162696368-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 04:58:29.651793

The Federal Correction Institution at Leavenworth is one of two places in Kansas where Immigration and Customs Enforcement can detain people long term, and the coalition wrote to the prison warden in June about unsanitary, inequitable and unhealthy conditions.

Warden Crystal Carter wrote in a June 20 response letter that the prison had eliminated medical fees, added law library resources that ICE failed to provide, implemented new recreation hours and expanded Spanish-language communications.

But concerns about lockdowns and adequate phone call time remain, said Kyle Virgien, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.

“We see a lot of problems across ICE’s detention network,” Virgien said. “Detention is difficult. It rips people from their communities. It isolates them from their families. This is a constant.”

Virgien began speaking with people inside Leavenworth in April and continues to monitor conditions.

What he heard was troubling, he said.

The coalition wrote in a pair of letters in May that detained immigrants faced unsanitary and crowded living quarters, extended lockdowns, delayed and costly medical treatment, restricted contact with their families, and no access to religious services.

Some had attempted suicide, the letter said.

Carter, the warden, said things have changed.

After reviewing its procedures, the prison eliminated a $2 fee that people in ICE custody were charged for certain health visits. Staff were told to stop those charges and reverse all previous ones. To boost access for medical services, the prison created request slips written in Spanish for ICE detainees, Carter said. However, it is unclear how quickly officials respond to Spanish medical requests.

Carter said capacity concerns did not exist at the time of writing, and, according to the coalition, people inside have said what once were crowded cells have become less so.

According to July data from ICE, estimating average daily populations from the past year, about 35 people are held daily in Leavenworth for immigration reasons. Most pose little to no threat, according to ICE threat level classifications. On average, around 21 people were associated with criminal cases, and 12 were not. All are male and stay an average of 25 days.

During those 25 days, people in ICE custody now are afforded at least one hour of outdoor recreation time daily and a maximum of 300 minutes of phone calls per month, with no call lasting longer than 15 minutes.

People in ICE custody at Leavenworth are subject to the rules and policies of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which oversees operations. Some of the rules and policies are a departure from typical conditions in ICE detention facilities, Virgien said.

He has heard stories of mistreatment from guards and retaliatory lockdowns that punish many for the actions of few, he said. Lockdowns mean people are in cells for 23 hours a day and must “pack all of their life tasks into that one hour outside the cell,” Virgien said, which can include recreation, showers, legal research, religious practices and phone calls.

Carter said one instance of a lockdown has occurred in Leavenworth’s ICE detention unit for 72 hours, and another more than eight hours.

“Except for the limited and infrequent instances, all ICE detainees have time outside of their cell each day and have access to exercise, the electronic law library and phone systems,” Carter said.

The people ICE detains in Leavenworth are imprisoned alongside people awaiting criminal trials or serving criminal sentences.

Benjamin O’Cone, a spokesman for the bureau, said in an emailed statement that it’s the mission of the bureau and Leavenworth to “operate facilities that are safe, secure and humane.”

“We take seriously our duty to protect the individuals entrusted in our custody, as well as maintaining the safety of our employees and the community,” O’Cone said. “Humane treatment of the men and women in our custody is a top priority.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment. ICE also has not responded to the coalition’s letter, according to ACLU of Kansas spokeswoman Esmie Tseng.

Virgien said the coalition is glad the prison addressed some of the issues they raised, but concerns remain.

“Many of the people at the facility have already won their immigration cases, and ICE is still detaining them,” Virgien said.

The coalition believes ICE should release people as soon as their immigration cases are won.

In at least one case, an immigration judge determined a man could not return to his country of origin without risking torture. Others include people who have spoken out against authoritarian governments in their countries of origin or fled persecution. Some have young children. Many have come from Chicago, and a small number from Kentucky, Virgien said.

When asked about the possibility of pursuing legal action, Virgien said, “all options are on the table.”

Now, with major Congressional budget increases for ICE, Virgien fears problems will only multiply.

Congress approved more than $175 billion for ICE in its most recent budget bill, making it what the Brennan Center for Justice classified as the largest federal law enforcement agency. The funds expand ICE’s ability to bring people into custody while capping the number of immigration judges in the country.

Also in Leavenworth, private prison company CoreCivic is battling the city government to reopen a shuttered prison to use as its Midwest Regional Reception Center, which would detain as many as 1,000 people. A judge temporarily blocked the company in July from housing people at its facility until the matter is worked out in court.

Earlier this month, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against Zwinck, alleging that he had violated Colorado laws limiting cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities.","Five sheriff's deputies from Colorado are being disciplined after a college student spent two weeks in a federal immigration detention center last month after a routine traffic stop.

An administrative review concluded that Sheriff’s Deputy Alexander Zwinck shared information on a Signal group chat that included federal immigration agents after he had pulled over Caroline Dias-Goncalves, 19, a student at the University of Utah, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell said in a statement Wednesday.

The agents then used that information to track Dias-Goncalves down and arrest her. She was taken to a detention facility in Aurora, where she was held for 15 days before being released on bond.

""The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office should not have had any role in the chain of events leading to Miss Dias-Goncalves’s detention,"" Rowell said.

Colorado law restricts coordination between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities. It prohibits state and local law enforcement from providing information about a person's immigration status to federal officials or disclosing personal identifying information to immigration authorities.

""I regret that this occurred. I apologize to Miss Dias-Goncalves,"" Rowell said.

Zwinck pulled Dias-Goncalves over while she was driving on Interstate 70 outside Loma on June 5. Zwinck claimed Dias-Goncalves was driving too close to a semi-truck.

The traffic stop lasted about 20 minutes and Zwinck released Dias-Goncalves with a warning. Shortly after she exited the highway, federal immigration agents stopped her, arrested her and took her to the Aurora detention facility, where she was held until June 20.

Born in Brazil and raised in Utah since she was 7, Dias-Goncalves is one of nearly 2.5 million people living in the United States known as “Dreamers,” young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Dias-Goncalves arrived on a visa that expired over a decade ago and has a pending asylum case.

In interviews conducted as part of the review, Zwinck claimed he did not know he was violating any laws or policies when he shared Dias-Goncalves' information and location with federal authorities in a group chat meant to discuss drug crackdown efforts.

According to the review's findings, Zwinck was involved in at least four other incidents last month in which the information he shared on the group chat following his traffic stops led to federal immigration enforcement actions.

Zwinck also told investigators that he had received and read two department-wide emails from the sheriff's office last year and in January, both outlining how deputies should interact with immigration authorities.

The review concluded there was “a preponderance of evidence” showing that Zwinck as well as Sheriff’s Deputy Erik Olson, who was on the group chat, and their supervisor, Sgt. Joe LeMoine, “acted outside of agency policy.”

Zwinck was placed on unpaid administrative leave for three weeks and Olson for two. Both will be reassigned to patrol. LeMoine was suspended without pay for two days.

Lt. David Holdren, LeMoine's supervisor, received a letter of reprimand and Holdren's supervisor, Capt. Curtis Brammer, was provided documented counseling.

Earlier this month, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit against Zwinck, alleging that he had violated Colorado laws limiting cooperation between local and federal immigration authorities.

Rowell said the lawsuit ""sends a demoralizing message to law enforcement officers across Colorado"" and urged Weiser to ""apply the law equally to all law enforcement and government officials instead of making Deputy Zwinck an example.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250616-Caroline-Dias-Goncalves-vl-548p-b8f924.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 09:59:00.679198

It’s not a good look.” Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, confirmed in an email that Ms. Clouatre had been released from ICE custody.
She did not comment on what role, if any, Mr. Kennedy’s office had played in the case.","After nearly two months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Paola Clouatre, 25, secured her release from a Louisiana detention center this week following an intervention from an unlikely source: a Republican lawmaker who has allied himself with President Trump.

Officials who work in the office of Senator John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, requested that the Department of Homeland Security release Ms. Clouatre from detention after an immigration judge halted her deportation order, according to emails reviewed by The New York Times.

Ms. Clouatre, a Mexican citizen, had been detained by ICE agents on May 27 while she was at a routine appointment in New Orleans related to her application for a green card and permanent resident status.

Ms. Clouatre first entered the United States as a teenager to seek asylum with her mother and brother. The family was processed at the border in Tijuana, according to Ms. Clouatre and her lawyer, and was granted parole, which allows migrants to remain temporarily in the country. In 2018, Ms. Clouatre’s mother failed to show up for a court hearing in California, leading a judge to issue a deportation order against Ms. Clouatre.

Ms. Clouatre’s apprehension came amid growing pressure from the White House to ramp up arrests to fulfill Mr. Trump’s pledge of mass deportations. ICE agents have raided farms, swept through factories and targeted immigration courthouses across the country, in some cases arresting immigrants as they attend routine hearings.

Mr. Kennedy, the junior Louisiana senator, has been a vocal supporter of these efforts, appearing on conservative radio shows and cable television to decry sanctuary cities and applaud ICE agents’ enforcement.

“If you’re in our country illegally, you’re a criminal,” Mr. Kennedy said during a July 17 Fox News interview. “Illegal immigration is illegal, duh.”

So the Clouatres were surprised to learn that people in his office were fighting to reunite their family.

In an email on Tuesday morning, Christy Tate, the constituent services representative in Mr. Kennedy’s office, wrote to Mr. Clouatre to confirm that his wife had been released from ICE custody after her office had made a formal request to the federal agency.

“I am so happy for you and your family,” Ms. Tate wrote. “We will continue to keep you, your family and others that are experiencing the same issues in our prayers.”

Ms. Tate did not respond to phone calls or emails, and representatives of Mr. Kennedy’s office did not reply to a request for comment from The Times.

Ms. Clouatre was released from a north Louisiana detention center on Monday and is back home with her family in Baton Rouge. She is wearing an ankle monitor and awaits a court date to continue immigration proceedings. Her lawyer, Carey Holliday, said she was likely to obtain a green card.

Mr. Holliday said he had contacted Mr. Kennedy’s office in June to tell staff members there about the family’s case and to ask for their support. He said he believed ICE had eventually released Ms. Clouatre because of mounting public pressure from sources including Mr. Kennedy’s office.

“It’s a very compelling case,” Mr. Holliday said. “This is someone who honorably served his country, was honorably discharged, and now the government wants to take his wife away. It’s not a good look.”

ICE wants to make immigration enforcement as efficient as FedEx or Amazon. Louisiana was poised for this moment. Since the beginning of the second Trump administration, more than 21,000 people taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have passed through the Alexandria detention facility. More deportation flights have taken off from there than from any other place in the United States, and more domestic ICE flights have passed through there than anywhere else, according to a widely cited database of ICE flights.

Punished for Playing by the Rules: the Deliberate Cruelty of Trump’s Deportation Regime

The overwhelming majority of immigrants whose cases are winding through the immigration court system show up for their hearings, believing that by adhering to the system’s labyrinthine requirements they’ll be rewarded with clearance to stay in the country. Or at least the chance to fight another day. But under President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation regime, abiding by the immigration system’s rules has become increasingly dangerous. Those who show up in court now routinely face arrest. But failure to appear for a hearing generally triggers a deportation order, attorneys explained.

U.S. Highlighted on International Human Rights Watchlist for ‘Sustained Attacks on Civil Freedoms’ Under Trump

The U.S. has again been highlighted on a watchlist maintained by global alliance CIVICUS to draw attention to serious concerns regarding the exercise of civic liberties in various countries, with the organization pointing to “sustained attacks on civil freedoms” in the first six months of President Donald Trump’s second term.

It is a financial cost that is often passed on to families and loved ones, and is especially harmful for Black families.

The governor’s team in a statement also echoed moderate Democrats’ concerns about its scope.
“I’m not critical of the why, it’s the how,” said Kathryn Barger, a moderate Republican, during the meeting.","“People wearing ski masks are grabbing people, throwing them into unmarked cars and sending them to Alligator Alcatraz or El Salvador or Libya,” said California state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored a bill to ban certain kinds of face coverings for law enforcement. “It’s really terrifying, and there should be a deep, broad-based movement to put a stop to this kind of fascist secret police.”

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security called the efforts “repulsive messaging bills that stoke dangerous anti-ICE rhetoric for cheap political points and fundraising emails” in a statement to POLITICO, adding that federal officers “clearly identify themselves as law enforcement” and need the masks to shield themselves from violence and online harassment.

Even in California, which is dominated by a Democratic supermajority, lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom aren’t entirely sold on Wiener’s anti-mask bill. That’s due in large part to opposition from powerful state and local law enforcement lobby groups, whose members resent being lumped in with federal immigration officials and questions about its legality.

Newsom has slammed federal agents’ use of face coverings — but also publicly questioned whether the state can regulate federal law enforcement. The governor’s team in a statement also echoed moderate Democrats’ concerns about its scope.

“This is a critical issue facing our communities,” said Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a Newsom spokesperson. “Consistent with the Governor’s direction, we want to ensure the bill doesn’t disrupt the important work of state and local law enforcement, which doesn’t involve immigration operations.”

In Los Angeles County, one member of the Board of Supervisors questioned how such an ordinance would be enforced as her colleagues voted to take the first step toward drafting anti-mask rules.

“I’m not critical of the why, it’s the how,” said Kathryn Barger, a moderate Republican, during the meeting.

Janice Hahn, the supervisor who put forward the proposal, acknowledged its legality “may be decided in court.”

“This is the time for our vulnerable residents — and whether or not it gives them a false sense of security — they need to know that their government is paying attention … that we have the courage of our convictions to stand up and say, ‘When you’re in our county, this is how we expect you to behave as a law enforcement official,’” Hahn said.

I see following Trump 100 percent of the time.” In response, Steil lauded Trump’s executive orders and deportations.
When asked again why the president is going it alone, Steil referenced an ongoing legal battle over whether Trump needs Congress’ blessing.
Retired AFSCME union staff member and current organizer Mary Burpee of Elkhorn saw the town hall differently.
So people are frustrated.” Days before Thursday’s town hall, Burpee was part of a mock funeral procession that included a cardboard coffin left at the front door of Steil’s home in Janesville, which made national news Wednesday evening.","Republican U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil was met by a hostile crowd attempting to shout him down Thursday evening during his first town hall gathering since the passage of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

Some supporters left early calling the spectacle “disgusting,” while one Democratic activist said the Janesville Republican “got what he deserved” for being a rubber stamp for Trump and the GOP.

The Elkhorn High School auditorium was filled with around 200 people, some of whom carried signs with slogans like “Resist,” “God is King no Others” and “Hands off SSI and Medicare.” When he entered the stage, Steil was met a by a roar of boos mixed with some cheers from a smaller group of his supporters.

The town hall was raucous as the audience repeatedly overpowered Steil’s microphone. He paused often while urging the crowd to stay civil and allow him to answer a series of questions out of respect to those who asked them.

The questions touched on a wide range of issues from federal funding for cancer research, Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs being enacted without congressional approval and the immigration arrests by masked ICE agents “disappearing” people.

One attendee questioned the morality of deportation raids during Trump’s second term.

“What I see happening to our immigrant population embarrasses me, horrifies me, and you have not raised your voice to complain about it,” she told Steil. “I see no leadership. I see following Trump 100 percent of the time.”

In response, Steil lauded Trump’s executive orders and deportations.

“What I see as moral hazard was created by (former President Joe) Biden by allowing the U.S.-Mexico border to remain unsecure,” Steil said, as he was drowned out by a roar of boos that lasted roughly 10 seconds.

“I think we need to secure the U.S.-Mexico border,” Steil continued after the crowd quieted. “You may not. It’s fine that we disagree.”

On tariffs, a man from Elkhorn said he was always under the impression that Congress must be involved, which was met with loud cheers. He then asked “what dire economic circumstances” put Trump in a position to issue them without congressional approval.

Steil didn’t get into specifics about the role of Congress, but said the overall goal of the Trump administration is “to make sure that other countries are treating the United States fairly.” He called China an “egregious abuser” of U.S. trade policies across multiple administrations. When asked again why the president is going it alone, Steil referenced an ongoing legal battle over whether Trump needs Congress’ blessing.

The shouting, the boos and overall chaos was too much for Walworth County resident Carol Stanczak who walked out of the auditorium about halfway through the question-and-answer session. She told WPR she came to have questions answered, but Steil was “road blocked by people screaming and hollering.”

“You know, I don’t know if these people are paid to come in here and be jerks,” Stanczak said. “This is not the American way. Let the man speak!”

She said Steil is a good leader who is committed to and concerned about his constituents. She said the audience’s behavior only strengthened her support.

“I’ll fight harder,” Stanczak said.

Another Steil supporter, Kevin Roblee of Lake Geneva, stood at the back of the auditorium and occasionally shouted at the crowd to let Steil answer questions. He said Walworth County is “a conservative county, and this is the fist time I’ve ever seen this kind of rhetoric coming out of the audience.” He said the dialogue “seems to be against Trump, rather than what Bryan Steil is doing in Congress, which is much more important and relevant.”

“This has nothing to do with Bryan Steil or his efforts in Congress, and that’s why I’m upset,” Roblee said.

Retired AFSCME union staff member and current organizer Mary Burpee of Elkhorn saw the town hall differently. She said she wasn’t surprised to see the anger leveled at Steil because constituents like her have been “demanding” he hold an in-person town hall “for many months, almost a year now.”

“Normally, I would be of the persuasion that there should be some decorum that, you know, let your representative speak,” Burpee said. “But I think he deserved this today, and I say that because he’s given the middle finger to his constituents for so long. And I think the passage of that horrible, big, beautiful bull**** bill has got people so angry, and it’s already passed. So people are frustrated.”

Days before Thursday’s town hall, Burpee was part of a mock funeral procession that included a cardboard coffin left at the front door of Steil’s home in Janesville, which made national news Wednesday evening. She said the coffin represented the “death of democracy,” and was in no way meant as a threat against Steil or his family.

Susan Chandler, who chairs the Democratic Party of Wisconsin’s 1st Congressional District delegation, also stood by Steil’s opponents who shouted during the town hall and said “people had a right to express their emotions.”

“I don’t feel he answered a single question that was presented to him,” Chandler said. “He was slick and polished, and it’s time for him to go.”

After the town hall concluded and the audience filed to their vehicles, a homemade “No Kings” sign was left hanging on the entrance to the Elkhorn High School auditorium.

Steil represents one of just two competitive congressional districts in Wisconsin, though he has won previous races comfortably and currently has a large fundraising edge in the early stages of this campaign cycle.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/steil-town-hall-main-scaled-e1754020484238.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 09:58:11.747259

“We see the law firms, bowing to pressure, bending to bullies, instead of staying rooted in justice of the law,” Biden said.
The gala is not the first speaking engagement of the summer that Biden has used to take aim at current US President Donald Trump.
Earlier this month, Biden delivered a keynote address at the Society for Human Resource Management conference in San Diego.
While Biden heaped praise on former vice-president Kamala Harris during his speech, he did not reference his decision to step down mid-election.","Former United States President Joe Biden took the stage at the National Bar Association’s 100th Annual Awards Gala in Chicago to deliver remarks honoring the United States civil rights legacy, and the state of the country.

Speaking amid continual scrutiny around his physical and mental health, Biden played up the importance of a strong judicial branch, and characterized the US as at a moment in time that “makes us confront hard truths.”

“So many of you have fought to make this country live up to its highest ideals,” Biden said. “Not since the tumultuous days of the 1960s has this fight been so existential to who we are as a nation, with marginalized groups so dramatically under attack.”

Founded in 1925, the National Bar Association is the largest and oldest network of law professors, judges, and lawyers in the US. Biden’s speech focused heavily on the contributions of Black lawyers to America’s civil rights history, and the need to continue that legacy, in light of an administration that he said “seeks to erase history, erase quality, erase justice itself.

“We see the apparent glee of some of our politicians while watching immigrants who are in this country legally torn from the arms of their family, dragged away in handcuffs from the only home they’ve ever known,” Biden said. “My friends, we need to face the hard truths of this administration.”

Law firms representing those opposing the Trump administration’s agenda have been targeted with executive orders by the administration. Some have capitulated to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Federal judges, increasingly on the receiving end of harsh rhetoric and threats to their safety, have weighed creating their own security forces.

“We see the law firms, bowing to pressure, bending to bullies, instead of staying rooted in justice of the law,” Biden said.

The gala is not the first speaking engagement of the summer that Biden has used to take aim at current US President Donald Trump. In June, he offered oblique criticism of the Trump administration during a Juneteenth celebration service at the Reedy Chapel AME Church, one of the places in Texas where an order proclaiming the end of slavery was read on 19 June 1865.

Earlier this month, Biden delivered a keynote address at the Society for Human Resource Management conference in San Diego. During a question and answer session, Biden said he was “working like hell” to finish a memoir of his presidency as he contends with his prostate cancer diagnosis.

In his book, a reflection of the 46th president’s four years in office, Biden will probably attempt to shape his legacy – and to confront questions about his mental health and physical fitness that clouded his final years in office and ultimately forced to end his bid for re-election.

While Biden heaped praise on former vice-president Kamala Harris during his speech, he did not reference his decision to step down mid-election.

In sporadic public appearances since leaving the White House, Biden has hit back against new reporting that alleges a “cover up” by the then-president’s closest aides to hide his frailty and decline from an American public who polls showed believed he was too old to serve another four years.

Biden’s speech did not directly address these allegations, although he did note his two of his claims to fame in US politics – being the youngest person ever elected to the US Senate, and the oldest person elected to the presidency.

The White House and congressional Republicans have amplified the claims, opening investigations into whether Biden was in control when he made a series of notable clemency decisions at the end of his presidency. In an interview with the New York Times this month, Biden said he orally authorized every pardon and commutation issued during his term and called Republicans who said his staff abused the presidential autopen “liars”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298355f2b81a39fbbd36d479921aec990e7dfbd1/546_0_5463_4372/master/5463.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8ce67f0d1dcd41852ee9f0a971a8b9c9",N,,2025-08-01 10:57:12.187831

Temporary Protected Status is a protection that can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing them from being deported and allowing them to work. The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It is part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem can extend Temporary Protected Status to immigrants in the U.S. if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.

The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.

The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end Aug. 5 while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the U.S. for more than 25 years were set to expire Sept. 8.

U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is Nov. 18.

In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment and health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of Temporary Protection Status for people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4 billion loss to the economy.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said.

Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus.

Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have made perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.”

“Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote.

The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.

“They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday.

Honduran Foreign Minister Javier Bu Soto said via the social platform X that the ruling was “good news.”

“The decision recognizes that the petitioners are looking to exercise their right to live in freedom and without fear while the litigation plays out,” the country’s top diplomat wrote. He said the government would continue supporting Hondurans in the United States through its consular network.

Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife, co-President Rosario Murillo, have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago.

In February, a panel of U.N. experts warned the Nicaraguan government had dismantled the last remaining checks and balances and was “systematically executing a strategy to cement total control of the country through severe human rights violations.”

In its crackdown on immigration, the Trump administration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the U.S. on a temporary basis.

The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.

The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.

“It is not meant to be permanent,” Justice Department attorney William Weiland said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250721-kristi-noem-vl-327p-ccf605.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 10:57:16.772067

Administrative Processing Is a Temporary “Refusal” Under INA §221(g) Administrative processing occurs when a visa cannot be issued at the time of the interview.
Not All Administrative Processing Is the Same There are several distinct categories: 221(g) Document Requests: Applicants receive a written request for missing evidence; must respond within one year.
Updates and Communication Are Limited: Be Patient and Strategic Visa applicants and lawyers should not submit inquiries until at least 180 days have passed post-interview, unless an emergency exists.
Key Takeaway: Administrative processing is not a final visa denial but often causes significant delays.","Administrative processing remains one of the most misunderstood causes of visa delays. The following five key points summarize recent guidance from AILA’s DOS Liaison Committee (Practice Pointer, July 30, 2025) and offer essential insight for clients and attorneys.

1. Administrative Processing Is a Temporary “Refusal” Under INA §221(g)

Administrative processing occurs when a visa cannot be issued at the time of the interview. While it is not a final denial, the case is technically refused under INA §221(g) until the applicant satisfies additional requirements (e.g., submitting documents or awaiting internal checks). The CEAC system will display the status as “Refused”, even though the visa may ultimately be issued.

2. Common Triggers Include Missing Documents, Security Clearances, and Watchlist “Hits”

The most frequent causes of administrative processing include:

Missing documents (e.g., police or court records)

Interagency security checks (name matches, Technology Alert List reviews)

Nationality-based or sensitive occupation reviews

Biometric or biographic matches to security databases

Officers may also request Form DS-5535 for certain applicants, which gathers additional biographic data.

3. Not All Administrative Processing Is the Same

There are several distinct categories:

221(g) Document Requests: Applicants receive a written request for missing evidence; must respond within one year.

Security Clearance Cases: These are internal agency checks, requiring no applicant action; duration varies.

Waiver-Dependent Refusals (INA §212(a)): Applicants found inadmissible may need to await lengthy adjudication of waivers—sometimes up to 2–3 years for immigrant visas.

4. Updates and Communication Are Limited: Be Patient and Strategic

Visa applicants and lawyers should not submit inquiries until at least 180 days have passed post-interview, unless an emergency exists.

After 180 days: use the consulate’s contact method, follow up every 30 days.

Consider congressional liaison support in urgent or humanitarian cases.

Refiling a new visa application does not expedite processing and may worsen delays.

5. Litigation May Be a Last Resort

If a case remains stalled after months (or years), a writ of mandamus in federal court may compel a decision. This requires careful legal analysis and is best handled by experienced litigation counsel.

Please contact us via email at VISALAW@Wolfsdorf.com if you seeking to litigate a past due case must be at least 6 months and in most cases armless 12 months to be credible.

Key Takeaway: Administrative processing is not a final visa denial but often causes significant delays. Understanding the process, managing expectations, and following appropriate follow-up protocols are crucial for achieving resolution.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his lawyers have frequently asked the court to intervene when lower courts have blocked executive actions on issues such as his hard-line immigration policies and efforts to fire federal employees.

The cases are brought on an emergency basis, through the court's so-called ""shadow docket,"" and the court often decides them quickly, mostly in favor of the government, without full briefings or oral arguments, and sometimes with little or no explanation.

But Kavanaugh, speaking at a conference attended by judges and lawyers in Kansas City, said the court takes the cases seriously and has made efforts to give them the attention they deserve.

Kavanaugh conceded that it is ""not a trivial question"" whether a president's policy can go into effect while litigation continues, but he added that the court does not want to signal that what is a preliminary assessment of the legal merits is the final word on the issue.

""Because of the importance of those questions, we have been, I think, doing more and more process to try to get the right answer on those preliminary assessments,"" he said.

He mentioned, for example, that the Supreme Court heard oral arguments and issued a lengthy ruling when it narrowed injunctions that had blocked Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship.

He also cited cases involving Covid-19 vaccines that arose during the Biden administration in which the court heard arguments before issuing a decision.

""I think we've written a lot more than we have in the past,"" Kavanaugh said.

With judges facing tough scrutiny, especially in the face of harsh criticism from Trump and his allies when they rule against him, Kavanaugh thanked the judges in the room for their role in protecting the rule of law.

""So I come to you all with great respect for ... what we all do to preserve what I think is the crown jewel of our constitutional democracy, which is the independence of the judiciary,"" he said.

But, he added, as a judge ""you have to recognize and have thick skin and know that criticism comes with the territory.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250731-brett-Kavanaugh-vl-1242p-e691aa.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 10:57:45.615414

Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails.
... Law enforcement has always been a calling.
This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is newly flush with billions from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” spending legislation and under pressure to rapidly hire 10,000 new agents. But one tactic it recently tried to do that hiring — aggressively recruiting new agents from some of its most trusted local law enforcement partners — may have alienated some of the leaders it needs to help execute what the Trump administration wants to be the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.

“We’re their force multipliers, and this is the thanks we get for helping them do their job?” Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd said in an interview. Judd said he’s not happy about a recruitment email ICE’s deputy director sent to hundreds of his deputies, and he blamed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees ICE.

“Kristi Noem needs to get on her big girl pants and do what’s right. She needs to make sure that there’s an apology,” said Judd, who also made it clear that he wants to “support President Trump’s mission.”

NBC News spoke to local law enforcement leaders in four states whose agencies participate in ICE’s 287(g) program, under which local officers are deputized to help in immigration enforcement, and whose deputies ICE targeted for recruitment.

The recruitment email, sent this week, appears to have targeted law enforcement officers whose agencies participate in the 287(g) program.

The email, which NBC News has obtained, reads, in part: “As someone who is currently supporting ICE through the 287(g) program, you understand the unique responsibility we carry in protecting our communities and upholding federal law. Your experience in state or local law enforcement brings invaluable insight and skills to this mission —qualities we need now more than ever.”

The email also touts potential $50,000 signing bonuses as an incentive for joining ICE, and it links to a government recruitment website featuring an image of Uncle Sam, the headline “AMERICA NEEDS YOU” and the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayment beyond the signing bonuses.

“ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership,” the Pinellas County, Florida, Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

The sheriff in Pinellas County is a Republican, as is Judd.

“It was bad judgment that will cause an erosion of a relationship that has been improving of late. And it’s going to take some getting over, and it’s going to take leadership at DHS to really take stock, ’cause, hey, they need state and locals,” Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said in an interview.

Thompson said the association has heard from more than a dozen law enforcement agencies about the recruitment emails. He also said that the group has not heard from DHS since the emails were flagged to the association and that he intends to send a “very stern note” to ICE.

“This is inappropriate behavior of a partner organization,” Thompson said. “We’re all on the same boat. And you just don’t treat friends or partners like this.”

One Florida police chief who did not want to be named out of concern that his department could face retaliation said departments that have partnered with the federal government now fear they could lose their best officers.

“Now you know why everybody’s so pissed,” the chief said.

“This is like the transfer portal in college sports,” the chief said, adding: “We see people leave us because they believe they can make more money at other locations. ... Law enforcement has always been a calling. Now it’s a job.”

The DHS media office did not respond to questions about local law enforcement concerns but provided NBC News with a statement that it attributed to a senior DHS official: “ICE is recruiting law enforcement, veterans, and other patriots who want to serve their country. ... This includes local law enforcement, veterans, and our 287(g) partners who have already been trained and have valuable law enforcement experience. Additionally, more than $500 million from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill will go to increasing our 287(g) partnerships with state and local law enforcement.”

The sheriff’s office in Forsyth County, Georgia, told NBC News that the Atlanta ICE office “sent an apology” for the recruitment email.

Not all sheriffs are upset with the recruitment effort. In fact, some say they support it.

Thaddeus Cleveland, the sheriff of Terrell County, Texas, said, “I think if someone wants to better their life, better their career, you know, look towards the long years, the long game, retirement, there’s nothing better than the U.S. government to go out and have a successful career.”

Cleveland, who has just four deputies, admits he cannot compete with the $50,000 bonuses the agency is offering.

“We may not be able to turn around and hire somebody the next day. It may take a few weeks. It may take a few months. But again, I support, you know, someone wanting to pursue something they’re interested in. I may end up having to work a little more, which is OK.”

Goliad County, Texas, Sheriff Roy Boyd also said he is not upset about the recruitment and noted that his office also has to deal with the state’s recruiting new troopers from his department.

“We can’t compete with the salaries of the state and the feds,” he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-01/250128-ice-ch-1119-9937a1.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 09:59:25.760510

PPI says that from January 20 to June 26, almost half of all ICE arrests involved people who were detained at a local jail, typically accused of minor offenses, such as driving without a license.

“Jails and police departments play a key role in criminalizing immigration by detaining people until ICE agents can make an arrest,” the group says.

The level of cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents greatly varies. Some states or cities prohibit law enforcement from sharing information or coordinating with ICE. However, hundreds of law enforcement agencies are part of the federal 287(g) program which deputizes state and local officers to act as immigration agents. The number of participating agencies has skyrocketed under Trump. As of June 30, 875 law enforcement agencies had joined the program, up from 135 in December of 2024.

In addition to feeding people into the deportation system, local jails also lease beds to ICE, the U.S. Marshals Service, or both. PPI found that in 25 states, the only bed space available to ICE or the U.S. Marshals Service is in local jails. While sanctuary city policies generally bar cooperation with ICE, they often permit contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service, which, under Trump, plays a critical role in detaining thousands of immigrants. The U.S. Marshals Service has contracts with almost 1,000 jails, according to PPI.

PPI says that from January through June, federal prosecutors charged thousands of people with criminal immigration offenses. This led to the pretrial detention of almost 20,000 people. For criminal immigration charges, the U.S. Marshals Service, not ICE, would be responsible for the person’s incarceration, thereby circumventing local jurisdictions’ bans on cooperating with ICE.

“ICE and other federal agencies can refer people for federal prosecution on immigration-related ‘crimes’ and thus use contracted local jails in sanctuary cities, counties, and states,” the report says. “In doing so, the Trump administration is transforming what are normally civil immigration matters into more serious federal crimes. This shift hides the true scale of immigrant detention from public view, which is often reported as only those in ICE custody and does not include those facing criminal prosecution.”

According to PPI, people detained pretrial on criminal immigration charges, as well as those held on ICE detainers or in overnight hold rooms, are not included in ICE detention data, which recorded about 57,000 people held on average in June. However, PPI estimates that more than 80,000 people are detained in the “crimmigration system.”

His government has pledged tougher action on smuggling networks, with Starmer vowing to “smash the gangs” responsible for transporting people across the Channel.
“Almost 900 people crossed the Channel yesterday, meaning 25,000 people, mainly young men, have crossed the Channel this year.
[And] 2025 is the worst year on record so far, and the Labour Government are doing nothing to stop the crossings,” said Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp.
Radical right Reform UK leader Nigel Farage echoed those criticisms, writing on social media: “898 illegals crossed the English Channel yesterday.","More than 25,000 people have crossed the English Channel into the United Kingdom so far this year, marking the fastest pace of arrivals since records began in 2018 and piling pressure on the UK’s Labour government as anti-immigration sentiment is stoked by the political right wing.

Figures released on Thursday show that nearly 900 refugees and migrants made the crossing in 13 small boats on Wednesday alone, bringing the total number of arrivals in 2025 to 25,436. It’s a perilous journey that has resulted in dozens of deaths over the years.

The milestone is likely to intensify political scrutiny over Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s handling of undocumented migration. His government has pledged tougher action on smuggling networks, with Starmer vowing to “smash the gangs” responsible for transporting people across the Channel.

Opposition politicians have seized on the latest numbers to criticise Labour’s approach.

“Almost 900 people crossed the Channel yesterday, meaning 25,000 people, mainly young men, have crossed the Channel this year. [And] 2025 is the worst year on record so far, and the Labour Government are doing nothing to stop the crossings,” said Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp.

He added: “Their 17 in, one out deal with France will not even make a dent – it would take 10 years for [Home Secretary] Yvette Cooper to deport the illegal immigrants that have arrived since the start of this year alone under her so-called deal, which still hasn’t started.”

Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced “one in, one out” returns of asylum seekers earlier this month. The pilot programme sets out that for every person returned, a different individual would be allowed “to come here via a safe route: controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, Starmer said at the time.

Philp also reiterated his party’s proposal to immediately detain and deport new arrivals, warning that continued legal challenges under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) could force a Conservative government to consider withdrawing from it, a threat they have often made in and around the Brexit years when the party was in government.

Radical right Reform UK leader Nigel Farage echoed those criticisms, writing on social media: “898 illegals crossed the English Channel yesterday. This means more hotels, more costs and more people who should not be here. The public have had ENOUGH!”

A series of violent far-right demonstrations have been held recently outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, north of London.

Meanwhile, United States President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a hardline anti-immigration platform and has been executing it during his second term with raids and deportations of immigrants, recently praised the UK government’s efforts, saying it was “doing a fantastic thing” by addressing the issue, though he admitted knowing “nothing about the boats”.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10960318-1689674914.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-08-01 10:57:26.216698

As the Trump Administration indiscriminately targets all immigrants, rather than focusing on violent criminals, including arresting lawful permanent residents and those here with legal protections, Padilla pushed for Republicans to finally come together to protect DACA recipients by passing the Dream Act.
Padilla emphasized that Republicans continue to voice support for the Dream Act behind closed doors and vowed to keep fighting to secure permanent protections for DACA recipients.
Key Excerpts: “Colleagues, it feels like every single day the Trump Administration finds new ways to defy the rule of law.
Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants with pathways to citizenship or permanent legal residence.","Padilla: “This mass detention and deportation operation will go down in our history as a stain, a dark chapter in our nation’s history, an outrageous moral failure, intentionally caused by this Administration.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last night, U.S. Senator Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, took to the Senate floor to defend Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients from the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) baseless statement that “illegal aliens who claim to be recipients of DACA are not automatically protected from deportations.” Padilla slammed the Trump Administration’s push for DACA recipients to “self-deport,” emphasizing that these long-term residents, who were brought to the country as children, have been working, studying, and living legally in the United States since 2012 and are vital members of American communities.

He highlighted the story of Javier Diaz Santana, a deaf 32-year-old DACA recipient who was arrested while at the Los Angeles car wash where he has worked hard six days a week for the last five years. Masked immigration officials carrying weapons raided the Temple City car wash, confiscating his ID and handcuffing him, preventing him from communicating. Despite having no criminal record and living in the United States since he was five years old, Javier was taken to El Paso, Texas where he faced the risk of deportation.

As the Trump Administration indiscriminately targets all immigrants, rather than focusing on violent criminals, including arresting lawful permanent residents and those here with legal protections, Padilla pushed for Republicans to finally come together to protect DACA recipients by passing the Dream Act. Padilla emphasized that Republicans continue to voice support for the Dream Act behind closed doors and vowed to keep fighting to secure permanent protections for DACA recipients. He also blasted the Administration for scapegoating hardworking immigrants and using cruel immigration enforcement as spectacles to distract from their failing policy agenda.

Key Excerpts:

“Colleagues, it feels like every single day the Trump Administration finds new ways to defy the rule of law. They will tear families apart, decimate local businesses, and deceive the public in order to distract from their own failures and scandals. And nowhere has this been clearer than in their cruelty towards immigrants.”

“If it was just deportation operations focused on dangerous violent criminals, there would be no discussion, there would be no debate, there would be no disagreement. But that’s not what this Administration is doing. They are going after all immigrants. The vast majority of those that have been arrested and detained and many of those deported, many without due process before being deported, are not convicted criminals.”

“The Trump Administration is saying that these young adults who were brought to the United States as children and who have lived here, who have studied here, and who have worked here legally — let me emphasize that: worked here, studied here, lived here legally — since the year 2012, thanks to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, this Administration is saying now that they have no right to be here, that they could be deported, or maybe should be deported at a moment’s notice, or worse, that they should choose to leave their families and their communities for countries that they’ve never known.”

“The whole point of DACA is protection from deportation because these are not criminals or some danger to society. These are young people who have lived in the United States for as long as they can remember. These are young adults who, as kids, were on your little league team or in your Girl Scout troop. For God’s sake, they’re part of our communities, and they’re young adults who have now grown up to be lawyers, to be doctors, to be teachers, and who have more love for everything that this country stands for than anyone threatening them in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.”

“This week, the Trump Administration is now telling them that they should be arrested and thrown out of the only home they’ve ever known in an attempt to satisfy Donald Trump’s quest for political points or an arbitrary quota. To the Trump Administration, let me say this: you cannot claim to love our country at the same time you’re trying to destroy our future.”

“Don’t tell me the Trump Administration is following the law when we hear cases like this, and don’t tell me that the Administration is only targeting dangerous, violent criminals because the data proves otherwise. … For as tragic and as heartbreaking as Javier’s story is, he’s not alone. There have been more and more stories of DACA recipients being arrested and detained, and the fear is just growing across communities.”

“One thing is certain: this mass detention and deportation operation will go down in our history as a stain, a dark chapter in our nation’s history, an outrageous moral failure, intentionally caused by this Administration. Because for all the tough talk, this is not just politics as usual. In fact, when the Dream Act was first introduced over 20 years ago, it was bipartisan, and it enjoyed bipartisan support for most of the last 20 years, and even today, polling shows an overwhelming majority of the American public supports DACA recipients. Yes, both Republicans and Democrats across the country.”

“Make no mistake, Americans will not soon forget what this Administration is doing to their neighbors — to their neighbors, to their co-workers, to their friends. Now, this story doesn’t end the way you think it might, because we will continue fighting, not just to stop these outrageous arrests, but we will not rest until we enact real and permanent protections for DACA recipients who contribute so much to our country.”

Video of Senator Padilla’s floor speech is available here.

Senator Padilla is a leading voice in Congress for providing long-term undocumented immigrants with pathways to citizenship or permanent legal residence. Last week, Padilla hosted a press conference in Los Angeles alongside immigration advocates, impacted families, and community leaders to announce legislation to expand a pathway to lawful permanent residency for millions of long-term U.S. residents. As Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and mass deportation assaults intensified in Los Angeles, Padilla marked the 13th anniversary of the DACA policy by urging Congress to take immediate action to deliver permanent protections for millions of families, parents, and individuals who are increasingly at risk amid President Trump’s mass deportation agenda. He also delivered remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the anniversary, pushing for permanent protections for Dreamers rather than the indiscriminate ICE raids stoking fear in Los Angeles communities.

Regardless of what decision the judges’ deliberations bring, the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose taxes — including tariffs — but over decades, lawmakers have ceded power over trade policy to the White House.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Appellate court judges expressed broad skepticism Thursday over President Donald Trump’s legal rationale for his most expansive round of tariffs.

Members of the 11-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington appeared unconvinced by the Trump administration’s insistence that the president could impose tariffs without congressional approval, and it hammered its invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to do so.

“IEEPA doesn’t even mention the word ‘tariffs’ anywhere,” Circuit Judge Jimmie Reyna said, in a sign of the panel’s incredulity to a government attorney’s arguments.

Brett Shumate, the attorney representing the Trump administration, acknowledged in the 99-minute hearing “no president has ever read IEEPA this way” but contended it was nonetheless lawful.

The 1977 law, signed by President Jimmy Carter, allows the president to seize assets and block transactions during a national emergency. It was first used during the Iran hostage crisis and has since been invoked for a range of global unrest, from the 9/11 attacks to the Syrian civil war.

Trump says the country’s trade deficit is so serious that it likewise qualifies for the law’s protection.

In sharp exchanges with Shumate, appellate judges questioned that contention, asking whether the law extended to tariffs at all and, if so, whether the levies matched the threat the administration identified.

“If the president says there’s a problem with our military readiness,” Chief Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore posited, “and he puts a 20% tax on coffee, that doesn’t seem to necessarily deal with (it).”

Shumate said Congress’ passage of IEEPA gave the president “broad and flexible” power to respond to an emergency, but that “the president is not asking for unbounded authority.”

But an attorney for the plaintiffs, Neal Katyal, characterized Trump’s maneuver as a “breathtaking” power grab that amounted to saying “the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants so long as he declares an emergency.”

No ruling was issued from the bench. Regardless of what decision the judges’ deliberations bring, the case is widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

Trump weighed in on the case on his Truth Social platform, posting: “To all of my great lawyers who have fought so hard to save our Country, good luck in America’s big case today. If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE “DEAD,” WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS. Thank you for your attention to this matter!’'

In filings in the case, the Trump administration insists that “a national emergency exists” necessitating its trade policy. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade, a specialized federal court in New York, was unconvinced, however, ruling in May that Trump exceeded his powers.

The issue now rests with the appeals judges.

The challenge strikes at just one batch of import taxes from an administration that has unleashed a bevy of them and could be poised to unveil more on Friday.

The case centers on Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs of April 2 that imposed new levies on nearly every country. But it doesn’t cover other tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, nor ones imposed on China during Trump’s first term, and continued by President Joe Biden.

The case is one of at least seven lawsuits charging that Trump overstepped his authority through the use of tariffs on other nations. The plaintiffs include 12 U.S. states and five businesses, including a wine importer, a company selling pipes and plumbing goods, and a maker of fishing gear.

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose taxes — including tariffs — but over decades, lawmakers have ceded power over trade policy to the White House.

Trump has made the most of the power vacuum, raising the average U.S. tariff to more than 18%, the highest rate since 1934, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.

The attorney general for one of the states suing Trump sounded confident after the hearing, arguing that the judges “didn’t buy’’ the Trump administration’s arguments. “You would definitely rather be in our shoes going forward,’’ Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said.

Rayfield said that Trump’s tariffs — which are paid by importers in the United States who often try to pass along the higher costs to their customers — amount to one of the largest tax increases in American history. “This was done all by one human being sitting in the Oval Office,” he said.

NBC Washington first reported on attorneys’ concerns about the increased presence of immigration officers at the courthouse.
“This type of ICE presence in and around the courthouse has never been like this,” said Butorac, who’s served as a public defender in Fairfax for over two decades.
The sheriff’s office, meanwhile, said it doesn’t assist ICE in making arrests, and that there hasn’t been a change to department policy.

Dawn Butorac, the county’s chief public defender, said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been “coming to the courthouse to arrest people when they show up for their court cases.” It appeared to be happening more frequently last week, she said, and they’ve been making arrests inside for about the last month.

NBC Washington first reported on attorneys’ concerns about the increased presence of immigration officers at the courthouse.

“This type of ICE presence in and around the courthouse has never been like this,” said Butorac, who’s served as a public defender in Fairfax for over two decades.

In some cases, the officers wait outside the nearby jail for when people are released on bond, Butorac said. But they’re also appearing “when they know people might have court cases — that could be traffic infractions, that could be traffic cases, it could be felony charges, and they’re showing up to arrest people.”

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Fairfax County Sheriff’s Office said the department is aware ICE made two arrests inside the courthouse on July 21. The agency doesn’t keep records of when and where immigration officials make arrests, the statement said, but “to our knowledge, these are the only arrests that have occurred inside of the courthouse building by ICE.”

Until July 21, the statement said, ICE would generally make arrests outside of the courthouse.

Butorac said sheriff deputies have been escorting ICE agents through the courthouse to specific courtrooms in order to help them find people they want to arrest.

“This actively assisting, walking through the courthouse with them, being with them when things are happening, that is new and shouldn’t be happening,” Butorac said.

The sheriff’s office, meanwhile, said it doesn’t assist ICE in making arrests, and that there hasn’t been a change to department policy.

The increased ICE presence, Butorac said, “adds a layer of making people afraid to come to court, and that includes everyone. That includes not only the people who are looking to have their cases resolved, but also people who might be victims of crimes. They might not want to come to court. People might not want to report crimes because they’re afraid of all law enforcement.”

The agents making the arrests, she said, haven’t displayed a warrant before taking people into custody. There have also been cases in which people have told officers they’re in the U.S. legally and have been charged with but not convicted of a crime, “which would be the thing that then would take away their status, and (their cases are) not being finished, and they very likely could never be resolved,” she said.

The circumstances, Butorac said, are creating a “due process problem.”

Attorneys are more aware and monitoring whether immigration officials are in the courthouse and are frustrated because, “We all have a stake in the system running fairly, and everybody’s matter being resolved and they’re not getting done.”

In the case of clients, Butorac said anecdotally, “You just see the fear that our clients have, and the greater risk they’re taking when making decisions about how to resolve their case.”

The announcement, made in a city where three-fourths of residents are foreign-born, was greeted with thunderous applause as Trump said his next administration was going to root out undocumented criminals.

But under the current Trump administration, the idea of who is considered a “criminal” has broadened to include all undocumented people. ICE raids and arrests of undocumented immigrants, regardless of their criminal history, have ignited fear and anger from Hispanic communities across the country, a diverse voting bloc Trump made inroads with in 2024.

In Florida, the governor was quick to assist the president make the leap from “bad hombres” to anyone without papers. In February, at the first meeting of his State Board of Immigration meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said, “If you are here illegally that is a crime too, OK? You can’t just say you have free range to be here illegally until you commit some type of felony. I want you out before you commit the felony.”

The sweeping characterization of undocumented immigrants as criminals, even those that are trying to follow the rules, is changing attitudes about President Trump’s response to what he once called an “invasion.” In South Florida, large groups of immigrants who had Temporary Protected Status or asylum cases pending saw themselves suddenly categorized as “criminals” after the Trump administration ended their statuses. Recent national polling shows Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration while a local survey shows that some of South Florida’s Venezuelan immigrants are feeling disillusioned. The pendulum swing now even has South Florida Republican elected officials finding themselves in a precarious situation: stay loyal to Trump’s agenda or answer to their immigrant voter base.

“There’s this huge upsurge of sentiment that this is a country of immigrants, that these immigrants are not all bad,” said Eduardo Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University. “And that even those who are being deported should be treated in a more humane way.”

‘Everyone is basically at risk’

Fort Lauderdale immigration attorney Mark Hamburger told the Miami Herald that under previous presidential administrations there was an understanding that migrants who commit serious crimes should be prioritized for deportation over undocumented people with clean records and families in the country that depend on them. “There is no line anymore. Everyone is basically at risk,” Hamburger said.

“Trump wants to group all immigrants into this category of criminals, but that’s just not true,” he said. “I’m sure they’d love to say, ‘They’re all criminals, they all have records.’ But they don’t even say that anymore. Now, what the press secretary says is, ‘Well, they’re here unlawfully and that in itself is a crime, so we’re detaining anyone who’s here unlawfully.’”

By targeting undocumented people in general, Hamburger said, the Trump administration has overwhelmed the court system and stoked fear, ultimately to push immigrants to self-deport.

One of Hamburger’s clients was a woman from Nicaragua who came to the United States in 2022 seeking political asylum, which her sister and cousin were able to secure. She had been living in Los Angeles, but was feeling paranoid amid the ICE raids and anti-ICE protests.

Hamburger called her before her trial, which was finally set for last month. She was noticeably nervous over the phone and hung up. When he called back, she confessed: “I’m in Honduras right now.”

Though she had a strong political asylum case, Hamburger said, the stress was making her sick. She gave up on her case and left the country.

“I have many other cases like that where people are just slowly putting up the white flag,” Hamburger said. “The chaos, the psychological torture, it reaches a certain point for immigrants where it starts to manifest physically as illness. And some people, ultimately, just give up.”

Americans soften on immigration

As U.S. Rep. María Elvira Salazar of Miami pitched the Dignity Act to the American public — and Trump himself — Salazar reiterated a crucial point that undoubtedly resonates with her constituents in Miami: not all undocumented immigrants are criminals.

“Yes, they broke the law, but someone gave them a job because they needed those workers, workers who are still needed today,” she said.

The bill would grant undocumented immigrants living in the country for more than five years with no criminal record a legal status that protects them from deportation. While its passage remains unlikely in a polarized Congress, it marks a notable attempt by Salazar to distance herself from the full scope of Trump’s immigration crackdown..

The timing is notable. A growing body of polling shows that the public mood is shifting — and fast.

A July 11 Gallup poll found that Americans are becoming more positive about immigration, reversing four years of rising concern. In June 2024, 55 percent of respondents wanted immigration reduced. By July 2025, that number dropped to just 30 percent. Among Hispanic voters, Trump’s approval on immigration now sits at 21 percent, well below his national average.

A separate CBS News poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s administration is targeting “people who aren’t dangerous criminals” for deportation — and that his second-term policies have gone further than many voters expected.

What’s behind this big change in public opinion?

“A lot of it has to do with overreach,” said Mike Madrid, a Republican political commentator and expert on Latino voters. Many are critical of the Trump administration for circumventing due process and sending military vehicles to cities like Los Angeles, Madrid said. Americans have also been inundated with harrowing anecdotes in the news and on social media of undocumented immigrants being detained by ICE and separated from their families, likely adding to the unpopularity of Trump’s policies.

In Miami, ICE agents in plain clothes have arrested immigrants as they walked out of immigration courtrooms. In a New York Times report published in June, a reporter watched as ICE officers in Miami arrested an undocumented man they were looking for, along with his brother who happened to be with him.

“[Trump’s] numbers are still very strong with Republicans. I think the vast majority of Republicans did vote for this and like it, and frankly, think he probably could still be more aggressive,” Madrid said. “But the voters that he needs to get to a majority — young voters, Hispanic voters, independents — they have fled in pretty historic numbers. The collapse is pretty spectacular, especially given a very short time frame.”

Immigration attorneys across the country are hustling to help clients who have been swept up in the crackdown despite having no criminal history. Hamburger said most of his clients either have no criminal history or have been charged with misdemeanors, the most common being driving without a license. Two clients of his were arrested while fishing without a license, he said. Now, they’re in Alligator Alcatraz, the state-run immigration detention facility built in the Everglades where detainees reportedly face harsh and disgusting conditions.

Hundreds of detainees who earlier this month were held in Alligator Alcatraz or scheduled to be sent there had no criminal convictions or pending charges in the United States, the Herald reported this month.

‘They didn’t vote for this’

Salazar, who represents a diverse swath of Miami-Dade County with large populations of Cubans, Haitians, Caribbeans, Colombians and Venezuelans, is “in a bind,” said Gamarra, the FIU professor. While Gamarra said the Dignity Act bill is unlikely to pass, “it helps her public stance.”

Salazar will have to answer to that large constituency in the mid-terms, though Gamara said it’s too early to tell exactly how Latino voters in Miami will respond to South Florida Republicans.

But there are some notable trends emerging. An FIU survey Gamarra conducted in May among Venezuelans in Florida showed real disillusionment among a third of Trump voters with his administration’s immigration policy, particularly the ending of Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole.

“I can tell you from looking at the Venezuelan data that there is a degree of sentiment, very deeply held sentiment, that they were betrayed, that they didn’t vote for this,” Gamarra said. “They thought it was going to only be criminals because they made that distinction that ‘we’re not criminals.’ But they didn’t anticipate the broader definition of ‘criminal’ behavior that the administration has adopted.”

In the meantime, Madrid said he has noticed “fascinating” shifts occurring in different Latino communities in response to Trump’s policies.

For the first time in his career, Madrid said he is seeing the Cuban American community respond to this moment the same way the Mexican American community is, despite their very different histories in the United States and typical political beliefs. He recalled attending a recent press conference where Cuban and Venezuelan community leaders called on FIFA to protect attendees from ICE the way the Dodgers’ did in Los Angeles.

Mounting evidence shows the Trump administration’s weaponization of data analysis to target immigrants for detention and deportation moving forward rapidly. Continued advancements in AI technology are aiding in this effort.

The ongoing erosion of digital privacy this entails could soon allow the administration to not only expand its war on immigrants but also more efficiently target political enemies.

Central to the Trump administration’s strategy is exploitation of loopholes in the Privacy Act, whereby the mere allegation of criminality is enough to erode even U.S. citizens’ privacy protection.

Protections under the Privacy Act only apply to U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, leaving undocumented immigrants particularly vulnerable. However, even U.S. citizens’ privacy protection evaporates if it is alleged that they are under investigation, as is the case for two former Trump aides accused by the President of treason for criticisms they leveled during and since his first term.

More worrisome is the judicial deference to administration claims that its enemies are “being investigated,” without evidence that an actual investigation is under way or has any basis.

In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a request from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for access to Social Security Administration data on the grounds that it was “investigating” fraud and waste.

The court’s three liberals dissented in the ruling, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writing that the ruling’s “emergency” justification was based solely on the fact that the court “cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out.” (Lawsuits challenging DOGE’s request had been pending.)

Such a pretext, Jackson added, “has traditionally been insufficient to justify the kind of extraordinary intervention the Government seeks.”

Meanwhile, the adoption of military intelligence technology—developed, in part, on “kill chain” analytic work by Palantir Technologies—to sift through this newly available data means the government can now do so more accurately and at cost.

Such battlefield data analysis approaches are already being used to improve the ability of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to target, detain and deport immigrants. In April, DHS awarded Palantir a $30 million contract to improve its existing Investigation Management System to better target immigrants for detention.

“Palantir software is already configured to support the ICE mission and environment,” DHS noted in announcing the contract.

Juan Sebastian Pinto, a former employee of Palantir Technologies now deeply concerned about the company’s violation of its’ initial principles for ethical data analysis, explains how the process works.

“In AI-enabled military operations today, the first phases of the kill chain—finding and fixing—focus on data collection and sensor input to identify and categorize subjects as targets, threats or non-targets,” writes Pinto on his Substack page.

“This type of categorization, known as ‘fixing’ in a military context, allows corporations to mark individuals for targeted action.”

For authoritarian regimes, these targeting algorithms—which are continually being refined with new AI technology—can be applied to any government-defined group of perceived enemies, immigrant or otherwise, with staggering efficiency and for pennies on the dollar.

As might be expected, ICE (Immigrations and Custom Enforcement) and CBP (Customs and Border Protection) have long used their own administrative data when determining, for example, where to conduct a workplace raid. The challenge is that the information could be out of date, missing or ambiguous (e.g., multiple individuals with the same name).

Organizations such as Palantir—with sophisticated data analysis drawing from multiple datasets—can do a better job of determining where a particular “target” can be found. And, thanks to an earlier Executive Order, “Stopping Waste, Fraud and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,” signed in March, the number of data sets available have expanded significantly. They include the following:

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Social Security Administration (SSA)

U.S. Education Department

U.S. Postal Service

An inevitable consequence of such record sharing is that information provided by mixed-status households—where one or more family members is undocumented—for securing services such as SNAP for eligible U.S. citizen children provide indicators of immigration status that would allow an undocumented parent to be targeted.

Access to a particular individual’s data in many such cases provides access to data on their entire households, some of whom might become “collateral damage” when the data record is used for targeting detention.

Similarly, algorithms developed by Palantir experts could incorporate “indicators” such as ESL enrollment or medical treatment requiring an interpreter that do not definitively reflect citizenship/legal status but could be used in building AI-driven models for targeting.

In principle, each agency would ordinarily deny access to records with individuals’ personally identifying information as required by the Privacy Act. In today’s context, with the Trump administration clawing away at the firewalls that once guaranteed our privacy, such assumptions are anything but certain.

In our current information-rich environment, the outcome of the ongoing war over access to data will be as important or, arguably, more important than increased funding for in-the-field detentions by ICE or CBP, whose authority has now been extended nationwide.

Unfortunately, traditional judicial deference to the executive branch, premised on the assumption that the government objective is better governance, is no longer justified. All that can be hoped for at this point is a groundswell of public pressure for integrity in government and commitment to the rule of law.",https://fresnoalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/KillChain_web.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 10:57:56.914928

Appeals court will decide - Scripps News,"Jacob Gardenswartz, www.scrippsnews.com, jacob-gardenswartz",,,,,https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/the-president/are-trumps-sweeping-reciprocal-tariffs-legal-appeals-court-will-decide,"A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments Thursday about the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda, just one day before higher reciprocal tariff rates on dozens of nations around the world were set to take effect once again.
The appeals court adjourned Thursday morning after roughly an hour-and-a-half of arguments without issuing a ruling, and gave no indication as to when their decision might come.
Many — but not all — of Trump’s many tariff announcements rely on IEEPA for legal justification.
I mean, you heard justices referring to footnotes in pages of an opinion from 1975 for heaven's sake,” Katyal said.
“As officers of the court, as people who care deeply about the Constitution, it's just gratifying to be part of that process.”","A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., heard arguments Thursday about the legality of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff agenda, just one day before higher reciprocal tariff rates on dozens of nations around the world were set to take effect once again.

The 11 justices on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had tough questions for attorneys on both sides of the dispute, though they appeared inclined to agree with the lower Court of International Trade’s ruling earlier this year that Trump overstepped his legal authority in imposing the tariffs.

A coalition of five small businesses that import goods from overseas as well as a group of 12 Democratic-led states filed challenges to the tariffs, with both cases consolidated upon appeal. The appeals court adjourned Thursday morning after roughly an hour-and-a-half of arguments without issuing a ruling, and gave no indication as to when their decision might come.

At issue in the case is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that gives the president broad powers to “regulate” international commerce during times of national emergency, specifically grants him the power to impose tariffs on foreign imports.

Many — but not all — of Trump’s many tariff announcements rely on IEEPA for legal justification. Attorneys in Thursday’s arguments highlighted the reciprocal tariffs, aimed at remedying trade imbalances with nations around the world, as well as those intended to curb the spread of fentanyl and other illicit opiates.

The Department of Justice, represented Thursday by assistant attorney general Brett Shumate, argued for broad presidential powers and suggested the authority to impose tariffs was tacitly implied in the law due to the context in which it was passed.

“Congress has long given the president broad discretion to deal with complex and evolving national emergencies in light of his preeminent role in foreign affairs and national security,” Shumate said in his opening remarks.

Lawyers representing the small business and Democratic states, conversely, noted the law makes no mention of tariffs — and suggested even if the justices were to agree with the Trump administration that it did impart a presidential emergency tariff power, the manner in which Trump is employing it should not be allowed to stand.

The Trump administration’s argument amounts to “a breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years, and the consequences are staggering,” argued Neal Katyal, the former solicitor general of the U.S. under President Barack Obama who’s now representing the small businesses in this case.

Even if the Justice Department can convince the justices that IEEPA gives the president powers to impose tariffs, it must also prove that the president is using them within the bounds of the law — which includes several limitations on the president’s emergency powers.

Specifically, the president’s actions must result from an emergency that is “unusual and extraordinary” — something the plaintiffs lawyers argue is not the case, given that the trade imbalances Trump highlighted have persisted for decades.

The Department of Justice lawyers counter that while the trade deficits may be longstanding, their impacts on domestic manufacturing contribute to the “extraordinary” situation the president identified in his emergency declaration.

The Trump administration must also prove in court that Trump’s tariffs “deal with” such a threat — something critics of the tariff policy have argued is not the case, pointing, for example, to Trump’s newly-announced tariff on Brazil — a nation with which the U.S. maintains a trade surplus.

During a briefing with reporters following the hearing, the lawyers for the small businesses that sued suggested the case was tantamount to a referendum on the American system of separation of powers.

“Our founders fought a war about this stuff,” Katyal noted. “This was not some minor thing, going into the unsuspecting night. This was about as major as it gets.”

The lawyers declined to speculate as to when the justices might rule or how they’d do so, though they heaped praise on the officials for their preparation.

“They were incredibly well prepared. I mean, you heard justices referring to footnotes in pages of an opinion from 1975 for heaven's sake,” Katyal said. “As officers of the court, as people who care deeply about the Constitution, it's just gratifying to be part of that process.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4da29ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5293x2779+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff4%2Fee%2Fe4f5c4934bf8bc372ba23a769c38%2Fap25190611553823.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 10:58:07.612674

Today, let’s meditate on another wasteland—the United States Senate—a wasteland which humorously flatters itself the greatest deliberative body in the world.

All Senate Republicans save two—Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski—this week voted to confirm Emil Bove III to a lifetime appointment on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

All Senate Republicans save these two voted to do this despite three separate whistleblowers coming forward to allege that Bove had engaged in outrageous behavior in his current role at the Justice Department.

All Senate Republicans save two voted to do this without bothering to hear from the whistleblowers—none of whom were called to testify concerning their allegations.

All Senate Republicans save two apparently didn’t care that Bove ordered a major corruption case dropped in what Justice Department attorneys regarded as a quid pro quo deal with New York Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for policy support on immigration enforcement.

All Senate Republicans save two apparently didn’t care that Bove informed Justice Department lawyers that a planned mass deportation to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act would go forward “no matter what,” which is to say irrespective of litigation or court orders.

All Senate Republicans save two apparently didn’t care that Bove allegedly informed those Justice Department lawyers that they might have to be prepared to say “fuck you” to a federal court to make this happen.

All Senate Republicans save two apparently didn’t care that Bove testified at his Senate confirmation hearing that he didn’t recall saying this and denied ever telling anyone to defy a court order.

All Senate Republicans save two voted to confirm him despite his individual role in firing career prosecutors who—for purely political reasons—had become suspect in the new regime.

All Senate Republicans save two didn’t seem to care about Bove’s demands for data about which FBI agents worked on Jan. 6-related investigations.

All Senate Republicans save two seemed curiously uncurious about Bove’s history of prosecutorial over-aggressiveness and anger management issues during his service at the U.S. attorney’s office for the southern district of New York.

I could fill an entire column with sentences like this. But calling out the slavish abandonment of Senate Republican oaths and their selective attention to things like facts is a bit of a mug’s game. After all, why would anyone have expected any Republican senator save two to behave any differently here than they did? None of them has shown enough honor or integrity to warrant the expectation that they would care a fig about Bove—save for the fact that The Situation demands that they vote for him and pretend he’s a normal, qualified nominee.

And if I’m being honest, I don’t actually think the Third Circuit Court of Appeals is a terrible place to put Bove in storage. The man in his current role is a menace. He has done immense institutional damage to the Justice Department in a short period of time, and while some of that damage would have happened anyway, his particular zeal for the hatchet-manning of it all does seem to have had a catalytic effect.

We think of federal appeals court judgeships as particularly powerful positions, and there’s a sense in which they are, but on the Third Circuit, Bove will never be more than one vote among three. He will always be subject to outvoting, to reversal both by the en banc court and by the Supreme Court. And the Third Circuit, in any event, is not the locus of much litigation involving his boss, from most of which he would presumably be recused anyway.

Confirming corrupt judges—and yes, I am accusing Bove of being corrupt—is never defensible for a senator. But if all of this looking away at Bove’s misconduct merely had the effect of kicking him upstairs into coldish storage on a court of appeals and taking him out of frenetic action in the executive branch, I would oppose it vigorously in public (there is a principle here, after all) but allow myself a private little sigh of relief.

The problem is that Bove is going places. One must regard him, at this point, as a prohibitive favorite for any Supreme Court nomination Trump gets to make in his second term. Bove is young; he is smart and capable; and he has performed any number of valued services for President Trump, both inside the administration and as his personal lawyer. He is a league slicker and better qualified than Judge Aileen Cannon, the district court judge in Florida who so unsubtly—almost without pretense, really—threw the classified documents criminal case Trump’s way. She is bumblingly corrupt. He, by contrast, is pretty good at the whole thing: The Talented Mr. Bove, one might say.

All Senate Republicans know this. They know they are setting him up for elevation. And all Senate Republicans save two don’t care. The Situation demands it of them, and that is the imperative whose call they obey.

The problem is containable, they tell themselves; it’s just a Third Circuit judgeship. And the other side is hypocritical about judicial qualifications. And the allegations here are probably overstated or made up. And the president is allowed to dismiss cases and litigate aggressively and fire Deep State employees who were probably up to no good. And he certainly is qualified.
