Bush, let Mr. Lyons off the hook for the moment, he cautioned that he might change his mind and order him to appear again to answer questions if ICE continues to violate court orders.
“ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated.” Judge Schiltz attached to his ruling a list of 96 court orders from 74 different immigration cases that ICE has failed to follow since Jan. 1.
The federal courts in Minnesota have been deluged this month by legal cases filed by immigrants swept up in the administration’s dragnet.

He said that if Mr. Tobay Robles were quickly released, he would cancel the hearing with Mr. Lyons.","The chief federal judge in Minnesota excoriated Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday, saying it had violated nearly 100 court orders stemming from its aggressive crackdown in the state and had disobeyed more judicial directives in January alone than “some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

The extraordinary broadside by the judge, Patrick J. Schiltz, came in a ruling in which he temporarily rescinded an order he had issued on Tuesday, summoning Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to appear in front of him to explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating so many orders arising from the Trump administration’s hard-line immigration actions in Minnesota.

While Judge Schiltz, a conservative jurist appointed by President George W. Bush, let Mr. Lyons off the hook for the moment, he cautioned that he might change his mind and order him to appear again to answer questions if ICE continues to violate court orders.

“ICE is not a law unto itself,” the judge wrote. “ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated.”

Judge Schiltz attached to his ruling a list of 96 court orders from 74 different immigration cases that ICE has failed to follow since Jan. 1. He noted that his tally was “almost certainly substantially understated” because it had been “hurriedly compiled by extraordinarily busy judges.”

“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law,” Judge Schiltz added.

The federal courts in Minnesota have been deluged this month by legal cases filed by immigrants swept up in the administration’s dragnet. Some of the immigrants have sought to avoid being sent out of the state by federal agents, while others have complained they were wrongfully detained.

Judge Schiltz’s initial order demanding that Mr. Lyons appear in front of him on Friday arose in the case of Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, an Ecuadorean man who entered the United States illegally nearly 30 years ago and was taken into custody by immigration agents on Jan. 6. Judge Schiltz determined that ICE had detained Mr. Tobay Robles under an improper reading of federal law and two weeks ago instructed federal officials either to let him challenge his detention or release him.

After that failed to happen, the judge told Mr. Lyons to appear in front of him. But he provided a way out.

The bill would amend the migration code to make membership in a nongovernmental group an aggravating factor for several existing offenses, with draconian penalties. For members of an nongovernmental group it imposes a minimum of 10 years in prison and a €50,000 fine for facilitating illegal entry or exit; upgrades transportation of an undocumented migrant from a misdemeanor to a felony punishable by at least 10 years and a minimum €60,000 fine per person; and turns facilitating unlawful stay into a felony punishable by up to 10 years.

The bill is being introduced just as a seven-year legal battle concluded in January with the full acquittal of 24 aid workers who were baselessly charged with felonies for their life-saving search and rescue operations.

By singling out and imposing harsher penalties on aid workers, the bill stigmatizes humanitarian work and could deter groups from providing life-saving support.

The Migration Minister would also be able to remove an organization from the official registry based solely on a criminal prosecution against a member. Without registration, an organization cannot effectively operate in Greece. Greece’s existing burdensome registration framework for nongovernmental groups, introduced in 2020, has been criticized by the Council of Europe and UN special rapporteurs.

The bill also creates a new registry that would require the certification of all employees and volunteers of these groups. The bill effectively grants the minister broad power to decide what “certification” entails and to set the conditions at their own discretion. Furthermore, the authorities could revoke the residence permits of legal residents who are members of these groups based solely on being a “suspected perpetrator,” bypassing the presumption of innocence.

These proposed measures constitute an unjustified interference with protected rights including the freedom of association, violating Greece’s international and regional rights obligations. In March 2023, the UN special rapporteur Mary Lawlor noted that aid workers in Greece face the misuse of criminal law to a “shocking degree.” This bill codifies that harassment.

The law should protect those who provide humanitarian assistance, rather than providing authorities with tools to prosecute them. Parliament should reject these abusive provisions and ensure that any new legislation protects civic space.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/09/202509eca_greece_migrants_boat.JPG?h=dfbb13fb&itok=vj_BfGNp,N,,2026-01-29 01:57:30.708274

One of the country's highest-ranking Catholic leaders and a top ally of Pope Leo is sharply criticizing the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, calling ICE a lawless organization.

During an interfaith service this week, Cardinal Joseph Tobin, the head of the Archdiocese of Newark, urged members of the church to pressure lawmakers to block funding for ICE. His remarks come after the deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, and after the detention of Liam Conejo Ramos, a 5-year-old boy who was taken into custody by federal agents after arriving home from preschool and sent with his father to a family detention center in Texas.

For more now, we're joined by Cardinal Joseph Tobin.

Thanks for being with us.

Cardinal Joseph Tobin, Archbishop of Newark: Good evening.

Geoff Bennett:

Before speaking out, I imagine you must have weighed the implications. What specific moral and theological convictions ultimately compelled you to speak publicly?

Cardinal Joseph Tobin:

I think the principle motivator was a concern for the common good.

In the Catholic way of thinking and approaching social-moral questions, it's not simply the vindication of competing rights, but it's rather the preservation of the common good. And so to look at how the actions in Minneapolis or anywhere else affect the common good, those are people like whom you mentioned, the refugees, people without legal status, as well as the citizens of the United States.

Geoff Bennett:

And you have called not just for prayer, but for political action, calling for the defunding of ICE, as we mentioned.

What concrete changes do you envision?

Cardinal Joseph Tobin:

Well, I think what we want to do is -- as much as possible, is use as a principal motivator the human dignity of people.

And I think what I was calling for and I still call for and will call for is the recognition of the dignity of human beings, no matter what their legal status may be.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you reconcile this call to push back against actions you believe are unjust with the church's teaching and the Scripture's teaching of respect for government authority?

Cardinal Joseph Tobin:

Well, I think that we pray for our government officials. And as St. Paul says in First Timothy, we pray that in order that we can live tranquil and decent lives and following our values.

And so we not only pray for ourselves, but we pray for others, because we recognize, in human dignity, the dignity of especially people who don't -- do not necessarily look like us.

Geoff Bennett:

In your message, you also invoked the rise of authoritarianism. Do you believe the country is headed in that direction or that we're presently there? And, if so, what are the biggest moral choices facing Americans right now?

Cardinal Joseph Tobin:

Well, I think we have to ask ourselves about the ongoing discord within our society and ask what the roots are.

We also have to ask ourselves, as Americans, where do we want our country to go? What do we want it to be, both here within our national borders and in the community of nations? These are questions that require, I think, respectful listening to each other and also the freedom to express our opinions.

Geoff Bennett:

Separate from the moral question, there is the political question. And you could argue that President Trump won the Electoral College, he won the popular vote, he won every battleground state running on tougher immigration enforcement and that lax enforcement under the Biden administration caused real harms.

Cardinal Joseph Tobin:

Well, I'd like to make it clear that I'm not endorsing anybody's political program or even that -- the values of a movement.

Rather, I think what we need to do is see what's happening in front of us and then recall what I think is a fundamental value for any of us with faith, without faith. I really hope that the recognition of the human dignity of others is important.

And when we see that dignity violated sometimes in a very egregious and even fatal manner, then we have to say something.

Geoff Bennett:

As a faith leader looking at this moment in American life marked by deep turmoil, but also by people coming together in unexpected ways, do you see signs of hope?

Cardinal Joseph Tobin:

I really believe that, without hope, we're truly in a miserable state. There has to be hope.

And part of my hope is that, when people recognize the humanity of the other, they change. On the contrary, if you want to do inhuman things to people, what you strive to do is take away their dignity, to call them names and not recognize them for who they really are.

Geoff Bennett:

Cardinal Joseph Tobin, thanks again for your time this evening. We appreciate it.

Dan Newhouse said Wednesday that “a lot of questions need to be answered” in the wake of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota, but stopped short of calling for new leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.

Newhouse, a Republican from Sunnyside, was in Olympia speaking to the state House and Senate Republican caucuses.

The congressman, who isn’t running for reelection this year, told the Standard he sees signs the administration is “turning the corner a little bit” and figuring out a new strategy with a “different tone.” He said he agreed with President Donald Trump’s initial push to deport the so-called “worst of the worst” who have committed violent crimes.

But it’s clear that federal immigration authorities have gone beyond that, Newhouse said, arguing “things have gotten out of hand.”

“I’m all for border security and getting rid of the bad people,” Newhouse said. “But we have to show some humanity.”

Newhouse didn’t say that embattled Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem needs to be replaced. Her agency oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. He said that, following Pretti’s killing by federal agents Saturday, he’d “like to hear what she has to say” in congressional hearings.

A growing number of House Democrats, including several from Washington’s congressional delegation, are pushing to impeach Noem after the shooting of Pretti.

Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina, is among them.

“The American people are demanding accountability for these horrific acts,” she said in a statement Monday. “Accountability needs to start with Secretary Noem. It’s clear that the administration and Republicans in Congress are unwilling to hold ICE and its leadership accountable.”

U.S. House Democratic leadership said Tuesday that Noem should be fired or impeached. Two Republican senators, Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, recently called for Noem’s ouster.

Newhouse drew blowback from other Republicans because he supported Trump’s impeachment after the president’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But in Trump’s second term, Newhouse, like most Republicans in Congress, has avoided criticizing the president.

Several GOP candidates are seeking to replace Newhouse in his safely red central Washington congressional district. They include state Sen. Matt Boehnke, past candidate Jerrod Sessler and Yakima County Commissioner Amanda McKinney, who are all Republicans. Trump has endorsed McKinney in this race, and Sessler in his 2024 challenge of Newhouse.

Newhouse declined to pick a favored successor Wednesday, noting that there are “good people that are running.”

As for issues he’s watching in Olympia this legislative session, Newhouse, a farmer, said last year’s Democratic-backed tax increases are worsening affordability for state residents. He’s generally focused on trying to improve the economic climate for businesses.

He previously served four terms in the state House in the 2000s before then-Gov. Christine Gregoire appointed him to lead the state Department of Agriculture.

In 2020, Guan Heng secretly filmed detention facilitates in the north-western Chinese region, where human rights groups say more than one million ethnic Uyghurs have been detained against their will.

Guan, 38, applied for asylum after arriving in the US illegally in 2021, but was detained in August as part of a mass deportation campaign by the Trump administration.

Plans to deport him to Uganda were dropped in December after his situation raised public concerns.

When asked during Wednesday's hearing if his plan in filming the detention facilities and releasing the video a few days before his arrival in the US was to give himself grounds for an asylum claim, Guan said it was not.

""I sympathised with the Uyghurs who were persecuted,"" he replied, via video link from the US correctional facility where he was being held.

Guan published most of the footage on YouTube after leaving China, having first travelled to Hong Kong and then Ecuador, the Bahamas, and eventually Florida.

The videos show him travelling to parts of Xinjiang and filming what he describes as ""concentration camps"".

Several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur Muslim population in Xinjiang.

A series of police files obtained by the BBC in 2022 revealed details of China's use of these camps and described the routine use of armed officers and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape.

People who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse.

Guan's lawyer, Chen Chuangchuang, said his client's case was a ""textbook example of why asylum should exist"".

The recent litigation concerning the government’s 340B Rebate Model Pilot Program (the Rebate Program), as further described below, took an unexpected turn as the federal government recently signaled that it intended to revise its approach to the Rebate Program. This change in strategy was previewed by the government in a letter filed with the Court on January 12, 2026—the deadline for briefing regarding the preliminary injunction—stating that the government was considering “returning the approvals challenged [in the lawsuit] to [the Health Resources and Services Administration] for reconsideration,” and that the parties “plan to dismiss the appeal in short order.” The government formally moved to dismiss its appeal on January 16, 2026, and the First Circuit dismissed the appeal on January 20, 2026.

By way of background, just three days before the Rebate Program was set to go into effect, a U.S. District Court issued a preliminary injunction blocking its implementation, which we previously wrote about here. The government swiftly appealed the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit, requesting an administrative stay of the District Court’s decision while the First Circuit deliberated on the preliminary injunction. The First Circuit declined to issue an administrative stay, finding that the federal government had “not carried its burden to justify a stay”—noting specifically that the government did not make a strong showing that it is likely to success on the merits and did not demonstrate that it would suffer irreparable injury should the Court decline to grant the stay. The Court agreed with the District Court’s findings that “the administrative record . . . is devoid of evidence that the federal government considered the hospitals’ significant reliance interests — a critical factor in the analysis of an arbitrary-and-capricious claim.” Absent the stay, the First Circuit requested further briefing on the appeal of the preliminary injunction.

As of this writing, the case will continue to move forward at the District Court level, as the parties have not yet submitted any filings to indicate otherwise, and the District Court’s preliminary injunction prohibiting implementation of the Rebate Program will remain in effect until that litigation is resolved. As discussed in our original post, under the 340B statute, the government can decide to use rebates, but may not bypass APA requirements when modifying the 340B program to implement those rebates. In issuing the preliminary injunction, the District Court indicated that, among other things, the government failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the costs and benefits of the program and the deviation from decades of industry reliance on upfront discounts. Therefore, if the government elects not to pursue reconsideration of the injunction in the First Circuit, the Rebate Pilot Program, as currently contemplated by the government, may not proceed until litigation at the District Court level concludes.

As noted by the District Court, the government would need to satisfy APA requirements to implement a rebate program under the 340B statute, including developing a full administrative record addressing the costs and benefits to the parties. However, it is unclear to what extent the government would incorporate commenters’ suggestions for managing 340B Covered Entities’ implementation costs, which include, for example, delaying the program’s start date to better equip Covered Entities to handle the increased administrative burden, implementing a dispute resolution mechanism that better protects 340B Covered Entities in the event that manufacturers fail to provide timely rebates, and limiting the scope of a future pilot program (as designed, the Rebate Program would apply to all 340B Covered Entities).

We will continue to monitor this litigation and developments concerning the Rebate Program.

5:30 p.m.: Maine’s largest business groups urge congressional action to rein in ICE

Three of Maine’s largest business groups joined forces Wednesday in asking the state’s congressional delegation to push for greater control over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The Maine State Chamber of Commerce, Portland Regional Chamber and Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber sent a letter to the delegation raising concerns about the economic impacts of recent ICE activity in Maine.

The letter calls for greater congressional oversight, limits on aggressive enforcement tactics involving non-violent individuals, and continued bipartisan work on immigration reform.

“Our employers are increasingly reporting that authorized workers are staying home from work, as it has been widely reported that ICE enforcement includes not only individuals with extensive criminal records, but also individuals who believe they are legally authorized to work and reside in the United States,” the letter states. “These activities are occurring in downtown areas as well as in major retailers and grocery stores.”

The letter notes that Maine’s labor market is among the tightest in the country.

“Elevated ICE enforcement has rapidly become one of the most pressing economic challenges facing hundreds of Maine businesses,” the letter states. “Businesses across nearly every sector — from essential services to restaurants — are already triaging operations simply to remain open. This situation is not sustainable for many businesses.”

The letter makes these points in depth:

• Congressional Oversight: “Enforcement efforts should be focused on individuals without legal status who have criminal records. However, there is now public reporting of individuals with legal status and no criminal history that have been aggressively pursued in commercial centers throughout our communities. This creates a public safety concern that extends beyond the workforce and is influencing broader consumer behavior. Many individuals are hesitant to spend time in shopping districts, resulting in a significant decline in customer traffic for local businesses. The bottom line is that these actions are undermining economic activity and have caused an entire population — regardless of legal status — to remain at home and away from our businesses. A thorough review is needed to clarify the objectives, scope, and execution of current enforcement activities.”

• Enforcement Activities: “Congress should review and establish clear limits on aggressive ICE enforcement actions involving individuals without criminal records. The reported activities have created a destabilizing environment in our communities. While we respect the rule of law and the majority of professionals who conduct enforcement responsibly, we strongly support congressional efforts to ensure that enforcement activities are carried out with restraint and professionalism.”

• Immigration Reform: “We appreciate congressional efforts to address our broken immigration system. In particular, bipartisan immigration legislation introduced in 2024 and supported by Senators Collins and King would have strengthened border security while creating a legal process for existing immigrants without legal status. While significant progress has been made on border security, there must also be a pathway for long-term legal status for residents without a criminal history. This issue has undermined our economy for decades and demands a lasting solution.”

5:20 p.m.: ICE agents shatter window, leave one-month-old baby and mother in car during Portland arrest

Video obtained by the Portland Press Herald shows federal immigration agents leaving behind a woman and her infant child, along with broken glass, after detaining a Guinean immigrant with no known criminal history in Portland.

Hassane Barry and his wife, Nene, asylum seekers from the Republic of Guinea in West Africa, were driving home from an appointment last week to get their one-month-old baby a passport. As they drove down Forest Avenue, they suddenly found themselves boxed in by four unmarked police cars.

Armed and masked federal agents stepped out and said Hassane’s name. They were here for him.

“There’s a baby in the car,” Hassane told the agents. “There’s a baby.”

But before the couple had time to do anything, agents shattered his driver side window. Glass sprayed over the baby’s car seat and the car’s interior, Nene said. Hassane was arrested and pulled into an unmarked police car. Officers left the scene in a matter of minutes.

Nene, who does not have a driver’s license and speaks little English, was left alone inside the car with her infant.

A group of around ten bystanders filmed agents and watched the incident unfold from the sidewalk. They walked through shattered glass to help usher Nene and her baby into their own cars to warm up. They eventually coordinated drivers who could take Nene, her baby and their car all back home.

Hassane was taken to the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts, where ICE’s detainee locator indicates he is still being held. A week since the arrest, Nene said she’s still in shock and is now too scared to leave her apartment.

“At night, we cannot sleep,” Nene said. “The baby cries; I cry.”

3:20 p.m. Passamaquoddy Chief seeks to quell fears in statement

Chief William Nicholas Sr. and Vice Chief Joseph Socobasin of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Motahkomikuk (Indian Township) released a statement Wednesday afternoon in an effort to address concerns voiced by reservation residents.

The statement, which largely echoes those released last week by Penobscot Chief Kirk Francis and Chief Amkuwiposohehs “Pos” Bassett the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Sipayik, urges tribal members to identify themselves as U.S. citizens and to show proper ID if contacted by federal immigration officials.

“We have not been contacted by ICE for any immigration purposes on our reservation and would hope that communication would be made through the Police Department if they were to come here,” the officials wrote.

Nationally, some members of federally recognized tribes have had found their tribal IDs, which are acceptable proof of citizenship for many purposes, were not sufficient in interactions with federal immigration enforcement officers.

There have been no reports of ICE agents stopping or detaining tribal members in Maine.

2:45 p.m.: Federal immigration agents struck observers’ vehicles with paintball-like projectiles

At least two vehicles driven by observers of U.S. Immigrant and Customs Enforcement activity were hit by paintball-like projectiles by federal immigration agents in the Home Depot parking lot in South Portland on Friday afternoon.

Sabine Pierce, who said she has witnessed a couple of dozen ICE scenes since Jan. 20, arrived at Home Depot after agents had already moved the detainee into their vehicle. Pierce kept her distance from the agents but shouted obscene critiques through her rolled-down car window.

As her car approached the area, an agent walked to his vehicle and grabbed an assault rifle before approaching her vehicle.

Pierce said the agent told her “this is your last warning, If you don’t leave, you will be arrested.”

At that point, another agent ran towards her vehicle with something that looked like a sledgehammer in hand, according to Pierce. She drove away before he could get close enough.

As she was leaving the parking lot, Pierce said her vehicle was struck twice on the passenger side by the paint-ball like projectile. The agent who fired it was on foot, about 200 or 300 feet away from Pierce’s car.

ICE spokespeople did not immediately respond to an inquiry about why a paintball-like gun was being used.

2:30 p.m.: A pastor searched for a missing congregant. He found a car with the keys on the floor

Around 10 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 22, Westbrook pastor Carlos Nzolameso received a call from a member of his congregation who was searching for a roommate. Evaristo Kalonji, who organizes and plays the music at the church, had not shown up to his job at Chipotle.

Several other congregants also reached out to Nzolameso, concerned that Kalonji, an asylum seeker from Angola, was missing. Nzolameso, who leads the predominantly Portuguese-speaking Rehoboth Christian Church, said Kalonji, who has no family in the United States, is like a son.

He set out to find him.

Nzolameso spent a couple hours searching for Kalonji in and around South Portland, where Kalonji lives. Nzolameso checked with the police department for any traffic stops or accidents. His efforts yielded no answers. He weighed checking the hospital next.

It wasn’t until the pastor made a final trip to retrace Kalonji’s commute that he spotted his car — a black Ford Fusion — two minutes away from Kalonji’s home. It was parked on Westbrook Street in South Portland. The car was unlocked, he said, and the keys were on the floor.

“I was devastated. I couldn’t even believe it,” said Noemia Nzolameso, the pastor’s daughter, when she heard the news. “I was in shock. Literally.”

1:10 p.m.: Greater Portland businesses to be surveyed about ICE impacts

Five local organizations are banding together to survey more than 1,000 businesses in Greater Portland to see how they have been impacted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations over the last several days.

Surveys were sent Wednesday on behalf of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce, Visit Portland, the City of Portland Housing & Economic Development Department, Portland Downtown and the Greater Portland Council of Governments (GPCOG).

The anonymous survey seeks to better understand whether recent ICE activity has had any measurable economic impacts on businesses, including on staffing, productivity, revenue and general operations.

Already, many immigrant-owned businesses have temporarily closed their doors to protect staff and to avoid attracting any attention.

Other businesses have put up signs standing with immigrants and protesting ICE’s enforcement actions here.

12:40 p.m.: Gov. Mills says she is pressing Trump on ICE presence as city leaders say they are worried about a possible wave of evictions

The mayors of Maine’s largest and most diverse cities told Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday that they are bracing for a wave of evictions next week as the immigration enforcement campaign in the state is keeping families out of work.

During a roundtable discussion with the mayors of Portland, South Portland, Westbrook, Lewiston and more, Mills said she has requested a meeting with President Donald Trump and is seeking information on who exactly has been arrested so far in Maine, the reasons for the arrests and where they are being detained, but said she has not received a response.

The mayors attending the roundtable recounted similar ways the enforcement campaign has impacted daily life in their cities, including decreased attendance at workplaces and schools that is having serious economic implications.

Portland Mayor Mark Dion said that according to Project Home, a program run by the nonprofit Quality Housing Coalition, there are at least 653 households across Portland, South Portland and Westbrook that are at risk of eviction come Feb. 1. Those households account for 2,285 adults and children.

Dion said he worries evictions will be the “new tsunami” following the increased ICE presence that “could linger for quite some time.”

“It’s bad enough to be afraid to go outside, and it could be worse if we push them outside,” he said, urging the governor to seek assistance from philanthropic organizations and the legislature to treat the issue as an emergency.

Mills said she and Attorney General Aaron Frey, who was also in attendance, will be pressing the administration to provide the identities of who has been taken and what the legal basis is for their detention.

“Who are they? Where are they? We don’t believe in secrecy surrounding arrests and detention,” she said. “This is America. Tell us what the federal government’s plans are for them? When will they be returned to their jobs and families?”

12:40 p.m.: Portland sandwich shop to donate half of upcoming sales to local groups

Ramona’s on Washington Avenue announced in a social media post Wednesday that it plans to donate 20% of its sales this Thursday, Friday and Saturday to two local community support groups.

The restaurant said the proceeds would go to the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project and the MaineHealth Food Pantry. Ramona’s said the groups “provide vital support to those in our community affected by the inhumane ICE tactics in our state.”

Ramona’s had initially announced it would donate 50% of its Friday sales, but Friday has been designated as a National Shutdown Day, calling for “no school, no work, no shopping” to protest immigration enforcement tactics and shootings in Minneapolis. In their Instagram post, Ramona’s stated, “We wholeheartedly stand with our fellow industry workers who have chosen to strike, showing solidarity with businesses unable to open and with those who cannot work safely.

“We believe that food is a source of comfort and community,” the post adds. “Our doors will be open to provide a safe space for our neighbors and those who wish to contribute to the organizations named above. We know that these are small gestures, but we hope that they contribute to the greater good of our community here in Portland.”

11:45 a.m.: Many Maine businesses will participate in Friday’s nationwide strike

The list is growing of Maine businesses that plan to participate in Friday’s nationwide shutdown in protest of ICE activity.

Arcana yoga and massage studio is one of several Portland businesses that have posted their plans on Instagram in an effort to encourage others to join.

“Hey Folks, we will be closed on Friday 1/30 in Solidarity with the general strike!” the post reads. “Be brave, Be wise, Be aware and please local businesses close in solidarity. This is not like previous actions. This is a well organized national strike. One day of profit is not as important as this historically very effective non-violent action!!!”

Nash & Co., Flatiron Coffee Bar, Another Round, Izakaya Minato, Tandem Coffee & Bakery, Speckled Axe, Sun Oriental Market and Mayhem Portland also have posted plans to be closed in support of the immigrant community and to protest ICE.

The strike, organized at NationalShutdown.us, is billed as “ICE OUT! Nationwide Shutdown! No work. No school. No shopping.”

As part of the shutdown, a protest event is being planned for 3 p.m. Friday at Monument Square in Portland, according to social media posts.

But while many local businesses plan to close on Friday, some will remain open because closing isn’t feasible for a variety of reasons, said Amy Landry, board president of Portland Buy Local. Many are reaching out in other ways.

“Whether open or closed, businesses are donating profits, gathering supplies, and volunteering with local nonprofits,” Landry said. “What we’re seeing is that local businesses are supporting our community in ways that feel right to them.”

10:50 a.m.: Lewiston woman worries for her husband being held in Massachusetts by ICE

Delfino Nsuka was minutes from his home in Lewiston, his wife said, when ICE agents stopped him Thursday afternoon.

Jaylee Shropshire-Nsuka recorded as much of the interaction as she could. She was driving to his location in another car, listening to officers through a phone call with her husband.

“She’s literally on the way,” Delfino told the agents, according to a recording of the phone call.

“You can talk with her after,” a man tells Delfino, before asking him to take off his seat belt and get out of the car, which Delfino had turned off.

Jaylee said she didn’t hear from her husband until the next day. He is currently being held in Plymouth, Massachusetts, and is scheduled to appear in immigration court in February.

“At that point I hadn’t heard from him in almost 2 days, and I was obviously freaking out,” she said. “Because, you know, they’ve sent people to Texas and Louisiana. You just have no idea what’s gonna happen, you know what I mean?”

In the video she recorded, ICE agents told Delfino they ran a “check for immigration” and that he was “going to have to come with us.” They never ask for his name in the video, although Jaylee said her husband gave them his work authorization papers.

Jaylee said her husband, who is originally from Angola, has no criminal history and has done “everything he is supposed to do” for his immigration case.

Delfino arrived to the United States eight years ago on a visa, she said. They met each other while attending high school in Lewiston.

Jaylee said they got married last year and were in the middle of sorting out the paperwork to adjust his status, although she added that he was in Maine as an asylum-seeker before that.

Delfino is one of at least three people married to U.S. citizens who have recently been detained by immigration officials, according to court records and their spouses.

That includes Marcos Da Silva, who was detained by ICE in Portland on Jan. 20 and is still in federal custody. Another man married to a U.S. citizen was arrested by Border Patrol agents in Wiscasset on Jan. 16 while leaving his home, according to court records.

Jaylee said her husband has no criminal history and has been a hard and dedicated worker for the eight years that she’s known him.

“He’s the breadwinner at home,” she said. “Our whole lives are going to be affected by this, and currently are being affected by this situation. Something needs to happen, because innocent people are being targeted.”

10 a.m.: ICE officials won’t say if operations have slowed in Maine

ICE officials declined to share whether operations in Maine have slowed since its enhanced enforcement began last week.

Immigrant advocates said Tuesday that calls to their ICE activity hotline have slowed after a significant spike last week — when federal officials reported that agents had apprehended more than 200 people since its operation began on Jan. 20.

Officials from the federal agency, however, refused to answer whether immigration enforcement activity has reduced, and would not share how many agents are working throughout the state.

“Due to operational security and officer safety, ICE does not discuss any ongoing, upcoming, or planned immigration enforcement operations. ICE also does not divulge law enforcement tactics or methods,” the agency said in a statement Wednesday.

An essential feature of the Task Force is its formal role in coordinating AI policy and enforcement across the Executive Branch.
The Department of Commerce will also play a central role by evaluating state AI laws and referring those it deems overly burdensome on industry participants to the Task Force for potential litigation.
In other words, the federal government is seeking to constrain state AI regulation through Article II powers, rather than through express statutory preemption enacted by Congress.","The Task Force will be chaired by the Attorney General and includes senior leadership from across the Justice Department, with the Associate Attorney General as Vice Chair and representatives from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office of the Associate Attorney General, the Office of the Solicitor General, and the DOJ’s Civil Division. The Attorney General is authorized to appoint additional members to the Task Force as appropriate. The composition of the Task Force signals that challenges to state AI laws will be treated as matters of institutional and constitutional significance rather than routine regulatory disputes.

An essential feature of the Task Force is its formal role in coordinating AI policy and enforcement across the Executive Branch. The Task Force will consult with the Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, senior economic policy officials within the White House, and the Counsel to the President. The Department of Commerce will also play a central role by evaluating state AI laws and referring those it deems overly burdensome on industry participants to the Task Force for potential litigation. Notably, all these actors reside within the Executive Branch.

The Task Force’s mission bears a fundamental resemblance to these statutory preemption regimes. Just as Congress sought a single regulatory standard for airlines and automobile emissions, the Executive Order underlying the Task Force reflects a policy judgment that uniform federal treatment of AI is preferable to state-by-state regulation. The crucial distinction, however, is institutional rather than substantive. Unlike the Airline Deregulation Act and the Clean Air Act, which are both products of Congressional action, the Task Force stands to achieve regulatory uniformity through litigation and Executive coordination alone. In other words, the federal government is seeking to constrain state AI regulation through Article II powers, rather than through express statutory preemption enacted by Congress.

This Article II-driven approach means that the Task Force’s creation alone is insufficient to displace state law or immediately alter the regulatory obligations that AI businesses face. Any meaningful effect depends on a multi-step process: The Commerce Department must first identify and refer a state law to the Task Force, the Justice Department must initiate litigation, and a court must grant injunctive relief. That process can take considerable time, and even preliminary injunctions, while available, require litigants to satisfy a demanding standard.

As a result, the Task Force’s efforts are likely to proceed methodically rather than produce rapid, sweeping changes. Courts will take time to weigh the merits of each claim, and preliminary relief is not guaranteed.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16337_2239.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 23:58:17.316390

Another federal judge in Minneapolis is considering a lawsuit the state and city governments filed seeking an end to the surge.","Schiltz, a George W. Bush appointee, appended a list of nearly 100 court orders he said the immigration agency had violated in the past month solely involving immigrants detained in the Twin Cities area as part of Operation Metro Surge.

“This list should give pause to anyone — no matter his or her political beliefs — who cares about the rule of law,” the judge wrote. “ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2026 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.”

Many of Schiltz’s colleagues on the federal bench in Minnesota have similarly vented about ICE’s recalcitrance in recent orders. Minutes after Schiltz’s order, one of his colleagues — Clinton appointee John Tunheim — backed an emergency effort to block ICE from targeting thousands of refugees residing lawfully in Minnesota but who are still awaiting permanent residency status. Tunheim ordered the Trump administration to release anyone detained on this basis and to return to Minnesota any who had been transported out of state.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite the judge’s fury, his order amounted to a reprieve of sorts for ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons, whom Schiltz had previously ordered to appear before him Friday to address potential contempt of court.

Schiltz’s initial order came in the case of an Ecuadorian man, Juan Tobay Robles, whose release from ICE detention the judge ordered earlier this month. Schiltz lit into the agency for violating the order after officials failed to release the man for days despite the court directive.

But on Wednesday, Robles’ attorney confirmed that his client had been released, mooting the need for Friday’s hearing. The attorney, Graham Ojala-Barbour, said despite the cancellation, he would welcome another opportunity to seek “accountability for ICE.”

“We have heard from the administration that they intend to have ICE at the Super Bowl. I don’t know how much of that is rhetoric,” Matt Mahan, the San Jose mayor, told KTVU.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to confirm reports about operations around Levi’s Stadium on 8 February, writing in a statement that the agency does “not disclose future operations or discuss personnel”.

“DHS is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the Super Bowl is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the World Cup,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin, adding that security for the event would include a response “conducted in-line with the US constitution”.

“Those who are here legally and are not breaking other laws have nothing to fear.”

The move, which comes as the administration faces mounting criticism over its immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota and the killings of two US citizens by federal agents, has caused concern in the community, particularly for vulnerable families.

“It’s going to increase the level of tension and fear in our area,” Peter Ortiz of the San Jose city council told the San José Spotlight. “We’re already seeing that they are scared to go out to eat, scared to go to the local corner store, scared to send their kids to school.”

Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, announced last fall that agents would conduct operations during the Super Bowl.

“There is nowhere that you can provide safe haven to people who are in this country illegally, not the Super Bowl, and nowhere else,” Lewandowski said on the Benny Johnson podcast. “We will find you, we will apprehend you, we will put you in a detention facility and we will deport you.”

Noem also confirmed ICE operations at the game during an interview with that same podcaster.

“We’ll be all over that place,” she said. “We’re gonna enforce the law so I think people should not be coming to the Super Bowl unless they are law-abiding Americans who love this country.”

The agency has collaborated with the NFL for two decades, according to a DHS statement, and sent nearly 700 employees to New Orleans last year to aid in security for the event, and “intellectual property enforcement”.

But Trump administration officials have derided the NFL as “woke” and criticized the decision to have Bad Bunny perform at this year’s half-time show. The Puerto Rican artist, who will perform along with Green Day, opted not to include US stops on his latest tour over concerns his fans could face ICE raids.

Donald Trump described the half-time show entertainment this year as a “terrible choice” and said he will not attend the game.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39acaa1bdda8b6bb89b6c42a1d42f1d3ac16d099/408_0_4699_3761/master/4699.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f40369375b86261c5c48f192d63e2ca6",N,,2026-01-28 22:58:18.908545

“They’re open because they want to be open,” Marquette Hawkins, the mayor of California City, told me a few days after the planning commission’s hearing.","On September 18, 2025, Karam stopped eating. Nearly three weeks earlier, he had been transferred to the California City ICE Detention Facility, a remote facility deep in the Mojave Desert, from Mesa Verde, another ICE detention center, in downtown Bakersfield. At Mesa Verde, Karam, who has a chronic stomach ulcer, had been receiving regular medication, was frequently kept on a liquid diet as prescribed by a doctor, and was able to see medical staff routinely. (Karam is a pseudonym, as he remains detained by ICE and fears retaliation.) Karam had even been approved to see a gastrointestinal specialist for his condition, but he was transferred before the appointment.

When Karam arrived at California City, he informed a nurse who was conducting his medical intake about his ulcer, liquid diet, and the medications he takes daily—some of them multiple times a day. Yet, during his first twenty-four hours at the facility, he received no medication, and later, when he finally began to receive anything at all, they were the wrong pills and were provided with wild infrequency.

As his health declined and his numerous requests for medication went unanswered, Karam decided to go on a hunger strike. By September 22nd, nearly a week into the strike, he was vomiting blood. The next day, he fainted, which triggered a “code blue”—a life-threatening medical emergency—that brought him to the medical clinic. There, according to Karam, he was kept for two or three hours as a health-service administrator named Ms. White took his vitals, and told him that it would be another two weeks before he could see a gastroenterologist for his condition. For the next three days, multiple staff members at California City told Karam that he would only get his medication if he ended his hunger strike.

About a week later, Karam ended his strike, and staff assured him that he’d be able to see a doctor and receive his proper liquid diet. But it would be more than a week until he finally saw that doctor, who not only told Karam that there would be no appointment with a G.I. specialist but that he should “go back” to his country to get the medical care he needs.

In the three months since, Karam’s medical condition has continued to worsen and remains untreated. He told me that he has developed mouth ulcers, still vomits blood, and has blood in his stool. Karam has gone on three additional hunger strikes since September.

After speaking with several current and recently released detainees from the California City ICE Detention Facility (C.C.D.F.), I have learned that Karam’s experience of medical neglect there is pervasive. These detainees reported adequate care at other ICE detention and processing facilities they were previously held at, and described the California City facility as unique in its mistreatment of those held in its custody. Time and again, detainees told me that they experienced extremely delayed appointments with health-care professionals, the denial of medications and treatment, experiences with unsafe and unsanitary living conditions, and a general antagonism by medical staff toward detainees.

“California City is extraordinarily isolated, it is extraordinarily brutal and cruel, it is extraordinarily deprived of adequate medical care,” Tess Borden, an attorney at the California nonprofit Prison Law Office, explained to me.

In November, Prison Law Office joined the firm of Keker, Van Nest & Peters, the A.C.L.U., and the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice in filing a class-action lawsuit against ICE and the Department of Homeland Security on behalf of those detained at California City. As noted in the filing, detainees refer to C.C.D.F. as a “torture chamber” and “hell on Earth.” In fact, Borden says, the conditions at the facility are so terrible that detainees are resigning themselves to self-deportation, instead of pursuing asylum and other immigration cases, and that “people are also trying to take their own lives.”

In April, 2025, as deportations ramped up nationwide, the for-profit prison company CoreCivic repurposed a decommissioned prison in California City into an immigration detention center after signing a contract with ICE. The company already owned the prison, which had sat unused since 2023, so the contract, which is worth an estimated a hundred and thirty million dollars annually, was a valuable source of revenue for CoreCivic. Additionally, the CoreCivic property has helped address ICE’s growing need for detention space in a state where the agency has turbocharged its immigration-enforcement activities. If fully occupied, C.C.D.F. will be the largest detention center on the West Coast—and one of its most remote.

C.C.D.F. is situated two hours north of Los Angeles, deep in the Mojave Desert, and about sixty miles from the edge of Death Valley National Park. Temperatures can be below freezing in the winter, and well over a hundred degrees in the summer. “It’s hard for attorneys to get out there,” Mario Valenzuela, a lawyer who represents multiple clients at C.C.D.F, told me. It is a three-hour round trip from Valenzuela’s office in Bakersfield out to California City, and the detention center is so desolate that he often can’t find cell service. He told me, “There’s nothing around, just barren desert, then all of a sudden you come across this facility.”

The closest town to C.C.D.F. is California City, about five miles away, where about a quarter of residents live below the poverty line, and roughly eighteen per cent are unemployed. As of 2024, CoreCivic is one of the town’s largest employers. But, despite signing a contract with ICE, ongoing litigation alleges that the company has not secured a business license or the proper conditional-use permit for the facility with the municipal government of California City. Since it opened, C.C.D.F. has allegedly been operating in direct violation of A.B. 103, a state law that requires a hundred-and-eighty-day waiting period and two public hearings before a private corporation may repurpose a facility as an immigration detention center. An active lawsuit is currently deciding these claims, but, even if the courts side with CoreCivic, the company seems to have acted in a legal gray zone when opening C.C.D.F.

On August 27th, CoreCivic began receiving detainees at C.C.D.F. In September, a federally authorized monitor visit by Disability Rights California raised “serious concerns” about the facility’s significant disrepair, caused by the period it sat vacant and the subsequent “rush to open.” That month, five hundred migrants were believed to have been transferred to C.C.D.F. In November, Prison Law Office estimated that eight hundred detainees were being held at the facility, and by mid-January the count was fourteen hundred. C.C.D.F. is projected to reach its full capacity of two thousand five hundred and sixty people in the first quarter of 2026.

“Any claims there are inhumane conditions at the California City Correctional Facility are FALSE,” the D.H.S. assistant secretary for public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, said in an e-mail, adding that “ICE is regularly audited and inspected by external agencies” to insure its facilities comply with “national detention standards.” With regard to medical treatment, McLaughlin said that the agency provides “comprehensive medical care.” A representative for CoreCivic added that the company has “submitted all required information for a business license and [continues] to maintain open lines of communication with city officials.”

Still, as detainee numbers have surged, staffing and basic infrastructure have clearly not kept up. In a letter sent to D.H.S. last month, California’s attorney general, Rob Bonta, warned that “the facility does not have enough medical doctors for its detainee population size,” and the staff it does have “appear to be inexperienced and lack basic understanding of civil detention management principles.” On January 20th, Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff toured the facility and spoke with the warden as part of an oversight visit. “Far and away, the biggest concerns were about lack of medical attention,” Senator Padilla told me by phone after his visit. He compared the facility’s conditions to what he saw during a tour of migrant detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay last year, explaining that it can take “weeks or months” for a detainee to receive care, “even for matters that, in my mind, seem pretty urgent.”

For Yuri Alexander Roque Campos, a thirty-year-old detainee living with a life-threatening heart condition, those factors proved almost fatal. After being transferred from Mesa Verde to C.C.D.F. on September 5th, Roque Campos (who is named in the class-action lawsuit) was denied his heart medications before he even saw an intake nurse, and did not receive aspirin for five days. As a result, Roque Campos suffered what was described by doctors as a “pre-heart attack” and was rushed to the emergency room twice during his first two days at California City for extreme chest pain and paralysis. Roque Campos lost consciousness en route to the hospital during the first trip.

Todd Randall Wilcox, a correctional health-care physician and the former president of the American College of Correctional Physicians, reviewed the medical records associated with Roque Campos’s hospital visits, as part of expert testimony for the class-action suit. “The emergency room doctor expressed serious hesitation to send him back to California City,” Wilcox wrote. The hesitation was justified. When Roque Campos returned to California City, his medical records and a letter from the E.R. doctor explaining his reluctance to discharge Roque Campos were confiscated. Roque Campos was then placed in an isolated observation cell for eight days, where he received medication sporadically. He would not see a doctor for over a month. This ordeal put Roque Campos “at significant risk for sudden cardiac death,” Wilcox concluded in his review, and he was not the only detainee facing this risk.

Fernando Viera Reyes, a fifty-year-old man detained by ICE, had been receiving adequate care at Golden State Annex, an ICE facility in the northern suburbs of Bakersfield, for elevated prostate-specific-antigen (P.S.A.) levels. In March, 2025, Viera Reyes was seen by a urologist who insisted he get a prostate biopsy to find out whether cancer was present. But, before a biopsy could be conducted, Viera Reyes was transferred to California City, in late August. Despite Viera Reyes showing symptoms like bloody urine, C.C.D.F. medical staff only supplied him with Flomax, a medication used to treat enlarged prostates, on an infrequent basis. When he asked a doctor for pain medication, the doctor gave him Vitamin C. “I am very concerned I have prostate cancer and it is taking a very long time to get it diagnosed and treated,” Viera Reyes wrote in a declaration for the class-action lawsuit in early December.

Between January and October, Viera Reyes’s P.S.A. levels jumped from 6.3 to seventy-four, suggesting a very high likelihood of prostate cancer. Wilcox condemned his treatment. “Mr. Viera Reyes’s treatment as it relates to his prostate condition thus far at California City constitutes a complete dereliction of duty by the medical staff. Every day that this is delayed increases this patient’s risk for metastatic disease.”

Gustavo, yet another detainee at C.C.D.F. who has suffered from inadequate medical attention, spoke to me from inside the detention center, and asked me not to use his last name. He told me he thinks CoreCivic staff aren’t providing adequate medical care because they are basically waiting out the clock. They are acting as if “everybody who’s here is gonna be deported,” Gustavo told me. “That’s why I think that they don’t want to spend any money on medication, because they figure we’re just gonna get sent to Mexico.”

On December 16th, the California City Planning Commission held its second public hearing regarding CoreCivic’s repurposing of its facility. Even though the commission scheduled the hearing a week before Christmas, forty people spoke during public comment. One by one, they invoked Nazi concentration camps, Soviet gulags, and the Japanese internment camp at Manzanar, which had stood only a hundred and ten miles north of C.C.D.F. The public commenters condemned the planning commission for not doing more to stop CoreCivic and ICE. “You guys have blood on your hands already,” one said. “I think you’re in way over your heads. I don’t think you anticipated this happening in this little city,” another said. “I did not anticipate a concentration camp in my town.”

But the central question raised during public comment was procedural: How was C.C.D.F. even allowed to open in the first place if CoreCivic appeared to be in direct violation of California state law and local municipal codes?

“They’re open because they want to be open,” Marquette Hawkins, the mayor of California City, told me a few days after the planning commission’s hearing. “Are we, as a city, to go out there and station our thirteen officers around the building to blockade it? Are we, as the city—am I as a mayor—to go out there and lie in the middle of the street in front of the buses? I mean, what people are asking is not realistic.”

When I pressed Hawkins on the city taking a stand against ICE and CoreCivic, he responded that there is a calculation that must be made, “regardless of what my moral stance is,” adding that “the calculation is the revenue that CoreCivic brings with that facility and the jobs that it brings.” Hawkins acknowledged that the calculus sounds “distant and cold,” but he described himself as a pragmatist and dismissed many of the complaints of mistreatment specified in the class-action lawsuit. “That sounds bad, taking these things in isolation,” he said, but, citing conversations with the warden of the facility and in speaking with employees of C.C.D.F., he added that its possible detainees are “strategically” causing problems “to then go, ‘Well, I have to report on this because this is what happened.’ ”

This failure of municipal government to adequately address federal overreach in immigration policy is a pattern that ICE is relying on across the country to push its agenda forward. CoreCivic appears to be operating C.C.D.F. in violation of municipal code and state law without any consequences, and though it may not be the sole responsibility of Hawkins or the California City Planning Commission to hold CoreCivic, ICE, and D.H.S. accountable for everything that occurs at the facility, municipalities are a primary defense against potentially illegal activity within their city limits.

On December 22nd, after weeks of litigation, ICE and D.H.S. responded to a temporary restraining order filed on behalf of Yuri Alexander Roque Campos and Fernando Viera Reyes, demanding immediate care for the two men in the face of significant harm and potential death. The agencies agreed to send the two men to the necessary specialists within three weeks, and to “ensure timely compliance with all follow-up orders for treatment and medication.”

I reached out to CoreCivic about the health-care conditions at their facility. A company representative responded that “our health services teams follow both CoreCivic’s standards for medical care and the standards set forth by our government partners.” The company added that its staff are medical professionals “who contractually meet the highest standards of care.”

But, in November, the class-action suit alleges CoreCivic’s hiring page had nine open job listings related to medical care at C.C.D.F. By early December, eight of those listings were still open, including physician, psychiatrist, and advanced registered nurse practitioner. Just as the company seems to have rushed to open C.C.D.F. without proper legal approvals, they were still hiring medical professionals months after opening.

But staffing issues do not fully explain the lack of basic medical care at California City. “They do it so you give up,” Julio Cesar Santos Avalos, who was a detainee at California City from September to November, told me. When he arrived at C.C.D.F., Santos Avalos recalls a consistent push by staff for detainees to sign away their rights and self-deport. Instructions for how to self-deport are displayed prominently near phones where detainees communicate with their lawyers. Santos Avalos and many of the detainees and attorneys I spoke to believe the lack of medical care is part of that push. The detention center is aiming to make conditions so terrible that detainees stop fighting and decide to leave. Santos Avalos, who suffers from chronic pain owing to a foot deformity caused by childhood cases of polio and Guillain-Barré syndrome, was denied his pain medication and made to sleep on a top bunk until he broke under the pressure and self-deported to El Salvador.

I asked Julio Cesar Santos Avalos if he knows the next time he’ll be able to see his children, both of whom still live in California. “I can’t return as a permanent resident anymore,” Santos Avalos, who is in El Salvador for the first time since he left four decades earlier, at the age of seven, said. “And for what? Just because some guy says we’re illegal, we’re criminals? Look at Trump’s wife. His wife is a criminal too, then, right?”

In two years, Santos Avalos’s son may be able to apply for a visa on behalf of his father. In the meantime, he told me, “it hurts that I’m not there for them because I was there all the time for them. But, I talk to them every day, and I tell them I love them every day.”

Though all detainees at C.C.D.F. are meant to be held pursuant to laws regarding civil detention, the experience they describe is harsher and more restrictive than that of many criminal prisoners. “It’s important to locate the conditions at California City within this federal Administration’s punitive approach to immigrants,” Borden, the lawyer with Prison Law Office, told me. She cited a post on X, in February, 2025, by Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, that told immigrants, “Do not come to this country or we will hunt you down, find you, and lock you up.” In August, Noem reiterated those comments when she told CBS News that “overwhelmingly, what encourages people to go back home voluntarily is the consequences.”

Mario Valenzuela views this messaging as the origin of much of the mistreatment in ICE detention. “The officers and everybody that falls below them, they feel emboldened to be aggressive like never before,” he told me. With each passing month, those aggressive tactics test the moral and legal boundaries, only to be met with insufficient resistance, which, in turn, emboldens the federal immigration apparatus to push it even further. “It’s coming from the top,” Valenzuela said, “this feeling that they can do whatever they want. There’s no accountability.” ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/696547ff333782d35ad1ba12/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/newyorker_californiacity_final2.jpg",N,,2026-01-28 22:58:23.432357

""When small business has a cough in Minnesota, the entire state catches a cold ...
When small business is suffering, it can literally bring entire state economies to their knees,"" says Trent, noting that roughly half of U.S. job creation comes from small businesses.
On Jan. 11, one of Pilllar's baristas called Bracken to report an incident with ICE agents outside, Bracken says.
Four confrontations involving ICE agents have occurred outside Pilllar so far in January, he says.","Manny González has run Manny's Tortas, his Mexican sandwich booth inside Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis, with his 68-year-old sister for more than 25 years. Since early December, four of his 10 employees have stopped showing up to work, out of fear they will be detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, he says.

González, 65, is worried, too, he says. The trained chef, who immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico City in 1982, now carries his passport everywhere. His average monthly revenue is down roughly 50%, he estimates. He and his sister, who typically looks after the company's books, are working 12-to-15-hour shifts on their feet making tortas to keep the business running while they're short-staffed, he adds.

González says small-business owners in Minneapolis like him fear for their personal safety, their community's safety and their companies' survival as ICE agents flood the city. The U.S. federal government's ""Operation Metro Surge"" brought thousands of ICE agents into Minneapolis beginning in December, and tensions between law enforcement and protesters escalated after two Americans — Renée Good and Alex Pretti — were killed by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents in January.

Residents have seen their day-to-day lives reshaped, and local small-business owners are no exception. Many of the businesses along Lake Street — a six-mile stretch of road in Minneapolis that's home to an estimated 2,000 restaurants, marketplaces and shops — are experiencing an estimated 40% to 100% drop in revenue compared to last winter, says Marie Campos, communications and marketing manager at Lake Street Alliance, a nonprofit that supports small, primarily immigrant-owned businesses in that corridor.

Minneapolis' small businesses were vulnerable even before December, says Richard Trent, executive director of the Main Street Alliance, a nationwide small-business network. Businesses, some of which survived the Covid-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests, had to recalibrate their business models due to U.S. tariffs on imported goods and federal cuts to Medicaid funding, he says.

Now, with customers and staff members alike staying at home — concerned about witnessing violence or being arrested themselves — sales are plummeting and businesses are running out of cash to pay for their expenses, says Trent.

As the biggest city in the state by population, Minneapolis tends to sway the entire state economy, Trent says. One-third of the Minnesota-based small businesses in Trent's network, which typically operate with a relatively low amount of cash flow already, are ""on the verge of collapse right now,"" he estimates.

""When small business has a cough in Minnesota, the entire state catches a cold ... When small business is suffering, it can literally bring entire state economies to their knees,"" says Trent, noting that roughly half of U.S. job creation comes from small businesses.

Ordinarily on weekends, Midtown Global Market bustles with live music, laughing children and a diverse array of businesses, says González. It's quieter now, with multiple shuttered storefronts, though González has heard people blowing whistles outside to signal that ICE agents are nearby, he says.

Roughly half of Minneapolis' immigrant-owned businesses have temporarily or permanently closed due to safety concerns or lack of staff since early December, Campos estimates. Other businesses are temporarily closing or cancelling events, too.

Some are refashioning themselves as community centers for locals who need warmth or free coffee while protesting or patrolling in the sub-freezing weather. Many business owners recall how community support helped them financially survive the pandemic and George Floyd protests that embroiled Minneapolis in 2020, says Campos.

""[They] recognize the community has given so much back to them,"" she says. ""It is the environment here where you don't turn your back on the community that has supported you.""

Pilllar Forum, a café and event space in northeast Minneapolis, is one such organizing hub, says owner Corey Bracken. The business has a history of hosting protesters, and its revenue is actually up compared to this time last year, whether due to local community support or simply being open when others are closed, says Bracken. But even for businesses not facing imminent closure, stress is high.

On Jan. 11, one of Pilllar's baristas called Bracken to report an incident with ICE agents outside, Bracken says. The barista told Bracken that agents ""picked up"" two people who'd left a nearby Latino-owned grocery store, and the barista and some of Pilllar's patrons rushed outside to blow their whistles, only to be pepper sprayed and beaten with batons, Bracken says.

""Sometimes, it just feels like they're out there to show their presence. Other days, it feels like they're there to intimidate and bully,"" says Bracken. Four confrontations involving ICE agents have occurred outside Pilllar so far in January, he says.

ICE did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment. When asked by ABC News about economic concerns for the region, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin pointed to the protests and what she referred to in a statement as ""the fact sanctuary policies won't allow us to work with state and local law enforcement,"" the outlet reported on Jan. 21.

On Tuesday, three days after Alex Pretti was killed, U.S. President Donald Trump said, ""we're going to de-escalate a bit,"" referencing the tension in Minneapolis in an interview with Fox News. As of Wednesday, the two Border Patrol agents who fired guns during Pretti's shooting are on administrative leave.

The emotional toll has expanded beyond the confines of the city, says Jessica Peterson White, a city council representative in Northfield, roughly 35 miles south of downtown Minneapolis and home to Carleton College and St. Olaf College. Businesses there are similarly closing due to being short-staffed, she says.

Peterson White, a business owner herself — of Content Bookstore, in downtown Northfield — says that other owners in her store's neighborhood have been questioned by ICE agents about their hiring practices. She's begun training her employees on their constitutional rights and what to do if an ICE agent comes into the shop and starts harassing customers, she says.

""I can hardly do my normal job of just running my business, keeping my inventory flowing ... because I spent so much time assessing and reassessing, 'What feels safe today?'"" says Peterson White. She and her staff spend some of their working hours dropping off supplies to a group organizing grocery delivery services for families afraid to leave their homes, she says.

""Our Penguin Random House boxes are exactly the right size [for groceries],"" Peterson White says.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108258379-1769620937051-gettyimages-2258087506-_sm13604.jpeg?v=1769620989&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-28 22:58:27.780189

Trump administration defends immigration operation as lawful

Jan 28 (Reuters) - A Minnesota federal judge on Wednesday canceled a contempt of court hearing for acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Todd Lyons after the agency complied with an order to release a wrongly detained Ecuadorean man, but the judge warned he could hold ICE leaders in contempt if the agency continues to flout court orders.

Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick J. Schiltz in Minneapolis had ordered acting ICE director Todd Lyons to appear in court to explain his agency's failure to comply with nearly 100 court orders during President Donald Trump's controversial immigration enforcement surge.

The hearing could have been damaging to ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as they grapple with lawsuits and the fallout of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens by ICE agents in Minnesota.

Schiltz said on Wednesday that he remained concerned by ICE's failure to comply with 96 court orders in 74 cases - what he said was likely an undercount - and warned he could hold ICE leaders in contempt of court if they failed to fix the problem.

""ICE is not a law unto itself. ICE has every right to challenge the orders of this court, but, like any litigant, ICE must follow those orders unless and until they are overturned or vacated,"" Schiltz said in an order.

The Trump administration sent thousands of immigration agents to Minneapolis and Saint Paul beginning in December in what officials described as an operation to enforce immigration laws and stop fraud.

Minnesota's Democratic leaders have accused Trump of flooding the streets of those cities with armed agents out of animus for their Democratic political leanings, and as part of his feud with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.

Trump and Walz on Monday said they spoke by phone about de-escalating tensions in Minnesota following weeks of protests and the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by ICE agents.

The Minnesota Attorney General's Office is suing to block the surge or rein in ICE tactics, accusing agents of racially profiling citizens, making unlawful stops and arrests and sowing fear in communities.

The Trump administration has said the operation is lawful. A judge has yet to rule on the state’s request.

The legislative push comes as immigration enforcement has become one of the earliest tests of Gov.
Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, who said they are intended to prevent immigration enforcement from interfering with access to essential services and democratic participation.

Republican leaders pushed back on the Democratic proposals Wednesday, arguing the focus should remain on economic issues rather than challenging immigration enforcement.","Virginia Democrats on Wednesday rolled out a package of bills designed to curb federal immigration enforcement activities in the commonwealth. The lawmakers framed their effort as a public safety measure to protect the state’s immigrant communities and other residents, following deadly clashes between ICE agents and protesters in Minnesota and as media polls show Americans’ growing discontent with the federal government’s aggressive campaign to rout out undocumented immigrants.

The proposals, which have been filed but not yet advanced through committee, would restrict where and how federal immigration and border patrol agents can operate and limit cooperation from state and local authorities.

At a morning news conference at the state Capitol in Richmond, Democratic lawmakers said the legislation aims to prevent what they described as aggressive, unaccountable federal enforcement actions from taking place in Virginia communities and to ensure immigrants and other residents can access schools, hospitals, courthouses and polling places without fear.

“House Democrats are here for one reason. We’re charged with protecting all Virginians,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, told reporters. “It’s Virginia citizens, all Virginia residents, our neighbors, and keeping our communities safe.”

Simon tied the legislative push to the deaths of Alex Pretti, a hospital ICU nurse who cared for veterans, and Renee Nicole Good, a Minnesota mother of three, during recent federal enforcement actions.

“Alex Pretti, a VA hospital ICU nurse, was just trying to help a woman who’d been knocked to the ground, he was shot in the back 10 times by federal agents. He was shot like a dog in the street. Renee Good, a mother of three, shot in the head,” Simon said.

Democrats did not provide a response Wednesday on a reported federal plan to establish an ICE detention facility in Hanover County, nor did they elaborate in detail on the bills they expect to advance this session.

The legislative push comes as immigration enforcement has become one of the earliest tests of Gov. Abigail Spanberger’s administration, following Democrats’ takeover of statewide offices and both chambers of the General Assembly.

Shortly after her Jan. 17 inauguration as Virginia’s 75th governor, Spanberger moved quickly to reverse a signature Republican immigration policy by rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that had urged state police and corrections officers to help carry out federal immigration enforcement, a step that advocates said fueled fear in immigrant communities.

But Spanberger’s move did not end existing agreements between state or local agencies with the federal government.

Democratic lawmakers said their own proposals are designed to draw clearer boundaries between federal immigration enforcement and state and local institutions, particularly schools, hospitals, courthouses and polling places.

“We can enforce the law and respect the Constitution,” Simon said. “We hold criminals accountable without terrorizing communities. That’s what real public safety looks like.”

Bills restricting enforcement locations and cooperation

Several of the new proposals were introduced by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, who said they are intended to prevent immigration enforcement from interfering with access to essential services and democratic participation.

Lopez’s House Bill 1440 would prohibit federal immigration enforcement in certain “protected areas” owned or operated by the state or local governments, including hospitals and health care facilities, schools at all levels, offices of commonwealth’s attorneys and other locations designated by the attorney general.

Under the proposal, employees of those facilities could not knowingly allow federal immigration enforcement into nonpublic areas for enforcement purposes. Violations would be punishable as a Class 1 misdemeanor, with limited exceptions.

HB 1441 would restrict state and local law-enforcement officers from assisting or cooperating with federal immigration enforcement operations, unless they are acting under a valid judicial warrant, subpoena or detainer, or are otherwise required by law.

And HB 1442 would prohibit immigration enforcement activity within 40 feet of polling places, locations where election results are being certified, or recount sites. Lopez said the legislation is meant to ensure that voters are not deterred from participating in elections.

“Public safety includes protecting the most fundamental right in a democracy, the right to vote without fear,” Lopez said. “What we have seen from ICE agents is intimidation.”

Courthouse protections

Another proposal, HB 650 by Del. Katrina Callsen, D-Albemarle, would restrict civil arrests inside courthouses. At the Chesterfield County Courthouse alone, at least 14 undocumented individuals were arrested last summer, drawing sharp rebukes from public officials, civil rights groups and lawmakers but praise from former Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

The measure would prohibit such arrests of people who are attending court proceedings, traveling to court or leaving court, including witnesses and family members, unless the arresting authority presents a judicial warrant or order that has been reviewed by a designated official.

Violations would be punishable as contempt of court.

“Courthouses should be places of justice, not fear,” Callsen said at the news conference. “People have to be able to enter a courthouse to testify, attend hearings and comply with the law without worrying that they’ll be snatched, detained or disappear on their way in the door.”

Callsen said the bill is aimed at preventing a breakdown in the justice system when people are afraid to participate.

“When people are afraid to show up, crimes go unreported,” she said. “That is not what public safety is about.”

Data, masking and cooperation limits

Other bills filed this session address transparency and cooperation with federal authorities.

HB 7, introduced in December by former Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, now a state senator, would prohibit most state and federal law-enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings while performing official duties, with exceptions for health protection and tactical operations.

The bill would create criminal penalties, allow civil lawsuits against officers who violate the rule and eliminate sovereign immunity as a defense.

And HB 1438 by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would prohibit state and local agencies from entering into agreements that authorize officers to perform federal immigration enforcement functions. Existing agreements would have to be terminated by Sept. 1, 2026.

The bill would also limit inquiries into a person’s immigration status and create a cause of action for violations.

And Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, said data privacy and constitutional protections are also central to the legislative effort.

“No one should have their personal information swept up, shared or misused without due process or without their consent,” Tran said. “Our legislation is proactive. It’s responsible, and quite frankly, it’s our duty.”

Senate counterparts

Across the hall, Sen. Saddam Azlan Salim, D-Fairfax, announced earlier this week that he introduced companion legislation, including bills mirroring the courthouse arrest restrictions and facial covering bans.

A third bill, SB 783, would limit agreements between state or local agencies and federal immigration authorities and expand data-collection requirements under the Virginia Community Policing Act to track the presence and actions of federal immigration officers during stops.

In a statement, Salim sharply criticized recent federal enforcement actions.

“ICE has murdered another Minnesotan, and we need to call it what it is: state violence, plain and simple,” Salim said, adding that his bills are intended to ensure that “no agency, no badge, and no president is above the law or the value of a human life.”

All three of Salim’s proposals advanced in a Senate Committee Wednesday afternoon.

Republican leaders pushed back on the Democratic proposals Wednesday, arguing the focus should remain on economic issues rather than challenging immigration enforcement.

House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, and Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, said Democrats are straying from an affordability agenda that leaders in both parties have identified as a top priority this session.

“That should be the focus,” McDougle said. “Not political games like gerrymandering, not political games like fighting with D.C.”

Asked about the Democratic measures, Kilgore said, “Virginia has absolutely no say in what the federal government is doing.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-98/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img_4799-1024x7681769640691.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=_T-mBdRg,N,,2026-01-28 19:57:53.216432

The brief supports Minnesota v. Noem, filed by the State of Minnesota in federal court on Jan. 12, which argues the increased presence of ICE and other federal agencies in the Twin Cities area is not based on an “urgent need for enhanced and aggressive immigration enforcement,” but rather “to cause chaos” and as punishment for state and local policy, a violation of the 10th Amendment.

An amicus brief — or friend of the court brief — is a legal document that allows a party not named in the case to provide an outside perspective on an issue under litigation.

“ICE’s occupation of American cities must end now,” Denver Mayor Mike Johnston said in a statement on Wednesday. “President Trump unleashed this reckless and lethal ICE invasion, and now parents are so afraid of being abducted they’re scared to take their kids to the hospital or leave the house without their passports or birth certificates.”

Operation Metro Surge is an ongoing federal immigration enforcement effort launched in December 2025 that placed more than 3,000 federal agents in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

“ICE isn’t keeping us safe from the bad guys,” Johnston said. “Right now, they are the bad guys — and the longer they remain on our streets without immediate reforms, the more people are in danger.”

President Donald Trump softened his tone Monday on the immigration crackdown in Minnesota, touting productive conversations with the governor and Minneapolis mayor as he sent his border czar to take charge of much of the enforcement effort, according to the Associated Press.

Some federal agents were expected to leave as soon as Tuesday.

“What is happening in Minneapolis is not something that should ever happen in America,” Denver City Council President Amanda Sandoval said in a statement. “Families, immigrant and otherwise, are living in fear, and two American citizens are dead.”

Johnston told reporters at a news conference on Monday, where he rolled out his 2026 citywide goals, that he is “heartbroken and furious” about what’s happening in Minneapolis.

“I would want ICE out of my city as quickly as he (Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey) would, because as he said, it does not make the city safer,” Johnston said. “So, I feel as strongly as he does, and I would support him or another mayor as much as I would expect them to support us in the situation.”

This is not Denver’s first legal move challenging the president. The city has filed five lawsuits and two additional amicus briefs against the Trump administration to protect federal funding, preserve city policy, and defend individuals’ rights to seek reproductive care.

“We know this administration isn’t interested in accountability,” Sandoval said. “So, it’s time for the court to show it still cares about the rule of law and prevent this from happening to another city.”

COURT ORDERS ICE TO STOP UNLAWFUL ARREST AND DETENTION OF REFUGEES

Federal Judge Grants Temporary Restraining Order Halting Operation PARRIS

(Minneapolis, MN) – Today, a federal judge issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) preventing the Trump administration from arresting and detaining lawfully resettled refugees in Minnesota under Operation PARRIS while the case challenging the practice proceeds. The judge also ordered the immediate release of all detained refugees in Minnesota and the release of those taken to Texas within five days. The TRO was granted as part of a class action lawsuit filed by a group of refugees represented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), Berger Montague, and the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law (CHRCL). The Advocates for Human Rights, a non-profit providing on-the-ground legal representation to impacted refugees in Minnesota, is an organizational plaintiff.

“For more than two weeks, refugees in Minnesota have been living in terror of being hunted down and disappeared to Texas,” said Kimberly Grano, Staff Attorney, U.S. Litigation at IRAP. “This Temporary Restraining Order will immediately put in place desperately-needed guardrails on ICE and protect resettled refugees from being unlawfully targeted for arrest and detention.”

The following is an excerpt from Judge Tunheim’s order:

“Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully—and importantly, a right not to be subjected to the terror of being arrested and detained without warrants or cause in their homes or on their way to religious services or to buy groceries. At its best, America serves as a haven of individual liberties in a world too often full of tyranny and cruelty. We abandon that ideal when we subject our neighbors to fear and chaos.”

The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration is illegally targeting lawfully present refugees in order to trigger a mass termination of refugee status, rendering them vulnerable to deportation. Since the announcement of Operation PARRIS on January 9, armed ICE agents have been going door to door arresting members of the Minnesota refugee community, including children and the elderly, and sending them to detention camps in Texas. Some were subjected to intense questioning, while others have remained imprisoned for over a week, many shuffled between facilities in shackles. Those who have been released were left on the streets of Texas, usually without money, identification, or any way to get home. The TRO will remain in place until briefing on a preliminary injunction is complete.

“We are glad that the Court put a stop to ICE’s campaign of terror against our refugee neighbors. Today’s ruling is an important win, and a reminder that our courts are a powerful check,” said E. Michelle Drake, Executive Shareholder at Berger Montague. “We’ll keep fighting for Minnesota’s refugee and immigrant communities. Minnesota has always welcomed refugees, who come here to escape persecution and build new lives.”

“Two weeks ago, armed ICE agents began imprisoning refugees who fled persecution, came here lawfully, and built a life in Minnesota,” said Sarah Kahn, Senior Staff Attorney, CHRCL. “Through this order, the judge recognized that this brutal and senseless practice is illegal and required that the government respect longstanding protections for refugees.”

“Operation PARRIS’s scheme of detaining lawfully present refugees is an unprecedented assault on core human rights that are enshrined in both the 1951 Convention and the 1980 Refugee Act – rights that The Advocates is committed to protect,” said Michele Garnett McKenzie, Executive Director of The Advocates for Human Rights. “We are grateful the Court has stepped in on a temporary basis to stop the Government’s attack on the refugee community, and we look forward to presenting our full case in the Court.”

The letter indicated that DHS was analyzing the potential purchase of the warehouse at 10900 Hopewell Road (A/K/A 16220 Wright Road), Williamsport, MD, to establish a “new ICE Baltimore Processing Facility” for use by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Elements of the project mentioned in the letter include, “construction of holding and processing spaces, office space, public-facing visitor space and installation of amenities, such as cafeterias, bathrooms, and health care spaces”. Proposed site improvements mentioned in the letter include, but are not limited to, “installing, upgrading, or rehabilitating existing parking areas, fencing, site lighting, landscaping, drainage/stormwater, recreation areas and cameras. Tentage and guard shacks may also be installed.”

The letter was sent under a federal law that requires DHS to inform the local government of its determination on whether the project impacts historic property. In the letter, DHS communicated that the undertaking results “in a finding of No Historic Properties Affected”. The federal law in question does not give the County any opportunity to overrule that determination.

Generally, the Federal Government does not need to respect local zoning regulations that conflict with federal mandates (often referred to as the Supremacy Clause). As such, federal government entities historically have not sought the zoning approval of Washington County Government for projects and has not done so with respect to the property at 16220 Wright Road.

It is Washington County’s position that decisions about land use are best made locally. However, the legal reality when property is owned by the Federal Government is clear. Washington County is not able to legally restrict the federal government’s ability to proceed. DHS has not notified Washington County that a purchase has taken place.

“The business community in Minnesota prides itself in providing leadership and solving problems to ensure a strong and vibrant state,” begins an open letter signed by 60 chief executives on January 25, the day after a federal agent fatally shot nurse Alex Pretti.

“In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused co-operation among local, state and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution,” continues the statement.

The message did not hit the mark for some. Bill Weihl, founder of corporate climate advocacy group ClimateVoice, called it “mealy mouthed”.

Tanya Khotin, strategic sustainability adviser at Khotin Impact Strategies, says its use of the language of the administration — focused on “de-escalation” — makes it “worse than saying nothing at all”.

Experts make clear that businesses’ failure to speak clearly on immigration enforcement is not just a moral failure, but a tangible business risk that is growing by the day.

I’m in no question that corporate leaders are viewing all of this as unhealthy, but their silence is really noteworthy right now

Michael Posner, NYU Stern

A statement by the American Sustainable Business Network, which represents smaller businesses including Patagonia and Ben and Jerry’s, goes further: “We demand a nation where safety is rooted in justice, not fear, and where our elected representatives actively defend constitutional rights, accountability and the rule of law.”

Companies’ responses matter because although President Donald Trump’s rhetoric in recent days hints at a partial retreat, federal budget decisions indicate that sustained, elevated funding for immigration enforcement is the new normal in the US.

While last year the Trump administration was firing federal workers in droves and cutting billions of dollars of “wasteful” grants and loans for the energy transition, it was also significantly increasing the budget of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.

The new normal

The 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act increased ICE’s budget from roughly $10bn a year over the past decade to more than $170bn over the next four years. This is higher than the yearly budget for all local and state law enforcement agencies combined across the entire country.

Stern Center for Business and Human Rights director Michael Posner says businesses have an obligation to speak publicly on the issue.

“The greatest beneficiary of human rights, support for democracy, support for independent courts and the free press has been the US business community,” he says. “I’m in no question that corporate leaders are viewing all of this as unhealthy, but their silence is really noteworthy right now.”

Khotin says this silence is particularly striking because it represents “a complete 180” after spending years talking about sustainability.

Corporate executives in the US are not fearful for their lives, they’re fearful that they’ll get a bad deal. That fear is leading us down a very bad path

Tanya Khotin, Khotin Impact Strategies

The consensus is that companies’ silence is rooted in fear of retribution from the administration. A survey of American businesses conducted in late 2025 found that legal teams are more worried about direct attacks from the Trump administration than ESG-related litigation and regulation.

“I acknowledge that there’s fear, but I don’t respect the sentiment or actions around that fear,” says Khotin. “Corporate executives in the US are not fearful for their lives. They’re fearful that they’ll get a bad deal. That fear is leading us down a very bad path.”

The cost of getting it wrong

While Posner argues that a drift away from the rule of law threatens the future of all US businesses, early warning signs from some companies show how the risk can become meaningful fast.

In late 2025, following months of protests and artists withdrawing their work from the platform, Spotify stopped running recruitment adverts on behalf of ICE. Hotel chain Hilton has also faced protests and a burgeoning boycott campaign after the parent company cut off a Minneapolis hotel in its network for refusing to grant service to ICE agents.

Neither company has released an official statement or responded to Sustainable Views’ requests for comment.

Guides for citizens to establish which companies have contracts with either the Department of Homeland Security or ICE, and direct their advocacy accordingly, are freely available online.

Rutgers University labour studies professor Eric Blanc describes activism against companies affiliated with ICE as a “winnable struggle that can put serious pressure on the administration”.

Trillium Asset Management chief advocacy officer Jonas Kron says businesses should pay close attention to these campaigns, and “heed those calls before matters get worse”.

What businesses should do

Posner wants to see corporate leadership teams communicating with customers, employees and investors publicly in defence of the rule of law — and now might be a good time for them to consider immigration enforcement within their human rights due diligence programmes.

“In a broad sense, due diligence means ensuring employees are being treated with dignity and without discrimination,” Posner says. “Responsible employers should be doing everything in their power to make sure employees are safe and not subject to government harassment.”

Most business leaders have been willing thus far to wait for a bond market or stock market reaction to send the message to the administration that it has stepped out of bounds. That will not work in this situation

Jonas Kron, Trillium

Kron draws a sharp contrast between corporates’ silence now versus their response to the January 6 2021 insurrection on the Capitol. At the time, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said it represented a “sad and shameful chapter” and that those responsible should be held accountable.

Apple has not commented publicly on immigration enforcement, but news reports indicate Cook has distributed an internal memo saying he is “heartbroken” by the events in Minneapolis and is calling for “de-escalation”. The company did not respond to a request for comment.

Kron says chief executives need to “communicate directly and forcefully to the administration that this [use of lethal force] needs to stop”.

“Most business leaders have been willing thus far to wait for a bond market or stock market reaction to send the message to the administration that it has stepped out of bounds,” adds Kron. “That will not work in this situation.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/77fa6e82-5b68-4b16-8366-46dd506c03ef.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 19:58:04.612937

Border Patrol agents have the same responsibility, but generally operate within 100 miles of the United States border.
Can Border Patrol operate within American cities?
Some have been surprised to see Border Patrol agents operating in American cities that are more than 100 miles from the border, such as Minneapolis.
But Border Patrol agents do have limited powers even when they are far from the border, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit that promotes immigrant rights.","As interactions between federal immigration enforcement agents and protesters have turned increasingly heated and even violent in cities across the country, many wonder what the law says about the legal powers of officers and the rights of protesters.

Those violent interactions reached their latest apex Jan. 24, when federal law enforcement shot and killed Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti after tackling him and discovering a gun that, in videos of the incident, appeared to be secured in his waistband.

Protesters have argued that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol employees are violating constitutional rights after the Trump administration sent a surge of agents into major American cities. Government officials say protesters are interfering with officers who are simply enforcing the nation's immigration laws.

The Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE and Border Patrol, didn't respond to a request for comment on legal questions surrounding federal immigration enforcement.

Here are answers to key legal questions on what immigration agents and protesters are allowed to do, and where there are gray areas in the law:

Is ICE law enforcement? What about Border Patrol?

Yes, ICE and Border Patrol are both part of law enforcement. But that doesn't mean they are just like police who enforce state and local laws.

ICE agents are specifically tasked with enforcing federal immigration laws. Border Patrol agents have the same responsibility, but generally operate within 100 miles of the United States border.

Can Border Patrol operate within American cities?

Some have been surprised to see Border Patrol agents operating in American cities that are more than 100 miles from the border, such as Minneapolis. But Border Patrol agents do have limited powers even when they are far from the border, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit that promotes immigrant rights.

Under U.S. law and regulations, Border Patrol agents are generally authorized to enter cars, trains, boats and airplanes without a warrant to search for unauthorized immigrants within 100 miles of the border.

Beyond that, Border Patrol agents are still immigration officers with nationwide enforcement authority, just not with the special boarding and searching authority that's specific to the 100-mile zone. That means Border Patrol agents outside the 100-mile zone may interrogate and arrest people under the same general authority ICE has and under the same restrictions.

Do you have to obey federal immigration agents?

The public must obey lawful orders from federal immigration agents, but not unlawful ones. Here's what that looks like in practice:

ICE agents have the right to enforce immigration laws without being obstructed, and they can give orders under that authority.

However, both citizens and noncitizens have rights under the Constitution, including the right to gather, protest, remain silent, and refuse to consent to a search.

Can ICE agents detain you? Arrest you? Go into your home?

ICE agents can only detain or arrest someone based on evidence that the person violated federal immigration laws, or evidence that the person committed another federal crime in an agent's presence.

To detain someone, the ICE agent must have reasonable suspicion of the crime. To arrest that person, the agent needs to have a reasonable belief that the crime occurred.

To enter a person's private home, law enforcement typically needs a judge-signed search warrant. That's based on the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.

However, the Associated Press obtained an internal ICE memo dated May 12, 2025 that asserts agents may forcibly enter a residence based on an administrative warrant if they are arresting someone who is under a final legal order to be removed from the country.

Unlike a typical search warrant, an administrative warrant may simply be signed by a supervising ICE officer, without independent review by a judge.

That type of forced home entry is sure to face legal challenges, legal experts said.

""I think the overwhelming consensus among lawyers is that the government's argument is bogus and not well supported by the Fourth Amendment,"" former federal prosecutor Kenneth P. White told USA TODAY.

""The analogy I use is the 'Parks and Recreation' episode where Ron Swanson has a permit,"" White said, referring to the TV sitcom character who headed a local Parks and Recreation Department. ""That's just a note from him saying, 'I can do what I want.'""

What are protesters allowed to do?

Under the First Amendment, protesters may assemble peacefully, chant, hold signs, and express their opposition to ICE agents' presence or actions in public spaces. Those areas include sidewalks, public parks, and areas outside government buildings, as long as protesters don't block access or interfere with government operations.

Protesters are also allowed to film federal agents who are working in public areas.

Some parts of the U.S. have buffer zone restrictions surrounding law enforcement. In Florida, people must stay at least 25 feet away from first responders once they are given a verbal warning. Those laws are currently facing scrutiny in the court system.

Federal law prohibits obstructing justice, and some have argued that tactics such as tracking ICE agents and alerting others of their presence with whistles could veer into that territory.

White, the former federal prosecutor, called that argument ""dubious"" since, to win a case in court, prosecutors would need to prove people were blowing whistles to obstruct proper law enforcement. Some protesters may be using the whistles to alert others that agents who could violate constitutional rights are in the neighborhood.

""You would have to know and intend to assist someone in committing a crime or evading detection or arrest,"" White told USA TODAY. ""But a lot of the protesters are just saying, 'These ICE agents come in and they rough up and beat up or shoot anyone who doesn't look White. So, we're warning everyone that they're coming.'""

Can federal agents be prosecuted?

Federal agents can be prosecuted, but those prosecutions can also be tricky.

Federal prosecutors are allowed to bring federal charges against agents. However, those investigations may face political interference.

The Trump administration has said it's investigating the recent killings of not only Alex Pretti, but also Renee Nicole Good, a mother who was shot multiple times by an ICE agent while in her SUV. But, according to state authorities, the FBI backed out of a joint investigation into Good's death.

In addition, six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned over the decision by Justice Department leadership not to investigate Good's shooter, according to reports by The New York Times and MS NOW, which cited anonymous sources.

State prosecutors can still pursue charges against federal agents based on state crimes. However, the federal agents could argue they are immune from state charges under a constitutional provision – the Supremacy Clause – that puts federal law above state law.

Federal courts have allowed some state prosecutions to go forward despite that immunity argument, after concluding the federal officers weren't reasonably carrying out lawful federal duties, according to Bryna Godar, a staff attorney at the University of Wisconsin Law School's State Democracy Research Initiative who wrote about the prosecutions in Lawfare, a legal publication.

Can Alex Pretti and Renee Good's families sue?

People alleging federal law enforcement officers violated their constitutional rights – such as by using excessive force – don't have many legal options.

In the past 40 years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected attempts to take federal officers to court in such cases, saying Congress established a separate option under a federal law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

That option involves filing an administrative claim against the U.S. government, rather than against the actual officer. Alleged victims then have to wait for a rejection or for six months to go by, at which time they can sue the federal government in court. Even then, they won't get a jury trial. Instead, a judge will hear the case.

It would be different if the officer were a state or local agent. In those cases, members of the public could take the officer straight to court and, if they can show the officer isn't shielded by certain immunity protections, get a jury to hear the case.

A lawyer for Renee Nicole Good's family has already acknowledged that difficult reality.

“It is always challenging to pursue litigation against state and local law enforcement officers because of the many immunities they are afforded,"" Antonio M. Romanucci, who is representing the family, said in a statement.

""But legal action against the federal government is even more complex, as it requires victims to navigate the byzantine, time-consuming processes mandated by the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),"" Romanucci said.

""This process will not deter us in any way from fervently pursuing justice on behalf of Renee Good,"" he added.

What's the status of the Minnesota case?

Minnesota sued the Department of Homeland Security, asking a judge to put a halt to the Trump administration's surge of immigration agents into the state.

Minnesota said the surge is violating a constitutional provision that protects state sovereignty because local law enforcement is being forced to clean up ""messes"" ICE has created, rather than respond to other 911 calls and do their normal work. However, the Trump administration says the surge is about enforcing federal immigration laws and has led to the arrest of more than 3,000 people who weren't authorized to be in the country.

A federal judge in Minnesota is still deciding whether to temporarily block the surge of agents as the lawsuit proceeds.

It's one of several immigration-related cases that could make it to the Supreme Court.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/27/USAT/88377287007-20260127-t-143511-z-257592037-rc-2-v-7-jasyyah-rtrmadp-3-olympics-2026-icesecurity.JPG?crop=8237,4635,x0,y428&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-28 19:16:11.782484

What was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown, including the targeting of U.S. citizens and violent measures against peaceful protesters.

Illegal immigration and inflation were the twin issues that helped Trump win the election. Now, opinion polls show a growing number of Americans, including key independent voters, are unhappy with Trump's handling of both, putting Republicans on the defensive ahead of the midterms.

The polling shows most Republicans still back Trump’s push for mass deportations, but a sizeable minority are uneasy with a heavy-handed approach by federal immigration agents, which led to the shooting deaths of a mother of three and a nurse in Minneapolis this month.

Just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of immigration, the lowest since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday. While 84% of Republican respondents said they support Trump on the issue, a fifth of them said federal agents had gone ""too far"" in their crackdown.

If those sentiments persist, they could spell trouble for Republicans in November, when Democrats are aiming to take control of Congress and block the president's agenda.

""This was one of the president's number one advantages and it has become a political liability for him,"" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. ""The base is still pretty comfortable with what Trump is doing. But it's not just about the base, it's about swing voters.""

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration's approach to immigration.

""President Trump wants all Americans to feel safe in their communities. That guiding principle is why the President has promised to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our country, urged local Democrat leaders to work with federal law enforcement, and called for a fact-based investigation into the tragic death of Mr. Pretti,"" she said in a statement.

Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the December deployment of nearly 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul provoked a national uproar with the fatal shootings of Renee Good on January 7 and then Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were killed during confrontations with immigration agents at protests.

Trump has taken steps in recent days to ease tensions in Minneapolis, dispatching his border czar to oversee the operation and signaling a willingness to work with state officials.

It remains unclear whether these moves reflect a recognition of the political risks to Republicans in November midterms, or are simply an effort to regain control of an operation that has produced daily images of masked federal agents responding aggressively to protesters confronting them in the streets.

Trump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers about how to recalibrate his immigration strategy, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks. The discussions included a possible reduction of agents deployed to Minnesota and narrowing the focus there to deportations rather than broad enforcement operations, the sources said.

Some Republican strategists warned that a renewed focus on deporting the “worst of the worst,” as Trump promised during the campaign, was necessary to retain support from moderate Republicans and independents in November.

""Americans support secure borders, and they're willing to forgive mistakes when you're cleaning up the previous administration's fiasco - provided you're seen as targeting criminals,"" said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who worked on Hispanic outreach for Trump's 2020 campaign.

""The margin for error narrows dramatically if you’re perceived as going after gardeners and taco truck ladies.""

SOME REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS PUSH BACK

Trump's softening of his tone and sidelining of Gregory Bovino - a top Border Patrol official and a lightning rod for opponents of the crackdown - followed days of criticism from a number of Republican lawmakers and governors.

A Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Chris Madel, made headlines for his decision to quit the race over the tactics being used by federal agents in Minneapolis and what he described as indiscriminate arrests.

Zach Duckworth, a Republican state senator who was recently activated in the Minnesota Army National Guard to support local law enforcement, said he was so alarmed by top Trump officials labeling Pretti a ""domestic terrorist"" that he wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and others to object to the characterization.

He told Reuters that was a ""tipping point,"" saying many of his constituents in the Minneapolis suburbs are centrists and support removing violent criminals, but are alarmed by the scope and tactics of Trump’s operations, which have also swept up people in the country legally.

Democratic strategists see opportunity for their party, which polls show is not trusted by most Americans to handle immigration, especially after former President Joe Biden's slow reaction to stem immigrants entering the country illegally.

Michael LaRosa, a former Biden White House official, told Reuters the overwhelming opposition by Democrats to Trump's crackdown would help to drive both progressive and moderate voters to the polls in November.

While an increasing number of traditional, moderate Republicans now oppose Trump's immigration crackdown, Democrats are at risk of misdiagnosing the moment and overplaying their hand, said Scott Rasmussen, a veteran pollster.

""Where the left is making a mistake on this issue is they think they're winning a fight to build support for illegal immigrants,"" Rasmussen said. ""Where the right, especially the MAGA right, is wrong, is they are thinking everybody voted for what's happening in Minneapolis.""

In interviews with eight Trump supporters in Delano, a Republican-leaning town just 10 miles (16 km) west of downtown Minneapolis, all said they stood squarely behind the president's immigration crackdown and would vote Republican in the midterms.

But they also acknowledged that immigration agents appeared poorly trained and ill-prepared for the task before them, and expressed worries that widespread criticism of ICE's tactics could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.

Jake Blackowiak, 33, worried the controversy could contribute to the party losing at least one chamber of Congress in the midterms.

""The Republicans aren't going to be able to pass any more laws or advance the agenda he promised,"" he said.

Former Republican Minnesota congressman Gil Gutknecht urged the White House to clarify its enforcement targets.

""To say that all the people who are being rounded up are violent criminals is an exaggeration,"" Gutknecht said in an interview. ""They're not all murderers and rapists.""

He said it was too early to tell whether the deaths in Minnesota would impact the midterms, but the White House should continue its immigration enforcement operation.

Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia M. Dyer attached to her post a letter from the Ypsilanti Public Schools superintendent sent to parents late Monday that reported the arrests hours earlier by U.S. Immigration and Customs agents at a bus stop near an undisclosed school as classes were letting out.

""Earlier today, following reports of ... ICE presence near our campus, we have received confirmation that several parents in our community were taken into custody while off school grounds,"" said the letter by Ypsilanti Public Schools Superintendent Alena Zachery-Ross. ""There are no words to capture the pain, fear and disruption this causes for our scholars and their loved ones.""

Zachery-Ross said she had no further details about the arrests, ""as ICE frequently provides no advance notice, does not contact Metro Dispatch, and leaves families, schools, and communities to process the impact on their own in the aftermath,"" the letter said.

Zachery-Ross, who did not return a phone call Tuesday, added: ""I want to be clear: Ypsilanti Public Schools remains a safe sanctuary for all scholars. We do not voluntarily cooperate with ICE, nor do we grant them access to our school buildings or property without a valid judicial warrant.""

Phone calls and emails to ICE and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office were not immediately returned Wednesday.

In her Facebook post, Dyer, the county sheriff, said the arrests happened at a bus stop.

""Based on the information we currently have, ICE activity did not occur on any school grounds,"" Dyer wrote. ""However, it did take place near bus stops in the Ypsilanti community, and it appears that parents connected to local schools were targeted at a bus stop in Ypsilanti during student drop-off times.

""I am continuing to seek answers in partnership with our local leaders and schools,"" the sheriff wrote. ""Children deserve to feel safe traveling to and from school, and actions like these can undermine that sense of security and cause lasting harm.

""My office will continue to be there for our immigrant families,"" the sheriff wrote. ""We do not ask about immigration status, nor do we engage in immigration enforcement, and we will continue that practice, as our job is to protect and serve all residents regardless of immigration status. I will continue seeking answers, as any ICE activity especially near bus stops and/or other sensitive locations is deeply disturbing.

In her post, Dyer also stumped for the passage of Michigan Senate Bills 508–510, ""a legislative package that aims to protect 'sensitive locations,' including schools, hospitals, and places of worship, from immigration enforcement actions. I strongly hope these bills are supported to provide clearer protections and additional safeguards for our communities.""

The bill package — introduced by State Sens. Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield; Mary Cavanagh, D-Redford Township; and Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit — defines ""sensitive locations"" as ""an educational institution; a place of worship; a hospital; the site of a funeral, wedding, or other public religious ceremony; a courthouse; or the site of an organization that is assisting children, pregnant women, victims of crime or abuse, or an individual with significant mental of physical disabilities,"" according to an analysis by the Senate Fiscal Agency.

The bills were referred last year to the Civil Rights, Judiciary and Public Safety Committee. They come amid a similar push to ban federal enforcement around Michigan's courthouses.

The Michigan Supreme Court is scheduled Wednesday to hear public comment to determine if the justices want to amend the court rules to prohibit warrantless civil arrests, including immigration enforcement while a person attends a court proceeding or has legal business in the courthouse, regardless of whether they're in the country illegally or not.

Democrats across Michigan and nationwide have criticized President Donald Trump's campaign to deport people who are in the United States illegally, while protests have been held locally and nationwide. ICE agents have been assaulted multiple times during protests, while federal agents in separate incidents fatally shot two people during Minneapolis demonstrations. In both cases, authorities said the agents' lives were in danger, although critics said the shootings were unnecessary and that the agents overreacted.

The U.S. Supreme Court in September lifted restrictions that barred the Trump administration from conducting immigration-related raids in the Los Angeles area based on broad criteria, such as speaking Spanish or gathering at locations day laborers often congregate. In the 6-3 ruling, the justices put a hold on a federal district judge's order that found that ""roving"" raids were likely unconstitutional because agents were detaining people without probable cause at car washes, bus stops and Home Depot parking lots based on stereotypes.

Last week, Sterling Heights Mayor Michael C. Taylor called ICE ""monsters"" and said he'd like for the city's police department to cut off all ties with federal law enforcement agencies, although police officials said they don't plan to pull officers from federal task forces.

Dear Representative Maria Elvira Salazar,

I’m writing this letter to you about something that affects families in my community and millions across the country: deportation, and how it tears families apart. Immigration isn’t just a debate about borders, it's a global issue about human rights and the hope for a better life. People cross the U.S borders to escape poverty, violence, and fear, but they often face another kind of fear and uncertainty once they arrive: being detained or deported.

In an article called “Under New Strategy, US Flies Deportees to Southern Tip of Mexico,” supported by the Pulitzer Center and written by Daniel Gonzalez, it is reported that of the nearly 60,000 immigrants in U.S. immigration detention in late September, over 70% had no criminal records. That means most of the people being held at detention centers aren’t dangerous nor criminals. These individuals are hardworking parents, family members, and neighbors who are just trying to live the American dream. Deporting them doesn’t make America safer, it just breaks families and communities apart.

I know this pain personally. My father was detained by ICE on his way to work, yet no crime was committed. My siblings and I were devastated. Thinking about him locked away, and not being able to come home, made me bawl my eyes out. My younger siblings kept asking where he was and when he was coming home, and I didn’t know what to tell them without making them more scared. I had to help my mom a lot more, it felt like I had to step into a parent role even though I’m still a kid myself. None of the opportunities my siblings and I have today would even be possible without the sweat, hard work, tears, and sacrifice my parents went through when they crossed the border. My dad is such a hard-working man. He came from nothing, started a business, and built a life for us. In Homestead and Florida City, stories like mine aren’t rare. Families live with constant fear that someone they love could be taken away at any moment. No child should feel the pain of a parent being taken away.

In my community, I’ve seen ICE stop people without asking if they have a license or residency card. Some of them actually have legal status or work permits, but they’re still treated like criminals. How is deporting innocent people who work hard and pay taxes making America any better? I’ve known people who were taken even though they had valid licenses and the right to work here. That isn’t confusion or a mistake, that’s discrimination. When the main provider of a household is taken, the entire family is in financial stress. No one should live in that kind of fear, especially in a place they’ve called home for decades.

What makes it worse is that immigrants are a big part of what keeps our country strong. According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy’s report, undocumented immigrants paid about $96.7 billion in taxes in 2022. They work hard, pay taxes, and help our communities grow, yet they’re treated like criminals. It’s just so unfair. It turns the American dream into a nightmare where stability can disappear in an instant. The decisions the U.S. makes about immigration will shape how other countries treat migrants, influence global human rights policies, and affect the movement of families across entire regions of the world.

That’s why I respect your work on the Dignity Act, because it recognizes that immigrants deserve a chance to live and work here legally. However, another way to make this system fairer is to make immigration laws clearer and more accessible. Many migrants truly want to follow the law, but the process is complicated and very slow. Currently, people wait years for documents, hearings, or updates. I’m asking you to support reforms that expand access to work permits, speed up court and processing times, and also create a system that actually gives families who built their lives here a reliable way to stay together. Increased funding for legal assistance programs would enable families to understand the process and follow the law. It's important to end unnecessary detentions for individuals who pose no threat and have no criminal history.

Representative Salazar, I’m asking you to keep fighting for families like mine. Behind every immigration case is a child crying at night and a parent missing at the table. I have seen immigration issues tear families apart and leave children scared. I am proud to be the child of undocumented immigrants. We just want the chance to live without fear, and you have the power to make that possible. I believe you can.

Thank you for listening and for standing up for the people who want to live a better life.

Sincerely,

Yeslin

Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have previously pushed back against Trump’s immigration crackdown by barring local authorities from cooperating with federal officers. Illinois and Minnesota have also sued the Administration in an effort to stop the surge of federal immigration agents into their states.

Such legal challenges are another mechanism through which states can push back against federal immigration enforcement. But legal experts have told TIME that unless a court decides to block the federal activity, the extent to which state and local authorities can resist such operations is effectively limited to restricting their cooperation.

Trump, for his part, has sought to crack down on that non-cooperation by levying repeated threats and attacks against cities and states with sanctuary policies in place during both his presidential terms, contending that they shield “criminals.”

“No more Sanctuary Cities! They protect the Criminals, not the Victims. They are disgracing our Country, and are being mocked all over the World. Working on papers to withhold all Federal Funding for any City or State that allows these Death Traps to exist!!!” wrote on Truth Social last April.

Amid escalating backlash against his aggressive immigration agenda, Trump on Sunday called for Congress “to immediately pass legislation to END Sanctuary Cities.”

The resolution emphasized free speech rights in and around the John Moss Federal Building in Downtown Sacramento, which houses federal agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

It also highlighted the protection of city data or information that could be used to trace or determine a person’s citizenship or immigration status by any ICE agent.

Vice Mayor Karina Talamentes said during the city council meeting that Minneapolis has shown what’s possible when community, government, and advocates fight back against authoritarian government. She emphasized that the people in Sacramento are afraid.

“People are nervous to call the police department,” Talamentes said. “People are nervous to ask for help. Kids are scared to go to school. People are scared to ask for government resources, afraid they'll get on a list. And there's just a lot going on in our country.”

Since 1985, Sacramento has been a sanctuary city, which means it’s a local jurisdiction that chooses not to assist federal agents with immigration enforcement.

But many attendees said the city leaders need to go further in protecting immigrants, protesters and courtwatchers.

CapRadio reported a court watcher was attacked and hospitalized Friday, Jan. 23, outside of the John Moss Federal building.

Hundreds of activists and community members showed up at City Hall on Tuesday to call on the city to do more to protect immigrant communities. There were over 600 internet comments and over 90 in-person comments.

As those suits move forward, here is a list of the five amendments the Trump administration has effectively suspended in Minnesota.
More broadly, every resident of the Twin Cities has had their First Amendment rights violated.
The Fourth Amendment The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.
And yet, DHS has been instructing ICE officers that they can invade people’s homes without a judicial warrant.","For nearly two months, the Trump administration has unleashed immigration officers on the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul in a siege of increasing cruelty and violence. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers are dragging citizens from their homes, deploying five-year-olds as bait, arresting demonstrators, and using pepper spray on protesters like bug repellent at a barbecue. They have shot three people, including the executions of Renée Good and Alex Pretti.

The immorality of the moment is clear. But the images of uninhibited brutality visited by federal law enforcement officers onto a metropolis also run counter to our Constitution—both its restrictions on federal power and the freedoms it is meant to protect. Simply put, the violence inflicted by ICE doesn’t just feel wrong: it is a violation of our basic rights, ones that hold the line between democracy on one side and fascism and dictatorship on the other. In Minnesota, we’re plainly seeing why these rights underpin our system of government.

Despite the rampant violations carried out by armed agents of the state, they are unlikely to see much justice in the courts. That’s because in recent decades, the Supreme Court has limited people’s ability to sue individual federal officers who violate their rights. Such suits were accepted and even common in the 19th century. But in sad irony, the same Supreme Court justices who say it’s important to continue the country’s earliest legal traditions have made them all but impossible. “They’ve made it incredibly difficult to sue federal officers for abuse of power, no matter how egregious,” says David Gans, a scholar at the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive nonprofit law firm.

But some avenues remain to stopping the violence and obtaining legal relief. Namely, a federal judge can order the government to stop illegal behavior, and there are multiple lawsuits mounting constitutional challenges to both ICE’s tactics and the entire invasion, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, more broadly. As those suits move forward, here is a list of the five amendments the Trump administration has effectively suspended in Minnesota.

The First Amendment

The First Amendment protects the rights to speak freely, to assemble, and to protest. This includes the right to observe federal government action and to protest against it. Crucially for Minnesota, this includes a right that CBP and ICE really don’t like: the right to record their actions. The First Amendment also protects against government retaliation for these acts—these rights would be meaningless if the government could chill them through retaliation. The government cannot target and punish you because of your views or other First Amendment-protected actions.

But under Trump, it’s impossible to count the ways in which all these rights have been violated every day in Minnesota, not to mention around the country. Obstructing law enforcement is not a protected act, but every video of an ICE officer arresting or pepper spraying an observer who is not obstructing them serves as documented evidence of unconstitutional retaliation for a protected act. Every time an officer physically assaults or detains someone who is simply observing or protesting, that’s a violation of the First Amendment.

This isn’t just theoretical. In a case filed by a group of Twin Cities observers demanding relief from ICE’s tactics, federal Judge Kate Menendez found this month that ICE likely violated the First Amendment rights of two plaintiffs when agents arrested them in what appeared to be retaliation for watching them. Menendez likewise found that a third plaintiff likely suffered unconstitutional retaliation for protected activity when an ICE officer pepper sprayed him as he stood aside a road. Menendez’s opinion provides a glimpse of how ICE is using chemical agents to chill Minnesotans’ free speech: “In one instance, agents drove slowly past, opened the car door, and ‘sprayed [a bystander] directly’ as the bystander ‘held their arms out’ and ‘was standing on the edge of the road.’ As the bystander moved away from the car, ‘another agent on foot came behind them and sprayed them directly in the face again,’ before spraying ‘into the small crowd.’” Menendez issued an injunction against against arrests and pepper spraying for people peacefully observing, but, in a move that shows the limits of local judges’ ability to intervene, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals soon blocked the order.

Reports from the Twin Cities show that the reprisals can sometimes be petty, but no less unconstitutional. One woman who followed a CBP vehicle in her car was stopped by an officer who warned that he was using facial recognition software and knew who she was. Three days later, the Department of Homeland Security revoked the woman’s Global Entry and TSA PreCheck. The government cannot revoke a privilege as punishment for exercising First Amendment rights. A local toy store says DHS initiated an audit of employment and payroll records mere hours after the owner’s daughter criticized ICE to the media. (DHS denies that the investigation of a store with just five part-time employees is tied to her critical comments.)

More broadly, every resident of the Twin Cities has had their First Amendment rights violated. That’s because this entire operation appears to be reprisal against Democratic cities in a Democrat-led state for its collective choice not to vote for Donald Trump in the last three elections. “I won Minnesota three times and I didn’t get credit for it,” Trump said this month when asked about his federal occupation. “That’s a crooked state. California’s a crooked state. We have many crooked states.”

A lawsuit seeking the end of ICE’s operation brought by the state of Minnesota and the cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis references these comments: “President Trump did not win the majority of votes cast in Minnesota in 2016, 2020, or 2024. His claims to the contrary, in the context of being asked to explain actions his administration is taking in Minnesota, suggests a desire to punish the State for voting for his opponents.” It further points out that in his first year back in office, Trump has only targeted Democratic cities with surges of federal officers and National Guard troops, and that he is attempting to withhold billions in federal dollars from Democratic states as well. Moreover, Minnesota is not a logical site of the nation’s largest immigration enforcement operation: a mere 1.5 percent of its population is undocumented, many of whom are already known to DHS. An ulterior motive is obvious.

On Sunday, Minnesota and the Twin Cities bolstered their lawsuit’s argument by adding a Saturday letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to the case’s record, which offered to “bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota” if the state hands over to the feds, among other databases, its voter rolls. There’s no rational way to make sense of violence and havoc the Trump administration is inflicting on the Twin Cities as normal immigration enforcement; it only makes sense as punishment upon the entire population for its political preferences. And that’s unconstitutional First Amendment retaliation.

The Fourth Amendment

The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. It would be impossible to list every way federal officials have violated this in Minnesota.

ChongLy Thao, a US citizen, was arrested when ICE broke down his door and entered his home with guns drawn. They refused to look at his identification and dragged him out of his house in underwear, through the snow, and whisked him away. When they realized he was a citizen an hour or two later, they returned him. This is a textbook example of unconstitutional behavior. If you want to breakdown a door, you need a warrant signed by a judge.

“The government doesn’t have a right to go into your house without your consent unless they have a warrant from a judge,” says Jill Hasday, a constitutional law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.

And yet, DHS has been instructing ICE officers that they can invade people’s homes without a judicial warrant. Last week, the AP reported on a secret DHS memo, closely held and only shown to a small number of high-ranking officials, justifying that new policy. This violates the Fourth Amendment and Supreme Court precedent—which is probably why it took a whistleblower for the public to find out about it.

Unreasonable traffic stops are also banned by the Fourth Amendment. In the case brought by the ICE observers, Judge Menendez found ICE likely violated the Fourth Amendment rights of three plaintiffs when officers stopped their cars after they followed ICE vehicles.

Then there are the Kavanaugh Stops, stops based on a person’s race or ethnicity and named for Justice Brett Kavanaugh because he defended the use of race in ICE stops in a September opinion. There are innumerable accounts of people being detained by ICE for no apparent reason but the color of their skin, including in Minnesota. In a press conference, a local police chief shared that nonwhite off-duty officers were being pulled over by ICE. The result is that nonwhite citizens and legal residents are afraid to leave their homes.

ICE and CBP are also testing the boundaries of the Fourth Amendment with their use of facial recognition software and data to track people’s locations, learn their identities, addresses, and other key information about them. According to 404 Media, ICE contends that they can circumvent the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement if they buy such data from third party companies rather than request it from, for example, AT&T or Verizon. Unless the courts or Congress address this issue, the government will find ever more dystopian ways to use for-profit surveillance tools to circumvent people’s constitutional rights.

The ceaseless violence ICE uses in its encounters with both immigrants and protesters also violates the Fourth Amendment. ICE is smashing windows to pull people out of cars and kneeling on their necks and backs when they detain them, among other violent tactics. “From the Supreme Court’s view, when the police seize you or your property and do so violently, that’s a Fourth Amendment problem where it’s excessive and disproportionate to law enforcement need,” says Gans. “What all the videos circulating show is just a shocking level of violence being meted out that far exceeds any law enforcement interest.”

This would include the killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti. The officers who pulled the triggers could be charged as murderers under state or federal criminal law, though the Trump administration certainly won’t do that. But constitutionally, explains Gans, these killing of US citizens who did not agree with ICE’s mission would be treated as “an unreasonable use of deadly force” under the Fourth Amendment.

The Fifth Amendment

The Fifth Amendment protects against deprivation of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” The Supreme Court has held that this includes an equal protection guarantee as well. The result is that the Fifth Amendment would also be implicated in Kavanaugh Stops, which are both unreasonable searches and seizures and an equal protection violation.

The Tenth Amendment

The final amendment in the original Bill of Rights stipulates that “the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.” It is, essentially, a guarantee of state sovereignty in areas not given to the federal government. Minnesota, Minneapolis, and St. Paul argue in their suit fighting ICE’s deployment that Operation Metro Surge violates the 10th Amendment, as the federal government has effectively invaded the Twin Cities in order to coerce the state to turn over voter data and to force cooperation with immigration enforcement that the state is not required to give. “They’re trying to hijack the state’s legislative process,” a lawyer with the Minnesota Attorney General’s office told Menendez during a Monday hearing. “They’re trying to get us to turn over voter rolls. What does that have to do [with immigration?] The federal government is attempting to bend the state’s will to its own—and that is not allowed under the Constitution.”

Menendez hasn’t issued a ruling, and it’s unclear if she will accept 10th Amendment arguments. But the federal government does seem to be signaling it is willing to exit Minneapolis in exchange for the surrender ofkey aspects of the state’s sovereignty.

The Fourteenth Amendment

The Fourteenth Amendment, enacted in 1868, guarantees that “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” As the text says, this was aimed at the states in the aftermath of the Civil War, but the Supreme Court has applied much of its protections to the federal government. The drafters of the 14th Amendment were trying to eradicate state-sponsored violence against Black people—police invading their homes, stealing their property, and hunting them down for violent treatment and even massacre—that have shocking parallels to what is happening to people of color in Minnesota today.

“One of the lessons that you draw from the 14th Amendment is, if you can’t be physically secure in your community, you can’t really enjoy liberty and freedom and all the promises the Constitution provides,” explains Gans. “As we see ICE terrorizing these communities, that lesson is brought home in a really strong way.”

Beyond explicit constitutional violations, the suit brought by Minnesota, Minneapolis, and St. Paul alleges a final breach of our founding document. “There is also a ‘fundamental principle of equal sovereignty’ among States,’” the plaintiffs state. “The Supreme Court has long recognized that our nation ‘was and is a nation of States, equal in power, dignity, and authority,’ and that this ‘constitutional equality of the States is essential to the harmonious operation of the scheme upon which the Republic was organized.’”

There’s a deep irony in this allegation. It quotes from Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision in which Chief Justice John Roberts rehabilitated the “principle of equal sovereignty” to strike down the 1965 Voting Rights Act requirement that states and other jurisdictions with a history of suppression have changes to voting laws cleared by the Department of Justice. Congress violated this principle because, according to Roberts, the selection of states was no longer tethered to conditions on the ground. Roberts, who has a long history of attacking the VRA, was incorrect about the existing conditions, but held that Congress needed a significant and current justification in order to treat states differently.

Roberts created the equal sovereignty principle for modern times, but its origins actually lie in the court’s infamous Dred Scott decision finding that Black people could never be citizens. In that case, Chief Justice Roger Taney found that empowering Black people as citizens in free states would overrule the equal sovereignty of slave states that denied Black people political power.

Today, Minnesota invokes the idea for opposite purposes: Rather than to stymie the freedom of one race, they seek to wield it to protect nonwhite people. Roberts’ rehabilitation of the equal sovereignty principle remains an untested weapon against Trump’s war on Democratic states. Its success may turn on whether courts will question Trump’s allegations of corruption against Democratic states. It’s certainly not the use Taney or even Roberts envisioned for a principle that many legal scholars see as both bogus and tainted with racial animus. But Roberts breathed fresh life into it nearly 13 years ago, and now the courts—and possibly Roberts himself—are being asked if they really mean it.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-28 21:57:49.836133

Militarized ICE & Border Patrol Immigration Enforcement in Minnesota

As the Trump administration unleashes highly militarized ICE enforcement operations in Minnesota, and across the United States, CVT’s clients and staff have had wide-ranging impacts, including five clients being detained and flown to a detention facility in Texas. CVT has responded with news media interviews and an extensive volunteer program delivering groceries for clients who cannot leave their homes for fear of being detained. Here are some highlights from recent weeks:

“Executions in the streets. Abductions by masked security forces at gunpoint. Mass detention in an abusive and unaccountable system. Disinformation campaigns to justify it all. These are the tools and tactics of the world’s most repressive regimes,” writes Scott Roehm, senior director of global justice and accountability, in this statement after the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Border Control agents in Minneapolis. Scott writes, “Whether to stand up and say ENOUGH isn’t a choice about politics. It’s about ending up on the right, or wrong, side of history.”

Whether to stand up and say ENOUGH isn’t a choice about politics. It’s about ending up on the right, or wrong, side of history.”

-Scott Roehm, senior director of global justice & accountability

CVT issued this press release with information about Minnesota-based clients who were detained by ICE. All individuals have lawful immigration status; all are asylum seekers with work permits. One client was detained while going into her workplace; the ICE agents tackled her in the snow in front of her co-workers. “Survivors recognize these actions. This is the kind of harsh and militaristic environment they fled,” said Sara Nelson, program manager.

Pioneer Press: Alison Beckman, senior clinician for external relations, is quoted in this article by Frederick Melo in the Pioneer Press, titled “For Some Refugees, Immigration Actions in Twin Cities Are Familiar.” Ally said that clients are not able to leave their homes out of fear of the unjustified militarized ICE enforcement, noting, “This is exactly what our clients have fled from.” This article was picked up by Yahoo News.

KARE11 News: Sara Nelson spoke to Raya Quttaineh on KARE11, the Twin Cities NBC affiliate, in this story about the clients who were detained, mentioning that one client called her social worker from the ICE van. “The social worker could hear the client trying to explain to them that she was an asylum seeker, trying to show them her asylum receipt that shows that she applied and that her paperwork’s in order. And she was saying, ‘Sir, sir, why are you arresting me?’ And she could hear them laughing in the background, and they just wouldn’t answer any questions,” Sara said.

. . . she was saying, ‘Sir, sir, why are you arresting me?’ And she could hear them laughing in the background, and they just wouldn’t answer any questions.”

-Sara Nelson, program manager

Prior to that, CVT issued this statement in response to the ICE shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis that took place Jan. 7. The statement reads in part: “This devastating loss of life would not have happened but for this unprecedented, unjustified and overly militarized deployment across the country and now in Minneapolis . . . Over four decades, CVT has worked with survivors of torture from 88 different countries. This type of militarized enforcement is among the exact kinds of oppressive environments our clients have fled.”

This article by James Walsh in the Minnesota Star Tribune article mentions CVT’s having a social worker connection to a person who was taken by ICE and flown to Texas.

MinnPost: Sara Nelson was featured in this article in MinnPost that focused on how mental health is being impacted in Minnesota. Sara noted that clients who had already completed services called her again last week in the wake of the deadly ICE shooting.

KARE11 News: Alison Beckman spoke on the Sunday morning newscast on KARE11. Ally spoke about the impacts of the intensified ICE enforcement in Minnesota, sharing the perspective of clients and community members as militarized presence and arrests increase and a woman was shot to death by an ICE agent. Ally comments, “This is the very thing that they fled in their home countries and they’re starting to see it play out in front of them.”

This is the very thing that they fled in their home countries and they’re starting to see it play out in front of them.”

-Alison Beckman, senior clinician for external relations

LBC News, UK: Ally also spoke on London radio about the impacts on clients of the militarization of immigration enforcement and the deadly shooting. She spoke about why the flood of masked, armed officers making arrests brings back the kind of oppression clients fled. She commented, “We’ve had people who’ve been stable for quite some time who are suicidal again, who are not leaving their homes, who are absolutely terrified.”

New Immigration Restrictions Further an Agenda of Cruelty

CVT published this statement as the Trump administration announced it will restrict immigration visas for 75 countries. Yumna Rizvi, senior policy analyst, comments that “ . . . this needlessly creates panic and alarm and puts thousands in limbo, including those fleeing from torture and persecution. The president uses cruel and deceptive claims like this to vilify immigrants and perpetuate harm.”

Guantánamo Detention Facility is 24 Years Old

Ahead of the 24th anniversary of Guantánamo’s opening, 116 organizations signed this statement led by CVT and the Center for Constitutional Rights reaffirming that it must be closed, without repurposing it for any future detention regime, and that there must be redress for individuals who were held and whose rights were violated. The authors write, “The failure of past administrations to close Guantánamo continues to cause escalating and profound harm to the men who still languish there. It has also enabled what many feared, and against which we and others repeatedly warned: the repurposing of Guantánamo to detain others unlawfully.”

Scott Roehm is quoted in this article in the New York Times on the impacts of program closures on clients, saying, “We know for sure that survivors we are no longer able to serve are suffering.” This article was picked up by many global media outlets.

Commentary on Authoritarian Regimes

Dr. Simon Adams, then-president & CEO, is quoted in this article in InterPress Service on the United States’ history with authoritarian regimes and a new report from the UN special rapporteur on torture on the trade of implements of torture. Simon comments, “It is unconscionable that companies are allowed to promote these products inside the EU. It is grotesque that such products even exist. This trade in human cruelty should be completely banned.”

Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett on Wednesday set out to visit the Texas facility holding a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father whose detention has fueled protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota.

Castro said he and Crockett, who is also a U.S. Senate candidate, planned to meet with the family, who were sent to Texas after they were detained in a Minneapolis suburb last week. Castro said he also planned to speak with others being held at the facility in Dilley, where some detainees have described poor conditions.

Dozens of protesters waved signs and flags outside the South Texas Family Residential Center, where detainees inside staged their own demonstration over the weekend.

“We’re going to find out in a little bit whether they’re going to honor their word, what they said they would allow us to do, what we are legally entitled as members of Congress to do, which is to check on the welfare of these folks,” Castro said in a video posted on social media.

The trip is part of Democrats’ midterm-election year effort to conduct congressional oversight and highlight the consequences of the President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota and elsewhere.

Administration officials have previously denied some members of Congress entry to federal detention facilities, though Castro said detainees in Dilley have been allowed by the administration — or its private contractor running the facility — to sign up to meet him and Crockett.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, into custody Jan. 20 in Minneapolis as part of a sweeping operation that has wrenched the city and spawned massive protests from residents. Two U.S. citizens have been shot and killed by federal officers during the operation.

A federal judge on Monday issued a temporary order prohibiting the Trump administration from removing Ramos and Arias from the U.S. as their detention is challenged.

Democrats have criticized the Trump administration over their lack of access to ICE facilities.

Minnesota Reps. Angie Craig, Kelly Morrison and Ilhan Omar were denied access to detainees at a federal building outside Minneapolis on Jan. 10. The Department of Homeland Security has said the three Democrats did not comply with a new policy to give facilities seven days notice.

The same policy was invoked to deny Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, from entering the Dilley facility and another in Pearsall, Texas, last week. Murphy said the denials keep Congress from fulfilling its constitutional and statutory responsibility to conduct oversight of executive branch facilities.

A federal judge earlier this month declined to step in and force the administration to yield to lawmakers' demands for better access.

Castro, a prominent member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, accused Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a recent video of running a “lawless” immigration enforcement operation that is effectively a “bounty hunter organization.”

Like Castro, Crockett and her Senate Democratic primary rival, state Rep. James Talarico, are among the Democrats calling for Noem's impeachment. Crockett also voted against a pending appropriations bill that would fund Noem's department and the immigration enforcement agencies that fall under it.

“We absolutely have to clean house,” she said in a Saturday debate with Talarico. “Whatever that looks like, I’m willing to do it.”

The Republican-controlled House passed the DHS funding bill with the help of a handful of Democrats, days before 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti was killed. Several Senate Democrats said after Pretti's death that they would not approve DHS funding, even if it means a partial government shutdown starting this weekend.

But Mr. Guan had what appeared to be a strong claim, according to his supporters.
In 2021, Mr. Guan fled China, traveling through Ecuador before sailing on a small inflatable boat from the Bahamas to Florida.
“Their focus was mainly on how I arrived in the United States,” Mr. Guan recalled.
Despite the monthslong ordeal, Mr. Guan said that he did not regret his decision to flee to the United States.","A federal immigration judge on Wednesday granted asylum to a Chinese dissident who had taken great risks to secretly record his country’s mass detention and surveillance of Uyghurs.

Heng Guan, 38, was detained last August in upstate New York, and supporters feared that he would be sent back to China, where human rights activists said he would almost certainly face persecution.

After an outcry from human rights advocates, Democrats and The Wall Street Journal editorial page, the Trump administration sought to deport him instead to Uganda.

Then in late December, the administration dropped that request, but Mr. Guan has remained in immigration detention.

The judge, Charles M. Ouslander, said that Mr. Guan’s testimony was “credible and worthy of belief.” Judge Ouslander referred to a number of factors, including the State Department’s previous designation of China’s treatment of the Uyghurs in its far western region of Xinjiang as a “genocide.”

He also noted a letter submitted to the court by the State Department that described Mr. Guan’s role in documenting the Chinese government’s abuses.

Niles Gerry, a lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security, suggested during the hearing that the department could appeal the decision. The department has 30 days to do that, during which time Mr. Guan will remain in detention.

The decision is a rare defeat for the Trump administration’s hardline immigration effort. Winning asylum cases is now exceedingly difficult.

But Mr. Guan had what appeared to be a strong claim, according to his supporters.

In 2020, while he was living in China, he traveled to Xinjiang and secretly shot video of detention centers that held mostly Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group. The centers were part of a draconian campaign under the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to indoctrinate Uyghurs and root out what the Communist Party said were dangerous ideas fueling resistance and extremist violence.

In 2021, Mr. Guan fled China, traveling through Ecuador before sailing on a small inflatable boat from the Bahamas to Florida. While he was on the water, Mr. Guan released the footage, which documented hulking detention camps, detailing their high walls, guard towers and barbed wire.

It became rare visual evidence of the scale and brutality of China’s clampdown on the Uyghurs and refuted Beijing’s claims that people lived at the centers voluntarily.

In previous years, the Uyghur issue had become a major flashpoint in the relationship between the Trump administration and Beijing. And on the last full day of Mr. Trump’s first term, the State Department officially declared the Chinese government’s actions in Xinjiang a “genocide.”

Mr. Guan’s “compelling firsthand documentation added significant weight to the Trump administration’s own findings that the atrocities amounted to genocide,” said Rayhan Asat, a human rights lawyer at the Atlantic Council, a nonprofit that promotes international engagement. Ms. Asat’s brother has been imprisoned in Xinjiang since 2016.

After releasing the videos, Mr. Guan applied for asylum, joining the queue of more than three million people waiting for their case to wend through the overburdened court system. He had just moved to upstate New York when he was detained last summer after he was caught up in an immigration enforcement effort targeting his housemates.

In a telephone interview before his release, Mr. Guan said he gave the immigration agents his documents and told them that he had applied for asylum and had a permit to work legally in the United States. But, he said, the agents didn’t seem interested.

“Their focus was mainly on how I arrived in the United States,” Mr. Guan recalled. “So I told them the truth.”

Mr. Guan feared that he might be sent back to China. His mother, Luo Yun, who lives in Taiwan, has said that after the Xinjiang footage was released, even distant members of Mr. Guan’s family in China were questioned by Chinese police officers.

Mr. Guan’s concerns were hardly allayed in December when the Department of Homeland Security sought instead to deport him to Uganda, which has close political and economic ties with Beijing. “It felt very unreasonable,” he said.

Days later, the agency issued a new directive that limited deportation to Uganda to immigrants from most other African nations.

Despite the monthslong ordeal, Mr. Guan said that he did not regret his decision to flee to the United States. He said he understood why, after years of rising illegal migration, Mr. Trump was taking such a hard line. National immigration policies often fluctuated, he reasoned, and he happened to come at a time of tightening. “I’m just a little unlucky, that’s all,” he said.

America, he said, was a country that followed laws. Not long after he landed on a Florida beach in his boat, he had watched from afar as a car came to a stop at an intersection. “There was no one else around, no cars, no people, and yet this driver was still following the rules,” he recalled. “That left a deep impression on me.”

Mr. Guan said that the long days in detention had given him ample time to reflect, and he wanted to make a big life change. He had been more of a lone wolf, preferring to keep to himself. But while in the correctional facility, he struck up a friendship with other detainees, including an immigrant from Cameroon who helped pull him out of an especially difficult period emotionally.

It made Mr. Guan realize the value of human connection.

“I would like to help other people,” he said. “And maybe that can also help enrich my own life, too.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/15/us/politics/00hfo-nat-chinese-asylum/00nat-chinese-deport1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 17:14:26.944111

Amid the mixed signals from the White House, tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists say immigration raids had not slacked but appeared to be more targeted on Wednesday. The city has been convulsed by unrest, including confrontations between protesters and immigration agents, after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal agents, including Saturday's killing of nurse Alex Pretti.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media on Wednesday that federal agents had arrested 16 people in Minnesota for allegedly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement.

Trump's administration had indicated it will soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism.

The two border officers who shot at Pretti have been placed on administrative leave, according to an agency spokesperson, who added that it was ""standard protocol.""

A senior administration official said Homan's arrival would mark a shift to more traditional targeted operations rather than the broad street sweeps Bovino has led in multiple cities. Yet it remained unclear how much would change in a city where federal agents have regularly clashed with protesters.

Observers and activists told Reuters that Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday. They said there did now appear to be more of an emphasis on targeted exercises.

On Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific person.

If that person was not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun randomly stopping people and demanding to see proof of legal status, a practice that has enraged community members and led to heated encounters.

It is difficult to know precisely how many raids are taking place. Authorities do not share that information, and volunteers who track ICE and Border Patrol vehicles say many of their encrypted communication chats have broken into atomized, hyper-local groups, partly to avoid infiltration by federal agents.

""They definitely shift around,"" said Patty O'Keefe, a community ICE observer in south Minneapolis. ""Let up for a few days so people let their guard down, I think.""

One observer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe the change in tone from Trump meant there would be a meaningful slowdown in detentions.

""Like everybody out here, though, we can hope that maybe the change of having Homan come in could mean that ICE will shoot and kill less, that they won't attack people like us keeping watch on them,"" he said.

Bondi said 16 people had been arrested for assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement and that more arrests were expected. Among those taken into custody was Abdikadir Noor, a plaintiff in a civil lawsuit that accused immigration agents of using excessive force against protesters.

A federal judge in that lawsuit restrained officers from arresting or tear-gassing peaceful protesters, but an appeals court has paused that order.

DEMOCRAT OMAR ATTACKED

Under mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his attacks on Frey and Governor Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to lower the temperature.

But on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for saying the city would not enforce immigration laws: ""Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!""

Trump has threatened to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.

In response, Frey wrote on social media, ""The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws.""

In another sign that political tensions remain heated, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat and a frequent Trump target, was sprayed with an unknown liquid by a man with a syringe during a Tuesday town hall, where she called for the abolition of ICE.

Omar was unharmed. Minneapolis police arrested the suspect, Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, for third-degree assault. It was not clear whether Kazmierczak, who was booked into Hennepin County Jail, had an attorney.

The FBI is investigating the attack, and authorities believe the substance was non-lethal and non-chemical, a Justice Department official said.

Pretti, 37, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill officers, citing the handgun he was carrying.

But video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a restrained Pretti in the back.

The killing, coupled with the earlier fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer, has become a political crisis for Trump. A growing number of Republicans in Congress, who rarely buck Trump, have called for independent investigations into the shooting.

“It isn’t surprising because the Republicans have bent the knee,” Omar said during a December MS NOW appearance.","A man attacked Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar at a Tuesday town hall in Minneapolis, appearing to spray her with an unknown substance as she spoke about her desire to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.

Omar, who has represented Minneapolis since 2019 and has been an outspoken critic of the Trump’s administration’s immigration enforcement actions there, continued the meeting after the man was wrestled away from her podium by security.

“Here’s the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand. We are Minnesota strong, and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” she told the crowd. Later on X, she added: “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don’t let bullies win.”

When asked about Tuesday’s attack, Trump told ABC that he hadn’t seen the video, saying, “I don’t think about her.” He added: “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

The president regularly launches verbal and social media attacks against Omar, one of his most frequent targets, alongside other progressive women lawmakers in Congress — particularly those who are women of color. The vitriol he directs at the Minnesota Democrat has intensified alongside his attacks against other elected officials in the state, which has been at the center of his administration’s immigration crackdown since December. Trump has linked the raids, which initially focused on Minneapolis’ large Somali community, to federal prosecution of a series of fraud cases involving government programs and a misleading viral video about child care fraud. Trump referred to Omar as “a fraud” when asked about Tuesday’s attack.

Federal agents have been on the ground in the Twin Cities since December and recently killed two people in incidents that sparked national outrage. Omar has continued to call for abolishing ICE, urging Trump to “get your goons out of Minnesota.”

Trump announced this week that the Justice Department and Congress were investigating Omar, in a Truth Social post that also announced a separate shuffling of the officials in charge of managing immigration raids in Minneapolis. Under former President Joe Biden, the DOJ had opened an investigation into her finances and interactions with a foreign citizen in 2024, but closed it for lack of evidence, per The New York Times.​​

Tuesday’s attack is not the first incident of physical violence Omar has faced — beyond being inside the U.S. Capitol on on January 6, 2021, she was attacked at a state party caucus meeting as a staffer in 2014 — but rhetoric against the four-term representative has increased dramatically over the last few months, egged on by Trump.

Some members of Congress supported Omar on social media after the video of Tuesday’s attack spread online, including Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has previously spread hateful messages about her colleague, including calling her an “enemy of the state.”

On Tuesday night, Mace posted on X: “Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric — and I do — no elected official should face physical attacks. This is not who we are.”

Hours before the attack, Trump held a rally in Iowa and made derogatory remarks about Somalis and other immigrants as he has increasingly done over the last few months, mentioning Omar by name: “They have to show that they can love our country. Not like Ilhan Omar. Did you see that wiseguy? She’s always talking about the Constitution … She comes from a country that is a disaster.”

Omar has long been singled out by Trump alongside other members of the so-called Squad, a progressive group of women lawmakers that initially also included Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley. Since his first term, Trump has called them “not very smart,” suggested they hate the country and told them to “go back to where they came from.” Three of them were born in the United States, and Omar has been a U.S. citizen since 2000.

But beyond disparaging remarks from Trump, political violence has also skyrocketed in recent years. In 2022, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, was assaulted in their California home by someone who was looking “to kidnap and interrogate” the longtime lawmaker. Last June, former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed in their home. And last week, Florida Rep. Maxwell Frost was punched in the face at the Sundance Film Festival.

A U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) report released Tuesday found that threat assessment cases have climbed for the third year in a row, so far peaking in 2025 at 14,938 reported concerning statements and behaviors directed at lawmakers and their associates. The year prior saw 9,474 such incidents.

“Being a public servant shouldn’t mean risking your life in this way,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) out of Rutgers University. “When these kinds of incidents occur, and especially if the commander-in-chief doesn’t condemn them, it makes making the choice to run for office and voice your opinions — it has a chilling effect.”

The Brennan Center, a left-leaning think tank, has published analyses about the ways fear of violence impacts politicians’ policy positions and communications, as well as deterring people from getting into politics — one study found nearly 40 percent of local officeholders said abuse lessened their desire to run for reelection, with women and people of color more likely than White men to say the same.

Walsh added that while it’s hard to determine how many women decide not to run because of the threats of violence, there are still several cases of legislators, especially at the state level, leaving office for the safety of their loved ones.

Meanwhile, Omar has said she has not been supported by GOP colleagues throughout Trump’s repeated and increasing online attacks.

“It isn’t surprising because the Republicans have bent the knee,” Omar said during a December MS NOW appearance. “They’ve welcomed his disgusting rhetoric. I’m not expecting any of them to develop a backbone now.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ilhan_omar_attack.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 20:58:00.311233

Why it matters: Democrats are pledging to tank a broader funding package aimed at staving off a partial government shutdown at midnight Friday if Republicans don't agree to new constraints on ICE and other federal law enforcement.

""Senate Democrats are united behind a set of commonsense policy goals,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday after a private caucus meeting, adding, ""We want masks off, body cameras on.""

Schumer called on Republicans to either change the DHS spending bill to incorporate the Democrats' demands or strip it from the larger funding package.

The Senate is scheduled to take a procedural vote on the funding package on Thursday, and Republicans need at least six Democratic votes to pass it before the deadline.

The big picture: Democrats, from moderates to progressives, seem dug in on forcing changes at ICE.

Republicans this week have floated the idea of securing some of the changes Democrats want via executive action and not changing the funding bills.

To Democrats, given their lack of trust in the White House, that approach is a non-starter.

""Until ICE is properly reined in and overhauled, the DHS funding bill won't have the votes to pass the Senate,"" Schumer said on X on Wednesday.

The other side: Whether the demands are palatable to Senate Republicans and — perhaps more importantly the White House — remains to be seen.

""If the ICE agents and the Border Patrol agents weren't being doxxed and weren't being harassed and didn't have their families under attack, they'd be happy not to wear masks,"" Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) said regarding Democrats' mask ban.

Between the lines: Democrats shared few details about their proposals to end roving patrols and a ""tighten"" warrant use when immigration officers make arrests.

The text of the coalition letter is below and found online here with the list of signers.

Dear Members of Congress,

We the undersigned 1,025 organizations write to express our horror, outrage and deep grief about the news that federal agents have executed a human being in broad daylight on the streets of Minneapolis.

How many more people have to die, how many more lies have to be told, and how many more children must be used as bait and abducted, before Congress fulfills its responsibilities and stops these out-of-control agencies from continuing to violently attack our immigrant communities and communities of color, as well as their many allies and supporters?

We demand an immediate halt in all funding for these deadly operations until the violence, abuses, and deaths in American communities and in immigration detention centers stop. Congress must refuse to provide one dollar to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Border Patrol through the appropriations process and immediately take action to revoke the tens of billions already given through last summer’s reconciliation bill.

We demand that you act decisively and show DHS and the communities you serve that this cruelty and lawlessness is unacceptable and must end now. When federal agents are patrolling the streets of American cities and gunning people down in broad daylight, the bare minimum response is to stop the funding that enables these violent agencies to carry out these atrocities. You have the power and responsibility to stop this. What you do now will be remembered for future generations – take a stand today while you still have the power to do so.",https://www.ncjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/immigration-protest-jan-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 17:14:31.502320

Associated Press

WASHINGTON — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday.

Officers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.

READ NEXT: Minneapolis Border Patrol shooting: What to know about investigations, protests and immigration operations

A Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.

Investigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.

Separately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis. The Democrat had just called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign when she was sprayed.

Trump says ‘we’re going to de-escalate a little bit’

The developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti’s death, which was the second fatal shooting this month by immigration law enforcement.

By sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.”

The president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.

As he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.

Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff who had initially called Pretti “an assassin,” issued a statement suggesting CBP officers in Minneapolis “may not have been following” protocol. He said the Homeland Security Department’s initial statements about what transpired on Saturday was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”

Ecuador files a protest with the US Embassy

A video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.

International law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.

“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.

A “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’

After Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Trump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city’s police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”

Courts weigh in on detained immigrants

In Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.

Also in Texas, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of ICE to appear in his courtroom, the man’s attorney said.

Attorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.

Schiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.

Schiltz’s order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.

Schiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.

The Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

This escalation reached flashpoints with the fatal shooting of American citizens Renée Good on January 7, and of Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were shot by federal immigration agents during protests in Minneapolis.

In both cases, the Trump administration defended the killing as self-defense by the agent. Officials also denied state investigators access to the shooting scene.

“The killing of Renée Nicole Good illustrated what we have been saying all along: The attacks on immigrants are the tip of the spear on attacks on all Americans. This mass deportation agenda, as much as this administration had said it will only target ‘criminals’ — we are now seeing in real time that they are affecting everyone, noncitizen and citizen alike,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America´s Voice, at an American Community Media briefing held one day before Pretti’s shooting amid widespread protests.

Metro Surge

The ongoing protests are in response to Operation Metro Surge. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has called it “the largest immigration enforcement operation ever carried out,” involving the arrest of over 3,000 people.

The operation also involved the largest deployment of federal immigration agents in history. Some 3,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents are now operating in Minneapolis. That number is five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department, which has about 600 officers.

Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, discusses public reaction to ICE deployment in Minnesota, the fatalities that have ensued, and how these impact political opinions.

“Americans are seeing in real time what an [immigration] enforcement-only agenda looks like, and they’re recoiling from it,” said Cárdenas. “But even though most Americans reject what ICE is doing, that does not mean they support Democrat solutions for reforms … That’s why we have to navigate this moment carefully in terms of bringing people into our coalition.”

Public outcry

Immigration enforcement, and subsequent clashes between protesters and federal agents, is fracturing even Republican support for the administration’s actions.

A YouGov poll conducted a day after Pretti’s shooting found that “More Americans support than oppose abolishing ICE (46% vs. 41%).” A majority (57%) also “somewhat or strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. Only 37% approve.”

Meanwhile, a new POLITICO poll shows that one in five voters who backed Trump in 2024 say the mass deportation campaign is too aggressive. Moreover, 41% of Trump voters say that while they support the administration’s immigration enforcement goals, they disapprove of how the president is implementing it.

Ann Garcia, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project, explains the Trump administration’s directive on political dissent and how it could lead to state repression.

Legal tussles

The class-action and state lawsuits that have emerged to stop the immigration enforcement surge “show a dynamic where district courts are ruling in favor of plaintiffs on injunctions, which are just pauses, only to have circuit courts roll back those pauses,” said Ann Garcia, staff attorney for the National Immigration Project.

On January 26, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate a district judge’s injunction barring federal immigration agents from retaliating against protesters during Operation Metro Surge. The case involved Tincher v. Noem, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Minnesota on December 17, 2025 on behalf of six Minnesota residents.

Five days prior, an internal ICE memo was leaked authorizing agents to forcibly enter homes without a judge’s warrant, but only with an administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal.

“I imagine that will be challenged. There’s nothing legal about this,” said Garcia. “For many decades, courts have been abundantly clear on this point. Administrative warrants do not permit the government to enter a home or other private spaces. Only a judicially authorized warrant is valid to enter, search, arrest a person.”

Wider threats

“It’s a matter of the politicization of our judiciary,” she added. “Part of the reason that people are galvanized and going into the streets is because they realize that … at this point, it’s not just the freedoms of immigrant neighbors. It’s your freedom.”

Amanda Otero, parent of kids in Minnesota public schools and co-executive director of Take Action Minnesota, explains the steps Minnesotans are taking to form sanctuary school teams.

On the ground, “I’m seeing tens of thousands of my neighbors organized in local teams, providing rides and food support and rental assistance to families who are afraid to leave their homes and staying home, doing ICE watch and patrolling schools to make sure that our kids can come and go from school safely, and these kinds of initiatives are happening all across the state,” said Amanda Otero, co-executive director of Take Action Minnesota and a parent of two kids in Minnesota public schools.

“We are seeing catalyzing events every single day,” she explained. “The day before Renee was killed, at my child’s preschool, as parents were arriving, getting their little kids in their little snow suits up to the door and handing them over to the staff, teachers and parents looked up and, not a block away, watched federal agents tear gassing folks and arresting legal observers. Parents and teachers made eye contact and said, ‘Okay, kids, let’s go,’ and shoveled those kids in a little more quickly.”

Otero is part of a growing network of over 1,000 parents that have built sanctuary school teams in 40 public schools across Minneapolis. The teams are now training parents in other school districts statewide to peacefully ensure kids can safely enter and leave school. They are also offering food, rent aid and transportation to critical appointments for affected families.

“In Minneapolis and in Minnesota, I have never seen this many people get off the sidelines and take action, doing organizing to keep us safe,” she said. “The scale of what I’m seeing makes it very clear that whether you were supportive of ICE before or not, this moment is pushing so many more people to take a new step.”

Moral evaluation

“As lawyers, we would use the language of unconstitutionality. But really that’s just a substitute for the moral evaluation of what’s happening,” said Mark Tushnet, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School.

“One of the most encouraging things about the current situation is precisely the degree of popular opposition,” he continued. “Elected politicians say, ‘We ran on these programs,’ that ‘People are behind us’ … One way of showing it’s wrong is through popular demonstrations and resistance in the street.”

“It’s not the law in the abstract that solves these problems. It’s people standing behind their particular vision of what the law should be,” Tushnet added. “From the point of view of a constitutional lawyer: Don’t count on the courts, but go to the streets and the courts will follow.”",https://americancommunitymedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-23_ICE_protest_in_Minneapolis-11-e1769632047921.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 19:58:24.626050

As these actions expand nationwide, Congress must use its full authority to make sure the law is followed, government actions are transparent, and Americans' rights are protected. Congressman Costa's actions include:

IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT & ACCOUNTABILITY:

Strongly urged the House Judiciary Committee for an investigation into DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Under leadership, there have been violations of appropriated resources, disregard for the separation of powers, and patterns of lawless behavior reverberating throughout the agency.

Demanded President Trump to halt nationwide ICE raids targeting farmworkers, who are essential to our agricultural economy. Called on the Administration to stop enforcement actions harming farmworkers and collaborate with Congress on immigration reform.

Sought answers from DHS related to ICE Agents expressing concern over the conduct of ICE surrounding civilians and elected officials, and their refusal to identify themselves when asked by members of the public, and conducting such actions in plain clothing.

Pressed DHS and ICE on the illegal actions of the agency and demanded answers on how the Administration has ignored the legal and humanitarian protections afforded to current beneficiaries of DACA recipients despite clear protections.

Demanded annual budget bills include safeguards to require clear federal standards for immigration enforcement, including mandatory identification by federal personnel during arrests, a prohibition on the use of face coverings by agents and officers, required use of body-worn cameras by ICE officers, and strict adherence to Department of Homeland Security training standards before any new agents are placed in the field.

Conducted an oversight visit to Mesa Verde ICE facility, where individuals were being detained by ICE. ICE lacked clear answers and transparency during this visit, and the Trump Administration is currently facing a lawsuit over the unlawful restrictions they have placed on Congressmembers conducting oversight.

TAXPAYER PRIVACY & ITIN PROTECTIONS:

Sounded the alarm regarding the use of Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), expressing concerns regarding reports that negotiations were underway in regard to the use of ITIN for immigration enforcement.

Under U.S. Code, tax returns and taxpayers' information are strictly confidential and can only be disclosed under narrow exceptions that do not include immigration enforcement.

Pressed DHS on ITINs regarding the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between DHS and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), highlighting the need to uphold taxpayers privacy and not share protected information to carry out immigration enforcement.

Signed onto court filings defending longstanding tax confidentiality legal principles and the integrity of the Individual Taxpayers Identification Number (ITIN) program. The amicus brief focuses on the extensive legislative history demonstrating Congress's consistent intent to maintain a strict firewall between tax administration and immigration enforcement.

LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS:

Voted NO on the Department of Homeland Funding Bill, as the bill did not contain language to adequately protect families and communities from harmful enforcement practices, and it lacked safeguards explicitly preventing non-ICE personnel from conducting immigration enforcement without appropriate oversight.

Cosponsored H.R. 924, the NO BAN Act(link is external), legislation that would limit the President's authority to impose sweeping entry bans and prohibit discrimination in immigration-related decisions such as visa issuance, helping ensure immigration enforcement actions remain consistent with U.S. law and constitutional protections.

Cosponsored H.R.1061, the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act(link is external), legislation that would place guardrails preventing ICE and Customs and Border Patrol conducting enforcement actions near places people need to access safely such as: schools, hospitals, health clinics, shelters, food banks, domestic violence/victim service providers, courthouses, DMVs, Social Security offices, places of worship, funerals, and weddings.

Cosponsored H.R.4667, the VISIBLE Act,(link is external) legislation that would prohibit federal immigration officials from wearing non-medical facemasks and require agents to identify themselves, their agency, and their badge number during public enforcement activities. This requirement promotes transparency and accountability and helps members of the public confirm that they are interacting with legitimate government officials, not impersonators.

According to Ypsilanti Community Schools and the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office, ICE agents took some parents of local students into custody as they were waiting for a school bus.

Dr. Alena Zachery-Ross, Ypsilanti Community Schools Superintendent, called the circumstances ""a deeply distressing situation.""

""Earlier today, following reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence near our campus, we have received confirmation that several parents in our community were taken into custody while off school grounds,"" Zachery-Ross said in her letter dated Tuesday.

School officials did not say how many parents were taken into custody by ICE agents.

Both the superintendent and Washtenaw County Sheriff Alyshia Dyer said the ICE activity does not appear to have taken place on school property. Zachery-Ross said the school district's policy is that ""we do not voluntarily cooperate with ICE,"" and a valid judicial warrant would be required for federal agents to go into the school buildings or on school property.

Dyer said the ICE activity occurred near bus stops in Ypsilanti, saying that it appears ""parents connected to local schools were targeted at a bus stop in Ypsilanti during student drop-off times.""

Zachery-Ross said she is urging students to ""walk in groups"" or use ""trusted carpools"" for their transportation to and from school.

The Ypsilanti superintendent said she is working closely with the sheriff's office to monitor school sites, as well as working with the Washtenaw County Intermediate School District to support the students and their families who were involved in the situation.

""People shouldn't be afraid to go to school or church without facing detainment or worse from untrained, reckless, and unaccountable federal agents,"" state Sen. Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, who represents the district.

Zachery-Ross encourages families to keep their emergency contact information and care plans for children updated with the district.

""We will continue to advocate for your safety, your dignity, and your right to an education free from fear,"" she said.

It happened when the onlookers did not immediately leave an area of a South Portland parking lot where about six agents had gathered, according to two witnesses who recounted the episode in interviews. The projectiles left sticky, orange marks on their windshields, bumpers and car doors, they said, providing photos and videos to corroborate their accounts.

One video shows a group of about six officers approaching several vehicles in the lot. Two of them held rifles and one of them held a device that resembled a paintball gun. It is not clear what kind of threat the onlookers presented that would have justified the agent’s use of force.

The confrontation at the South Portland Home Depot last Friday afternoon is the first documented time during the Maine operation that agents have used crowd control weapons to deter public surveillance, underscoring the tension between those who say they are exercising their free-speech rights and agents who have warned them not to impede their work.

“I was not threatening them. I was yelling obscenities, but I was 50 feet away in my car with the window open and they came after me with guns and threatened to arrest me,” said Sabine Peirce of Portland, who said an agent fired at her sedan while they said she needed to leave because she was impeding federal law enforcement and could be arrested.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to inquiries about the encounter. The incident was reported later that evening to a tip line operated by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition. Video taken by another driver was posted to a website that tracks sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement across the country.

Peirce had driven to the Home Depot around 4 p.m. on Friday after witnessing an agent arrest a man about a half-mile away, near the Maine Mall. She was driving one of about four cars that approached a group of agents near the back of the lot by the service entrance.

One of the other drivers, Joshua Reynolds of New Hampshire, said that agents first approached an older woman driving a white Volkswagen who had gotten closest to the officers. They appeared to say something to her, then an agent shot projectiles at her car.

Reynolds assumed they might be pepper balls, which are deployed from devices that resemble paintball guns and release a powdery irritant. But these projectiles left a liquid mark, similar to drying glue, he said.

Travis Norton, a former police lieutenant in California and use-of-force expert, said he had never encountered paintballs used by law enforcement. Federal agents have used pepper ball guns among other “less lethal weapons” during intensifying enforcement actions across the country during President Donald Trump’s second term, according to Bellingcat.

When agents shot at the windshield and bumper of Reynolds’ car, he crept further toward them, he said. At that point, two officers approached with handguns drawn at their sides, he said.

Reynolds said he backed off quickly, pulling over a curb, when an agent approached his window and issued him a warning that spooked him, making him think of the case of an ICE officer who fatally shot a woman in her car earlier this month in Minneapolis. (A border patrol agent fatally shot a man trying to film officers there on Saturday.)

Reynolds did not immediately leave. He took another picture of the agents walking toward the cars, including two agents holding long guns against their chests. Both he and Peirce said they left soon after, after the agents had coaxed them back into the front of the Home Depot parking lot. Reynolds said that onlookers, presumably Home Depot customers, had stopped to watch and some appeared to be recording with their phones.

After leaving Home Depot, Peirce drove back to the Maine Mall area and called the event into a local hotline that is tracking ICE around Maine. A hotline representative confirmed her report.

“The goal has been to be peaceful and to document and show them … that the world is watching,” Peirce said. “There are eyes on them.”",https://themainemonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICE-Pepper-Balls-012726.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 18:18:52.642921

The proposed ICE facility is blocks from Western Heights High School and across the street from an Oklahoma City Fire Department station.","OKLAHOMA CITY — Dozens of outraged Oklahomans on Tuesday spent hours lambasting a proposed Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility slated to open in the south part of the city.

But city councilors, who spent over three hours listening to public comment about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s planned immigration processing center, said their hands were tied.

They said they have no power to stop the federal agency’s plans to convert a warehouse, located at 2800 S. Council Road, into a facility that would be used to detain, question and process individuals accused of violating immigration laws because of the Supremacy Clause, which mandates that federal law overrules state and local statute.

However, city leaders said they are none-the-less urging DHS to go through the special permitting process that applies to the private sector.

“It is the City of Oklahoma City’s longstanding position that decisions about land use are best made locally,” the city wrote in a statement. “The placement of a detention facility is an issue of local interest that would benefit from a public process involving residents, especially the neighbors of such a facility. Any private sector activity would be subject to such a process.”

A spokesperson for ICE did not immediately return a message left seeking comment Tuesday afternoon.

The impassioned public comment comes a little more than a month after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security first notified Oklahoma City leaders of its intent to purchase the warehouse to “support ICE operations” as a processing center, according to a letter sent to city officials last month.

Dozens of community members Tuesday shared emotional testimony and asked the City Council to push back against the proposed center, either by suing the federal government or finding other ways to support immigrant communities.

Laura Susana Tapia said she works with Oklahoma City’s Latino community every day and that despite Oklahoma City’s policy to not ask about immigration status when it comes to essential services, people are afraid.

“But that policy alone is not enough to ease the concerns of our communities when every day on our screens we are seeing families ripped apart, inhumane detention centers, and even the execution of U.S. citizens,” she said. “I ask you to please make decisions that empower our community to feel safe and protected in our homes.”

Several Oklahomans pointed to municipal action taken in Kansas City, Missouri, which created a five-year moratorium on non-municipal detention facilities, which would include ICE.

Legal counsel for Oklahoma City’s city council said action such as this would not be likely to legally restrict the federal government’s ability to proceed with the processing center in south Oklahoma City, according to a statement.

Tamya Cox-Touré, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, said that the ACLU is ready to help fight against the detention center and sue the federal government to push back against government overreach.

“We completely understand your position that you feel your hands may be tied, but we cannot accept that position at this time,” she said. “We believe there are ways and meaningful ways that you can move forward to ensure that this facility does not happen.”

Cox-Toure said the City Council can take other action, like passing an eviction moratorium to aid Oklahoma City residents who cannot pay their bills while being detained by ICE.

The City sent Oklahoma’s federal congressional delegation and DHS letters about the proposed facility on Jan. 21 and 22, respectively, emphasizing that the city would like the federal government to apply for a special use permit despite the Supremacy Clause making it technically unnecessary.

A special permit would allow for public comment and input as well as a review of how the proposed facility would affect traffic, public safety and the surrounding community.

Council members Camal Pennington, Ward 7, James Cooper, Ward 2, and JoBeth Hamon, Ward 6, were vocal about their opposition to the proposed ICE facility.

Hamon said she is determined to use her platform and power to push back against the ICE facility.

“None of us want to be in the position of saying we could have done something and we didn’t do anything,” she said.

Pennington said he hopes the federal government will comply with Oklahoma City’s current requirements and seek a special permit so the public is allowed to speak about the facility.

Chris Fowler, an Oklahoma City resident, said he questioned the safety of having an ICE facility so close to neighborhoods and schools.

The proposed ICE facility is blocks from Western Heights High School and across the street from an Oklahoma City Fire Department station.

“As we see nationwide and in our own city, where ICE goes, protests increase, traffic, and 24/7 law enforcement operations follow,” Fowler said. “So what is going to happen in these neighborhoods, to these businesses, to these schools.”

There are currently multiple ICE detention centers in Oklahoma, including in Watonga, Cushing and Newkirk.",https://oklahomavoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-10.10.55-AM.png,N,,2026-01-28 17:14:39.699794

On Sunday, Gregory Bovino, who was then overseeing President Trump’s Border Patrol operations in the city, told CNN that the agents were still working, had been moved to other cities and were “more than likely be on administrative duty.”

The revelation came as authorities in Minneapolis and the U.S. Capitol Police were investigating an attack on Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat who represents parts of the city and has been a frequent target of criticism from Mr. Trump. A man sprayed her with an unknown substance during a public event on Tuesday night as she criticized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

The attack was the latest reflection of the charged political climate over an aggressive federal immigration crackdown that has prompted an outpouring of anger in Minnesota and beyond.

Mr. Trump told ABC News on Tuesday night that he had not seen video footage of the attack on Ms. Omar but suggested without evidence that she had staged it. “I don’t think about her. I think she’s a fraud,” he said. “She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.”

Here’s what we’re covering:

The assault on Omar: Ms. Omar was uninjured, initially moving toward her attacker with her fist raised before he was tackled by security officers. She resumed speaking after a brief pause, saying she would not be intimidated. The Minneapolis Police identified the suspect as Anthony J. Kazmierczak, 55. He was booked into the local jail on suspicion of assault. Read more ›

The Pretti shooting: Stephen Miller, a top aide to Mr. Trump, suggested that the agents who killed Mr. Pretti after he was restrained and disarmed “may not have been following” protocol. Mr. Miller’s statement came after earlier comments in which he and other Trump administration officials portrayed the shooting as justified and Mr. Pretti as a would-be assassin. Read more ›

Trump’s language: On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told Fox News that he might “de-escalate” his campaign against Minnesota and its Democratic leaders. But at a rally a few hours later, he embraced incendiary rhetoric, falsely describing thousands of people arrested by ICE in Minnesota as “hardened, vicious, horrible criminals” and anti-ICE demonstrators as “paid insurrectionists.”

Impeachment calls: Mr. Trump briefly sidelined Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, this week after bipartisan backlash over her department’s portrayal of Mr. Pretti, only to quickly reaffirm his support and declare her job safe. On Tuesday, the top three House Democratic leaders joined more than 150 congressional Democrats in backing a bid to impeach her. Read more ›

Gregory Bovino, a Border Patrol chief who had been deployed to Minnesota, said on Sunday that the officers involved in the shooting were still working but had been transferred to other cities, adding that they would “more than likely be on administrative duty.”

It is unclear whether the other federal officers who pinned Mr. Pretti to the ground and restrained him were also placed on leave. Two federal officers discharged their weapons during the encounter, according to a preliminary review by Customs and Border Protection’s internal watchdog office that was sent to Congress on Tuesday. It provided a detailed timeline of the events based on body camera footage and agency documentation.

The review was the first official written assessment of the shooting since Trump administration officials rushed to call Mr. Pretti, a U.S. citizen and intensive care nurse, a “domestic terrorist.” Shortly after the shooting, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, claimed that Mr. Pretti had been “brandishing” a gun and that he had wanted to “kill law enforcement.”

But the initial review did not say that Mr. Pretti had brandished a gun. It said that Mr. Pretti had resisted attempts by officers to take him into custody, resulting in a struggle. A Border Patrol agent then multiple times yelled, “He’s got a gun!”

About five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent fired his Glock 19, and a Customs and Border Protection officer also fired his Glock 47 at Mr. Pretti, the review said. After the shooting, a Border Patrol agent “advised he had possession of Pretti’s firearm” and “subsequently cleared and secured Pretti’s firearm in his vehicle,” according to the review.

A New York Times analysis of video footage of the encounter found that officers fired 10 shots, including six after Mr. Pretti was lying motionless on the ground. Mr. Pretti, who had a firearms permit, had been disarmed before he was shot.

Hilton Beckham, a Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman, said in a statement that the government review was “an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings.”

Mr. Pretti’s killing came after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis earlier this month.

The Trump administration has sent thousands of federal officers and agents to Minnesota in recent weeks as part of its immigration enforcement blitz in the state. President Trump said on Tuesday that the administration may “de-escalate” the crackdown in Minnesota, although he did not specify what changes could come. He has also blamed Mr. Pretti for carrying a gun during the encounter, but has promised a “very honorable and honest investigation” into his killing.

Ms. Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was killed by an ICE agent in a separate confrontation in Minneapolis on Jan. 7.

In the song, Mr. Springsteen describes the immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, where a surge of federal agents has led to widespread protests, with activists recording confrontations with their cellphones and thousands of people shutting down streets.

Mr. Springsteen’s lyrics refer to President Trump as a “king” with a “private army,” and they denounce what the song calls the “dirty lies” from the administration.

In a statement, Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, “The Trump administration is focused on encouraging state and local Democrats to work with federal law enforcement officers on removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from their communities — not random songs with irrelevant opinions and inaccurate information.”

This month, at a surprise appearance in New Jersey, Mr. Springsteen dedicated a performance of his song “The Promised Land,” a working-class anthem, to Ms. Good. At that performance, Mr. Springsteen likened the administration’s actions in Minneapolis to “Gestapo tactics against our fellow citizens.”

Mr. Springsteen has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump across his two terms, calling him the “most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime” in an endorsement video for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign in 2024.

Last year, the singer released a six-track EP of songs and political commentary from performances in Manchester, England. That release begins with remarks that the United States is “in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.”

In response, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Springsteen “ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT” and called for a “major investigation” into the artist.

Mr. Springsteen has used his lyrics to make political statements for decades. In 2000, he released “American Skin (41 Shots)” about the killing of Amadou Diallo by four New York City police officers.

Other musicians have joined Mr. Springsteen in speaking out against ICE. After Ms. Good was killed, the singer Billie Eilish reposted a graphic on Instagram that called the agency a “federally funded and supported terrorist group,” and after Mr. Pretti’s killing she goaded her fellow celebrities, “u gonna speak up?” The singer Olivia Rodrigo called ICE’s actions “unconscionable” in a post on Instagram.

The musician Tom Morello announced he would hold a concert in Minneapolis on Friday, saying that the proceeds would be donated to Ms. Good’s and Mr. Pretti’s families.

Last year, the rapper Bad Bunny refused to perform in the mainland United States because, he said, he feared that ICE would target his concerts for immigration raids. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, has said that immigration agents will be “all over” the Super Bowl in California next month, when Bad Bunny is set to perform the halftime show.

In October, when the country star Zach Bryan released new lyrics warning that ICE agents would “come bust down your door,” Ms. Noem said the song “attacks individuals who are just trying to make our streets safe.” Mr. Bryan later said the lyrics had been “misconstrued.”

The statements about the two American protesters, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, came as administration officials defended agents from the Homeland Security Department who had been deployed in Minnesota, suggesting the killings were justified.

The comments are the most high-profile examples yet of the administration’s practice of insinuating that some of its political adversaries are terrorists.

How do prosecutors define domestic terrorism?

Domestic terrorism has an unusual status in federal law. There is no formal charge of domestic terrorism, meaning that a person cannot be convicted of that specific crime. Typically, federal prosecutors will try to persuade judges after a conviction — during the sentencing phase of a criminal proceeding — that a crime constituted domestic terrorism.

Though a number of crimes are classified as terrorism statutes, or “federal crimes of terrorism,” more often than not, experts said, the charges associated with domestic terrorism cases are standard federal charges, such as murder or assault.

But the classification affects federal inquiries from the outset, including which unit investigates a particular target and the types of warrants available to federal agents. Officials referring to investigative targets and pending prosecutions will sometimes use the phrase domestic terrorism.

Thomas E. Brzozowski, who was the counsel for domestic terrorism at the Justice Department from 2015-25, said in an interview that officials had previously been cautious when using the term.

Prosecutors during his time at the Justice Department made sure that public statements using the term “were done in a principled, consistent, uniform fashion.”

“The second you start deploying the term arbitrarily and capriciously before all the facts come in you lose trust,” he said, adding, “And then the next time you characterize something as domestic terrorism, even when it really is, people simply don’t believe you anymore.”

A spokeswoman for the White House, Abigail Jackson, did not directly respond to questions about the use of the term domestic terrorism in relation to Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti.

What is the legal definition of domestic terrorism?

The formal legal definition is relatively new. It became law shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, as part of the Patriot Act.

The term refers to activities involving “acts dangerous to human life” that violate criminal laws, and that “appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping.”

To be considered domestic terrorism, the acts must occur “primarily” within U.S. jurisdiction.

Investigations are classified as related to domestic terrorism early in the process. After a preliminary inquiry, the F.B.I. typically categorizes a particular investigation as domestic terrorism and assigns it to the appropriate team.

Once suspects are formally charged, prosecutors may refer to them as having engaged in domestic terrorism. But the classification affects defendants most during sentencing, when prosecutors can ask for terrorism-related “enhancements” that extend the duration of a prison sentence.

Federal officials have considered some of the last decade’s most high-profile acts of violence to be domestic terrorism, including the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018 and another targeting Latinos at a Walmart in Texas in 2019.

Many of those charged in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were not sentenced as domestic terrorists. But several convicted of the most severe crimes were, including Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader who was sentenced to 22 years in prison. He was pardoned last year by President Trump.

How have key Trump administration officials used the term?

Since his return to office, Mr. Trump and top officials in his administration have been focused on their own definition.

“They specifically see domestic terrorism as a problem of the political left,” said Shirin Sinnar, a professor at Stanford Law School who is working on a book about the legal history of terrorism in the United States.

Stephen Miller, the president’s homeland security adviser, has been one of the most enthusiastic proponents of that view. In May, responding to a San Diego city councilman who had referred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as terrorists, Mr. Miller countered, “We are living in the age of left-wing domestic terrorism.”

“They are openly encouraging violence against law enforcement to aid and abet the invasion of America,” Mr. Miller said.

In September, shortly after issuing an executive order that classified antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, Mr. Trump sent a formal memo to key agency heads on the subject. It wove together the killing of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the two assassination attempts on Mr. Trump and, crucially, “attacks on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

And the memo called on the Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate people “engaged in acts of political violence and intimidation designed to suppress lawful political activity or obstruct the rule of law,” as well as those funding them.

Progress was to be reported directly to Mr. Miller.

How has that played out after the Minneapolis killings?

Ms. Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, on Jan. 7, while in her S.U.V. Many Americans reacted in horror to the shooting. Administration officials argued that it was justified, saying that Mr. Ross had feared for his life.

Mr. Miller posted a clip of the episode, captioned with the two-word phrase “domestic terrorism.” The head of the Homeland Security Department, Kristi Noem, called Ms. Good’s actions “domestic terrorism.” Vice President JD Vance characterized them as “classic terrorism.”

The official response was similar after federal agents fatally shot Mr. Pretti on Saturday. Ms. Noem called him a “domestic terrorist,” and said he had been seeking “to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” comments contradicted by video analysis by The New York Times and others.

The comments have been met with fury. “They were calling her a domestic terrorist before they even knew what her name was,” said one of Minnesota’s Democratic senators, Tina Smith.

“President Trump’s response has remained consistent throughout this entire situation,” Ms. Jackson, the White House spokeswoman, said Wednesday. “He views Mr. Pretti’s death as a tragedy and has advocated for a fact-based investigation. And President Trump also views the deaths of countless innocent Americans at the hands of criminal illegal aliens as a tragedy that should warrant equal coverage.”

She pointed to comments that Mr. Trump had previously made about Ms. Good.

“I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person, but her actions were pretty tough,” Mr. Trump said.

Alan Feuer contributed reporting.

“We are evaluating why the CBP team may not have been following that protocol,” Mr. Miller said in the statement, referring to agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a law enforcement agency under the department. The statement was provided to The New York Times on Wednesday by a White House spokesperson and was reported earlier by CNN.

While Mr. Miller did not elaborate, his comments came as the Trump administration faces escalating blowback for Mr. Pretti’s killing.

Shortly after the shooting, Mr. Miller, the highly influential deputy White House chief of staff, characterized the 37-year-old Minneapolis resident in a social media post as a “domestic terrorist” and an “assassin” who had “tried to murder federal agents,” without providing evidence. He accused Democratic leaders who had condemned the killing of inciting insurrection.

Other Trump administration officials offered similar accounts. The homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, claimed that Mr. Pretti had brandished a gun and appeared intent on inflicting “maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”

A New York Times analysis of videos of the shooting contradicted those accounts. The analysis shows that Mr. Pretti was holding a phone — not a gun — when federal agents pinned him to the ground before shooting him. A preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s internal watchdog office also did not say that Mr. Pretti had brandished a gun.

In his statement on Wednesday, Mr. Miller said the Homeland Security Department’s initial assessment of the killing of Mr. Pretti was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”

The Trump administration’s comments about the killing of Mr. Pretti, who worked as a nurse in the intensive-care unit at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Minneapolis, have stirred widespread public anger and prompted more protests in the city over the aggressive federal immigration crackdown.

Mr. Trump told Fox News on Tuesday that he might “de-escalate” the campaign but later, at a rally in Iowa, made incendiary remarks that falsely described thousands of people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minnesota as “hardened, vicious, horrible criminals” and anti-ICE demonstrators as “paid insurrectionists.”

Mr. Trump and his aides have made similar justifications for the killing of Renee Good, the 37-year-old Minneapolis woman fatally shot on Jan. 7. by the ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who the president said had acted in self-defense. Local and state officials in Minnesota have contested those accounts. A New York Times analysis of that shooting shows no indication that Mr. Ross had been run over.

Ms. Omar, who represents Minnesota’s fifth congressional district, has played an outsize role in national politics and has long been a target of right-wing criticism.

Mr. Trump has singled her out for years, frequently leading his supporters at rallies to chant, “Send her back” to Somalia, where she was born. He has called Ms. Omar “garbage,” suggested without evidence that she married her brother and falsely said that she praised Islamist terrorist groups like Al Qaeda.

Ms. Omar who was born in 1982, emigrated to the United States as a refugee at age 12.

She fled Somalia’s civil war for a refugee camp across the border in Kenya. In 1995, her family emigrated to the United States, living in Virginia before settling in Minneapolis, where many Somali immigrants have built a community.

In interviews, Ms. Omar, who wears a hijab, has described enduring bullying in school as a young, veiled recent arrival to the United States. Other kids, she said, stuck gum on her head scarf and knocked her down stairs.

Her father “sat me down, and he said, ‘Listen, these people who are doing all of these things to you, they’re not doing something to you because they dislike you,’” Ms. Omar said in a 2018 interview with The New York Times. “They are doing something to you because they feel threatened in some way by your existence.”

Ms. Omar went to North Dakota State University before returning to Minnesota, where she began climbing the ranks in Minneapolis politics. In 2017, she was elected to the state’s House of Representatives. Two years later, in 2019, she took office as one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, alongside Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan.

Ms. Omar arrived in Washington on a firmly progressive ticket — supporting L.G.B.T.Q. rights and Medicare for All. She became part of a group of Democratic lawmakers firmly on the party’s left that included the New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and was nicknamed “the Squad.”

Ms. Omar quickly became one of the most polarizing members of Congress, a household name for critics and supporters alike.

Some of her most contentious stances have been tied to Israel and the war in Gaza. Ms. Omar has long supported a movement to boycott Israel and accused its government of committing genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation.

Pro-Israel critics argued that some of her remarks crossed a line into antisemitism. In 2019, Ms. Omar wrote on social media that U.S. support for Israel was “all about the Benjamins” — referring to hundred-dollar bills. Some Jewish groups said the remark invoked anti-Jewish tropes involving money; Ms. Omar later apologized for the remark.

Ms. Omar’s supporters have argued that she has become a lightning rod for bad-faith critics who cannot abide seeing a Muslim woman in a head covering on the floor of Congress.

In recent weeks, House Republicans have threatened to open an investigation into Ms. Omar in an apparent effort to tie her to a Minnesota fraud scandal in which, law enforcement officials say, members of the Somali community billed state agencies for social services that were never provided.

Mr. Trump has used the scandal to broadly characterize Somali Americans, including Ms. Omar, as ingrates who should “go back to where they came from.” Many Somali Americans in Minnesota say the scandal has tarnished the reputation of their community of about 80,000 people.

Law enforcement officials have been looking into some of Ms. Omar’s finances as part of an investigation that began under the Biden administration. The New York Times reported this week that in 2024, the Justice Department began scrutinizing her finances, campaign spending and interactions with a foreign citizen.

No charges have been filed. Ms. Omar has denied wrongdoing, saying that “years of ‘investigations’ have found nothing.”

The protesters also directed their ire at Hilton for, they claimed, providing lodging to ICE agents. A hotel worker checking in guests, and guests themselves, seemed confused by the protest. It could not immediately be determined whether ICE agents were staying at the hotel.

The Manhattan protest followed a similar action on Sunday in Minneapolis, where the killings by federal agents of Renee Good and Alex Pretti this month have further inflamed residents angry about the crackdown and the methods employed to enforce it.

The Minneapolis protest, which began as a peaceful, if noisy, demonstration outside a Home2Suites by Hilton hotel, grew heated after some people in the crowd began to vandalize the building and federal agents used tear gas.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, declined to respond to a request for comment about protesters’ targeting of hotels where they believe ICE agents are staying. Hilton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani, through a spokesman, praised the protesters for exercising their rights and the police for their response, and he said he was glad the demonstration had ended peacefully.

The spokesman, Sam Raskin, said in a statement that Mr. Mamdani believes “ICE is a rogue agency that has repeatedly carried out cruel, inhumane and lawless raids and arrests of American citizens.”

Just after 6:35 p.m. Tuesday, police officers entered the Hilton lobby and warned that those who did not leave faced arrest. “They want you guys out of the hotel,” one officer said. Many people soon left, and the police forced reporters out as well. About 50 people remained.

The Rev. Micah Bucey, the senior minister at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, was among those who stayed put. He said he was unfazed by the prospect of being arrested.

“I know that my God is telling me that I have to be here,” he said. “I am in solidarity with all of the people in Minneapolis. All of the people in Chicago, all of the people across the country, especially with my immigrant neighbors.”

Some of the protesters who left the lobby lingered in the cold outside, where they were joined by others who had walked over from a separate anti-ICE rally outside a federal building in Foley Square.

At about 7:30 p.m., officers with the Police Department’s Strategic Response Group began to make arrests, lifting protesters off the lobby floor, binding their hands with zip ties and escorting them through a back door to a waiting bus.

The police said that 66 people had been taken into custody. Sixty-four were issued summonses for trespassing and disorderly conduct; two received desk appearance tickets for obstructing governmental administration.

By 8 p.m., the lobby had been cleared, and some stray protesters outside the hotel continued to chant “Stop helping ICE” against the steady beat of a drum and the sound of bagpipes. Others had walked up Sixth Avenue to Washington Square Park, where the crowd dispersed.

Kaja Andric contributed reporting.

Gasps were audible through the crowd, as well as cries of “Oh my God, oh my God.” Some attendees yelled out, “He sprayed something!” A woman in the crowd appeared near tears.

The Minneapolis Police said the man, whom they later identified as Anthony J. Kazmierczak, 55, was arrested and booked into jail on suspicion of assault. A forensics squad was called to analyze the scene, he added.

Ms. Omar, a Democrat who represents part of Minneapolis and has been a frequent target of President Trump, held the town hall in her district of Minneapolis to address the ongoing ICE operations in the city. Hours before, Mr. Trump criticized Ms. Omar at a rally in Iowa and repeated inflammatory remarks about her birth country, Somalia. He said immigrants “have to show that they can love our country. They have to be proud, not like Ilhan Omar.”

The assault occurred just after she said: “We must abolish ICE for good. And D.H.S. Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment.”

Her comment mirrored calls by Democratic lawmakers for Ms. Noem, the homeland security secretary, to step down or face impeachment after federal immigration agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis this month.

Ms. Omar, visibly shaken after the assault, insisted to her staff and security that she would continue. She asked for a napkin and told them: “Just give me 10 minutes. I beg you. Please don’t let them have the show.”

Ms. Omar then turned the crowd. “Here’s the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand,” she said. “We are Minnesota strong, and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.”

Someone in the crowd later thanked Ms. Omar for staying and continuing after the assault, which had shaken not only her but the entire room.

“I learned at a young age you don’t give in to threats,” Ms. Omar said.

About an hour after the town hall, Ms. Omar posted on social media that she was OK and grateful to her constituents for rallying behind her after the assault. “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work,” she said. “I don’t let bullies win.”

The U.S. Capitol Police, which investigates threats against lawmakers, said in a statement that the attack on Ms. Omar was “unacceptable” and would be met with “swift justice.”

“We are now working with our federal partners to see this man faces the most serious charges possible to deter this kind of violence in our society,” the agency said.

As video of the encounter quickly circulated on social media, some officials condemned the assault. Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis denounced the attack, saying on X that “this kind of behavior will not be tolerated in our city,” and that “violence and intimidation have no place in Minneapolis,”

Representative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican who has often been at odds with Ms. Omar, said she was “deeply disturbed” by the attack.

“Regardless of how vehemently I disagree with her rhetoric — and I do — no elected official should face physical attacks,” she said in a social media post. “This is not who we are.”

Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs contributed reporting.

In reality, most of the immigrants that ICE has arrested in city crackdowns since Mr. Trump took office have no criminal record. In Washington, which Mr. Trump characterized in his speech as a “horrible,” crime-ridden city before his recent show of force, only 2 percent of those arrested by ICE had been convicted of a violent crime.

Tim Hogan, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, criticized Mr. Trump’s rhetoric toward detained migrants as dangerous, saying that voters will hold him accountable in November’s midterm elections.

“At a time when our entire nation is reeling from multiple tragedies in Minnesota, Donald Trump continues to pour gasoline on the fire,” Mr. Hogan said, adding “He knows damn well that his lies sow chaos, but he does it anyway.”

The dark turn in Mr. Trump’s language came amid a growing outcry against his administration’s show of force in Minnesota. After suggesting to Fox News earlier on Tuesday that he might “de-escalate” the crackdown, he then pushed back on the idea that any change in approach in Minnesota was a retreat, attacking anti-ICE demonstrators as “paid insurrectionists” and “paid agitators.”

He returned to that language in his speech. Mr. Trump was heckled throughout the address and outside the rally venue by people he described as “lunatics.” A crowd lined up for blocks along the president’s motorcade route, blowing whistles, beating drums and chanting “ICE out now!” A woman attending the rally screamed, “Release the files,” presumably referring to the Epstein files, and was being escorted out. A young man was dragged out by security officers for heckling the president.

“They get paid,” Mr. Trump said as the man was removed. “These are all paid agitators, that’s all they are. They get paid to go and — they don’t even know when they interview them. ‘Why are you here? I don’t know.’ They have no idea. They’re paid insurrectionists, really, in some cases. They’re sickos.”

Before Mr. Trump’s sidetrack, he had delivered an unusually focused hourlong speech, campaigning for the midterms and seeking to counter criticism of his tariffs and the rising cost of goods. In recent months, when Mr. Trump has been frustrated by continuing criticism over the state of the economy, he has vacillated between blaming immigrants for the country’s economic woes and assuring his supporters that life has been better than ever under his administration.

Mr. Trump repeated many of his false claims about the economy on Tuesday. He falsely said that he had eliminated taxes on Social Security, when he has not. He said that his administration had collected $600 billion in tariff revenue, when in reality the sum is $287 billion. And he claimed that prices for groceries and pharmaceutical drugs were falling, but the reverse is true: Drug prices are still rising and prices for groceries are now rising faster than during any month since October 2022.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/28/multimedia/28minneapolis-ice-promo3p-qbmp/28minneapolis-ice-promo3p-qbmp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 15:19:38.687930

Pretti's death at the hands of immigration officers escalated tensions surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement surge, and has already prompted bipartisan calls for an investigation. Pretti was the second U.S. citizen killed by immigration officers in Minneapolis this month.

According to the preliminary assessment, Customs and Border Protection officers said Pretti resisted arrest before two officers shot him.

But the assessment makes no mention of Pretti attacking officers or threatening them with a weapon — as the administration first described the incident. It also appears to more closely match multiple bystander video and witness testimony of the incident.

The preliminary assessment of Pretti's shooting, known as a death notification, was shared by congressional sources not authorized to speak publicly, and reviewed by NPR. It was based on body-worn camera footage and documentation from the agency, it said.

The CBP assessment describes how officers were initially confronted by two women who were blowing whistles while they conducted an immigration enforcement operation.

""The [officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The [officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move,"" the review states, adding that the officer then sprayed both with oleoresin capsicum spray, commonly known as pepper spray.

CBP officers attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted their efforts and a struggle ensued, according to the report.

During the struggle, an agent yelled, ""He's got a gun!"" multiple times, the review states.

Approximately five seconds later, one agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and an officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, an agent advised that he had Pretti's firearm in his possession, the review states.

Asked about the CBP report on Tuesday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in a statement said that the ""extra personnel sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used to create a physical barrier between arrest teams and the disruptors,"" and officials are are examining whether protocol was followed on the scene of Pretti's shooting.

But right after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was quick to describe Pretti's actions as ""domestic terrorism,"" saying Pretti was ""attacking"" officers and ""brandishing"" a weapon before he was killed. And Miller in a post described Pretti as a ""would-be-assassin.""

Multiple bystander videos and witness testimony contradict the government's initial portrayal of the incident. Pretti can be seen holding only a phone in his hand before at least six officers tackle him, pinning him face down on the ground and shooting him in the back, firing what sounds like 10 shots.

One eyewitness said in a court document that Pretti was not even facing agents when they grabbed him. ""It didn't look like he was trying to resist, just trying to help [a] woman up,"" they wrote.

Noem has come under bipartisan scrutiny for her quick characterization of the incident.

In Washington, Democrats are pushing to block funding for the Homeland Security Department, and several other agencies, after the shooting and the administration's response. Several Republicans, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and John Curtis of Utah, also criticized Noem's immediate effort to blame Pretti, and others called for an investigation.

The assessment of Pretti's death was conducted by an internal Customs and Border Protection oversight office known as the Office of Professional Responsibility; it cautions that any information may be updated as more details come to light.

Homeland Security Investigations, a branch of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is investigating the incident. It's also under review by the Office of Professional Responsibility's Investigative Operations Directorate, which investigates employee misconduct.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5027x2828+0+0/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdc%2F4a%2Fe1a7f0fb466eb5b96c7422448f28%2Fgettyimages-2258128073.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 17:14:22.122571

A Maryland federal judge is set to hold a temporary restraining order hearing in a lawsuit challenging U.S.","A high-stakes hearing Friday will bring the immigration crackdown in Minnesota to a head in the courts, as the nation’s top Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official will be forced to take the stand to explain the agency’s aggressive surge.

“The Court’s patience is at an end,” Patrick Schiltz, the chief judge of Minnesota’s federal district court, wrote Monday.

Schiltz’s contempt threat against acting ICE Director Todd Lyons comes as the court has been overwhelmed with lawsuits challenging the agency’s tactics and the Trump administration’s efforts to shield it from scrutiny.

Minnesota is suing to get ICE out of the Twin Cities. Local prosecutors want a judge to provide access to evidence in this weekend’s shooting. Civil rights interests are challenging ICE’s antiprotest tactics.

And dozens of migrants caught up in the surge have filed individual cases contesting their own circumstances.

It’s led to an inflection point that will put Lyons on the stand.

Schiltz said the court has been “extremely patient” with the administration, even as thousands of agents descended on Minnesota to detain noncitizens without a plan for the hundreds of legal challenges that were “sure to result.”

Roughly 3,000 ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel are on the ground in the Minneapolis area conducting enforcement, the government disclosed in a court filing this week.

“Respondents have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders, and that they have taken steps to ensure that those orders will be honored going forward,” the chief judge wrote.

“Unfortunately, though, the violations continue,” he said.

The judge’s scolding came in the case of Juan Hugo Tobay Robles, who said he remained detained despite a judge ruling that the Trump administration must afford him a bond hearing or release him.

He’s one of hundreds of migrants who have challenged the legality of their detention via what is known as a habeas petition. Several hundred have been filed in Minnesota since the start of Operation Metro Surge, The Gavel’s review of court dockets found.

The immigration crackdown in Minnesota also pits the Trump administration against state leaders, as officials pursue competing probes and messaging about the surge in the wake of two fatal shootings.

Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother, was shot and killed in her car by an ICE officer Jan. 7, following an apparent confrontation.

Video footage showed her SUV surrounded by several officers, one pulling on the driver’s side door handle, and another telling her to “get out of the f‑‑‑ing car.” The officer who fired the shots, Jonathan Ross, approached the car from the front and fired as the wheels turned. With Good shot, the vehicle crashed into a parked car on the side of the road.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed Good attempted to use her car as a weapon to run Ross over and that he was hit, though the videos make neither clear.

Then, Saturday, ICU nurse Alex Pretti, 37, was gunned down by a Border Patrol agent.

Video footage of that shooting showed Pretti recording video with his phone before the incident escalated, when federal officers realized he was in possession of a gun.

The firearm, which Pretti legally held, appeared to have been taken out of the nurse’s possession by officers before he was shot and was not in his hands at any visible point. It appears at least 10 shots were fired, according to several analyses of videos of the shooting.

DHS officials, who later came under fire by Democrats and Republicans for their initial response, suggested Pretti “committed an act of domestic terrorism” and “wanted to massacre law enforcement,” though the evidence available does not support those conclusions.

Hours later, the offices of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison (D) and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty (D) sued. They sought to preserve all evidence, saying federal personnel had ordered state and local investigators to leave and were potentially letting evidence spoil.

“From a law enforcement perspective, this is astonishing,” the emergency motion read. “The federal government’s actions are a sharp departure from normal best practices and procedure, in which every effort is taken to preserve the scene and the evidence it contains.”

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee. He held a hearing Monday and did not issue a decision but mandated the evidence be preserved in the meantime.

The Justice Department has told Tostrud there’s no need for him to intervene, as federal policies already require evidence preservation. The government submitted sworn declarations from officials at ICE, the FBI and CBP to support their assertion that the policies are being followed.

“HSI Special Agents routinely participate in the criminal discovery process and are well-versed in the Government’s Constitutional obligations when cases culminate in a prosecution,” wrote Mark Zito, who runs an St. Paul-based investigatory office within ICE that he said is leading the federal probe.

Just hours before Tostrud’s hearing, another judge in the same courthouse heard Ellison’s bid to send the surge of federal personnel in Minnesota back home.

That case landed before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, an appointee of former President Biden. After the hearing, she ordered the parties submit additional arguments in writing. A ruling is expected after the final brief comes due Wednesday evening.

As the state pushes in court, private plaintiffs are also moving.

The American Civil Liberties Union represents six Minnesota residents challenging tactics federal personnel are allegedly using to respond to the flood of protests.

Menendez got that case, too. She had blocked federal agents from retaliating against peaceful demonstrators or using pepper spray and nonlethal munitions against them, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted it Monday evening until it resolves the administration’s appeal.

It’s the 8th Circuit’s first major ruling on Operation Metro Surge. The flood of litigation in the district court may soon follow.

IN FOCUS

Feds sharpen focus on elected Democrats

The Trump administration is increasingly targeting elected Democrats with legal action, homing in on officials who have pushed back against the president’s policies.

In Minnesota, Trump’s immigration crackdown has caused his administration to lock horns with state and local officials — namely, Gov. Tim Walz (D), the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee on former Vice President Kamala Harris’s ticket.

The Justice Department earlier this month launched a criminal investigation into whether Walz and other Minnesota officials have impeded federal law enforcement officers’ ability to do their jobs in the state, after a welfare fraud scandal involving the local Somali community prompted the federal surge.

It issued subpoenas to Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) and Attorney General Keith Ellison (D), in addition to the office of St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her (D) and Hennepin County.

Meanwhile, Trump threatened to invoke the seldom-used Insurrection Act, which lets the president send military troops into states to tamp down civil unrest, if Minnesota’s “corrupt politicians” did not let up on immigration enforcers there.

Trump’s allies outside the White House have further fanned the flames. Mike Davis, head of the conservative Article III Project, wrote on X that Democratic officials who “plot to arrest federal officers for doing their jobs” will go to federal prison.

“Insurrection, seditious conspiracy, assault, kidnapping, harboring, conspiracy, and many other federal felonies,” he said. “And if anyone dies, felony-murder.”

The fatal shooting of Pretti, the ICU nurse, by a Border Patrol officer Saturday and the nationwide outcry in response left Trump looking for an off-ramp.

He said Monday that he had “very good” calls with Walz and Frey, saying White House border czar Tom Homan would be dispatched to Minneapolis to take over the operation from senior Border Patrol official Greg Bovino.

But even as Trump sought to cool off tensions, his focus turned to another Minnesota Democrat: Rep. Ilhan Omar.

The president announced a Justice Department probe of Omar, who he claimed has become wealthy in recent years despite immigrating from Somalia with “NOTHING.”

Omar fled the war-torn nation with her family in the 1990s and was elected to Congress in 2018. Minnesota’s Somali community has also been in the spotlight for a growing welfare fraud scandal involving some community members and Trump’s decision to end the temporary protected status of Somalis in the state in November.

“Time will tell all,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

In response, Omar suggested the president was “deflecting” with “lies and conspiracy theories” about her.

“Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing and you’re panicking,” she said on X.

The latest investigations add to a series of other probes targeting elected Democrats, as prosecutors seek to make good on Trump’s vows for retribution against his political enemies.

Five of the six Democratic lawmakers who participated in a video calling on service members to reject unlawful orders said this month they are being investigated: Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Reps. Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.), Maggie Goodlander (D-N.H.), Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.) and Jason Crow (D-Colo.).

The sixth lawmaker, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), hasn’t commented on a federal probe but has been the subject of Pentagon scrutiny, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seeks to censure the retired Navy captain and lower his retirement rank. Kelly has sued in response.

Then, there are the mortgage fraud investigations, which are so far known to have targeted Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) and Federal Reserve Gov. Lisa Cook — though, James is the only one of the bunch who has been indicted, and since then, the case was dismissed.

Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) faces three criminal counts alleging she assaulted and interfered with immigration officers at a New Jersey detention center during a congressional oversight visit. She pleaded not guilty.

Her case was set to go to trial in November but has been indefinitely postponed as she appeals a judge’s ruling denying her bids to dismiss the charges over claims of legislative immunity and a selective and vindictive prosecution.

And Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Fla.) faces charges alleging she stole $5 million in Federal Emergency Management Agency funds and used some of it to fund her campaign. Her arraignment before a federal judge in Florida is scheduled for next week.

Bids for DC plane crash accountability persist after year

Thursday marks one year since the deadly crash near Reagan Washington National Airport that killed 67 people aboard an American Airlines flight and Black Hawk military helicopter.

The investigation and legal fight are still in full swing.

On Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) held a hearing on the causes of the midair collision, the deadliest aviation disaster on U.S. soil since 2001.

For those interested: The NTSB published animations of the incident Tuesday. Watch it from the perspectives from the helicopter and the control tower.

“Any individual shortcomings were set up for failure by the systems around them,” said NTSB member Michael Graham, whom Trump has nominated for a second term. “We are not here today to place blame on any individual or any organization.”

As the NTSB probes, many of the passengers’ families are placing blame — legally, at least.

Some have filed lawsuits against the federal government, American Airlines and PSA Airlines, the regional carrier owned by American that operated the flight.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, consolidated the cases into a singular one in her courtroom in the nation’s capital. The judge set a Feb. 27 hearing on whether it can proceed toward trial.

American Airlines has urged Reyes to dismiss it from the case. The airline says the families haven’t identified any breach of federal standards that would make it liable and argues the claims concerning flight scheduling into D.C. are preempted by federal aviation law.

“Plaintiffs, the survivors of deceased passengers on Flight 5342, understandably seek compensation for the tragic deaths of their loved ones,” the airline wrote in court filings. “And they are entitled to relief from the party that was responsible for this tragedy — the United States government.”

The government has admitted liability. But it agreed with American that some of the families’ claims go too far and are preempted.

“Multiple sovereigns cannot mandate potentially conflicting rules about, for example, airspace management or pilot licensing,” the government wrote in court filings. “The aviation industry thus has unique interests in federal uniformity, and preemption vindicates those important interests.”

It’s possible Reyes won’t need to get involved.

Ahead of the Christmas holiday, the Justice Department signaled it was meeting with the families about a potential settlement.

They promised an update as soon as New Year’s Eve on the talks. No news has come yet.

ORDER LIST

Cases the Supreme Court is taking up — or passing on — this term.

The court agreed to take up one new case at its final conference of the January session. The next conference isn’t until after Presidents Day.

IN: Facebook pixel tracking

The court agreed to hear Salazar v. Paramount, a battle over the scope of a 1988 law Congress passed after failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork’s video rental history was leaked to the press.

The Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA) makes a “video tape service provider” liable for damages when it knowingly discloses personally identifiable information of a “consumer.”

Michael Salazar claims Paramount violated the law. Salazar subscribed to a newsletter published by 247 Sports, a college athletics news outlet owned by the media conglomerate.

He used the subscription to view videos on the site while logged into his Facebook account. Paramount had installed a Facebook pixel on its website and used it to disclose Salazar’s viewing records to the company. Facebook then used it for targeted advertising.

Salazar petitioned the justices after an appeals court ruled he isn’t a “consumer” under the VPPA. The law doesn’t apply to all a video tape service provider’s goods, the court said, only its audiovisual goods.

Since Salazar had subscribed to a newsletter, the appeals court said his suit couldn’t proceed.

The ruling appeared to split with a decision from another appeals court, which considered Salazar’s similar lawsuit against the National Basketball Association (NBA) and ruled against the league.

The Supreme Court declined to hear the NBA’s appeal last month.

OUT: Man’s new attempted murder trial

The Supreme Court reinstated the conviction of Charles Martin, a Maryland man charged with attempting to murder his girlfriend after she had refused to get an abortion.

It’s a win for Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), whose office urged the justices to throw out a federal court’s ruling Martin must receive a new trial.

At the center of the battle was the state’s failure to disclose a forensic report that analyzed computers at Martin’s home and whether it violated his constitutional rights.

A divided panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled Martin’s conviction must be tossed.

The Supreme Court agreed to reverse that decision without hearing arguments, citing the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (ADEPA). The 1996 law sharply limited when federal courts have power to intervene to upend a state criminal conviction.

“The panel majority’s reasons for concluding otherwise were not consistent with the deference that AEDPA requires,” the Supreme Court wrote in its unsigned opinion.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court’s most junior liberal justice, sided with Martin but did not explain her reasoning.

A frustrated judge A federal judge on Monday called out the Trump administration for not being prepared for the onslaught of new habeas petitions.","The Justice Department and federal courts are struggling to keep up with the exponential increase in federal court cases of immigrants in custody who are challenging their detentions – another result of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies across the country.

The cases, in which a person can challenge detention in the jurisdiction where they are physically held, through what’s called a habeas corpus petition, have skyrocketed in Minneapolis and Texas over the past three weeks, several attorneys responding to the surge say and court records show.

“There has been a shift. It’s happened all so fast,” said Jacqueline Watson, an attorney in Austin, Texas, and board member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

The increase in the habeas cases in federal court has exposed how the justice system and the Trump administration are straining to respond to the White House and Department of Homeland Security’s escalation of immigration arrests. The situation has become especially acute this month with the Operation Metro Surge campaign in Minnesota, where the Trump administration has sent more than 3,000 Homeland Security border and immigration officers to the Twin Cities, and as immigrants arrested in Minnesota and elsewhere are being moved to federal detention facilities near the US-Mexico border.

“I’ve seen people (in court representing DOJ) I’ve never heard of. The cases are just getting sent to whatever attorneys can handle the workload within the district,” Watson said of the prosecutors now being tasked to respond to immigration detention challenges in the Western District of Texas. “The volume slows down already scarce court resources.”

At least one US attorney in a district on the US-Mexico border has raised the possibility that the Justice Department, which must respond to the federal court cases individually, may need to discuss changes in approach at the Department of Homeland Security, which takes immigrants into custody, according to internal DOJ discussions described to CNN.

Since January 1, more than 400 detainees have filed habeas petitions in the federal court in Minnesota, often seeking bond hearings or to be released, according to the court’s public docket. There were just over 125 habeas petitions in the state during all of last year.

Federal courts near the border have seen similar increases. In December, US attorneys from Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi told an appeals court that their prosecutors were struggling to field responses to immigrants’ detention challenges.

“To respond to this wave of habeas petitions, the U.S. Attorney’s Office has been forced to shift its already limited resources from other pressing and important priorities,” Justin Simmons, the Trump-appointed US Attorney for the Western District of Texas, wrote to the Fifth Circuit, describing how he’s moved civil and criminal attorneys in his office to full-time habeas case duty.

Homeland Security officials are far more likely to make arrests and keep a person who has no criminal history in detention under the Trump administration. And a DHS policy change last summer now allows far fewer detainees to be eligible for bond hearings in immigration courts, which exist within the Justice Department and outside the federal court system.

As a result, people in custody are now more likely to file an emergency petition with the federal district court where they are being held. The judges then hear from the Justice Department and from the immigrant’s lawyer to determine if the person should be released or receive a bond hearing, with proceedings and responses needing to happen within days.

Last week, detainees filed nearly 180 new habeas petitions in the Western District, according to court records. And the week before, 125 new habeas petitions were filed in the court, Simmons’ office announced in a press release.

US Attorneys’ offices with major increases of immigrants in DHS detention have been pushing for additional prosecutors as well, but lawyers alone may not be enough, according to a source familiar with the discussions at the Justice Department.

Justice Department spokespeople didn’t respond to requests for comment this week on the increase in immigration detention cases in the federal justice system.

DOJ has, however, called for more attorneys from other midwestern US attorneys offices to go to Minnesota during the immigration arrest surge, CNN has reported.

A frustrated judge

A federal judge on Monday called out the Trump administration for not being prepared for the onslaught of new habeas petitions.

The administration, wrote chief Judge Patrick Schiltz, “decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.”

“The scale we’re talking about is not what we’ve ever seen before. And it’s just the pure amount of enforcement going on,” My Khanh Ngo, an attorney with the ACLU who is working on dozens of habeas cases for people in custody.

On Monday, Schiltz noted how line prosecutors from the US Attorney’s Office in the Twin Cities have struggled to respond on the Justice Department’s behalf.

The US Attorney’s Office has “struggled mightily to ensure that respondents comply with court orders despite the fact that (the Trump administration) have failed to provide them with adequate resources,” Schiltz wrote in a court order in the case of a man from Ecuador who had come to the US as a child nearly 30 years ago.

The man was detained and had been in ICE custody since early January, and Schiltz decided he should have a bond hearing or be released. But neither had happened for three weeks.

“The Court’s patience is at an end,” Schiltz said.

The Center for American Progress has called for the administration to pull federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents out of Minneapolis and fire Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to prevent further tragedies.

But a new CAP report shows that the problems with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are far more widespread and demand meaningful reforms and accountability from Congress. The report recommends the following commonsense measures:

DHS must be held to the same standard as local police and wear uniforms that clearly identify their agency, be unmasked, and be equipped with body-worn cameras during public enforcement actions.

DHS must reform hiring, screening, and training to remove unqualified personnel.

DHS personnel must be held accountable for improper use of force and allegations of misconduct.

DHS must preserve Americans’ constitutional rights and operate within the rule of law.

DHS must enhance accountability to Congress and the public.

This militarized, unaccountable behavior by the Trump administration’s DHS and other federal law enforcement agencies is unlawful and unsafe. As their mission becomes increasingly politicized, these agencies are behaving more like regime secret police than federal law enforcement officials protecting the American public.

Congress, the courts, and a future administration must demand and implement real reforms that keep our communities safe, protect rights and freedoms, and prevent overreach and abuse. DHS must follow the law and fulfill its role to enhance—not compromise—the security of Americans and the homeland.

Approximately five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a CBP officer both fired shots at Pretti, according to the report.","Two federal officers fired their guns during Alex Pretti’s fatal shooting, according to an initial review by the Department of Homeland Security obtained by NBC News.

Both agents were placed on administrative leave, according to DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. MS Now was first to report that detail.

The preliminary report, from a Customs and Border Protection internal investigation led by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was sent to congressional committees Tuesday, including the House Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, according to three sources.

The DHS report said that during the encounter Jan. 24, an officer yelled “He’s got a gun!” multiple times and then “approximately five seconds later a BPA [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO [Customs and Border Protection officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti.”

It’s unclear from the report whether the bullets from both officers’ guns hit Pretti.

The report also did not make any mention of Pretti attacking officers or brandishing a gun, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed in the aftermath of the shooting.

Multiple videos recorded by eyewitnesses that were verified and analyzed by NBC News show Pretti did not hold a weapon during the struggle as he was surrounded by agents. One video shows that a federal agent removed a gun from Pretti's waist area just before he was shot.

The report said that after the shooting, a Border Patrol agent said he had possession of Pretti's gun, which was then secured in his vehicle.

A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence"" Sunday, after state investigators were denied access to the crime scene.

The report said its findings were based on CBP documents and body-camera from officers on the scene.

It said that officers were ""conducting enforcement actions"" in Minneapolis on Saturday morning as part of Operation Metro Surge, near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 25th Street.

The operation has seen some 3,000 federal officers and agents deployed to Minnesota — Minneapolis Police Department has just 600 officers — as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on migrant communities and what federal officials say is an attempt to stamp out local corruption and fraud.

The surge has been met with strong local opposition and protests, particularly after a local woman, Renee Good, was shot dead by an immigration officer while at the wheel of her car Jan. 7.

""Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway,"" the report into Pretti's death said.

An officer was then ""confronted"" by two women blowing whistles who failed to comply with an order to move out of the road, according to the report. After the officer pushed them both away, it said, one of them ran to a man the report identified as Pretti.

The officer continued to attempt to move the woman and Pretti out of the road before using his pepper spray on them both, the report said.

""CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel’s efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He’s got a gun!' multiple times,"" the report said.

Approximately five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a CBP officer both fired shots at Pretti, according to the report.

At 9:02 a.m., CBP staff cut Pretti's clothes and provided first aid including placing chest seals on his wounds, before fire department medics arrived two minutes later, the report said.

He was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center at approximately 9:32 a.m.

Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller said Tuesday that the initial statement from DHS — which in the hours after the shooting said Pretti ""wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement"" — was based on reports from CBP staff on the ground.

He said that the White House had provided ""clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors.""

""We are evaluating why the CBP team may not have been following that protocol,"" he said.

A DHS spokesperson said: “The initial statement was based on reports from CBP from a very chaotic scene on the ground. That’s precisely why an investigation is underway and DHS will let the facts lead the investigation.”

Miller's initial comments prompted a significant backlash, including from many in the Republican Party. The operation in Minnesota has no fixed end date and was already facing criticism following the shooting of Good.

Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Trump was asked about his staff's assessment that Pretti was a ""domestic terrorist.""

""I haven't heard that, but certainly he shouldn't have been carrying a gun,"" the president said.

Both DHS and CBP are conducting investigations into the shooting and the results of an autopsy are still to be released by Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office.

A CBP spokesperson said the report was released as per standard procedures and provided only an outline of what took place.

""They provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings. They are factual reports – not analytical judgments – and are provided to inform Congress and to promote transparency,"" the spokesperson said.

The CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility says it investigates ""criminal and serious misconduct or mismanagement allegations.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260128-alex-pretti-rs-5d824a.jpg",N,,2026-01-28 15:20:00.100624

United Methodist legal experts offer an update on the impact of President Trump’s immigration policies and a guide of rights when interacting with federal immigration enforcement agents.

But after the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, United Methodist legal experts acknowledge that asserting U.S. constitutional rights can come at great risk.

Nevertheless, they also say that peacefully documenting immigration enforcement actions in public spaces is key to accountability long-term.

United Methodists have good reason to stand up for basic rights — especially when those rights are being ignored or violated.

The United Methodist Church’s Social Principles declare that all individuals — no matter their circumstances — deserve basic human rights and freedoms. These include the right to life, liberty, security as well as equal treatment before the law and freedom from unlawful detention.

“These rights are grounded in God’s gracious act in creation (Gen. 1:27), and they are revealed fully in Jesus’s incarnation of divine love,” say the General Conference-approved social teachings.

“As a church, we will work to protect these rights and freedoms within the church and to reform the structures of society to ensure that every human being can thrive.”

But for many church leaders, President Trump’s second term is putting these principles to the test.

The Immigration Law and Justice Network — a United Methodist ministry with legal clinics across the U.S. — has been keeping up with the impact of Trump’s immigration policies and what they mean for basic human rights. The ministry released an update Jan. 26 in English and Spanish that also gives guidance for interactions with federal officials — Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol.

It should be noted that simply being in the U.S. illegally is a civil offense, not a criminal one.

The guide also notes that the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against “unreasonable searches and seizures” still apply to everyone in the U.S. regardless of their immigration status.

However, the guide also acknowledges that asserting U.S. constitutional protections to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Border Patrol now can carry a heavy price.

“It is important to do a personal risk assessment grounded in knowing your constitutional rights but also knowing the trends of immigration enforcement in your area and making a determination for yourself on what to do next,” said Melissa Bowe, an attorney and co-executive director of the Immigration Law and Justice Network.

“The stakes are high, and insisting on our rights comes with more risk and could intensify one’s interaction with these ICE or Border Patrol agents.”

Federal immigration enforcement agents have used increasingly aggressive tactics including entering homes without judicial warrants, breaking car windows to pull people from their vehicles, separating children from their families and fatally shooting two observers — Renee Good and Alex Pretti.

Since Trump’s second term began a year ago, immigration agents have killed four people in their operations and another 32 people have died in detention centers — a 20-year high.

The New York Times reported that for the past month, agents have seized more than 100 refugees in Minnesota and sent them to a detention center in Texas to be revetted. Those released have needed to pay their own way back. The refugees all have no criminal record and are here legally in the U.S.

The agents’ tactics have received rebukes in court, sparked public outcry and now face scrutiny in Congress.

Amid this intensifying public attention, Bowe said it is important for those who feel safe enough to insist on their rights to record and document immigration enforcements’ actions.

“This is one of the only ways we can try to hold immigration enforcement accountable to the general public and accountable long term,” she said.

All people have a First Amendment right to record ICE or Border Patrol agents in public spaces, provided they do not physically obstruct their work.

“Usually that means staying at a distance (roughly 10 feet) and obeying orders to move for safety reasons,” Bowe said.

The Immigration Law and Justice Network offers the following guidance for what to do if you are:

Stopped on the street?

Ask “Am I free to leave?” Immigration enforcement is not allowed to keep asking you questions without reason. Before giving them your name or any information, ask if you are free to go. If they say “yes,” stay away from the place. If they say “no,” tell them you do not want to answer any questions and you want to talk to a lawyer. In some states, you may have to share your name, but that is it.

If ICE searches you or your belongings, you have the right to say: “I do not agree to this search.”

Stopped in a car?

Do not answer any questions related to your immigration status or your country of origin. Say: “I want to exercise my right to remain silent” and “I want to speak with a lawyer.” If the officer asks to search your vehicle, you have the right to refuse consent to any search. They cannot do it without a judicial warrant unless there is reasonable suspicion.

If you are driving along border states, Border Patrol could pull you over and you could encounter checkpoints. They can pull you over if they have reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation or a crime, and they may ask questions about your status. They can continue to detain you to inquire about your status, but they cannot force you to speak or to sign anything.

Facing ICE at the door of your home or facility?

Do not open the door. Federal agents theoretically cannot enter your home or facility without a judicial warrant. Also beware of sneaky tactics. Immigration enforcement often uses tricks to get you to open the door, so be wary of anything they say, the Immigration Law and Justice Network warns.

You have the right to ask to see the warrant. If the agents say they have a warrant, tell them to pass it under the door before opening it. If you are at the door of a facility, you can ask to review the warrant while they wait outside the front entrance.

Check the warrant thoroughly. Confirm the name and address on the order to make sure it is precise to your location. Also verify that a judge has signed it. An ICE warrant is different from a court-mandated, judicial warrant. During raids, agents often say they have a “warrant” when all they have is an ICE warrant.

If in a facility, designate “private spaces” with closed doors. If ICE comes to your church or other facility, people inside have stronger privacy rights when out of “public spaces” like waiting rooms.

The United Methodist ministry also says what not to do.

Do not run. If you run, federal agents may go after you.

Do not show false documents, be it a fake driver’s license or other fake identification.

Do not sign anything without the advice of an attorney.

Any of these actions could make an encounter go worse or result in more legal trouble.

This is a critical time for people of all faiths to be present with their immigrant neighbors and to bear witness to what is happening, said retired Bishop Minerva Carcaño, chair of the Council of Bishops Immigration Task Force.

“If we are startled by a government that is increasingly acting in authoritarian ways and outside the bounds of U.S. laws and policies, immigrants — even those who are in the U.S. legally — are living in extreme fear for their lives,” she said.

What is happening now reminds the bishop of when Christians needed to go into hiding during times of persecution when the Roman Empire saw Jesus’ teachings as threat to imperial rule.

“We United Methodists believe that we are called to live in and as witnesses of the boundless compassion, mercy, love and justice of the Kingdom of God inaugurated in Jesus,” Carcaño said. “This is the time to be faithful.”",https://www.umnews.org/-/media/umc-media/2026/01/28/18/10/4th-amendment-graphic-parchment-2026-1200x800px.jpg?mw=1200&hash=4979787E90142ED5334683E869D65FD1,N,,2026-01-28 14:15:49.897803

First, budget reconciliation is an expedited procedure for enacting legislation that primarily affects federal spending and revenues.","In 1997, the United States District Court for the Central District of California approved the Flores Settlement Agreement (“the Settlement”), which establishes a nationwide policy for the detention, release, and treatment of minors in immigration detention. The Settlement requires that children be held in safe and sanitary conditions, placed in state-licensed facilities or their equivalent, and released without unnecessary delay when detention is not required.

The Trump administration now seeks to terminate the Settlement, arguing that “changed circumstances” render continued enforcement inequitable. In particular, the administration points to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB Act), enacted in July 2025 through budget reconciliation. The OBBB Act appropriates $45 billion for detention capacity, including family detention in Family Residential Centers (FRC). The administration claims this appropriation reflects congressional approval of a policy shift favoring the detention of immigrant families and children. The district court correctly rejected the administration’s argument, and the administration appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

In January 2026, the Constitutional Accountability Center filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit on behalf of Members of Congress, opposing termination of the Flores Settlement. Our brief explains that a budget reconciliation bill cannot be read to silently displace the Settlement’s protections.

First, budget reconciliation is an expedited procedure for enacting legislation that primarily affects federal spending and revenues. Because reconciliation bills bypass the Senate’s normal 60-vote requirement, the process is subject to important constraints designed to prevent abuse. The most significant is the Byrd Rule, which prohibits the inclusion of “extraneous” matter in reconciliation legislation—including substantive policy changes that dwarf their budgetary impact. The Senate is careful to enforce the Byrd Rule to ensure it remains a meaningful constraint on the reconciliation process.

Second, the administration’s reliance on the OBBB Act rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of what reconciliation can accomplish. The OBBB Act’s detention provisions survived reconciliation precisely because they are appropriations—money for detention capacity—not changes to the legal standards governing detention. A provision terminating the Settlement would be a major substantive policy change that could not have

survived the reconciliation process. Accordingly, the OBBB Act cannot constitute a “changed circumstance” warranting termination of the Settlement.

Because the OBBB Act did not—and indeed, could not—signal a policy shift toward family detention, the Ninth Circuit should affirm the district court’s decision refusing to terminate the Settlement.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2026-01-28 14:16:01.844375

San Mateo County’s federal representatives are speaking out against the federal immigration escalation in Minneapolis in recent weeks — an aggressive, Trump-administration backed crackdown that resulted in the death of two American citizens.

President Trump and others in his administration have justified clashes with protesters in Minneapolis as action against intentional agitators and, in some cases, domestic terrorists, seeking to impede immigration action.

But the recent killings of both Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal agents have sparked nationwide backlash and reproach. The attacks on protesters have removed all credibility from Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Rep. Kevin Mullin, D-South San Francisco, said.

“We need to rein in and overhaul ICE immediately. I would not support another dime for ICE,” he said. “What we are witnessing here is deeply disturbing. ICE needs to be out of Minnesota immediately. The attacks on American citizens are unconscionable.”

Mullin said, as of now, he has not heard of an ICE surge coming to the Bay Area, a concern that has been floated in recent weeks given the amount of attention driven to the area by the upcoming Super Bowl.

“We will keep our ear to the ground and our antennae very high,” he said.

Both Mullin and U.S. Rep. Sam Liccardo, D-San Jose, voted no on a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. They are also calling for the impeachment of U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.

Senate Democrats are also threatening to vote no on a bill that includes DHS funding without new guardrails, a threat that could potentially shut down swaths of the federal government.

“I am advocating with members of the Senate to vote, as I did, against a DHS appropriations bill to ensure we do not continue to fund lawlessness,” Liccardo said. “I am urging colleagues to support articles of impeachment against Kristi Noem, and I’m being public about my conviction that criminal prosecution is essential.”

It’s imperative that Democrats take back the House of Representatives in the upcoming November midterms, Mullin said, a statement that he’s reiterated as Democrats continue to push back against Trump despite their minority hold in both houses of Congress.

“The reality is there’s no replacement for political power. We have to take back the House of Representatives to be a check on this lawless administration,” he said. “I’m doing everything in my power to make that become a reality.”

That power will then allow for the accountability and investigation into ICE and Border Patrol agents responsible for Pretti and Good’s deaths, Mullin said.

Liccardo also stressed the need for far greater accountability and oversight.

“You criminally prosecute those ICE agents who are violating the law. You ensure compliance with civil rights,” he said. “You dramatically downsize the department, which is bloated and ineffective, and you eliminate these horrific quotas that they seem to be trying to satisfy.”

At the same time, he encouraged those protesting to remain peaceful.

“ICE activity has created extraordinary passion on the streets, and my very deep concern is that passion takes a harmful path that then justifies the imposition of martial law in the minds of this deranged president,” Liccardo said. “Our First Amendment rights should be fully exercised without raising a fist.”",https://kevinmullin.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cropped-logo-1-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-28 18:18:13.598488

California Democratic senators advanced a measure Tuesday that would make it easier for people to sue federal agents over civil rights violations, a bill shaped by fears of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement practices.

The bill from Sens. Scott Wiener and Aisha Wahab, both Bay Area Democrats, took on additional significance after federal agents gunned down Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen and ICU nurse, in Minnesota last weekend. Senators discussed the measure on the floor for more than 90 minutes before voting along party lines, 30 to 10, to send it to the Assembly.

“It’s a sad statement on where we are in this country that this has to be a partisan issue,” Wiener said just before the vote on his bill, which is also known as the “No Kings Act”. “Red, blue, everyone has constitutional rights. And everyone should have the ability to hold people accountable when they violate those rights.”

It’s among several bills lawmakers are moving forward in the new year to confront an escalation of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics and to protect immigrant communities. They include bills that would tax for-profit detention companies, prohibit law enforcement officers from moonlighting as federal agents and attempt to curb courthouse arrests.

Those efforts follow a slate of legislation signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom last year to resist the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign in California, including a first-in-the nation measure to prohibit officers from wearing masks and others that limit their access to schools and hospitals.

While some of those laws are facing legal challenges, the new batch of proposals offer “practical solutions that are squarely within the state’s control,” said Shiu-Ming Cheer, deputy director at California Immigrant Policy Center.

Here’s a look at some of the key bills lawmakers are considering:

No moonlighting as a federal agent

Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Democrat from Culver City, authored a bill that would prohibit law enforcement from taking a side job as a federal immigration agent.

At a press conference in San Francisco earlier this month, Bryan said the measure is especially timely as the federal administration ramps up its recruitment of California’s local law enforcement.

“We don’t collaborate in the kidnapping of our own community members, but there is a loophole in state law,” he said. “While you can’t collaborate with ICE while you are working in your police shift, you can take a second job with the Department of Homeland Security. And I don’t think that that is right.”

In an interview with CalMatters, he said the legislation is intended to bring transparency and accountability, and to close that loophole.

“The federal administration has created not just a secret police but a secret military at the expense of health care, social safety nets, and key benefits that the American people need and rely on to make it through the day,” said Bryan. “All of those resources have been rerouted to the unaccounted militarized force patrolling our streets and literally killing American citizens.”

Keep ICE awy from courthouses

Sen. Eloise Gómez Reyes, a Democrat from San Bernardino, introduced legislation to prevent federal immigration agents from making “unannounced and indiscriminate” arrests in courthouses.

“The issue is clear cut,” said Gómez Reyes in a statement. “One of the core responsibilities of government is to protect people — not to inflict terror on them. California is not going to let the federal government make political targets out of people trying to be good stewards of the law. Discouraging people from coming to court makes our community less safe.”

The legislation was introduced nearly two weeks after a federal judge ordered that the U.S. Justice Department halt civil arrests in immigration courts across Northern California, ruling that its deportation policies hadn’t addressed the “chilling effects, safety risks, and impacts on hearing attendance.”

Efforts to bolster protections in California courthouses have also been championed by Sen. Susan Rubio, a Democrat from West Covina, who introduced a bill that would allow remote courthouse appearances for the majority of civil or criminal state court hearings, trials or conferences until January 2029.

Taxing detention centers

Assemblymember Matt Haney, a Democrat from San Francisco, introduced a bill that would place a 50% tax on profits from immigration detention centers. Over 5,700 people are being held in seven immigration detention centers across California, three of which are located in Kern County.

Escalating ‘resistance’

Cheer, of California Immigrant Policy Center, said the early introduction of the bills demonstrates more urgency from the state Legislature to tackle issues around immigration enforcement.

“My hope for this year is that the state can be as bold and innovative as possible seeing the crisis communities are facing from immigration enforcement,” she said.

That means ensuring funding for attorneys to represent people facing deportation, addressing existing gaps in state laws around information sharing with the federal government, and looking into companies that are directly profiting from the business of arresting and deporting people, Cheer said.

Republicans have criticized the measures, which they characterize as overstepping on federal priorities.

“No one likes to see what’s happening in Minnesota. No one wants to see that coming to California,” said Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican representing Huntington Beach. Instead, he argued, cities and states should jettison their so-called “sanctuary” policies that hamper coordination between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.

He also criticized Democrats for taking precious Senate time to prepare for hypothetical scenarios rather than addressing existing problems in California.

“At the end of the day, we have a lot of serious issues here in California, and we need to start focusing on California-specific issues.”

Kevin Johnson, an immigration law professor and former dean of the UC Davis School of Law, said state and local governments are trying to figure out how far to go in resisting federal immigration enforcement given Trump’s threats to pull funding from sanctuary jurisdictions.

“While there’s concern and fear in immigrant communities, there’s some solace being given by the support expressed by state and local officials,” he said. “As the Trump administration escalates its aggressive deportation tactics across the nation, California has escalated its resistance.”

“ICE doesn’t need ‘reform,’ it needs to be shut down completely, and anything short of that should be a nonstarter.","Democrats are grappling with how to handle the complex political issue of immigration reform and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on the heels of two fatal shootings by federal authorities in Minneapolis.

Immigration reform has always been a slippery issue for Democrats, and they are haunted by the 2024 presidential election, when President Trump was able to win over voters by making the border — and perception of Democratic weakness on the issue — one of his strengths.

But Democrats are starting to think the issue could work in their favor going forward.

“The mistake in 2024 was that Democrats didn’t want to talk about immigration so they only talked about it when they were asked about it,” said Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, who served as a communications director for Kamala Harris when she was vice president.

He said the issue now “works in Democrats favor” because Trump’s approval ratings on the subject are upside down and his administration has had to reverse course on its handling of ICE amid the furor over the shootings.

Democrats, seeking to put Republicans back on their heels, are vowing not to fund ICE, a move that could put spending for the Pentagon and other departments at risk.

Still, Democrats are torn on how to proceed long term. Some progressives, for example, want to abolish ICE, while others talk about reform.

One Democratic operative who has been at the center of discussions on how to handle the overall issue called it a “stubborn clash of perspectives” between the strategist class who “over-index for how the language of the moment will age” and the grassroots organizations “who have a finger on the pulse of where opinion lies.”

“Both of those perspectives could probably benefit from some humility that people’s opinions are constantly shifting based on what they are experiencing,” the operative said.

For now, it appears public sentiment may be moving toward the position of progressives.

A YouGov poll released last week showed that 46 percent of those surveyed — including 19 percent of Republicans — said they would support abolishing ICE. The poll showed that 41 percent opposed abolishing ICE.

It’s a significant shift from June, when just 27 percent of those surveyed — and 9 percent of Republicans — supported abolishing ICE.

The poll also showed that closing the agency has gained approval among independents: 47 percent backed eliminating ICE, a notable increase since June when only 25 percent supported the shuttering of the agency.

Public opinion is also changing overall on the issue, with more people saying ICE tactics have “gone too far,” according to a New York Times/Siena poll released last week, before Alex Pretti was killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minnesota.

The poll found 9 in 10 Democrats, roughly 7 in 10 independents and 2 in 10 Republicans thought ICE tactics had gone too far. The survey showed that only 26 percent of those polled said ICE’s tactics were “about right.”

Some Democrats said their leadership — including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) — needed to take a tougher stance.

“We’re living in a wild world when Schumer and Jeffries are to the right of Fox News and the Catholic Church, whose leaders have called to defund ICE and even the Department of Homeland Security,” said Christy Setzer, a democratic strategist.

“ICE doesn’t need ‘reform,’ it needs to be shut down completely, and anything short of that should be a nonstarter. If morality isn’t compelling to Democratic leadership, they could also read a poll: A majority support abolishing ICE, regardless of what our side’s most feckless consultants might argue,” Setzer said.

A handful of Democratic presidential contenders — not just the progressive leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), but also Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker — have called for ICE to be abolished.

Others are taking a more moderate tone. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who many see as the front-runner in the 2028 race, said he doesn’t agree with the shuttering of the agency but that he supports “comprehensive immigration reform.”

In a memo this week, Third Way, a Democratic think tank, said the agency needed “a top to bottom overhaul.”

“Immigration enforcement is necessary—but it must be safe, disciplined, and professional,” the memo said. “Show Americans that accountability and professionalism are not optional in federal law enforcement.”

In an effort to strike a more conciliatory tone, Trump on Monday called Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) following the fatal shooting, and said both conversations were “very good.”

During a briefing with reporters, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also said that “nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives.”

“There’s been a noticeable shift from the first 24 hours of messaging from the administration, which reflects some concerns from congressional allies and leading voices around the country,” Republican strategist Kevin Madden said.

“The Republican Party’s grassroots has strong Second Amendment and Fourth Amendment coalitions, and this incident has elicited enough concerns to generate a shift in tactics and approach,” Madden added.

“We’re already seeing this carry over to funding debates taking place in Congress,” he said. “Whether it leads to another shutdown and contributes to another degree of polarization remains to be seen.”

Simmons and other Democrats say the party can’t simply push for the shuttering of ICE or for significant reforms without offering solutions.

“Democrats have to talk about it proactively,” Simmons said. “The ideas have to go hand in hand. The trick is to assert their strength on keeping the border secure while assuring the public that they can do that in a more just fashion.”

“The risk for Democrats is to be too tepid,” he added. “They have to pick the right fights and fight like hell on them.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26026857553406-e1769551246524.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-28 16:16:03.199136

On 5 January, Luis Gustavo Núñez Cáceres, a 42-year-old immigrant from Honduras, died in ICE custody at HCA Houston Healthcare in Conroe, Texas. He had been admitted into the Houston-area hospital for a heart-related condition, according to an ICE statement. Núñez was first arrested by ICE agents during an operation in Houston on 17 November and was eventually transferred to the Joe Corley processing center in Conroe. On New Year’s Eve, ICE said, “he suffered multiple life-threatening medical emergencies, and HCA medical personnel moved him to the intensive care unit, where he remained until his death”. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement to the Guardian: “We have maintained higher standard of care than most prisons that hold US citizens – including providing access to proper medical care.” For many immigrants, the DHS said, “this is the best healthcare they have received their entire lives”.

“My brother was a person full of life and hope, always fighting for his wellbeing and that of our family,” Núñez’s brother wrote in Spanish on a GoFundMe page requesting assistance in bringing his brother’s body home. “Sadly, his life was cut short due to the lack of adequate medical care while he was in ICE custody.”

Geraldo Lunas Campos

On 3 January, while in ICE custody, a Cuban immigrant died of homicide, according to a recent autopsy report. Geraldo Lunas Campos, a 55-year-old father of four, died at the ICE facility Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas. In a 9 January statement, ICE said, “Lunas became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm. He was subsequently placed in segregation.” Medical personnel were called for assistance when they noticed him in distress, ICE claimed. The federal government later claimed that staff had been trying to save Lunas as he attempted suicide.

However, a witness told the Associated Press that Lunas Campos was handcuffed and that he was put into a chokehold until he became unconscious. The El Paso county medical examiner’s office autopsy report said that his body showed signs of damaged vessels on his neck and injury on his knees and chest, according to PBS.

Lunas Campos was originally arrested by immigration enforcement agents in Rochester, New York, in July, ICE said, and that he had been in the US for 30 years.

Víctor Manuel Díaz

A 36-year-old Nicaraguan immigrant, Víctor Manuel Díaz, also died at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, on 14 January. In a statement following his death, ICE said that security staff found him “unconscious and unresponsive in his room”. ICE said that Díaz’s death was a “presumed suicide” but that his death remained under investigation.

“I don’t believe he took his life,” Díaz’s brother Yorlan Díaz told ABC News. “He was not a criminal. He was looking for a better life and he wanted to help our mother.”

Parady La

A Pennsylvania man, Parady La, died while in ICE custody at the Thomas Jefferson University hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 9 January. The 46-year-old Cambodian immigrant was picked up near his Upper Darby home a few days before his death, his family told 6 ABC Action News. In a statement, ICE said that La was found unresponsive in the federal detention center in Philadelphia, where he was receiving treatment for drug withdrawal.

He was given Narcan and then taken to the hospital and diagnosed with organ failures, among other conditions. His family was notified on 8 January and visited him at the hospital, after they had spent days searching for him.

His daughter, Jazmine La, said that her father “was a real person and people loved him”.

Renee Nicole Good

Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by a federal agent in her car on 7 January. The 37-year-old mother of three was a poet and writer who had moved to Minneapolis from Kansas City, Missouri, last year.

The DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, said that the law enforcement agent who killed Good had responded to an “act of domestic terrorism”.

Good studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia, where she won an Academy of American Poets prize in 2020.

Donna Ganger, her mother, told the Minnesota Star Tribune: “Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known.”

Luis Beltrán Yáñez–Cruz

On 6 January, Honduran immigrant Luis Beltrán Yáñez–Cruz died at the John F Kennedy memorial hospital in Indio, California, from heart-related issues, according to an ICE statement following his death. The father of three initially entered the US in 1993, according to ICE, was removed from the country, and re-entered at least 20 years ago. ICE arrested him in Newark, New Jersey, in November 2025.

According to ICE, Yáñez-Cruz was detained at Imperial regional detention facility in Calexico and was later transferred to the hospital for chest pain, where he died.

His daughter, Josselyn Yanez, told News Channel 3 that his heart-related issues began after he was detained. “My soul was destroyed,” she said, “because I really hoped that my father would leave that place, but not in this way.”

Heber Sánchez Domínguez

Heber Sánchez Domínguez, a 34-year-old from Mexico, died at the Robert A Deyton detention center in Lovejoy, Georgia, on 14 January. In a statement, ICE said that he was found unresponsive and that his death was under investigation. After being arrested in Georgia on 7 January for driving without a license, he was transferred to the Lovejoy detention center as he awaited removal proceedings. ICE said that the detention center staff found him hanging by his neck and transferred him to the Piedmont Henry medical center, where he was pronounced dead.

The Mexican consulate in Atlanta told CBS News that Mexican officials have asked that “the circumstances of the incident be clarified”.

Alex Pretti

Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse for a veterans affairs hospital, was fatally shot by federal agents during an anti-ICE protest in Minneapolis on 24 January. The 37-year-old Minneapolis resident was trying to help a woman who had been pushed to the ground by ICE agents when he was tackled, beaten, restrained and shot to death.

Following his death, the senior White House official Stephen Miller wrote on X: “A domestic terrorist tried to assassinate federal law enforcement …” Video evidence showed that Pretti, who was carrying a firearm around his waist, was holding only his phone in his hand and that he was disarmed before being shot.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcb87fc89945fc3a39ab3f0063eddd7aa4ab5ea2/335_0_3331_2666/master/3331.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=000504cb2dfbbd79be9793ab62fc46e8",N,,2026-01-28 16:16:12.007819

Besides the Everglades facility, other detention centers getting unwanted attention include ICE facilities at the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas; one in Miami; and others in California City and Adelanto, both in California.","FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) — Two former detainees at an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator Alcatraz” testified Wednesday that they could be punished for seeking legal advice and had to write down phone numbers for attorneys on walls and beds using soap because they had no access to pen and paper.

The two men, one who was deported to Colombia and another who was sent back to Haiti, testified via video in a federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, that their monitored calls to people outside the detention center would be dropped whenever they talked about seeking legal advice or trying to get an attorney.

During a two-day hearing that started Wednesday, civil rights attorneys representing the detainees were seeking a temporary injunction from U.S. District Judge Sheri Polster Chappell that would ensure that detainees at the state-run Everglades facility get the same access to their attorneys as they do at federally-run detention centers. The Everglades facility was built last summer at a remote airstrip by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration.

The detainees’ lawsuit claims that their First Amendment rights are being violated. They say their attorneys have to make an appointment to visit three days in advance, unlike at other immigration detention facilities where lawyers can just show up during visiting hours; that detainees often are transferred to other facilities after their attorneys had made an appointment to see them; and that scheduling delays have been so lengthy that detainees were unable to meet with attorneys before key deadlines.

During Wednesday morning's hearing, the former detainees testified remotely from their home countries using translators and only their initials to protect their identities. While at the facility, the former detainee from Haiti said he was asked to sign documents he didn't understand, which ended up being papers to self-deport to Haiti where he feared going back to. He had asked for asylum in the United States.

He then was presented with a second-set of papers which someone explained to him would get him self-deported to Mexico, which he signed because of his fear of returning to Haiti. In the end, he was sent back to Haiti, he said.

State officials who are defendants in the lawsuit denied restricting the detainees' access to their attorneys and said any protocols were in place for security reasons and to make sure there was sufficient staffing. Federal officials who also are defendants said that no First Amendment rights were being violated.

“Moreover, any Alligator Alcatraz policy regarding attorney-detainee communications is valid so long as it reasonably relates to legitimate penological interest,” they wrote.

The third witness to testify Wednesday was Juan Lopez Vega, deputy field office director of ICE's enforcement and removal operations in Miami, who unsuccessfully tried to quash a subpoena compelling him to show up in court. Even though his job included oversight of detainees at the state-run facility, he testified that he had visited the center only once.

Case is 1 of 3 federal lawsuits

The case over access to the legal system was one of three federal lawsuits challenging practices at the immigration detention center. Another lawsuit brought by detainees in federal court in Fort Myers argued that immigration was a federal issue, and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state had no authority to operate the facility under federal law. That lawsuit ended earlier this month after the immigrant detainee who filed the case agreed to be removed from the United States.

In the third lawsuit, a federal judge in Miami last summer ordered the facility to wind down operations over two months because officials had failed to do a review of the detention center’s environmental impact. But an appellate court panel put that decision on hold for the time being, allowing the facility to stay open.

Florida has led other states in constructing facilities to support President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. Besides the Everglades facility, which received its first detainees in July, Florida has opened an immigration detention center in northeast Florida and is looking at opening a third facility in the Florida Panhandle.

Besides the Everglades facility, other detention centers getting unwanted attention include ICE facilities at the Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas; one in Miami; and others in California City and Adelanto, both in California. Common complaints include poor and insufficient food and lack of access to attorneys.

The ICE detainee population, which excludes Alligator Alcatraz and other state-run facilities, has roughly doubled to about 70,000 since Trump took office a year ago, fueled by a one-time injection of $45 billion for immigration detention.

John Fetterman (D-Penn.)
In the case of ICE, Jentleson writes, Democrats should embrace reforming, not abolishing, the agency.
The polling comes as Senate Democrats are demanding to re-negotiate a hulking DHS funding bill ahead of a Friday midnight deadline for a partial government shutdown, carving it off from a six-bill appropriations package.
Senate Democrats have embraced this push.
“Senate Democrats should embrace this reality and use their leverage to achieve meaningful changes that rein in ICE’s abuses and refocus the agency on its critical law enforcement mission,” Jentleson writes.","The memo was written by Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff to Sen. John Fetterman (D-Penn.) and top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), for his organization the Searchlight Institute, which conducted the 1,502-person online survey alongside Tavern Research.

The influential new think tank seeks to push the Democratic Party toward broadly popular positions, regardless of ideology. In the case of ICE, Jentleson writes, Democrats should embrace reforming, not abolishing, the agency.

“Democrats should use their leverage to demand commonsense reforms to ICE that have the backing of broad bipartisan majorities of Americans,” Jentleson writes in the memo, which came across the desk of aides to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Tuesday and continued to make the rounds among Senate Democrats early Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Searchlight’s latest survey finds that “bipartisan majorities of voters oppose ICE’s lawless tactics, including detaining U.S. citizens (73 percent), entering people’s homes without warrants (79 percent), and failing to wear clearly identifying uniforms (70 percent)”, according to the memo.

The polling comes as Senate Democrats are demanding to re-negotiate a hulking DHS funding bill ahead of a Friday midnight deadline for a partial government shutdown, carving it off from a six-bill appropriations package.

“This is likely to be their last major leverage point for several months at least if not for the rest of the year” to curtail the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, Jentleson told POLITICO. “But there’s a larger reason, which is that the tragic events that have unfolded in Minneapolis have shocked the conscience of Americans and brought their attention to the horrible shit that ICE is doing. Those two things combined give them a lot of leverage at this moment.”

Democratic likely midterm voters were split in the poll over how to change ICE, with 34 percent favoring reforming ICE and 33 percent wanting to get rid of it as an agency — meaning that it’s “a coin flip among Democrats,” Jentleson said. That indicates that in contested Democratic primaries, it’s not clear which side of that debate will have the edge with base voters.

What’s clearer, he wrote in the memo, is that voters do support some degree of immigration enforcement. The memo notes that the view that “immigrants living in the U.S. illegally should not be deported” receives no more than 30 percent support among Democrats and young people, and even less among other groups.

Senate Democrats have embraced this push.

Speaking on the Senate floor Tuesday, Schumer seemed to set the predicate for the partial shutdown, saying any administrative actions on ICE wouldn’t be enough and that “any fix should come from Congress. The public can’t trust the administration to do the right thing on its own and the Republicans and Democrats must work together to make that happen.”

Senate Republicans face a Friday midnight deadline to avert a shutdown. GOP Sens. Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski have said that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should be fired. President Donald Trump acknowledged shaking up his border security leadership team Tuesday.

There were believed to be about 7.1 million foreign nationals living in Spain at the beginning of last year, of whom an estimated 840,000 were in the country without authorization.
More than 10,000 migrants died trying to reach Spain in 2024, according to the Spanish advocacy group Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders).","As President Donald Trump terrorizes immigrants and Americans alike with his deadly mass deportation blitz while warning European leaders to tighten their borders by raising the racist specter of ""civilizational erasure,"" Spain's government is moving against the xenophobic tide by offering hundreds of thousands of migrants a chance at permanent legal residency.

The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and the leftist Podemos party reached an agreement Monday following the collection of more than 700,000 petition signatures in favor of a legislative initiative to legalize up to 500,000 undocumented migrants.

Those who can prove that they were in Spain for at least five months before December 31, 2025 and have no criminal record will be eligible for permanent legal residency with permission to work.

Spanish Migration Minister Elma Saiz (PSOE) said during a press conference that ""today is a historic day"" for starting the process of legalizing hundreds of thousands of immigrants in a country that has made great strides in overcoming its legacy of racism and xenophobia.

The far-right Vox party called the legalization plan ""madness"" that promotes ""barbarity.""

However, Saiz said that legalization will help Spain “recognize, dignify, and give guarantees” to people who already live and work in the country.

“We’re reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, on integration, and on coexistence that’s compatible with both economic growth and social cohesion,” she added.

Responding to arguments that legalizing so many migrants would severely strain Spain's social safety net, Podemos Secretary General Ione Belarra said on social media, ""What overwhelms public services are your cuts and privatizations.""

Belarra also said that some opponents of legalization are angry that they will no longer be able to exploit migrants by paying them less than legal workers.

Podemos Political Secretary Irene Montero said Tuesday that ""we have a legal obligation to guarantee [migrant] rights and that is what this regularization is, which we hope will reach all the people without papers in Spain who were here before December 31, 2025.""

Spain's population is approximately 49.4 million. Legalizing half a million immigrants would be the equivalent of granting permanent residency to about 3.6 million migrants in the United States. There were believed to be about 7.1 million foreign nationals living in Spain at the beginning of last year, of whom an estimated 840,000 were in the country without authorization.

Sánchez's PSOE-led government has been supportive of immigrants since coming to power in 2018, offering safe harbor for migrants arriving in Europe by sea when other European Union nations have moved to restrict their entry. More than 10,000 migrants died trying to reach Spain in 2024, according to the Spanish advocacy group Caminando Fronteras (Walking Borders).

Meanwhile, Trump's latest National Security Strategy, released last month, urges the US to ""cultivate resistance"" to immigration in Europe, espousing racist ""great replacement"" ideology while warning of “the real and stark prospect of civilizational erasure.""

“Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less,"" the document states.

European nations including Denmark, Germany, Greece, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have recently tightened their migration and asylum policies, in some cases partially due to pressure from Washington.

Responding to Trump's deadly anti-immigrant crackdown—which has killed both immigrants and US citizens—Montero said Tuesday that “in the United States at the moment there are millions of people who are afraid in their own homes because Trump’s migration policy enters people’s homes and takes them away.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=63368088&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C166%2C0%2C167,N,,2026-01-28 17:14:35.547943

Welcome to The Logoff: After killing Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend, the Trump administration is preparing to sweep his death under the rug.

What’s happening? On Tuesday, MS NOW broke the news that the Justice Department will not be opening a civil rights investigation into the shooting death of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday, a departure from standard practice.

Instead, an investigation into the shooting will be handled internally by Border Patrol’s parent agency, Customs and Border Protection, which will reportedly probe whether Pretti’s killer violated agency policy.

Additionally, another Department of Homeland Security agency, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) — which is a part of ICE — is said to be investigating whether Pretti himself committed any crimes.

What’s the context? The Trump administration’s decision may be shocking, but it’s not surprising: After an ICE agent, Jonathan Ross, shot and killed Renee Good at close range earlier this month, the DOJ quashed a civil rights investigation into her death by the FBI. Instead, top DOJ officials pressed to investigate Good’s widow — a move which caused at least 10 DOJ prosecutors to resign in protest.

As my colleague Ian Millhiser has reported, it’s also difficult — though not necessarily impossible — for state courts to prosecute the federal officers who killed Good and Pretti.

Why does this matter? The set of facts around Pretti’s death, captured on video for the world to see, is horrifying: He was gunned down by federal agents who, after beating him to his knees, fired at least 10 shots within seconds. When he was killed, he was attempting to protect a woman who had been pepper-sprayed by the same federal agents moments ago.

But under the Trump administration, there’s little reason to believe there will be any accountability for his death: In 16 shootings by federal immigration agents since last summer, none have resulted in criminal charges against the agents, or even any known disciplinary measures.

Minneapolis, Minn. — The Advocates for Human Rights and a detained individual have filed a class action lawsuit that challenges the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful detention practices at detention facilities in Minnesota. Amidst aggressive action by federal agencies, people are being detained without access to lawyers and denied confidential communication – all actions that violate the Constitution, federal law, and basic human rights. Democracy Forward and Fredrikson & Byron P.A. represent the plaintiffs.

The lawsuit challenges officials in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and federal security officials for deliberately blocking access to counsel for immigrants detained at the most critical moments of detention. Many are being transferred out of Minnesota or being pressured to abandon their rights before attorneys have any meaningful opportunity to reach them.

Individuals who have been detained at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis reveal violent arrests, extreme overcrowding, and constant shackling. DHS is further perpetuating these horrific conditions by blocking detainees from accessing legal counsel to seek their freedom. One 19-year-old Minnesota resident described being thrown to the ground when he tried to show officers his immigration papers, despite not resisting. “I was never offered a lawyer at any point,” he said. After being held in a cell packed far beyond capacity, he was shackled at the wrists, ankles, and waist, placed on a bus and a plane, and transferred out of state without being told where he was going. “I felt like I had been kidnapped,” he stated.

Another detainee, a refugee living in Minneapolis, described being surrounded by roughly 20 officers, pulled from his car, mocked by agents, and detained in a room that eventually filled with nearly 100 people. According to his testimony, detainees were forced to sleep standing up near an overflowing toilet with no privacy, denied beds and blankets, and allowed to make a few phone calls only under constant surveillance. “It’s like they’re trying to drive you crazy,” he said. “Most of them treated us like animals.” He explained that ICE personnel pressured people to sign self-deportation papers and refused to let him speak with a lawyer, even though he believed—correctly—that his refugee status protected him from detention.

“Access to counsel is a fundamental human right, helping ensure due process in a hostile immigration system,” said Michele Garnett McKenzie, Executive Director of The Advocates for Human Rights. “When DHS restricts the ability of people to speak confidentially with their attorneys at the most crucial moments of their cases, the result is unjustified detention and suffering, and potentially removal to countries where detainees face the risk of persecution, torture, and death. The government must allow us to speak to our clients as required under federal law and the Constitution.”

“We continue to oppose the Trump-Vance administration’s form of ‘catch me if you can’ justice,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “The administration is detaining people in a federal facility that was never meant for long-term custody, denying them access to counsel, shackling them during secretive transfers, and using fear and exhaustion to pressure them into giving up their rights. This is a deliberate strategy to evade accountability, and it violates the Constitution and federal law. Access to a lawyer is a fundamental right in the United States. We call on all lawyers across the nation to commit to the defense of access to counsel and the rule of law.”

“The constitutional right to access to counsel is key to our system of justice. As lawyers, we have a duty to ensure that no person in government custody is denied the opportunity to understand their rights and receive fair treatment under the law,” said Alethea Huyser, attorney at Fredrikson & Byron.

The lawsuit seeks immediate court intervention to restore meaningful access to counsel, require confidential attorney-client communications, and prevent retaliatory and obstructive practices that block legal representation. It also challenges the federal government’s use of a civilian federal building as an unauthorized detention center without the safeguards required by law.

The case is The Advocates for Human Rights et al v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security et al., and the legal team at Democracy Forward includes Elena Goldstein, Jeff Dubner, Aman George, Mark Samburg, and Anashua Dutta.

Moore said he was trained in the 1980s to avoid engaging with moving vehicles, yet “40 years later, you see not just one occasion but multiple occasions of those tactics” from immigration agents.
The Trump administration said that Pretti had a gun, and that the officers had acted in self-defense.
In both shootings, experts also questioned why the agents were wearing masks and failed to render aid, and lamented the immediate rush to judgment by Trump administration officials.
Rob Bonta reminded California law enforcement that they have the right to investigate federal agents for violating state law.","Drawing on decades of experience after having dealt with the beating of Rodney King, the killing of George Floyd and more, American law enforcement leaders, civil rights advocates and other legal experts have honed best practices for officers making street arrests, conducting crowd control and maintaining public safety amid mass protests.

Officers are trained to not stand in front of or reach into moving vehicles, to never pull their firearms unless it is absolutely necessary, and to use force only in proportion to a corresponding threat. They are trained to clearly identify themselves, de-escalate tensions, respect the sanctity of life and quickly render aid to anyone they wound.

When police shootings occur, leaders are trained to carefully protect evidence and immediately launch an investigation — or multiple ones — in order to assure the community that any potential wrongdoing by officers will be fairly assessed.

According to many of those same leaders and experts, it has become increasingly clear in recent days that those standards have been disregarded — if not entirely tossed aside — by the federal immigration agents swarming into American cities on the orders of President Trump and administration officials tasked with overseeing the operations.

In both small, increasingly routine ways and sudden, stunning bursts — such as the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis — agents have badly breached those standards, the experts said, and without any apparent concern or investigative oversight from the administration.

Agents are entering homes without warrants, swarming moving vehicles in the street and escalating standoffs with protesters using excessive force, while department leaders and administration officials justify their actions with simple, brash rhetoric rather than careful, sophisticated investigations.

“It’s a terrible disappointment,” said former Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore. “These tactics — if you call them that — are far and away out of touch with contemporary policing standards.”

“This isn’t law enforcement, this is terror enforcement,” said Connie Rice, a longtime civil rights attorney who has worked on LAPD reforms for decades. “They’re not following any laws, any training. This is just thuggery.”

“They use excessive force against suspects and protesters, they detain and arrest people without legal cause, they violate the 1st Amendment rights of protesters and observers,” said Georgetown law professor Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor.

“These types of tactics end up hurting all of law enforcement, not just federal law enforcement, even though state and locals didn’t ask for these types of tactics, and, frankly, have been moving away from them for years out of a recognition that they undermine trust in communities and ultimately hurt their public safety mission,” said Vanita Gupta, associate attorney general under President Biden and head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division under President Obama.

The White House said Trump does not “want any Americans to lose their lives in the streets,” believes what happened to Pretti was “a tragedy” and has called for an “honorable and honest investigation.” But administration officials also have defended the immigration crackdown and the federal agents involved, blaming protesters for interfering with law enforcement operations and accusing critics of endangering agents. However, many of those critics said it is the tactics that are endangering officers.

Gupta said Trump’s immigration surge “deeply strains the critical partnerships” that local, state and federal law enforcement agencies typically have with one another, and puts local leaders in an “incredibly challenging position” in their communities.

“State and local chiefs have to spend 365 days of the year building trust in their community and establishing legitimacy ... and in comes this surge of federal agents who are acting out of control in their communities and creating very unsafe conditions on the ground,” Gupta said. “That is why you’re seeing more and more chiefs and former chiefs speaking out.”

Moore said the tactics are “unnecessarily exposing those agents to harm, physical harm, as well as driving an emotional response and losing legitimacy with the very public that, as an agency, they are saying they are there to protect.”

Issues on the ground

Good was fatally shot as she tried to drive away from a chaotic scene involving federal agents. The Trump administration said the officer who shot her was in danger of being run over. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, without evidence, accused Good, 37, of being a “domestic terrorist.”

Experts questioned why the group of agents swarmed Good’s vehicle, why the officer who fired positioned himself in front of it, and whether the officer was in fact in danger of being hit given Good was turning her wheel away from him. They especially questioned his later shots into the vehicle as it was passing him.

Under best practices for policing, officers are never to shoot into moving vehicles except in exigent circumstances, and are trained to avoid placing themselves in harm’s way. “You don’t put yourself in that position because you have the option to just take down the license plate number and go arrest them later if you think they’ve violated the law,” said Carol Sobel, a Los Angeles civil rights attorney who has driven police reform for decades.

Moore said he was trained in the 1980s to avoid engaging with moving vehicles, yet “40 years later, you see not just one occasion but multiple occasions of those tactics” from immigration agents.

Pretti was fatally shot after trying to protect a woman who was violently shoved to the ground by an immigration agent also spraying chemical irritant. The Trump administration said that Pretti had a gun, and that the officers had acted in self-defense. Without evidence, Noem alleged Pretti, also 37, was “attacking” agents and “brandishing” the gun, while White House advisor Stephen Miller alleged that Pretti “tried to murder federal agents.”

Experts questioned why the agents were being so aggressive with the woman Pretti was trying to help, and why they reacted so violently — with a burst of gunfire — when he was surrounded by agents, on the ground and already disarmed.

Moore said that the officer who shoved the woman appeared to be using “brute force rather than efforts to create de-escalation,” and that spraying irritants is never suitable for dealing with “passive resistance,” which appeared to be what the woman and Pretti were involved in.

In both shootings, experts also questioned why the agents were wearing masks and failed to render aid, and lamented the immediate rush to judgment by Trump administration officials.

Gupta said the immigration agents’ tactics were “out of line” with local, state and federal policing standards and “offensive to all of that work that has been done” to establish those standards.

Bernard Parks, another former chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, said that videos from the two incidents and other recent immigration operations make it clear the agents are “totally untrained” for the operation, which he called “poorly designed, poorly trained,” with a “total lack of common sense and decency.”

Ed Obayashi, an expert in police use of force, said that although the agents’ actions in the two shootings are under investigation, it is “obvious” that Trump administration officials have not followed best practices for conducting those inquiries.

“The scenes have been contaminated, I haven’t seen any evidence or any what you would call standard investigative protocols, like freezing the scene, witness checks, canvassing the neighborhood, supervisors responding to try to determine what happened,” he said.

The path forward

Last week, California joined other Democrat-led states in challenging the crackdown in Minneapolis in court, arguing that Noem’s department “has set in motion an extraordinary campaign of recklessness and disregard for norms of constitutional policing and the sanctity of life.”

On Sunday, the International Assn. of Chiefs of Police, which has played a central role in establishing modern policing standards in the U.S., said it believes that “effective public safety depends on comprehensive training, investigative integrity, adherence to the rule of law, and strong coordination among federal, state, and local partners,” and called on the White House to convene those partners for “policy-level discussions aimed at identifying a constructive path forward.”

On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta reminded California law enforcement that they have the right to investigate federal agents for violating state law.

Gupta said the Trump administration failing to investigate fatal shootings by federal agents while “boxing out” local and state officials suggests “impunity” for the agents and “puts the country in a very dangerous place” — and state investigators must allowed in to investigate.

Butler said that the situation would definitely be improved if agents started adhering to modern policing standards, but that problems will persist as long as Trump continues to demand that immigration agents arrest thousands of people per day.

“There’s just no kind and gentle way,” he said, “to take thousands of people off the streets every day.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/837361b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6844x3593+0+486/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F71%2F0f%2Ff3be8b204cd1a1525cd304a40491%2Fgettyimages-2257868805.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 12:22:15.178044

The fatal shootings of protestors have increased the national controversy regarding the unprecedented immigration enforcement actions underway across the nation. However, it is not just widespread protests that oppose the federal government’s aggressive enforcement tactics. Various lawsuits regarding Operation Metro Surge, the controversial federal enforcement action underway across Minnesota, are also pending.

While there is no exact count, it is estimated that at least hundreds of habeas petitions are proceeding that contest individual detentions, more than were filed in all of 2025. A habeas petition is a petition filed in federal court alleging a person is in custody in violation of their constitutional rights. This is notable because of a potential contempt of court order expected to be taken up in a hearing on Friday, January 30. More on that later in the blog.

First, let’s revisit ongoing criminal investigations and examine several notable federal lawsuits challenging the broader legality of Operation Metro Surge.

A Quick Note on Criminal and Civil Liability

The same considerations regarding civil and criminal liability for Jonathan Ross, who shot Renee Good, apply to the as-yet unidentified officers who shot Pretti. However, unlike in the Good case, politicians from both parties have called for a clear investigation by DHS. As yet, however, the federal government has sharply limited Minnesota officials' ability to investigate.

The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division has stated it will not open a civil rights investigation into Good’s death, and career staff were reportedly told the division would not investigate either killing. Shortly after Good’s death, several federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned after being pressed by senior DOJ officials to investigate Good’s widow instead of the ICE agent who shot her.

Currently, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations unit is leading the federal investigation into Pretti’s shooting, an unusual choice given that HSI is being asked to investigate agents from a different DHS component, Border Patrol. Lawmakers from both parties have called for greater transparency and questioned whether ICE can credibly investigate the shooting, especially after senior DHS officials publicly likened Good and Pretti to domestic terrorists within hours of each killing.

Challenging Operation Metro Surge

On Monday, January 26, Minnesota and the federal government argued their cases over the constitutionality of the federal enforcement action, which is taking place despite repeated pleas for ICE to leave the state from local officials, police departments across the metro area, local businesses, and large corporations headquartered in Minnesota.

Filed on behalf of the State of Minnesota by Attorney General Keith Ellison, the City of Minneapolis, and the City of St. Paul against Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and other federal officials, the complaint claims that Operation Metro Surge violates the First and Tenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.

Minnesota argues that the Trump administration is violating the equal sovereignty principle and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court recognized equal sovereignty under the U.S. Constitution in Shelby County v. Holder, holding that U.S. states are ""equal in power, dignity, and authority.” Minnesota argues that the federal government has treated the state disparately from other states due to its not voting for Trump. The plaintiffs are asking for a federal judge to halt Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota and stop the deployment of the thousands of federal immigration agents currently in the state

Federal U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Menendez presided over the hearing. The requested relief is extraordinary. Minnesota is asking Judge Menendez to issue an order that would pause the DHS surge in Minnesota.

Recently, the Trump administration has pledged to reduce the number of ICE and CBP officers in the state. However, this order would require the federal government to act and would not depend on ongoing political discussions among the White House, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

Minnesota argued the request is required due to the unique situation unfolding that has led to the deaths of two protesters. The federal government responded that issuing such an order would require federal authorities to stop enforcing federal laws, which it calls “absurd.”

At the hearing, Judge Menendez acknowledged the need for a quick resolution but said she would take the time needed and that “I’m doing everything I can to get it right.”

Note that this is a separate case from Tincher v. Noem. In that case, six plaintiffs alleged they were subject to excessive force by ICE officers, and Judge Menendez subsequently issued a temporary restraining order that enjoined federal agents from retaliating against peaceful protesters or unlawfully arresting or detaining people engaged in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay of that order, but the case is continuing.

This TRO would be much broader and would require federal agents to leave Minnesota. If issued, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals could also issue a temporary stay of the district court’s order.

It would be a remarkable remedy, but Minnesota argues that enforcement actions are currently prohibiting the state from enforcing its own laws and responding to emergencies. In addition, Minnesota argues DHS’s actions are violating the anti-commandeering principle of the Tenth Amendment by forcing a state to enact or enforce federal law.

Hussen v. Noem

There is also a class-action lawsuit in federal court in Minnesota challenging Operation Metro Surge as unconstitutional. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the plaintiffs allege that Metro Surge is racially discriminatory and seeks to halt DHS enforcement practices.

Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that DHS officers are:

Stopping, without reasonable suspicion, people of color, particularly Somali and Latino residents

Arresting lawful residents without warrants or probable cause that they are removable

Using excessive force, such as chokeholds, pepper spray, and aggressive vehicle tactics, against people who pose no threat

The lawsuit argues these actions violate the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. It seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to stop ICE and CBP from continuing these practices, as well as damages for some plaintiffs based on individual claims.

Hussen v. Noem was filed on January 15 and is still in the early stages.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons’ Potential Contempt Holding

In yet another separate federal legal proceeding, Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz is requiring acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to appear in court on Friday, January 30, to show cause why he should not issue a contempt order for failing to abide by court orders requiring the release of people unlawfully held in detention. “The court’s patience is at an end,” the George W. Bush appointee wrote in his show-cause order. Judge Schiltz had ordered the release of a man detained by DHS on January 15, but as of this writing, the man remains in detention.

Judge Schiltz has also criticized the Department of Justice for seeking an arrest warrant for former CNN anchor Don Lemon and several other protestors. Both a magistrate judge and Judge Schiltz declined to find probable cause, and an Eighth Circuit panel declined to intervene.

A Lot Going On

For now, there remains a lot of legal and political wrangling over Operation Metro Surge. However, every individual detained by ICE has the right to file a habeas petition and is entitled to due process. Numerous law firms, pro bono organizations, and attorneys are filing habeas petitions on behalf of detained individuals. You can find immigration and civil rights attorneys on FindLaw.

Tammy Baldwin says U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “needs to be fired or resign” following the fatal shootings of two Minnesota residents by federal immigration agents.
“To make matters worse, Kristi Noem and ICE are blocking the local police from even conducting a real independent investigation.” Just weeks before, federal immigration agents fatally shot another Minnesota resident, Renee Good, in her vehicle.
Similarly, Noem described Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.” Noem “needs to be fired or she should resign,” said Baldwin.
At this point, Baldwin said she’ll vote no unless “accountability and reform and training” requirements for immigration agents are included.
“There should not be masked, armed, untrained, ill-trained federal agents roaming American cities, residential neighborhoods, schools, and places of worship,” said Baldwin.","Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin says U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “needs to be fired or resign” following the fatal shootings of two Minnesota residents by federal immigration agents.

Baldwin issued her ultimatum at a press conference where she began by talking about Alex Pretti, a graduate of Green Bay’s Preble High School, calling him “a role model to many” whose death was “entirely preventable.”

“We watched as ICE agents shot Alex 10 times, even as Alex lay motionless on the ground,” said Baldwin. “He was not brandishing his weapon. He was holding his phone to document what was happening to him and to his community.”

The day of Pretti’s death, Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” without evidence. Pretti was carrying a concealed, holstered pistol during the confrontation with agents. He had a state permit to carry the concealed firearm. Other members of Trump’s administration have claimed he brandished the gun and was intent on killing officers, despite several videos of the killing showing otherwise.

Baldwin said with videos of Pretti’s death spread far and wide on social media, Noem was “asking everyone not to believe their own eyes.”

“And Wisconsinites are smarter than that,” Baldwin said. “To make matters worse, Kristi Noem and ICE are blocking the local police from even conducting a real independent investigation.”

Just weeks before, federal immigration agents fatally shot another Minnesota resident, Renee Good, in her vehicle. Federal officials claimed the agent that pulled the trigger feared Good was trying to run over him. Similarly, Noem described Good’s actions as “domestic terrorism.”

Noem “needs to be fired or she should resign,” said Baldwin. She said Noem “has got to go” and “if impeachment is the way to do it, I’d support it.”

Baldwin won’t support DHS funding bill unless ICE is reined in

The U.S. Senate is set to consider a slate of federal funding bills this week that include new money for the DHS. At this point, Baldwin said she’ll vote no unless “accountability and reform and training” requirements for immigration agents are included.

Baldwin didn’t offer specifics, but said her office has been inundated by calls from Wisconsinites asking why the agents are allowed to wear masks and why they don’t have to wear badges.

“There should not be masked, armed, untrained, ill-trained federal agents roaming American cities, residential neighborhoods, schools, and places of worship,” said Baldwin. “And you know what? The other thing that I want to emphasize is accountability. There needs to be independent investigations. You can’t sweep this under the rug and say that the very agency whose agent is accused of homicide is going to do the full investigation and bar local and state law enforcement and prosecutors from having access to the evidence.”

Without Democratic votes, another shutdown is possible

The prospect of another shutdown of the federal government looms large in the U.S. Senate with Democrats like Baldwin refusing to approve new funding for the Department of Homeland Security without new restrictions on immigration enforcement activities.

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives has passed 12 federal spending bills, six of which have been signed by Trump. Another six are before the Senate, and the package must be approved by Friday or funding for the DHS and other agencies will lapse, causing a partial government shutdown.

The debate in the Senate comes just more than two months after the end of a record-breaking 43-day government shutdown sparked by an impasse between Republican and Democratic senators over extending enhanced tax credits for keeping health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25056743810835-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 15:19:42.352602

Fellow Democratic candidates are criticizing Rep. Eric Swalwell and former Rep. Katie Porter for voting — in Swalwell’s case, as recently as June — to fund Immigration and Customs Enforcement and support its agents’ work.

Swalwell (D-Dublin) last year voted in favor of a Republican-sponsored resolution condemning an attack that injured at least eight people demonstrating in support of Israeli hostages, one of whom later died, in Boulder, Colo., and expressing “gratitude to law enforcement officers, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, for protecting the homeland.”

He was one of 75 Democrats, including nine from California, to cross the aisle and vote in favor of the resolution.

“The fact that Eric Swalwell stood with MAGA Republicans in Washington to thank ICE while in California masked ICE agents terrorized our communities — despite Swalwell’s notorious and chronic record of absenteeism from Congress, is shamefully hypocritical,” former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a rival Democrat running for governor, said in a statement.

Swalwell’s campaign dismissed the attack as a “political ploy” by “a desperate campaign” polling in single-digits.

“What Eric voted for was a resolution to condemn a horrific antisemitic attack in Boulder, CO that killed Karen Diamond, an 82-year old grandmother,” a campaign spokesman said in a statement. “The truth is no one has been more critical of ICE than Eric Swalwell.”

The exchange comes as Villaraigosa, Swalwell and other Democrats running to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is serving his final year in office, struggle to differentiate themselves in a tight race that lacks a clear front-runner.

In a poll released in December by the Public Policy Institute of California, Porter led the field with support from 21% of likely California voters. She was slightly ahead of former U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and conservative commentator Steve Hilton but had far from a commanding lead.

With the June 2 primary election fast approaching, the sparring among the candidates — especially in the crowded field of Democrats — is expected to intensify, with those leading in the polls fielding the brunt of the attacks.

The Trump administration’s immigration tactics face mounting political scrutiny after federal agents fatally shot Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse from Minneapolis, during a protest over the weekend.

Pretti was the second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis to be killed by immigration officers in recent weeks. Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother, was shot in the head by an ICE officer Jan. 7. Federal officials have alleged it was an act of self-defense when Good drove her vehicle toward an officer — an assertion under dispute.

In recent days, Swalwell said that if elected, he would revoke the driver licenses of ICE agents who mask their faces, block them from state employment and aggressively prosecute agents for crimes such as kidnapping, assault and murder.

Tony Thurmond, another Democrat currently serving as California’s top education official, in an online political ad criticized Swalwell’s vote as well as several by Porter for bills to fund ICE and Trump’s border wall during the president’s first term.

Porter and Swalwell joined majorities of Democratic House members to support various spending packages in Congress, which included billions for a border wall and in at least one case, avoided a government shutdown.

“When others have stayed quiet, Katie has boldly spoken out against ICE’s lawlessness and demanded accountability,” said Porter campaign spokesman Peter Opitz.

Thurmond’s video touted his own background as a child of immigrants and support for a new law that attempts to keep federal immigration agents out of schools, hospitals and other spaces.

Tom Steyer, a billionaire Democrat also running for governor, said Tuesday that he supports abolishing ICE “as it exists today” and replacing it with a “lawful, accountable immigration system rooted in due process and public safety.”

Republicans blame Democrats and protesters

The two most formidable Republicans running for governor have generally supported Trump’s immigration strategy but have not commented directly on Pretti’s killing over the weekend.

Hilton, a former Fox News host, wrote in an email that “every sane person is horrified by the scenes of chaos and lawlessness in Minneapolis, and most of all that people are getting killed.”

But he linked violence to sanctuary policies in Democratic-run states and cities, including California, which prohibit local law enforcement from coordinating or assisting with federal immigration enforcement.

“The only places we’ve seen this kind of chaos are ‘sanctuary’ cities and states, where Democrat politicians are whipping people up into a frenzy of anti-law enforcement hate, and directly putting their constituents in harm’s way by telling them — from behind the safety of their own security details — to disrupt the enforcement of federal law,” Hilton said.

The conservative pundit said the “worst offender” is Newsom, whom Hilton accused of using “disgustingly inflammatory language designed to rile up his base in pursuit of his presidential ambitions.”

You know, when we talk about human rights, we're not just talking about the position of some activist.
What have been the impacts of the administration's immigration policies on the El Paso border community that you shepherd?
I certainly hope that Catholics will be leaders in the response to these violations to basic human rights and dignity.
Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas (CNS/Robert Duncan) Can immigration be seen as a pro-life issue?","In this city that sits along the U.S. southern border with Mexico, immigrant families are being torn apart by the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, said El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz.

""People are suffering, and the effects of that suffering will have an impact on our country too, for many years to come,"" Seitz told the National Catholic Reporter during a Jan. 21 interview at his office in El Paso.

Seitz, 72, addressed the federal government's ongoing immigration crackdown, which in recent weeks has prompted widespread protests across the country, especially in Minneapolis, where federal immigration agents have shot and killed two people in the last three weeks.

""I'm horrified by what I see"" in Minneapolis, said Seitz, who was appointed bishop of El Paso in 2013 and has been an outspoken advocate for immigrants and a vocal proponent of the Catholic Church's teachings on migration.

During his interview, Seitz commented on the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies and their effects on the border community in El Paso. He described his local church's efforts to accompany migrants during difficult times, shared his thoughts on the recent immigration statement from the U.S. bishops' conference and offered a solution for overcoming ""a fear of the person we don't know.""

The interview has been edited for purposes of length and clarity.

NCR: Has it surprised you to see the ferocity and relentlessness of the federal government's crackdown on immigration over the past year?

Seitz: Oh, it totally surprised me. Shocked me. I didn't think that the government would even be allowed to go as far as it's gone with all of this. I really thought that the limits on governmental power would prevent this kind of response. And it's very, very concerning. Sometimes it's hard for me to recognize my country.

What has bothered you the most about this crackdown?

It's hard to pick one thing. But, in a general sense, it's the total disregard for fundamental human rights. You know, when we talk about human rights, we're not just talking about the position of some activist. We're talking about something that's very fundamental to the teaching of the church, to the belief of not only the Catholic Church, but Christianity in general, and to people of faith even well beyond Christianity, and that is that human beings have a particular dignity because they are created by God.

What do you think of the recent violence that we've seen in Minneapolis related to the deployment of federal immigration agents there?

I'm horrified by what I see there. You know, it could well be that the reaction of people to [the federal government's] violent entrance into the community has also been over the top in some respects. We, as a church, certainly believe that people have a right to protest. You know, they have a right to express their concerns. But we don't believe that they have a right to violently impede officers of the law. The church would not turn a blind eye to those overreactions on the part of people.

But at the same time, we have to say what we're witnessing there is not in accord with what our Constitution calls for, and certainly not in accord with what the fundamental teaching of Christ and his church would be.

What have been the impacts of the administration's immigration policies on the El Paso border community that you shepherd?

People are traumatized here. And it's not only people who are working to regularize their [immigration] status. Even people who have their passports are fearful when they're out in this community, because we've seen examples of people being violently pulled from their cars before they were even asked the question about whether they were here illegally. The simple fact that they could be stopped, because they may be an immigrant, ought to be a great concern to all of us. The Constitution and its Bill of Rights, and our courts, through the years, have clarified that law enforcement cannot stop a person simply because of the color of their skin or the language that they speak. And those court decisions have been reaffirmed over and over again. But that appears to be what's happening. And so people aren't afraid for no reason. They are terribly afraid, and as I say, traumatized is not too strong a word, and their children are as well. When they go to school in the morning, they are left wondering, ""Will Mom or Dad be there when I come home?""

What can the Catholic Church do to respond to the situation beyond issuing carefully prepared public statements?

Well here in El Paso, we're trying to do quite a bit. We have teams going out to neighborhoods and parishes to ask people how they're doing, especially trying to identify those families who lost breadwinners and to see if we can help them. That's kind of in its initial stages, but it's happening in a couple of parishes, at least.

We are visiting the detention centers. I'm celebrating Mass in Camp East Montana, which is the largest detention facility in the country. It has over 3,000 people now and it's growing. We celebrate Mass there every Sunday and I'm going most weekends when my schedule allows. And we're also sending out a team of priests to hear confessions there during the week.

We've also been trying to inform people in our parishes about their rights and what they should do if immigration authorities come to their door or stop them on the street, what they need to cooperate with, and what they don't need to say. All of those rights apply to people who are immigrants here. You know, it goes against the grain for a Latino to say, ""We shouldn't answer the door unless there is a legal document like a search warrant."" But they have to know that that's their right.

What can the church do to best advocate for and accompany migrants?

I certainly hope that Catholics will be leaders in the response to these violations to basic human rights and dignity. In order to do that, we in the church, obviously, have to do a better job of teaching our people about what the church has to say about this. It's so clearly laid out in Scripture, and in the long history of the teaching of the church, and certainly by all of our recent popes, going back to certainly Leo XIII, not to mention Leo XIV.

We hope that by being reminded of these fundamental teachings, that Catholics will be active in calling our nation to a return to that respect for human life and dignity that's laid out in the first document that created this country, the Declaration of Independence. So let's live it. Let's practice it now. The church will never tire of reminding the government of that, and we would hope that the citizens of this country would also do the same.

This past November, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops released a special message on immigration. What did you think of the statement?

I was thrilled with it. We were limited in the length of it. It couldn't say everything. But we worked so hard on it, to find something that all the bishops could come together on. You know, everybody has their own way of saying things or they may differ in their willingness to say things that would be considered confrontational. All of us have a different take on how outspoken perhaps we should be on these issues, but I have not met a single bishop in the conference who would say that this is not a serious concern, of what's happening in this country right now.

How did you come to be so outspoken on issues pertaining to immigration?

Well, first of all, I guess we can say I'm a passionate person. God has called me to be a pastor. And that implies that I care about people deeply. I care about their lives and their experiences, their well-being, especially on a spiritual level. You know, we are not a people who have one life of faith, and then another life in the world. The Incarnation means clearly that these two realities are joined. I care about people, and what they're experiencing, just like, I believe, my master did. When Jesus finished preaching and saw people who were hungry, he fed them. And he told the disciples to feed them. So, yeah, thank God he gave me this passion. And all of my life and ministry, I've tried to live that.

If you had known me when I was in Dallas, you would have known that I was very active in the pro-life movement, and I continue to be, although it's kind of overshadowed in what people see right now in the area of immigration. I'm going to speak at a pro-life conference in L.A. this weekend [Jan. 24], and I'm going to talk about immigration, because the church has this beautiful, totally consistent teaching about the dignity of the human person from conception to natural death.

Bishop Mark J. Seitz of El Paso, Texas (CNS/Robert Duncan)

Can immigration be seen as a pro-life issue?

Sure. Every issue has its own unique aspects. I think abortion still has a particularly serious character to it, because it is the violent killing of a totally innocent human life. Somehow, we don't seem to grasp that.

Immigration, in a certain sense, should impact us in another way that is extremely serious. We need to come to grips with the fact that a child who is an immigrant, or an adult, or an elderly person who is an immigrant, is facing, at the very least, indirect threats to their very life. And the way that we're aggressively assaulting them in the process of arrest very often, in the way that we're treating them when they are in detention, and certainly, in the places that we're sending them back to, warrant some serious reflection.

In the majority of cases, they fled their country because they could not live there. In many cases, their lives had been threatened, or they couldn't support their family. They were starving. So now we're sending them back into circumstances even worse than when they left, because in order to escape that situation, they sold everything. And sometimes, when we're sending them back, they're being seen as traitors to their country and threatened to be thrown into prisons that are known to torture people. I know that for a fact.

Do you see anyone in our government today, expressing even the slightest concern for the well-being of those that we are treating that way? Not the least. It's incomprehensible.

Despite the church's teachings and recent statements from popes and bishops, various polls indicate that Catholics in the United States are deeply divided on immigration policy. Why do you think that is and is there a way out of the toxic polarization that we see on this issue?

Immigration does raise deep emotions. We have built into ourselves, probably from ages immemorial, a fear of the person we don't know. And sadly, I believe, politicians have, without conscience, tapped into that primordial fear. And they have been willing to characterize a whole broad group of people as violent criminals, rapists, and so on, when, in fact, that is a huge mischaracterization, to put it nicely.

Yes, people have come here who have not behaved well. But if you take the group as a whole, immigrants in general, and put them alongside people born in this country, study after study has shown that immigrant communities commit fewer crimes than nonimmigrant communities. So to characterize the whole group in that way, is absolutely a house built on cards, it's absolutely false.

That fear that we have, which is so strong, can be overcome rather easily because it's so false. And the way to do it, I believe, is to provide opportunities simply for people to meet the people they fear, to know them, to know their story. It doesn't take any rocket science. It doesn't take all kinds of complicated statistics. Just meet an immigrant in your community.

Their letter follows the death of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, at the hands of federal law enforcement personnel sent to Minnesota as part of a deportation crackdown.

Transcript

Part I

MEGHNA CHAKRABARTI: Cengiz Yar is a photographer and visual editor for ProPublica. He's covered conflicts around the world, including in Iraq and Syria. For the past week, he's been in Minneapolis. He arrived just after us. Citizen Renee Goode was shot and killed by ICE agents on January 7th.

This past Saturday morning, a second American, Alex Pretti was gunned down in Minneapolis by federal agents. Cengiz began his morning at breakfast with his family. And a note, the first 30 seconds of the story you're about to hear from Cengiz includes sound of the gunfire that killed Pretti.

CENGIZ YAR: At breakfast, we started seeing the videos of the shooting coming across social media and different chat groups.

And so finished breakfast, and as we were leaving breakfast, my brother had a seizure and I had to take him to the emergency room. I was sitting in the waiting room and on the TV screen, they were playing this video on repeat.

(VIDEO PLAYS)

There were two women sitting next to me and just like overhearing them talk about having to prepare a go bag. It was a really just like jarring moment sitting in an American hospital waiting room, talking about prepping a go bag to get out of here, prepping for the eventualities of what's going to play out here.

Once I got my brother checked in, I jumped in the cab and got to the scene of the shooting. There was gas floating in the air and agents had surrounded the intersection. And they were surrounded by protestors and there were probably 200 or maybe 300 protestors.

There were chants, but there was also just visceral screaming. People furious about what had just happened to their community member and in their neighborhood. And then was trying to get a better vantage point again and backed away.

And as almost as soon as I backed away to move myself agents started dropping tear gas canisters.

And what I think were flash bang grenades. I've covered a lot of protests in the U.S. and often what I see at protests is mainly younger adults, and that is not the case in Minneapolis. The people I've been seeing on the street range from teenagers to 80-year-olds.

A photo I took yesterday was like two people carrying away like an elderly woman who was on the front lines and got gassed.

By the time the gas cleared, my heart rate settled down a little bit, and I walked back to the site of the shooting, talked to a couple people, and went back to my hotel to talk to my editors and file a couple photos and wash the chemicals off me before going back out. And then I went back out that evening.

I feel like there's a lot of similarities to what I've seen in the past in foreign wars with a force that feels like an occupation force, where an unwanted armed unit has come in and is being aggressively confronted by the local population who doesn't want them there. I haven't seen that in the U.S. before, where heavily armored guys are driving around in big trucks.

And getting yelled at by soccer moms and elderly couples and teenagers everywhere they go.

It was like 20 or -20 or -15 last night. It was super, super cold and still there were probably a hundred people out last night surrounding the visual site. Community members had set up tables with food and hot packs for hands, and a local church had opened their doors for people to use the bathroom and was getting coffee out.

And it was, everyone I talked to was expressing both sadness for the events of that day, but also pride in their community for how they'd been reacting. And then also a lot of contempt for federal forces in their community. And a feeling that they're being occupied by the federal government at the moment.

CHAKRABARTI: Cengiz Yar is a photographer and visuals editor for the Pulitzer-Prize winning newsroom, ProPublica. He's in Minneapolis now. Now these recent killings are again raising the questions, and now this time louder than ever, about who these federal agents are and how they are being trained. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump removed several qualifications for potential ICE agents.

He upped signing bonuses. And pushed forward aggressive recruitment campaigns in an attempt to get more boots on the ground as part of his nationwide deportation operation. So today we're going to dig into those details. And joining us now is Nick Miroff. He's a staff writer at The Atlantic. He's been following ICE and Border Patrol for quite some time, and of course, in detail over the course of the events that have been happening in Minneapolis, he joins us from Washington.

Nick, welcome to On Point.

NICK MIROFF: Good to be with you.

CHAKRABARTI: So first of all, I'd actually like to start with a broader view of what we know regarding who the agents are, who are in Minneapolis. Do we know how many of them are relatively recent recruits? How many of them are veterans? How would you describe the men and women of ICE and Border patrol that are in the streets of Minneapolis right now?

MIROFF: Sure. A couple quick points. Alex Pretti was actually killed by a border patrol agent. Those were border patrol agents who were responding in that particular scene. And there have been, in total, somewhere around 3,000 federal agents in Minneapolis, should be noted that is something like five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department. So that is one reason that so many people report the feel of a kind of an occupied city.

And most of those are ICE officers. But a lot of them have been border patrol agents under the command of Greg Bovino who, you know, Secretary Kristi Noem was using as this kind of commander at large figure.

And as we reported in The Atlantic last night Mr. Bovino has been relieved of his command and is being returned to his old job in El Centro. California. So he is no longer going to be this commander at large figure. And the administration, the White House and the President are sending in Tom Homan, Trump's White House Border czar, who has been at odds with Secretary Noem for months.

And has been, until now, pretty much marginalized by this operation. And he and his team are going into to Minneapolis to try to turn down the temperature and to reassert, and this is important to reassert, ICE's role as the main agency responsible for the interior enforcement.

And that, and we can get into some of the other significance of that. But that's the big news over overnight.

CHAKRABARTI: To be clear, Bovino still has a job though, right? He hasn't been, he has been relieved of duty in Minneapolis, but he's still working for Homeland Security.

MIROFF: Correct. He's still the Chief Border Patrol agent in the El Centro sector of California. Yes. Which is in the Imperial Valley. That is the old job he had before Secretary Noem and Stephen Miller elevated him to this kind of roving position in which he's been so prominent in social media.

Okay. So we will talk about recruitment and training through the remainder of this program. But since you said that Homan's new sort of goal is to turn down the temperature in Minneapolis, it's not just the killings. Those are the most terrible things that have happened in the past couple of weeks.

But media and social media and firsthand accounts from folks in Minneapolis have described all sorts of very extreme tactics being used by these federal agents. Just today I saw a firsthand video of agents in trucks driving by protestors who are just standing on the sidewalk and they're doing drive-by pepper spraying of those protestors.

So what exactly can you see or believe that homeland security means by turning down the temperature? It would, I'm sorry, I'm going on here, Nick, but it just seems turning down the temperature would truthfully mean ending a lot of the tactics we're seeing on a daily basis in Minneapolis.

MIROFF: I think what we have to watch for over the coming days as Homan and his people get on the ground, obviously he's going there to meet with governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and other Democratic officials who, it should be noted, don't have a lot of political, incentive right now to cut some kind of deal with Tom Homan.

However, the other key thing is going to be, is there a change in tactics? Withdrawing the border patrol from Minneapolis is a big step. Homan has been speaking for months about wanting, believing in the kind of traditional way that ICE has enforced immigration law, which is much less dramatic and is more, what he calls targeted enforcement, where officers do research in advance of who they want to go for and they plan how to take them into custody with minimal confrontation.

That is the way that ICE traditionally operates. And so are they going to go back to those types of tactics? Are they going to, or are they going to just keep doing the same things but without the border patrol? And that is what we need to be looking for over the coming days.

Part II

CHAKRABARTI: In a minute or two, we're going to hear from a former Chief of Staff for ICE. But first, here's DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on October 20th talking to the press about the fact that the Department of Homeland Security has received over 175,000 applications as part of the Trump administration ramping up of their recruiting efforts.

KRISTI NOEM: We had over 175,000 applicants for our 10,000 new ICE agents. We have many of them that are already out on the job. They've completed their training. We also have huge recruitment for not just ICE agents and HSI, but our Secret Service law enforcement officers, our CBP officers, all of those recruitment efforts are through the roof because I think of the individuals that are excited about defending the homeland, protecting this country, and making sure that they have the ability to go out and to do a job that they can be proud of.

CHAKRABARTI: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on October 20th. Okay, so what is that recruitment like? What are one of the recruiting events like? Here's a little taste.

(FOOTAGE)

Hello.

How are you?

Doing well, how are you?

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so that is some sound that was recorded by Laura Jedeed. She went to an ICE hiring event at an arena in Arlington, Texas this past August.

JEDEED: I do a lot of reporting on the American far right and when I learned that ICE was doing a hiring expo in Arlington, Texas, and promising same day hires where you could go in, present your resume and potentially walk out with an offer.

I knew I had to go and see what that was like.

CHAKRABARTI: So she went. The interviewer and speakers promised expedited processing for applicants at the event if they had law enforcement experience. They also touted opportunities around the country.

JEDEED: There was no wait to get in. There was like a six person wait for the interview.

That interview took about six minutes. I timed it and this very normal woman took me and sat across from me at this black folding table and asked some very basic questions like my name, date of birth, whether I separated from the Army or retired, where I would like to be stationed. Really basic stuff that you could fill out on any form.

And I thought that was the pre-interview to be honest. And then when it was over, she's okay, we've got you. We'll stay tight. We'll email you with a tentative offer once we process your application. We are processing prior law enforcement experience first. So it may not be today, but just keep an eye out for the next couple days.

We'll get back to you.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so a couple important things there. One is you heard Laura talk about how the interviewer asked her if she had, quote, separated from the Army. That is because she is indeed a veteran of the United States military. She also happens to have had military intelligence experience, but the interviewer didn't ask her about that.

She also didn't ask about Jedeed's online presence, which has been very critical of the Trump administration.

JEDEED: It seemed like the question was law enforcement experience or no law enforcement experience. There was a complete lack of curiosity, very much including the seven-year gap on my resume.

CHAKRABARTI: But while the interviewer didn't seem interested in any of Jedeed's potentially applicable skills like her military intelligence experience, or whether she had firearms experience, an officer at the expo Q&A session did say this.

[EXPO TAPE]

CHAKRABARTI: So you're hearing there an officer at this ICE recruitment expo, basically telling applicants that they're going to be issued pepper ball guns, and if protesters are around and not explicitly, he says, quote, bleeping around, if they're bleeping around, to shoot them with the pepper ball guns, or a friend that comes up to assist the protestors.

Back to Jedeed, she actually did get an offer from ICE, a, quote, pending offer. She even got a start date and an assigned duty location.

JEDEED: It's very funny that they almost hired a journalist who doesn't care for them and has been very critical, that's funny. What's not funny though is that this means they're not vetting people, and I think we're seeing the results of that.

CHAKRABARTI: So that's journalist Laura Jedeed. She wrote about this experience going behind the scenes in the agency's hiring practices for Slate. And by the way, very soon after her story was published by Slate, the Department of Homeland Security denied that they had offered her a job. DHS Tweeted, quote, this is such a lazy lie.

This individual was never offered a job at ICE. End quote. But Jedeed responded to DHS with a screenshot from the Homeland Securities own dashboard with documentation welcoming her to ICE. There are check marks that you can see from application status to final offer, green check marks, and in the screenshot, you see her onboarding date was set to September 30th, 2025.

Duty location, New York City. Okay. I'd like to introduce Jason Houser into the conversation now. He's a former Chief of Staff for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. He served in that position from 2021 to 2023 in the Biden administration. Jason Houser, welcome to On Point.

JASON HOUSER: Thanks for having me.

I appreciate it.

CHAKRABARTI: Can you first talk about what recruitment efforts were like during your tenure at ICE?

HOUSER: Yeah, I would say that it was a different environment in that time period where Congress had not appropriated a great deal of funds to expand ICE's staff at that time.

We also, it is a unique space to work, where ICE, in the staff, the personnel numbers that we had at that time, were built for having two to 3 million people on the immigration docket. And most people realize now that there's about 14 million individuals on the immigration document.

And ICE staff does everything from just case management to, of course, enforcement and case oversight and detention management. So hiring was strained at those times, but in those processes, there's always both the DHS policies and procedures for hiring, but also ICE's internal vetting and screening.

That includes everything from comprehensive background checks, drug screening, looking at extremist activity and their past and their social media. It also has to do with their ability to physically carry out the duties. That sort of processing and management is consistent with just government standards.

And that's typical whether in the Defense Department or Department of Homeland Security. It takes a good amount of time and resources for HR human resource processing to move people through that vetting. What I've seen here recently is a collapsing of that and I think we're beginning to see the outcomes of that and some of the personnel that's being brought on board.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay. So by the way, just to be clear, the 14 million number that you referenced is because the Trump administration is doing these mass deportations. Or aiming to do these mass deportations.

HOUSER: Yeah, I would say that the immigration system, we all, I think we all admit, is broken in this country and we've not properly resourced any part of it, whether it's immigration judges or case managers or asylum processing officers, et cetera.

And ICE has had the same issues over time of not having the staff to handle the amount of work that's coming their way.

CHAKRABARTI: Nick, I promise I'll come back to you here in a second. But Jason, tell me more about, you said the, quote, changes that we have been seeing recently.

How do you react to what you're seeing going down in Minnesota?

HOUSER: Well, just what I see in Minnesota is the outcomes of leadership, of direction, of policy, of commander's intent to carry out quota focused arrests. What we're seeing playing out now in our communities, and there's been a turn away and most people are following that, 20 to 25% of federal law enforcement as a whole have been turned off counterterrorism, human smuggling, sex trafficking, drug smuggling.

That mission set. Which is quite frankly, has always historically been about two thirds of the focus of just ICE. And we're pulling the federal law enforcement away from those mission sets and now having them support these on the street civil immigration enforcement operations that are putting both the communities at risk, but also putting the officers at risk.

And I say, the one thing that I see just focused on the training and hiring. Is this sort of front loaded, this fast paced, rapid move, these hires to the front lines as quickly as possible. I'm worried about that in a lot of ways. One, that means that the vetting and screening for these officers is not occurring.

Additionally, this idea that we can just say, Oh, their training has equipped them for this. In two decades of ICE and CBP existing, they've never existed or carried out this specific mission set. So the idea that you can collapse the number of days of training and then even say we're going to complete training on the job, or when you're expanding the risk and sort of putting officers in these intense situations in these communities, training should actually be expanding, not collapsing.

Training should actually be expanding, not collapsing.

Jason Houser

Outside of just pushing people through, collapsing the background checks and the vetting, but also collapsing their training pipeline and preparing them for the environments in which they're going to work. Whether you agree with it or not, or what this administration is doing, it's putting the officers at risk, it's putting the communities at risk, and that should all be reassessed as we reset here.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, Nick Miroff from The Atlantic. This is where your reporting is critical. Tell us in more detail this collapsing of training that's been happening for new ICE recruits.

MIROFF: Sure. I was at the same job expo in Texas that you described earlier, and that was amid this all-out push by the administration to hire 10,000 deportation officers by the end of last year, basically by this month.

And the funding came from the Big Beautiful Bill and they ended up getting, they claim 220,000 applications. What we were able to determine was that a lot of people were applying for three or four different jobs, but this is, just this unprecedented hiring binge to get as many people in there as possible.

And as Laura Jedeed laid out, they were prioritizing people with previous law enforcement experience or military service, but by the beginning of this month, they were claiming victory and they said that they had hired 120, sorry, 12,000 new people as deportation officers and HSI investigators and legal staff.

And what we have reported is that number is misleading. That the number who are actually ready to deploy, who are considered operational is much lower. They've had very high dropout rates at the academy, and you asked about the condensed training. They've taken the training course for new deportation officers with no prior experience.

From about four to five months down to just 42 days now. And so it's basically a seven-week training course, six days per week. And I was asking about what kind of deescalation training the new officers are getting, and what I heard from my sources is that there are deescalation tactics woven into much of the coursework, but the amount of time they're dedicating to deescalation tactics is only about four hours.

So to think about sending new recruits out into scenarios like the ones we're seeing in Minneapolis is a recipe for disaster. And just one more point you asked earlier, are these new recruits that we're seeing out on the streets of Minneapolis? And I would say by and large, no.

And the key thing here is, the officer, the ICE officer that killed Renee Goode was had 10 years of experience with ICE and previous experience with the border patrol. So he was very experienced and the border patrol agent that killed Alex Pretti was, had been on the force for eight years.

So it's not, these are not new recruits that have been involved in these terrible tragedies.

CHAKRABARTI: Okay, so both of you have said a lot here, and I just want to go through them a little bit more forensically. Jason, let me just pick up with what Nick just said. Okay. In the two cases where U.S. citizens were shot and killed by agents, now we're talking about agents with years of experience.

Do you have, what's a plausible explanation for that?

HOUSER: Let's just say for instance that an officer was hired eight to 10 years ago when they came through the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center and became an agent. What were they being trained for?

And if they were a border patrol agent, they most likely were spending their 12 to 16 weeks in that training pipeline, focused on surveillance working tactics and authorities working along the border. Outwardly looking at national security threats that want to pin, that want to come across and use our border in criminal ways.

Drug smuggling. They weren't focused on civil immigration enforcement in the streets of Minneapolis, in these sort of highly intense, pressurized environments. So you could make a rational argument that an officer that comes from eight to 10 years ago before they were now put into these type of operations, are even at a larger risk. Just because they say someone has been working along the San Diego sector or Tucson sector down along the border, that has been working to deal with asylum seekers that have come across the border.

That's a different job than now someone that's dealing with riot control and carrying out operations where, you know, for instance, in the situation of Minneapolis, saying that they're going after hardened criminals in the streets.

You can see this has become about the visualization in these operations, right? Like we're not seeing, normally as Nick perfectly said earlier, I believe, when ICE goes after a convicted criminal in a community, convicted criminals don't want to be caught.

We do it with surveillance and pre-operational planning. You do it targeted to where the time, the sort of force that's brought to that arrest is proportional to the need, but it's also that it's proportional to protect the community. What we're seeing in Minneapolis is dozens of officers coming down the streets in armored vehicles, more for the show.

And I think that's where the politics of this and the training and the reality have all come together in Minneapolis and it's putting everyone at risk.

CHAKRABARTI: So more for the show though is the opposite of deescalation, right? It is actually provocation. Of the innocent citizens standing on the street exercising their first amendment rights to gather and protest in ostensibly what is a free country.

That makes me want to ask both of you more about, Jason, what you said regarding commanders intent. But we have a break that we have to take in just a second here, so we'll pick that up on the other side of the break.

Part III

CHAKRABARTI: Jason, let me just stick with something you said about Commander's Intent that we may be seeing in places like Minneapolis. And as both of you said, the fact that in these two deadly shootings, it wasn't a new recruit that pulled the trigger.

It was a veteran. Which makes me wonder, and Jason, I'm going to turn this to you. Whether there's something historically within ICE that leads to situations like this. For example, Lila Hassan, who's an investigative reporter for Al Jazeera, she was able to obtain documents over the course of many years regarding ICE training.

And she found, for example, there are many examples in this story, but she found, for example, that part of the train training in a quiz that recruits were given about when should deadly force be applied or how long should an officer wait until using deadly force?

And the answer in the quiz was none. Deadly force can be initiated immediately. There's also another document that she obtained that said, that directed new ICE agents to not use minimal forms of force first, because they claim the use of minimal forms of force could actually put the agent in danger.

So to jump to more significant, more serious forms of force, possibly even deadly force. And these documents are from years ago. So the problem is not new necessarily, Jason.

HOUSER: No, and this is in 2021, as leading ICE and supporting the acting director at that time, we rewrote the ICE Use of Force Handbook.

The actual handbook in which is used to train to in this guidance for the field, and then that was supported by Secretary Mayorkas in 2023, signing a use of force policy for the entire department. I would say we saw those systemic issues with that training. But this goes back to something that I just want to, there is a lot of military examples and comparisons that can be used in this.

And remember, the strategic decision making in the direction from leadership is what's driving this. We're in a place where quota arrests, we're targeting 3,000 a day. We're in a situation where rules of prioritizing those that have convicted criminality or just and taking away, taking into law enforcement's discretion, decide that individuals that have been here for decades are thriving in our communities or don't even have a viable way of being removed, are being targeted to hit this, those sort of directions and commands.

Have quite frankly decimated ICE's leadership over the last year. Dozens of senior leaders and seasoned officers that were running ICE have been removed. Transport demoted. And then when you have these situations where this idea that you can just walk down the streets of Minneapolis or Chicago and find convicted criminal migrants, it's not real.

It's fake. And what we have is a situation where ICE officers, deportation officers specifically, 80% of their work historically has been placing detainers or transferring individuals from other law enforcement agencies across the country into ICE custody. It's not traditionally in these at large, on the street operations, and we're beginning to see that as the stress point, with all those things combining together, that's creating these environment to where we have to get back to reasonable immigration enforcement that meets the needs of our communities.

And I think when it comes to the use of force, it needs to be proportional to the threat to protect the community and the law enforcement officer. But there's no reason why. And that's the thing about what's happening around the streets of Minneapolis.

Why are we there? What is the public safety outcome? What is the intent of leadership? That's where it's being blended with the politics. The idea, even if I was to put on, and think and direct like Stephen Miller has, that there should be 3,000 arrests a day. Why? And exponentially increasing the number of removals. Why would I be on the streets of Minneapolis? Where should resources be placed?

CHAKRABARTI: As you say, this is not, flooding the streets of Minneapolis is not how you execute a lawful and effective immigration arrest. So the intent is and they know it.

The intent is what we have seen on the streets of Minneapolis, is to terrorize regular citizens. And to somehow, it's not just use of force. It's a show of force. And Nick, let me ask you something though, because Jason said something else interesting. There's a lot of military aspect to this.

Okay. In terms of the behaviors, maybe. But I would argue that members of the military, first of all, the streets of Minneapolis are not a place for the United States military, period. Second of all, even members of the military have more training than it seems many of these new recruits do. So you said that went down from four to five months, which would be a maximum of 150 days, down to 45 or 47 days.

A third of the amount.

MIROFF: 42.

CHAKRABARTI: 42.

MIROFF: So it's even lower. Yeah, getting back to Jason's excellent point. This is about politics and this is the use of a federal law enforcement as an instrument of politics. And so the spectacle that is being produced here is crucial.

The optics that they are going for in terms of this kind of deployment are what Stephen Miller and others who are with him in this view as both important to the president's base and way to keep the fires of the president's movement hot. And we're seeing now the possible limits of that.

This is the use of a federal law enforcement as an instrument of politics. And so the spectacle that is being produced here is crucial.

It's too early to tell if Alex Pretti's death is going to be a turning point, but it does appear that the president is getting cold feet about how far to take this. And your point about the military is interesting. One thing that I have perceived, and I don't know if Jason would agree, is like, whenever the National Guard has been called, I was in Los Angeles, where they were brought out, the National Guard troops tend to be much more cool headed.

Much less inclined to use force. And the protestors too generally don't view the guard troops as the agents of aggression or oppression here. And so ironically, they have often had a calming presence at some of the places I've been.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah. So let me just make an observation here. That we are at a point right now in this country where we are saying out loud that perhaps not even the death of two American citizens at the hands of federal agents is enough to give the president of the United States pause about his national goal of this migrant eradication from this country. And again, I come back to what Jason said about commander's intent all the way up to the president of the United States.

Because this links to, again, thinking about new recruits, like who these new recruits are, and as Laura Jedeed told us earlier, yeah, she had that military experience, which maybe bumped her up higher to near the top of the list for potential new ICE agents. But she doesn't get a sense that they Googled her at all.

To find any other information about her. Now, this doesn't seem to me to be normal or let alone effective protocol when you're trying to hire people for a very serious and challenging position like becoming a federal agent. And I'll add this, I think we know what kind of person that the Department of Homeland Security believes is the right kind of person to carry out the intent of the President of the United States.

Because multiple social media accounts that DHS has have used a particular song in their recruiting efforts. It's called We'll Have Our Home Again, and just take a quick listen to this.

(SONG PLAYS)

CHAKRABARTI: That was, we actually got that one from an online recruitment campaign that went back as far as last August. We'll Have Our Home Again, it's a song associated with white nationalism. The Proud Boys have even put out a recording of it. Jason, it seems that presidential intent or leadership intent here when linked to this kind of recruiting effort tells you who they want on the streets as new ICE agents.

HOUSER: I would say a few things. I came into working at ICE and after the January 6th riots, and it was a bipartisan view on the hill and direction in the administration, we revetted all employees for left or right-leaning extremist views, and this idea that you're recruiting this rapidly, this quickly, without the proper assurance that these folks or individual are equipped or have this, not just the demeanor, the sort of the background and the capability to carry out these really, these extremely important tasks, with great, full Title 8 immigration enforcement is broad and it's extremely powerful.

And to put it into the hands of individuals that may not have the temperament and viewpoints to carry those out in the humane, just way, that all Americans expect, is very dangerous. And I would say just to make this where it hits home, let's say this was another part of the government.

Full Title 8 immigration enforcement is broad and it's extremely powerful. And to put it into the hands of individuals that may not have the temperament and viewpoints to carry those out in the humane, just way, that all Americans expect, is very dangerous.

Jason Houser

What if we weren't vetting the doctors that are working at the VA? What if we weren't vetting our military personnel and screening them. And that is not just to protect the public, that's protect other law enforcement agents. You're putting everyone in harm's way in that regard, and it needs to, it doesn't need to be rushed.

This idea that we're going to rush 10,000 new immigration deportation officers out into the streets to do arrests, when the rest of the immigration system itself has not been built to that capacity. And additionally, many of the individuals that are being targeted now are here legally. They came through vetting and screening programs along the border and have entered pathways and now being targeted by unskilled staff.

And I must admit to the point that I said earlier. We're putting ICE officers and border patrol agents in new environments; their old jobs and responsibilities are not going to change. So training should be expanding, not collapsing.

CHAKRABARTI: Let me turn back to you, Nick, here, because then there's also the fact, again, I'm looking straight at your reporting that even though standards have been eased in the academy where potential ICE officers get trained in order so they can get more recruits. You had said earlier that even then, a huge number of these recruits aren't passing the training requirements. And why is that?

MIROFF: Most of them who are dropping out are failing the physical fitness tests.

They require them to do pretty basic things. The main, I'm told that the biggest challenge for the new recruits has been running I believe it's a mile and a half. And some classes have seen attrition rates as they call them of about 50%. And that kind of failure rate has been widely mocked, but it's not like a joke to the veteran ICE officers who are going to have to work alongside these new recruits and who have been telling me for months that they're not comfortable. They don't want to be sent out on the streets with people that they don't think are qualified, who wouldn't have passed muster, in previous years.

And this is one more factor that is contributing to this low morale.

CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, one ICE official also told you that in addition to being unable to pass the fitness tests that some of the recruits drop out of the academy because they flunk exams on immigration law, or exams on knowing the Fourth Amendment's limits on an office's search authority.

So it sounds like even basic understanding of what the Constitution allows and doesn't allow is questionable.

MIROFF: And my understanding is that a lot of those exams are open book, so they have an open book, and they have to be able to accurately state what the law is.

They have books right there and they're not able to pass. Jason would probably know better about that, but it sounds pretty bad.

CHAKRABARTI: Are they open book, Jason?

HOUSER: Some of them are open book and some of them are multiple choice and other things. I think the one thing about all of this is the idea that over the last few months that dozens of senior leaders, those are all, have been fired from ICE, that have carried out this mission for decades. These are the folks that provide this training and oversight and accountability, and the loss of that is extreme.

And I must also say that these are the same officers that 48 months ago, that we were asking in the Biden administration for when I was detailing thousands of officers to the border, to humanely remove migrants that were in be Del Rio, Texas, for instance. And the directions there were, and we will have no loss of life. We will properly vet and screen individuals that are coming here and we'll make sure that they get through the proper process.

Those were the same officers. Now we have this juxtaposition of what they're being asked to do and bringing on these staff that are less seasoned and trained. It worries me for the future, that as we continue to have an immigration system that's just broken systemically, these officers are going to be called upon in five years, 10 years, 15 years to do other types of mission.

And what kind of workforce are we building? And it can't be myopically focused on the fact that we want to carry out punitive arrests on the streets in blue states. That cannot be what it's about. It has to be about the needs of our communities.

CHAKRABARTI: That long-term implication is something that I hadn't heard discussed before. So I'm grateful that you brought it up here. I have less than a minute. And Nick, if you forgive me, I want to ask Jason the final question. And you were the chief of staff for ICE for a couple of years, so if you were in that job today and you were deployed and you went to Minneapolis. What specific orders would you give to change that Commander's Intent? What specific changes would you make to reduce the temperature, to stop U.S. citizens from getting sprayed at point blank range with pepper spray or shot in the back?

HOUSER: The first thing that you would do is you would prioritize enforcement. You would give clear guidance that we were going to be targeting those that have final orders of removal, and we would be targeting those that have convicted criminality that we believe could be out hurting our communities. And you would proportionally place staff in Minneapolis.

That's proportional to the amount of migrants that we need to oversee and do case management, but also for those, the amount of staff that we need and the resources. My thing with Minneapolis is there's about 130,000 migrants in that country when actually in Florida and Texas there's 1.2 and 1.7 million.

Judge Robert Conrad, the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, shared that assessment in an internal memo, opens new tab on Monday afternoon as Senate Democrats vowed to oppose a funding bill for DHS after immigration officers on Saturday fatally shot a U.S. citizen, Alex Pretti, in Minnesota.

The legislation funding the department, which oversees U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is part of a six-bill spending package covering various areas of the federal government, including defense, health, transportation, education, and housing for the fiscal year ending September 30.

Those bills had already cleared the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives and include a measure that would provide the judiciary $9.2 billion, up 6.4% from a year earlier. The Homeland Security bill also provides an extra $30 million for Supreme Court security.

The funding package had appeared to be on track for passage in the Senate, which had already approved bills to fund other parts of the government, until Saturday, when immigration officers shot and killed Pretti.

His death prompted Democrats in the Republican-led Senate to vow not to support further DHS funding without reforms to safeguard Americans, raising the chances of parts of the government shuttering just months after the previous record shutdown ended in November.

""The combined bill no longer appears to have sufficient votes to pass the Senate, and a lapse of some duration is a distinct possibility while a strategy to address DHS funding is developed,"" Conrad wrote in Monday's memo to judges nationwide.

If approved funding lapses, the judiciary would not immediately shut down and employees should report to work as normal on February 2, Conrad wrote. But he said it can only rely on fees and other balances to sustain paid operations through February 4.

That would be a very short period compared to the most recent shutdown, when the judiciary was able to sustain paid operations for over two weeks after the lapse in appropriations began on October 1 before curtailing operations and furloughing employees.

Chen, www.nytimes.com, david-w-chen",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/28/us/politics/minneapolis-ice-states.html,"After the deaths of two American citizens in Minneapolis at the hands of federal agents, Democratic legislators across the country, aided by libertarian groups, are redoubling their efforts to restrict and challenge federal immigration tactics in their states.

A Colorado bill that was introduced in mid-January would enable individuals to sue federal law enforcement officials for civil rights violations.

In Delaware, a bill similar to one that was filed in New York last spring would prevent commercial airlines from receiving jet fuel tax exemptions if they transport people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement without warrants and due process.

Ever since the second Trump administration embarked on its large-scale deportation effort, Democratic-leaning states have proposed — and passed, in some instances — countermeasures, such as banning masked or unidentified law enforcement officers. Last month, a dozen legislators from seven states announced that they would coordinate legislation in 2026 to complement the litigation already being used by Democratic attorneys general to challenge immigration policies.

But after the killings of both Mr. Pretti and Renee Good, a resident protesting ICE’s presence in the Twin Cities, those endeavors have gained more urgency, according to lawmakers and immigration rights groups.

“I do think that we are starting to see legislators who, last session, were afraid of being a thorn in the side of an ascendant Trump administration — they were so afraid of poking the bear,” said Naureen Shah, who leads the American Civil Liberties Union’s immigration and advocacy work. “The tide is now turning, and maybe they feel that they’ve got nothing to lose.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, questioned the motives of all those state-level Democrats.

“Democrats don’t care about the rule of law,” she said. “If they did, they would support the president’s law-and-order agenda, which includes enforcing federal immigration law. Instead, Democrats are openly undermining the rule of law to protect criminal illegal aliens.”

Some states that are controlled by Republicans have gone the opposite direction. A new bill in the South Carolina legislature would mandate that all county sheriffs enter into formal agreements to work with ICE. Tennessee Republicans want government agencies to check the legal status of all residents as a condition of receiving public assistance, and also to verify the immigration status of elementary and secondary school students, despite a decade-old Supreme Court ruling that forbade it.

With most state legislatures back in session, patterns are emerging out of the dozens of bills that are active or being discussed, said Gaby Goldstein, the founder of State Futures, which organizes progressive lawmakers nationally and tracks legislation.

Many are related to rule-of-law concerns and civil rights protections.

The Colorado proposal, for instance, mirrors ones in California, Washington, Wisconsin and elsewhere that seek to establish a private right of action, which would give individuals or organizations the ability to file civil lawsuits for constitutional violations in state court, rather than on the federal courts, said State Senator Mike Weissman, the bill’s primary sponsor and a lawyer by trade. He represents the Denver suburb of Aurora, which Mr. Trump has said has been “taken over” by Venezuelan gangs. His bill would take aim at civil immigration enforcement, he said, “not police officers doing ordinary work.”

Though the legislation would apply to ICE and other branches of the Department of Homeland Security, he emphasized that the bill focuses on conduct that would violate constitutional rights rather than on employees of any particular branch of government.

“I mean, to use a crazy example, if Trump starts mobilizing park service employees to go crack heads and violate the Fourth Amendment, they’re going to find themselves answerable as well,” he said.

He has been working with the Institute for Justice, a libertarian group that has long battled against federal overreach. One of its cases involves a construction worker in Alabama of Mexican descent who, despite being a U.S. citizen and showing his REAL ID, was detained twice by masked agents.

Under current legal standards, Anya Bidwell, a senior attorney for the Institute for Justice, said individuals find it hard to sue state and local officials, and all but impossible to sue federal ones, who have broader immunity. And with the Supreme Court and Congress showing no appetite to step in, she said it is incumbent upon a state to “protect its own citizens.”

“Power works in a way that once you have it, you try to accumulate more and more and more of it,” she said. “And it’s really important to be able to fight back and to be able to enforce the rights that are guaranteed to us as individuals. That really shouldn’t be a partisan issue.”

That sensibility is also guiding State Senator Anthony Broadman, a first-term Democrat who represents a swing district in Bend, Ore., and is trying to appeal to conservatives who might remember when they were the ones outraged by federal recklessness.

Oregonians, Mr. Broadman said, still remember the armed sieges in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and in the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Oregon, he said, “where conservatives have been harmed by the federal government.” So he hopes to introduce a bill similar to the one in Colorado that would apply to federal constitutional violations, but would not be limited to immigration.

“It’s not just liberals and immigrants who get hurt by the United States, when they violate people’s rights,” he said.

Other targets of state-level Democratic bills include banning agreements that delegate some federal immigration powers to state and municipal law enforcement agencies (Hawaii, Massachusetts, Vermont) and banning masked or unidentified law enforcement officers (Maryland, Arizona, Virginia).

A bill in Washington would limit the ability of federal immigrant agents to enter child care centers, health care facilities and election sites without a warrant or court order.

Since the start of the second term, the Trump administration has launched a series of immigration enforcement operations involving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and other federal law enforcement agencies. These operations—involving masked, unidentified agents using aggressive tactics against both U.S. citizens and immigrants—have caused chaos across the United States. Many of these operations have been targeted against President Donald Trump’s political opponents, deploying large roving task forces to cities and states run by Democratic officials.

As an immediate next step, the Trump administration must pull ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents out of Minneapolis and fire Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in order to prevent further tragedies in Minnesota. But the problems with this administration’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are far more widespread and demand meaningful reforms and accountability from Congress.

To immediately reform the Department of Homeland Security, the Center for American Progress recommends the following commonsense measures:

DHS must be held to the same standard as local police and wear uniforms that clearly identify their agency, be unmasked, and be equipped with body-worn cameras during public enforcement actions.

DHS must reform hiring, screening, and training to remove unqualified personnel.

DHS personnel must be held accountable for improper uses of force and allegations of misconduct.

DHS must preserve Americans’ constitutional rights and operate within the rule of law.

DHS must enhance accountability to Congress and the public.

This militarized, unaccountable behavior by the Trump administration’s DHS and other federal law enforcement agencies is unlawful and unsafe. As their mission becomes increasingly politicized, these agencies are behaving more like regime secret police than federal law enforcement officials protecting the American public. It is critical that Congress, the courts, and a future administration demand and implement real reforms that keep our communities safe, protect rights and freedoms, and prevent overreach and abuse.

DHS must be held to the same standard as local police and wear uniforms that clearly identify their agency, be unmasked, and be equipped with body-worn cameras during public enforcement actions

The reckless actions of ICE, CBP, and other federal law enforcement agencies during these raids have undermined the legitimacy of and public trust in law enforcement more broadly. State and local police from jurisdictions across the country, many of which have spent years building trusted relationships with communities, are seeing those relationships jeopardized by federal deployments that have made people, particularly immigrants, more cautious about engaging with the police and the legal system. Eroding trust in police makes communities less safe because effective public safety depends on cooperation between residents and law enforcement. When trust and law enforcement legitimacy break down, people are less likely to report crimes or cooperate with investigations—making it harder to solve crimes, hold offenders accountable, and prevent future violence.

Just, effective policing requires that law enforcement officers and their operations be safe, transparent, and accountable. The behavior and tactics of DHS in recent immigration enforcement raids are unsafe and inconsistent with policing best practices. Allowing masked, unidentifiable, heavily armed agents to detain and abduct people off the street creates chaos in communities, puts both law enforcement and bystanders at risk of violence, encourages unprofessional behavior and misconduct, and hinders accountability. This is why legislators in multiple states are working to pass bills, similar to California’s recent legislation, that require officers in public enforcement actions be clearly identifiable and not wear facial coverings outside of specific exemptions such as a clear health or environmental hazard or if the officer works undercover and could be compromised.

Body-worn cameras are becoming standard across many state and local police as a way to encourage professionalism while protecting both residents from abuse and law enforcement from unfounded accusations. Federal law enforcement, including CBP and ICE, had been rolling out cameras across their workforce over the past several years. However, the Trump administration deliberately hamstrung the ICE body-worn camera program, even going so far as to urge Congress to cut the funding for the program by 75 percent even after receiving billions of dollars in additional funding to recruit new enforcement personnel. This growth in personnel while undercutting the body-worn camera program puts communities and law enforcement at risk and prevents accountability for wrongdoing.

Recommended reforms

Congress should prohibit federal law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings to conceal their faces and identities, with exceptions for health, environmental, and operational hazards and protection of undercover officers.

Masked and Unidentifiable: The Risks of Federal Law Enforcement Operating Without Identification

Allie Preston

Congress should require federal law enforcement officers to wear uniforms that clearly identify the officer’s agency and provide a personal identifier, such as a name or badge number, for any public enforcement action. Officers must also be required to provide this information upon request.

Congress should require body-worn cameras for all federal law enforcement officers conducting public enforcement actions. Congress should provide specific resources to both the camera systems as well as to the offices that manage and release footage and require supervisors to regularly blind audit operational camera footage to ensure professional behavior.

Congress should require federal law enforcement to publicly release any body-worn camera footage for any incident involving serious bodily injury or deaths in custody.

DHS must reform hiring, screening, and training to remove unqualified personnel

Ensuring that federal law enforcement operations are safe, transparent, and accountable requires hiring highly qualified candidates and providing them with comprehensive training at the academy and in the field. The Trump administration has been intent on rapidly expanding ICE recruitment and hiring, loosening some hiring and training standards and placing other law enforcement agents and the public at risk. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) effectively triples ICE’s budget and allocates nearly $30 billion specifically to support a hiring surge for new personnel including officers. The Trump administration is already claiming that it has hired 12,000 new ICE personnel. To support this hiring surge, ICE is recruiting candidates who are unqualified for law enforcement positions, have failed to meet and complete screening requirements, and have failed physical or academic standards. There are also growing fears of extremists joining the ranks. This fear is heightened by the Trump administration’s repeated use of extremist dog whistles in its recruitment materials.

With the efforts to get ICE officers on the street to carry out the Trump administration’s cruel immigration agenda, ICE has cut training down for new recruits from around five months to 42 days. This means thousands of new federal law enforcement personnel are on the streets with less training on immigration and criminal law, use of force, deescalation, and standard law enforcement tactics. When CBP went through a hiring surge and nearly doubled its force between 2005 and 2011, the agency saw an increase in use-of-force complaints, racist incidents, and eventually convictions of former agents for crimes including kidnapping, sexual assault, and accepting bribes.

In addition to the tragic shootings, DHS agents have been quick to escalate situations by utilizing less-lethal devices or vehicles, breaking vehicle windows, and even throwing flash-bangs for enforcement actions. Multiple recent DHS-involved shootings over the past year involve agents firing at vehicles, a tactic discouraged by most policing agencies. These dangerous tactics put community members and law enforcement at risk, are inconsistent with the best practices in public order policing, and likely violate agency use-of-force policies.

Recommended reforms

Congress should reinstate the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database that was terminated by President Trump. This database allowed for the centralized collection and reporting of misconduct information, making it easier to identify past misconduct allegations in the hiring process. This database should also include information related to any known affiliations with extremist groups.

Congress should require DHS to report on all funding spent on recruitment campaigns including content, targeting, and recipients of funding. Congress should investigate DHS practices and policies aimed at preventing the recruiting and hiring of extremists.

Congress should investigate DHS use-of-force policies, training, and reviews to ensure that existing policies are effective at limiting uses of force to specific, narrow contexts and that training and field practices are consistent with existing policies and best practices.

DHS should issue a directive to all agents clarifying guidance related to key use-of-force policies including engaging with vehicles, prohibiting breaking vehicle windows without cause, and fulfilling an officer’s duty to intervene and render aid.

DHS personnel must be held accountable for improper uses of force and allegations of misconduct

Although independent investigations are standard practice for fatal police shootings, the Trump administration’s response to recent shootings by DHS, including the killing of Renée Good and Alex Pretti, have raised serious questions about the integrity of any federal use-of-force investigation. Following Renée Good’s killing, the Trump administration refused to cooperate with state and local investigators and moved to shut down any federal civil rights probe. Coordination with both DOJ and local law enforcement is common in a high profile law enforcement shooting, as state and local law enforcement will usually prosecute any state criminal violations and the federal government will take the lead on civil rights violations. The administration instead attempted to investigate Good’s wife for her activities. Instead of waiting for a full investigation, the Trump administration rushed to smear both Good and Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” and falsely claimed that federal law enforcement had immunity from state prosecution. After this politicized cover-up, federal prosecutors and the lead FBI agent on the case resigned. Following the killing of Alex Pretti, Homeland Security officers obstructed state and local investigators from securing the scene and gathering evidence, and the Trump administration has reportedly continued to refuse to cooperate with state investigators. This refusal to conduct thorough, impartial investigations before smearing the victim is a common practice with the administration. It is essential to hold individual officers accountable for misconduct and violations of policy, as well as criminal and civil rights violations.

Recommended reforms

Investigations into uses of force, deaths in custody, and misconduct allegations must be independent, impartial, and comprehensive. Administration officials must not interfere or obstruct investigations and should ensure there is coordination between internal and interagency oversight bodies, including inspectors general, the offices of professional responsibility or internal affairs, the FBI, and the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division (DOJ Civil Rights).

Congress should require federal law enforcement to coordinate and share information on internal investigations with state and local law enforcement to the maximum extent possible, and federal law enforcement should defer to state and local law enforcement to address state criminal statutes.

Congress should require that any lethal use of force or death in custody should automatically trigger a DOJ Civil Rights review of all available evidence to determine whether to open a formal civil rights investigation.

Congress and the DOJ should rebuild, resource, and modernize DOJ Civil Rights to ensure that it can integrate modern technical tools into pattern or practice investigations and dedicate a pattern or practice team for reviews of federal law enforcement agencies that provides regular reports to Congress.

Congress should require that the DOJ and DHS provide regular reports to Congress and the public on use-of-force incidents, internal reviews and investigations, and accompanying disciplinary actions and policy changes.

DHS must preserve Americans’ constitutional rights and operate within the rule of law

In its mission statement, DHS pledges to safeguard the American people, the homeland, and the nation’s values with honor and integrity. However, as made evident by media reports, citizen observers, and whistleblower disclosures, DHS has allowed ICE and CBP to operate in a manner that violates Americans’ constitutional rights and skirts the rule of law. DHS must preserve Americans’ constitutional rights and uphold the rule of law in its conduct.

No warrantless arrests

In January 2026, whistleblowers brought to light an ICE memo instructing agents that they can enter a person’s home to arrest them without a judicial warrant—instructions that constitutional scholars, immigration experts, and a federal judge agree violate the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable search and seizure. Although the memo was only recently made public, it was issued in May 2025 and whistleblower disclosures allege this unconstitutional policy is being implemented. ICE operations in Minneapolis seemingly confirmed that agents are acting unconstitutionally in accordance with this memo, as agents have conducted raids across the city, breaking into people’s homes and even detaining citizens, without judicial warrants.

ICE agents have tried to claim that their actions are authorized by their own administrative warrants, but this is false and misleading. Administrative warrants are issued by ICE and authorize officers to arrest an individual suspected of violating immigration law. These warrants are not signed by judges and administrative warrants do not give agents the authority to conduct door-to-door raids or enter citizens’ homes under the guise of searching for evidence of immigration law violations.

Stop citizen detentions and “Kavanaugh stops”

On numerous occasions, ICE has detained citizens as part of its operations, targeting individuals based on their appearance. The conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court wrongly greenlit the Trump administration’s racist and discriminatory “Kavanaugh stops” through its September 2025 order in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo. In their decision, the conservative justices, led by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, affirmed that federal agents can stop and detain a person based on their perceived ethnicity, spoken language, or occupation. (Justice Kavanaugh recently sought to backtrack this claim via footnote in Trump v. Illinois.) The use of “Kavanaugh stops” has added further fuel to the Trump administration’s out-of-control DHS practices resulting in unacceptable racial profiling of entire communities in enforcement operations.

Media reports and citizen testimony have made clear that ICE and CBP agents are widely using “Kavanaugh stops.” Many forceful abductions and detainments of U.S. citizens, including of children, happened despite individuals asserting they are citizens and having documents on them proving their citizenship status. It is critical to note that there is no legal requirement for U.S. citizens to carry documentation proving their citizenship status within the United States, and that even the possession of these documents upon confrontations with ICE agents has not prevented the detainment and kidnapping of citizens.

Some citizens have been deported while others have been detained for days. It is unclear how widespread ICE’s abduction and detention of citizens is, as the federal government does not track how often immigration agents hold American citizens. But according to Pro Publica investigative reporting, more than 170 citizens were detained by immigration agents in 2025.

No obstruction of citizens observing or recording

Americans have reported and documented numerous instances where ICE agents have violated their First Amendment rights to record and observe law enforcement. ICE agents have tried to use force and intimidation to try to stop citizens from recording, including calling their actions “illegal” and stealing their phones, detaining them for exercising their legal right to record, and even threatening to have them designated as a “domestic terrorist.”

Citizens’ rights to observe and record have perhaps never been more important than now, as many DHS agents have been operating without the use of body cameras and the administration has blatantly misrepresented facts and issued statements directly disputed by civilian video evidence and has doctored imagery related to DHS operations using artificial intelligence. Civilian video footage documenting the recent killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti has been vital in disputing the Trump administration’s false claims regarding the actions of ICE and CBP agents and those of protesters and ensuring that the American public can see what is truly unfolding across the country.

Comply with court orders

In clear violation of the rule of law, ICE and CBP under the Trump administration have repeatedly ignored or outright defied court orders in their efforts to deport individuals—including U.S. citizens—to other countries. The illegal deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, along with more than 200 others, to a notorious and deadly prison in El Salvador was carried out in clear violation of a federal court order and without due process. Since then, more deportations against court orders have occurred. For example, ICE deported to Laos a person who claimed to be a U.S. citizen, violating a federal court ruling that “recognized his substantial claim to citizenship and prohibited his removal.” In another instance, a college freshman who was flying out to visit family for Thanksgiving in Texas was arrested at an airport and then deported against a federal court order.

As communities grapple with horrific enforcement tactics of ICE and CBP across targeted cities, ICE and CBP’s blatant disregard of court orders is also on full display. In Chicago and Minnesota, federal court judges demanded that DHS leadership appear in person to address repeated violations of court orders. In Chicago, a group of journalists, protesters, and members of the clergy in a court filing informed U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis that ICE and CBP “repeatedly” defied federal court orders that limited the use of “riot control weapons” and fired pepper balls and used tear gas. In Minnesota, Chief U.S. District Judge Patrick J. Schiltz recognized that ordering the head of ICE to personally testify was extraordinary and noted “but the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed.”

Instead of ignoring the Constitution and laws that protect and strengthen American justice and accountability, the Department of Homeland Security must respect and uphold the rule of law and restore compliance with federal court orders and judgments promptly.

Recommended reforms

DHS must immediately rescind the memorandum instructing agents that they can enter a person’s home without a judicial warrant and must issue a lawful directive notifying all agents of when it is constitutionally and legally permissible to enter a person’s home.

DHS must investigate claims of Fourth Amendment violations and take official action against any ICE or CBP agent who has been reported or proved to have violated the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable search and seizure.

Congress should mandate that DHS track and report citizen detainments, including but not limited to any instances in which a person detained claims to be a U.S. citizen and any verified instance of a citizen being detained. Congress should require that DHS transmit these reports to oversight committees.

Congress should require that if a detained person or their lawyer provides proof of citizenship or legal residency such as a birth certificate, passport, or REAL ID, that ICE and CBP accept such documentation as bona fide proof of citizenship or legal residency and immediately release such person from detention or custody.

Congress should pass protections that prohibit DHS from monitoring any citizen or legal resident who has been released from ICE or CBP custody.

Congress should pass protections clarifying that a lack of documentation on a person’s body is not probable cause for detention and require DHS to start a clock on verifying any detained person’s status. For example, if a person asserts U.S. citizenship and DHS is unable to determine their citizenship status within three hours, they must be released from custody.

Congress should pass legislation to prohibit racial profiling by federal law enforcement and put an end to so-called “Kavanaugh stops.” Such legislation should include explicit bans upon law enforcement stopping or detaining any person based on perceived race and ethnicity, spoken language, and occupation and include a private right of action for individuals who believe they were stopped and detained on such a basis.

DHS must issue a directive to all ICE and CBP agents detailing Americans’ rights to observe and record, including that individuals are allowed to film any public law enforcement action, and that agents are prohibited from harassing or tracking citizens who film law enforcement and from seizing or damaging personal recording devices.

DHS must issue official reprimands for any agent reported to have violated Americans’ rights to observe and record and retain any evidence of the agent violating the right to observe and record.

Congress should hold DHS accountable for failing to comply with court orders, including by withholding, freezing, or rescinding agency funding for willful noncompliance.

Congress should pass legislation to ensure that people have a civil right of action to recover damages when federal officers, or others operating under federal authority, violate their constitutional rights.

DHS must enhance accountability to Congress and the public

The Trump administration has gutted accountability and oversight offices designed to prevent DHS from violating rights, the law, and internal policies. In March 2025, the administration took steps to essentially dismantle multiple watchdog agencies that provided oversight of DHS, including the office responsible for overseeing immigration detention and the office responsible for ensuring the protection of civil rights. Following the gutting of these agencies, one investigation found there was nearly a 40 percent decline in the number of ICE detention facility inspections in 2025, which increases the possibility of abuse in these facilities going unnoticed and unaddressed.

The administration also demonstrated its failure to provide adequate oversight of DHS when it fired multiple inspectors general across the government in January 2025 but left in place the embattled DHS inspector general, Joseph Cuffari. An independent panel found in 2024 that Cuffari misled the Senate during his confirmation process by failing to disclose that he had previously been found to have run afoul of ethics rules when he worked in the Tucson, Arizona, office of the DOJ’s inspector general. By leaving in place officials found to have infringed ethics rules while working to destroy mechanisms designed to protect civil rights and monitor its detention practices, the Trump administration has demonstrated its disdain for public scrutiny and accountability.

The Trump administration has also thwarted multiple efforts by Congress to conduct oversight over immigration detention. Members of Congress have the right to enter immigration detention centers to conduct oversight but over the past year have been denied access to detention centers. The year 2025 marked one of the deadliest years in recent decades with more than 30 deaths of individuals in ICE custody, underscoring the urgent need for congressional oversight. Conditions at detention centers have raised serious concerns, with at least six reported deaths in ICE detention since the start of 2026. One recent death in ICE detention was ruled a homicide by asphyxia by the autopsy report, with a witness contradicting an initial DHS account of the incident. The Trump administration has regularly blocked congressional oversight: While traveling to Texas, U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) was blocked from accessing detention centers in Dilley and Pearsall; in Minneapolis, Democratic U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Angie Craig, and Kelly Morrison of Minnesota were denied access after initially being allowed into the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. Last year in California, Democratic Reps. Maxine Waters, Jimmy Gomez, and Norma Torres were also denied entry to a detention center.

Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security issued a memo restricting congressional oversight and implementing a new policy that requires members of Congress to give a minimum of seven days’ notice when they plan to visit a detention center. This memo was in response to a lawsuit from a group of congressional Democrats who sued over the Trump administration’s attempts to restrict access to detention facilities for oversight. The memo limits members of Congress’ ability to conduct oversight visits, an essential tool for ensuring accountability, transparency, and compliance with federal law within DHS detention centers. Federal appropriations law requires DHS to permit members of Congress to visit detention centers without prior notice, which DHS is trying to circumvent by limiting oversight of OBBBA-funded facilities.

Recommended reforms

DHS should reinstate employees of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) so that it may investigate allegations of violations of civil rights due to DHS activities as part of the lawful oversight of the agency.

DHS should reinstate employees of the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) so that it may investigate, mitigate, and address issues in immigrant detention facilities as part of the lawful oversight of DHS activities.

Congress should demand new senior leadership to the Office of the Inspector General at DHS to increase the ability to accurately conduct impartial investigations into current and future agency misconduct.

Congress and DHS should clearly delineate roles and responsibilities between the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Professional Responsibility, CRCL, and OIDO to avoid duplication of efforts and to ensure oversight issues and complaints are promptly addressed.

Congress should ensure that all detention facilities are required to grant members of Congress immediate, unfettered access to allow congressional oversight, with no DHS circumvention for any OBBBA-funded detention operations.

Conclusion

Americans rightly expect the Department of Homeland Security to fairly and consistently enforce the law and actually do its job of protecting the homeland. However, the Trump administration’s DHS is operating with impunity as if it is above the law.

Congressional Republicans gave DHS an unaccountable slush fund for the Trump administration to abuse via the OBBBA. Congress must now rein in the Trump administration’s out-of-control DHS by requiring the agency to adopt commonsense reforms that will save lives.

Enforcing the law and complying with the law are not in conflict. DHS can effectively enforce immigration laws without violating statutory and constitutional rights, disobeying court orders, abducting people from their homes to send them to foreign gulags, and killing people on the streets.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/GettyImages-2256088787.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 11:20:28.897905

Associated Press writers Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis, Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho, and Michelle Price in Washington contributed to this report.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Two federal officers fired shots during the encounter that killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis, a Customs and Border Protection official told Congress in a notice sent Tuesday, while Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs filed an objection saying immigration agents tried to enter the country’s consulate in the city without permission.

Officers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.

A Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.

Investigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.

Separately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis. The Democrat had just called for the abolishment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign when she was sprayed.

Trump says ‘we’re going to de-escalate a little bit’

The developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti’s death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.

By sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.” That’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.

The president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.

As he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.

Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff who had initially called Pretti “an assassin,” issued a statement suggesting CBP officers in Minneapolis “may not have been following” protocol. He said the Homeland Security Department’s initial statements about what transpired on Saturday was “based on reports from CBP on the ground.”

Ecuador files a protest with the US Embassy

A video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.

International law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.

“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.

A “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’

Immigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.

The White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Trump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city’s police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”

Courts weigh in on detained immigrants

In Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.

Also in Texas, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of ICE to appear in his courtroom, the man’s attorney said.

Attorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.

Schiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.

“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.

Schiltz’s order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.

Schiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.

The Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

Again, I want to make clear that Minnesota has made many arguments against the Trump administration, and I’m just focusing on the merits of this 10th Amendment argument.","A federal judge heard arguments on Jan. 26, 2026, as the state of Minnesota sought a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operation in the state. The administration has sent some 3,000 immigration agents to Minnesota, and attorneys for the state have argued, in part, that it amounts to an unconstitutional occupation, on 10th Amendment grounds. Alfonso Serrano, a politics editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Andrea Katz, a law scholar at Washington University in St. Louis, about the Minnesota lawsuit and its possible legal implications.

What’s the legal issue at stake in this court case?

In Minnesota v. Noem, attorneys for the state are arguing that the federal government is acting illegally by intruding on a sphere of state power (the police power). They’re claiming violations of the 10th Amendment, which is this idea that under the U.S. Constitution, states are reserved powers that existed before the Constitution was drafted, powers that are not delegated to the federal government.

They’re also making this rather new claim under what’s called the equal sovereignty principle, which is that states all have to be treated equally by the federal government. There’s also a First Amendment claim, and an Administrative Procedure Act claim, which is that the government is acting illegally in an arbitrary and capricious way. I think the 10th Amendment arguments are ones that I would say are kind of unprecedented, rather untested waters.

On that note, when does a federal law enforcement response cross the line and violate the 10th Amendment? Is there precedent for this?

The question you just posed is one that the district judge, Kate M. Menendez, seems to be nervous about having to hear. This is essentially asking a federal judge to sift into different buckets that which is federal power and that which is state power. And I can say there’s not a lot of case law on this issue.

The most filled-out doctrine under the 10th Amendment is the anti-commandeering doctrine. It holds that the federal government cannot use the state government as a sort of puppet. The federal government can’t use state officers forcibly against the state’s will to enforce the law. Now that is not, strictly speaking, what’s going on here, because Minnesota is complaining about the presence of federal agents enforcing the laws in ways that it thinks are illegal.

And so it seems to me that the 10th Amendment has been most developed in this area that Minnesota is not touching on, and so for that reason, I think their invocation of it is pretty unusual. They’re essentially claiming that the 10th Amendment protects their police powers and that the federal government is intruding on that. I think that’s a novel argument in court, and my suspicion is that it is not likely to be a winning argument in court.

The Trump administration has dismissed the state’s legal theory, saying the president is acting within his authority, correct?

Yeah, I think that’s correct. Again, I want to make clear that Minnesota has made many arguments against the Trump administration, and I’m just focusing on the merits of this 10th Amendment argument.

There was a sort of undeveloped strand of cases in the mid-20th century where the Supreme Court tried to develop this idea of core state powers. And so it said the federal government couldn’t act in a way that violated a state’s core powers, like where to put your state capital, or control over natural resources, or defining salaries for state government employees. The court said these are core state powers.

But then in a famous case called Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, in 1985, the court overruled itself and said – and this is still where we are – federal courts cannot be in the business of defining what constitutes a core state power. It’s too open-ended, undefined. It’s a political inquiry. It’s not something that’s appropriate for a judge.

And so I think on this 10th Amendment argument, Minnesota is essentially asking the courts to revive this core state powers doctrine, which I think the court is unlikely to do.

What repercussions could the judge’s ruling have?

Minnesota has already filed, in a case called Tincher v. Noem, a more conventional set of claims, which is that ICE agents broke the law, are violating rights, acting in excess of their authority. They have already gotten preliminary relief on this first set of claims, although Judge Menendez’s order is now on hold, pending appeal before the 8th Circuit court.

That is different from this 10th Amendment claim. In the 10th Amendment argument, one of the arguments that Minnesota has made is the equal sovereignty principle. The equal sovereignty principle was articulated in the 2013 case, Shelby County v. Holder. This is the famous case where the Supreme Court struck down an important part of the Voting Rights Act that prevented Southern states from restricting the vote, apparently on the basis of race. In Shelby County, the court said that the Voting Rights Act, which subjected certain states with a pattern of racial discrimination on the vote to a preclearance process where the federal government had to approve their laws before they passed them, treated different states differently.

Of course, in that case, the federal government said those are states that have a history of discrimination, so the federal government was justified in treating them differently.

But Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the Shelby County opinion, said the 10th Amendment means that the government can’t treat different states differently.

Now it’s not a well-regarded doctrine, so it’s kind of shocking that Minnesota is invoking it here. For one reason, the equal sovereignty principle has not been well developed since Shelby County. The second reason it would be a big deal – quite shocking to me, if the judge enforced it – is that Shelby County was talking about legislation that treated different states differently.

If we pass a rule where the executive branch can’t treat different states differently, you’re essentially denying the existence of discretion in enforcement, which is very quintessentially an executive power, right?

It could, for example, lead to states saying that federal agents can’t come in to help people in a natural disaster. So again, I think this argument, like the rest of the 10th Amendment arguments, suffers from being undeveloped in the case law and potentially carrying a risk of kneecapping the federal government’s ability to enforce the law, which sometimes does, for totally good-faith reasons, require treating different states differently.

Any final thoughts?

The first Trump administration was highly disorganized and didn’t take concerted action for a while. The second Trump administration was the precise opposite of that. They acted quickly and in a very organized fashion, pushing power as far as it can go in a number of agencies.

And I think the question this gets back to is how the federal courts have reacted to this barrage of executive orders, of new applications of old laws, of new forms of government power exercised in a way that threatens federalism.

The federal courts usually grant deference to the president when the government issues statements in the context of litigation. Court doctrine is to defer to those statements as being entitled. It’s a presumption of regularity, of accuracy. And I think we’re already seeing in the district courts some suspicion by the judges of the government’s version of things.

To me, this is sort of a brave new world, whether we’re going to see courts relax their deference toward the executive branch. And I mean, we are in kind of a brave new world. We have videos all over the internet showing the facts of the Alex Pretti shooting. But I just want to note that, from a separation of powers point of view, it’s very interesting to see federal judges seeming to distrust official accounts of events from the executive branch. I think this is an area in which the doctrine seems to be moving, and we’re watching it in real time.

,Policy,2026-01-28 15:31:21+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Bovino was the face of Trump's hardline immigration raids. Now his future is in question,"Jenny Jarvie, www.latimes.com, jenny-jarvie",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2026-01-28/bovino-was-face-of-trumps-immigration-raids-now-his-future-is-in-question,"For months, Gregory Bovino has been the public face of President Trump’s sweeping immigration raids across U.S. cities.
On Monday, Trump deployed border advisor Tom Homan to Minnesota, with Bovino reportedly set to depart the region.
However, the Associated Press reported Monday that Bovino and some federal agents were expected to leave Minneapolis as early as Tuesday.
As a frenetic mix of drums and bass kicked in, the video transitioned to footage of federal agents jumping out of a van to chase people down.
Ruiz Soto said that the controversy over the Trump immigration policy was no longer just about immigrants.","For months, Gregory Bovino has been the public face of President Trump’s sweeping immigration raids across U.S. cities.

When the brash Border Patrol commander charged into Los Angeles last summer with the stated mission of arresting thousands of immigrants, he was unapologetic as agents smashed car windows, concealed their identities with masks, seized brown-skinned Angelenos off the streets, and descended on MacArthur Park on horseback.

In Minneapolis, when a federal officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good on Jan. 7, Bovino’s response to Fox News’ Sean Hannity was, “Hats off to that ICE agent.”

And when a Border Patrol agent shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse, on Saturday, Bovino again defended the killing. Pretti, he said, looked like someone who “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

But as public outrage has swelled against the Trump administration’s aggressive tactics, Bovino’s future is in limbo. On Monday, Trump deployed border advisor Tom Homan to Minnesota, with Bovino reportedly set to depart the region.

Now, the question remains: will Bovino’s departure really change the Trump playbook?

Ariel G. Ruiz Soto — a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank — said Bovino’s exit, if true, could represent a pivotal moment in immigration enforcement in the nation’s interior.

“I think it signals that the tensions have risen so significantly that there’s beginning to be ruptures and fragments within the Trump administration to try to figure out how to do this enforcement more efficiently, but also with more accountability,” Ruiz Soto said.

Other immigration experts, however, question the significance of sidelining Bovino.

“I think it’s a grave mistake to think the change in the personnel on the ground constitutes a change in policy,” said Lucas Guttentag, a professor of law at Stanford University who specializes in immigration. “Because the policy remains the same: to terrorize immigrant communities and intimidate peaceful protesters.”

Even if Bovino is ousted or given a lesser role, Guttentag said, national immigration policy is still shaped by Stephen Miller — the White House deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor who has embraced hardline enforcement tactics.

“They’re still threatening to use military action,” Guttentag said. “They still want to keep the National Guard on call. All of those fundamental policies, as well as deporting people who had legal status, sending people to third world countries without any due process, adopting detention rules that deprive people of hearings to be eligible for release, all of that’s continuing.”

“Simply changing from Bovino to Homan,” he added, “doesn’t signal anything significant in terms of policy.”

So far, the Department of Homeland Security has remained publicly tight-lipped about what’s next for Bovino, and did not respond this week to inquiries from The Times.

However, the Associated Press reported Monday that Bovino and some federal agents were expected to leave Minneapolis as early as Tuesday. The Atlantic, citing DHS sources, reported that Bovino had been demoted from his role of Border Patrol commander at large and would return to his former job in El Centro, Calif.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin disputed that Monday, saying on X that Bovino “has NOT been relieved of his duties.” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt described him as a “wonderful person” and “a great professional” who would “continue to lead Customs and Border Patrol throughout and across the country.”

There has been mounting criticism of and public protest against the administration’s activities since the launch of Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota last month. Trump said he sent Homan to Minnesota “to de-escalate a little bit.”

“Bovino is very good, but he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy,” Trump said Tuesday during an interview on Fox News’ “The Will Cain Show.” “And in some cases that’s good. Maybe it wasn’t good here.”

::

A pugnacious 55-year-old who was born in California but raised in North Carolina, Bovino’s muscle-bound physique, green military greatcoat and gel-spiked hair seemed straight out of MAGA central casting.

Barreling into Los Angeles in June to command the Trump administration’s mass immigration raids, he seemed to relish confrontation as protests erupted and troops were deployed across the city.

“All over … the Los Angeles region, we’re going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we’re not going to stop,” Bovino told the Associated Press last summer. “We’re not going to stop until there’s not a problem here.”

When Bovino met legal setbacks, he was defiant.

In August, an appeals court upheld a temporary restraining order blocking his agents from targeting people in Southern and Central California based on race, language or vocation without reasonable suspicion they are in the U.S. illegally.

Bovino responded by posting a video on X that first showed L.A. Mayor Karen Bass telling reporters that “this experiment that was practiced on the city of Los Angeles failed” before cutting to himself grinning. As a frenetic mix of drums and bass kicked in, the video transitioned to footage of federal agents jumping out of a van to chase people down.

“When you’re faced with opposition to law and order, what do you do?” Bovino wrote. “Improvise, adapt, and overcome!”

After Bovino led agents in Los Angeles, he pivoted to Chicago to serve as the commander of Operation Midway Blitz. Then, he went to New Orleans before heading to Minnesota to lead what officials called Homeland Security’s “largest immigration operation ever.”

The fatal shootings of Good and Pretti by federal agents this month sparked outrage and protests, both in Minneapolis and around the nation.

Ruiz Soto said that the controversy over the Trump immigration policy was no longer just about immigrants.

“It’s about constitutional rights and it’s about U.S. citizens,” Ruiz Soto said. “For the broader public, it’s now much more immersive. It’s now much more in their face.”

After Border Patrol agents tackled Pretti to the ground and shot him, many Americans were outraged to hear Bovino and other senior Trump administration officials make false statements regarding the incident.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Pretti approached federal officers on the street with a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun and “violently resisted” when officers tried to disarm him.

But according to videos taken on the scene, Pretti was holding a phone, not a handgun, when he stepped in front of a federal agent who had shoved a woman to the ground. The agent shoved and pepper-sprayed him and then multiple agents forced him to the ground. In the middle of the scrum, an agent secured a handgun. Less than a second later, the first shot was fired.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted without evidence that Pretti had committed “an act of domestic terrorism,” and said her agency would lead the investigation into his killing.

Federal officials also denied Minnesota state investigators access to the shooting scene in south Minneapolis, prompting local and state officials to accuse the Homeland Security agency of mishandling evidence.

In the days since the shooting, Democrats in Congress have called for Noem to be removed from office.

“The country is disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done,” Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday in a joint statement. “Kristi Noem should be fired immediately or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House.”

When asked by reporters Tuesday whether Noem would step down, Trump said: “No.”

By sidelining Bovino, Ruiz Soto said the Trump administration appears to be sending a larger message.

“They’re going to try to restrict or home in the Border Patrol’s authority or at least the way they participate in operations and are going to now go back,” he said. “Or at least try to emulate more of the prior ICE model.”

Guttentag, however, said that while the public is seeing a tactical retreat on the part of the Trump administration, the problems went beyond Bovino’s leadership.

“So it’s not just the leadership, it’s the lack of training,” Guttentag said. “It’s the message that we’re getting from the very top, the statements from the vice president and others, that they have legal immunity. It’s the instructions to be as aggressive as they can be, and it’s also the lack of quality in the hiring and training process. All of that continues regardless of who the person on the ground is.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72fb9f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5958x3128+0+422/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2Fca%2Fe1d3ac6f4a32af73b1711c7b9037%2Fgettyimages-2256912385.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 12:21:56.478517

Republicans and Democrats call for Noem to step down

What started as sharp criticism of the Homeland Security secretary, and a longshot move by Democratic lawmakers signing onto impeachment legislation in the Republican-controlled House, has morphed into an inflection point for Noem, who has been the high-profile face of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement regime.

Noem's brash leadership style and remarks in the aftermath of the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good — in which she suggested Pretti ""attacked"" officers and portrayed the events leading up to Good's shooting an ""act of domestic terrorism"" — have been seen as doing irreparable damage, as events on the ground disputed her account. Her alliance with Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who was recalled from the Minnesota operation Monday as border czar Tom Homan took the lead, has left her isolated on Capitol Hill.

""What she's done in Minnesota should be disqualifying. She should be out of a job,"" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.

""I think the President needs to look at who he has in place as a secretary of Homeland Security,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. ""It probably is time for her to step down.""

Trump stands by Noem and praises her work

President Donald Trump defended Noem on Wednesday at multiple junctures, strongly indicating her job does not appear to be in immediate jeopardy.

Asked by reporters as he left the White House on Tuesday for a trip to Iowa whether Noem is going to step down, Trump had a one-word answer: ""No.""

Pressed later during an interview on Fox News if he had confidence in Noem, the president said, ""I do.""

""Who closed up the border? She did,"" Trump said, ""with Tom Homan, with the whole group. I mean, they've closed up the border. The border is a tremendous success.""

As Democrats in Congress threaten to shut down the government as they demand restrictions on Trump's mass deportation agenda, Noem's future at the department faces serious questions and concerns.

The Republican leadership of the House and Senate committees that oversee Homeland Security have demanded that department officials appear before their panels to answer for the operations that have stunned the nation with their sheer force — including images of children, including a 5-year-old, being plucked from families.

""Obviously this is an inflection point and an opportunity to evaluate and to really assess the policies and procedures and how they are being implemented and put into practice,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota, where Noem had been the state's House representative and governor before joining the administration.

Asked about his own confidence in Noem's leadership, Thune said, ""That's the president's judgment call to make.""

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called Noem a ""liar"" and said she must be fired.

The fight over funding

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that DHS enforces the laws from Congress, and if lawmakers don't like those laws, they should change them.

""Too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws,"" McLaughlin said. ""It's time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem's leadership.""

The ability of Congress to restrict Homeland Security funding is limited, in large part because the GOP majority already essentially doubled department funding under Trump's big tax breaks and spending cuts law.

Instead, Democrats are seeking to impose restraints on Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations as part of a routine annual funding package for Homeland, Defense, Health and other departments. Without action this week, those agencies would head toward a shutdown.

To be sure, Homeland Security still has strong defenders in the Congress.

The conservative House Freedom Caucus said Tuesday in a letter to Trump that he should invoke the Insurrection Act, if needed, to quell protests. The group said it would be ""ready to take all steps necessary"" to keep funds flowing for Trump's immigration enforcement and removal operations.

On the job for a year, Noem has clashed at times with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, as Republicans and Democrats have sought greater oversight and accounting of the department's spending and operations.

Noem has kept a low profile since the Saturday press conference following Pretti's death, though she appeared Sunday on Fox News. She doubled down in that interview on criticism of Minnesota officials, but also expressed compassion for Pretti's family.

""It grieves me to think about what his family is going through but it also grieves me what's happening to these law enforcement officers every day out in the streets with the violence they face,"" she said.

Once rare, impeachments now more common

Impeachment, once a far-flung tool brandished against administration officials, has become increasingly commonplace.

Two years ago, the Republican-led House impeached another Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, in protest over the then-Biden administration's border security and immigration policies that allowed millions of immigrants and asylum seekers to enter the U.S. The Senate dismissed the charges.

A Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.

Investigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.

Separately, a man was arrested after he sprayed an unknown liquid at U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar while she was speaking at a town hall meeting in Minneapolis.

Trump says 'we're going to de-escalate a little bit'

The developments came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.

By sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.” That’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.

The president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.

As he left the White House on Tuesday, the president was asked whether Pretti’s killing on Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.

Ecuador files a protest with the US Embassy

A video of the Ecuadorian consulate entry attempt posted on social media shows a staffer running to the door to turn the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.

International law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.

“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.

A “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘Maybe it wasn’t good here’

Immigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.

The White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti’s killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Trump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, along with the city's police chief, met with Homan on Tuesday and agreed to keep talking. Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.”

Attorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.

Schiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.

“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.

Schiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.

Schiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.

The Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

Though there was no confirmation of any ICE agents staying at the hotel, dozens ended up in the hotel lobby, prompting multiple arrests.

The NYPD said 66 people were taken into custody, 64 of whom were issued summonses for trespassing and disorderly conduct.

Two people received desk appearance tickets for resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration, police said.

“People have been tracking ICE movements and ICE actions,” Michael-Luca Natt, organizer for Sunrise Movement NYC, said. “They’re taking people off the streets and not just taking them away, our neighbors and our community members, but killing them blatantly in broad daylight with no due process.”

The protest happened just blocks from areas where immigration arrests have been reported, including 26 Federal Plaza and Canal Street.

NY1 reached out to both Hilton and the Department of Homeland Security regarding the claims tied to this location but did not receive a response.

At the same time, hundreds of protesters gathered in the bitter cold at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan to protest ICE and express outrage over the killings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis, shootings involving federal immigration agents.

“I’d like to see as many people out here to sway the federal government from sending immigration agents to come and kill New Yorkers,” James from Brooklyn said.

Among the crowd was Matt, also from Brooklyn and originally from Minneapolis.

“I’ve felt a strong pull back home all week. And I just really needed to be out here around people that felt similarly,” he said. “This feels different. This feels on the precipice of it being a lot more scary.”

City Hall released a statement regarding the protests, saying Mayor Zohran Mamdani “commends the protesters who exercised their right to protest against ICE.”

“As he has said, ICE is a rogue agency that has repeatedly carried out cruel, inhumane, and lawless raids, arrests, shootings, and even targeted American citizens. The Mayor is also pleased with the NYPD's response to today's peaceful protest,” the statement said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Hilton_Anti_ICE_Protest_AP_26028072592312,N,,2026-01-28 14:17:24.345838

“So you read much about Minnesota, where, unbeknownst to the public, we have brought down crime very substantially,” Trump said.","In a visit to Iowa Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Republican voters to turn out for the midterms to continue advancing GOP priorities.

In his speech, Trump turned his focus to the economy. Speaking to hundreds of supporters at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, he highlighted provisions in the massive tax and spending law passed last year and proclaimed his support for farmers and ethanol producers, both through tariffs and through promises to support ethanol production.

The president's visit comes as Iowa heads into eventful midterm elections later this fall. Iowa’s races for governor and a U.S Senate seat are open, and half of the U.S. House races in the state are currently ranked “toss-ups” by the Cook Political Report.

Trump made his speech in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, one of those toss-up races, where incumbent Republican Rep. Zach Nunn is running for his third term. Nunn is challenged by Democratic state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott.

“If we lose the midterms, you'll lose so many of the things that we're talking about, so many of the assets that we're talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we're talking about, and it would lead to very bad things,” Trump said.

Trump pointed to “No Tax on Tips” and “No Tax on Overtime” provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act as examples of how his administration is improving the economy for workers. The president last visited the state on July 3, 2025, the day before he signed the bill into a law.

He also touted tariffs as a way to make new trade deals to benefit farmers and threw his support behind E15, an ethanol gasoline blend pushed by agricultural industry leaders and Midwestern congressional members to help increase prices for corn growers and ethanol producers.

Last week, E15 was left out of a funding package that passed out of the U.S. House. Instead, the House is setting up a task force to consider the change by the end February. Trump said he trusts leaders in Congress to approve year-round E15 nationwide.

“I am trusting Speaker Mike Johnson, who's great, and Leader John Thune, who’s great — that's House and Senate — to find a deal that works,” Trump said. “For farmers, consumers and refiners — including small and mid-sized refiners — in other words, to get E15 approved. And they're working on it. They're very close to getting it done.”

Payments from an assistance program to help farmers struggling due to tariffs, high production costs and low prices also begin next month. Agricultural economists have said the funds from the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program will be helpful but insufficient to cover shortfalls farmers are facing.

Trump said money for the assistance program came from tariffs, but they come from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation fund. Congress replenished the fund with nearly $14 billion through the continuing resolution passed in November.

Trump called the economy “booming” and praised the CEO of John Deere, who was at the rally, for building two more plants — including an excavator factory in North Carolina — in response to tariffs, according to Trump.

“This has been the most dramatic one year turnaround of any country in history, in terms of the speed,” he said. “I really thought it would take us two or three years to do what we're doing.”

Trump said he’s also working to bring back “law and order” to the country. He claimed he lowered crime rates in cities like Washington, D.C., Memphis and New Orleans by taking “thousands of criminals” out of the states.

Noticeably absent from Trump’s speech was mention of the deaths of Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, who were killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this month.

The president also didn’t address protests in Minnesota or his agreement to consider reducing the number of immigration enforcement agents in the state. Trump’s speech took place four hours from the Twin Cities and three days after Pretti’s death.

“So you read much about Minnesota, where, unbeknownst to the public, we have brought down crime very substantially,” Trump said. “In Minnesota, we've taken out thousands of hard criminals, hardened, vicious, horrible criminals “

Trump also targeted Minnesota's Democratic U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, calling the country of her birth, Somalia, “a disaster.”

“It barely has a government. I don't think it does,” Trump said. “They’re good at one thing: pirates, but they don't do that anymore. You know why? Because they get the same treatment from us as the drug dealers get, boom, boom, boom.”

Protesters clog street outside Trump rally

As people inside the event center waited for Trump to arrive, protesters lined a street outside the venue that had been blocked off for demonstrators.

The crowd took over the parking lot of a neighboring Casey’s gas station. People stood on the gas pump barriers and a stack of firewood for sale. They held signs demanding the removal of immigration officers from Minneapolis and chanted “Justice for Pretti, Justice for Good.”

When an official motorcade drove past they booed and blew whistles.

Shirley Keenan from Des Moines said she is upset with how the Department of Homeland Security is treating people who are detained as part of the president’s immigration crackdown.

“I think he needs to have a heart and follow and follow the Constitution, quite frankly, and Congress needs to act as they are supposed to, as a third, equal branch of government,” Keenan said. “I sure hope that they take their job seriously, do the right thing and drastically decrease the budget for Homeland Security and require that ICE agents do not wear masks.”

Dennis Silver of Ankeny held a sign that said “ANF [America needs farmers] not ICE.” The 65-year-old said the protest outside the Trump rally was the first of his life.

“Stop the tariffs, stop the ICE deportations and the aggressiveness of ICE,” Silver said. “Where are all the jobs that he said he would create in America? You know, I know a lot of friends that have lost their jobs because of tariffs.”

Silver added that he's concerned about Trump's tariffs causing consumer prices to go up while weakening agricultural exports from Iowa.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b159f5a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1700x893+0+138/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd1%2F61%2F99727c374a05ba37647610fbac0e%2Ftrump-speech-iowa-2026-26.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 12:22:00.826851

Party leaders and election experts alike were alarmed this week after Attorney General Pam Bondi asked for access to Minnesota’s voter rolls as a condition for ending Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the state, the latest instance of the administration pressuring states to hand over their voter information.

The heightened fears come amid backlash over President Trump’s immigration crackdown and two fatal shootings at the hands of federal officers in Minnesota this month, as control of Congress hangs in the balance this November.

“There’s a real abuse of law enforcement power to claim that law enforcement power can be deployed and withdrawn in exchange for policy or other concessions,” said Wendy Weiser, a constitutional lawyer and vice president at the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan voting rights organization, pointing to Bondi’s letter.

“Secondarily … it tries to link the deployment to a state’s cooperation in what is a broader [and] improper project by this administration to lay the foundation for interfering in the upcoming election.”

Federal agents in Minneapolis over the weekend shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti at a protest against the administration’s immigration action, two weeks after an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in the city.

Thousands of ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are in Minneapolis as part of the administration’s immigration enforcement effort, but some Democrats are casting doubt on the motives behind the crackdown — particularly in light of Bondi’s letter.

In the note to Minnesota officials, which was obtained by multiple media outlets, the attorney general laid out several conditions that could “bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota,” including giving the Justice Department access to the state’s voter rolls.

“Bondi just sent a letter to Minnesota officials saying ICE will leave if the state turns over its voter database to Trump,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) wrote on the social platform X. “Guess what? This has never been about safety or immigration. It’s a pretext for Trump to take over elections in swing states.”

Murphy went so far as to suggest that the troop deployment is a pretense to cause chaos and justify taking control of elections.

“The Trump administration is creating this mayhem, particularly in cities in swing states, in order to take control of the election, to say, ‘Oh, the city’s out of control, the state’s out of control, you can’t trust the state government, we just need to run the election in November,’” Murphy told CNN over the weekend.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson blasted Murphy for “ridiculous claims that have no basis in reality,” stressing in a statement to The Hill that Trump “has been clear that he wants to work with state and local leaders to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from American communities.”

“Instead of whipping up more division, [Murphy] should urge Democrats to work with President Trump to remove public safety threats from our streets,” Jackson said.

But other Democrats and election experts were also alarmed by the letter’s implications.

Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon (D) said the letter was an “outrageous attempt to coerce” the state into handing over private data in violation of state and federal law.

Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) were among the other members of Congress who blasted Bondi’s move. And Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, who is from Minnesota, said the administration was trying to undermine elections.

Martin has previously raised concerns about the impact of Trump’s military deployments on elections, telling The Associated Press last month that “if people are afraid of leaving their house, they’re probably not going to leave their house to go vote on Election Day.”

Last month, Trump’s chief of staff Susie Wiles told Vanity Fair that claims that Trump could use the military to suppress voting are “categorically false.”

Election experts declined to weigh in on Murphy’s specific argument, but they echoed the broader concerns about federal overreach into elections.

“It’s not surprising that people are concerned about things getting ramped up,” said Michael Hanmer, a University of Maryland political science professor with a focus on voting and elections.

“What is surprising is that more Republicans and more conservatives in other elected offices aren’t throwing a fit about this. There are federal laws that grant oversight over key parts of the electoral process, but essentially, elections are run by the states.”

Rick Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote Monday that Bondi’s letter “shows ICE is not in Minneapolis for law enforcement or immigration purposes.”

“They are there to stir up s‑‑‑ in blue states and try to extort them, or at least to win a battle in American public opinion about what is necessary to curb illegal immigration,” Hasen said.

Bondi’s request for Minnesota voter rolls is the latest in a nationwide effort to gain access to voter data. Dozens of states, including Michigan and Pennsylvania, have refused, and litigation is ongoing. Earlier this month, a judge rebuffed the administration’s efforts to force California to hand over the information. And Tuesday, a federal judge in Oregon dismissed a similar suit.

“There’s a lot of ways in which having that information centrally can be abused as a pretext to engage in other efforts to interfere in the upcoming election,” said Weiser, whose organization has been tracking the administration’s efforts to access voting data and equipment.

GOP strategist Ford O’Connell argued that Republicans want access to voter data in order to make elections more secure, and that “it’s the Democrats who are interfering” by resisting.

Another Republican strategist predicted Democrats will turn up the volume on interference concerns as the election approaches, but that GOP leaders know any interference would face consequences from voters.

Altogether, though, experts say the conversation contributes to growing voter distrust in the election systems that could be problematic in the fall, when Republicans fight to hold onto their control of Washington.

“Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. The Trump administration has gone to considerable lengths to assert a federal interest … in the conduct of the 2026 midterm elections,” said Austin Sarat, an Amherst College political science professor and a contributor to The Hill.

“We are living in an era of elevated and in some cases intense fear. How that atmosphere of fear will play out six or seven months from now is difficult to say, but … an atmosphere of fear is not conducive to the kind of democratic dialogue [that] a vibrant republic depends on.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/Democrats_051725_AP_Julia-Demaree-Nikhinson.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-28 12:22:07.918191

That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.
Underpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy.
This means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification.
In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.","Immigration enforcement agents across the US are increasingly relying on a new smartphone app with facial recognition technology.

The app is named Mobile Fortify. Simply pointing a phone’s camera at their intended target and scanning the person’s face allows Mobile Fortify to pull data on an individual from multiple federal and state databases, some of which federal courts have deemed too inaccurate for arrest warrants.

The US Department of Homeland Security has used Mobile Fortify to scan faces and fingerprints in the field more than 100,000 times, according to a lawsuit brought by Illinois and Chicago against the federal agency, earlier this month. That’s a drastic shift from immigration enforcement’s earlier use of facial recognition technology, which was otherwise limited largely to investigations and ports of entry and exit, legal experts say.

The app’s existence was first uncovered last summer by 404 Media, through leaked emails. 404 Media also reported, in October, about internal DHS documents that say people cannot refuse to be scanned by Mobile Fortify.

“Here we have ICE using this technology in exactly the confluence of conditions that lead to the highest false match rates,” says Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU’s speech, privacy and technology project. “A false result from this technology can turn somebody’s life totally upside down.” The larger implications for democracy are chilling, too, he notes: “ICE is effectively trying to create a biometric checkpoint society.”

Use of the app has inspired backlash on the streets, in courts, and on Capitol Hill.

Protesters are using a variety of tactics to fight back. They include recording masked agents, using burner phones and donated dashboard cameras, according to the Washington Post.

Underpinning resistance to ICE’s use of facial recognition are doubts about the technology’s efficacy. Research has uncovered higher error rates in identifying women and people of color than for scans of white faces. ICE’s use of the technology is often occurring in intense and fast-moving situations, which makes misidentification more likely. Those being scanned may be people of color. They could be turning away from officers because they don’t want to be identified. The lighting could be poor.

The Illinois lawsuit against the DHS takes particular issue with the federal agency’s use of Mobile Fortify and argued that the app goes far beyond what Congress allows with regards to the collection of biometric data. The complaint cited several examples in which federal agents appeared to take photos or scans of US citizens across Illinois without their consent.

Democratic lawmakers in Congress introduced a bill on 15 January that would outright ban the homeland security department from using Mobile Fortify or similar apps, except for identification at points of entry. This follows a September letter, sent by senators to ICE, asking for more information about the app and declaring that “even when accurate, this type of on-demand surveillance threatens the privacy and free speech rights of everyone in the United States”.

The DHS said in a statement that Mobile Fortify does not violate constitutional rights or compromise privacy. “It operates with a deliberately high matching threshold and queries only limited CBP immigration datasets. The application does not access open-source material, scrape social media, or rely on publicly available data,” a spokesperson said.

According to 404 Media, the app’s database consists of some 200m images. “Mobile Fortify has not been blocked, restricted, or curtailed by the courts or by legal guidance. It is lawfully used nationwide in accordance with all applicable legal authorities.”

Observers, experts, and at least one congressman have said federal immigration agents frequently do not ask for consent to scan a person’s face – and may dismiss other documentation that contradicts this data. ICE has been documented using biometrics as a definitive determination of someone’s citizenship in the absence of identification.

This means that ICE is not required to conduct additional vetting of facial scans or checks to avoid a misidentification. 404 Media reported earlier this month that Mobile Fortify misidentified a detained woman during an immigration raid; the app came up with two different and incorrect names.

“Facial recognition – to the extent it should be used at all – is really supposed to be a starting point,” says Jake Laperruque, deputy director of the security and surveillance project at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT). “If you treat this as an endpoint – as a definitive ID – you’re going to have errors, and you’re going to end up arresting and jailing people that are not actually who the machine says it is.”

Laperruque says that even police departments across the country have pushed back against an over-reliance on facial recognition, treating it as a lead, at most. At least 15 states are cautious about using it all, and have laws limiting police’s use of the technology. In 2019, San Francisco became the first major US city to ban facial recognition technology by police and all other local government agencies.

The DHS issued a directive in September 2023 requiring that the bureau test the technology for unintended bias and offer US citizens the choice to opt out of scans not conducted by law enforcement. That directive appeared to be rescinded in February last year.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b35bd1a2d53b2046fc9c0d1794d5f50ca49402cf/426_0_4665_3731/master/4665.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e1f6e6e576fac78bae273c13e9a8a9b",N,,2026-01-28 12:22:18.971213

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the DHS funding bill “woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and said Democrats would withhold their votes from any packages that funds it.

Democrats won some concessions in the spending measure, but far fewer than what they had hoped to achieve. The bill trims Customs and Border Protection funding by $1 billion. ICE spending would remain flat, but capacity for detaining immigrants would shrink. The measure would provide $20 million for body cameras for law enforcement at both agencies, though detractors suggested it would not mandate they be worn. It would also require agency personnel to go through deescalation training.

DHS will still have plenty of funds from which to draw: the department was awarded $190 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, though lawmakers included in the new measure provisions requiring monthly updates on how that money is being spent. The DHS inspector general would receive an added $13 million for its oversight work.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on Monday that bills were the result of difficult bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, as well as discussions with the White House. Reaching an agreement was “not an easy task,” she said, though she added she “recognize[s] and share[s] the concerns” with the DHS bill after Pretti’s death. She highlighted the “safeguards” on immigration enforcement that were included and stressed the bulk of the bill goes toward non-controversial provisions such as funding the Transportation Security Administration, cybersecurity and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

“I hope we can come together in a constructive way to get this done and to ensure that we do not lurch into a dangerous and detrimental government shutdown,” Collins said. “So, that is my goal, and I look forward to working with our colleagues this week to accomplish that objective.”

Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., the Senate’s lead appropriator for DHS, similarly focused on the non-immigration provisions of the department’s funding bill and said those programs “must be funded.”

“We know from recent history that government shutdowns do not help anyone and are not in the best interest of the American people,” Britt said. “As we approach a government funding deadline, I remain committed to finding a pathway forward.”

Senate Republicans on Monday initiated the preliminary procedural steps for the minibus package, setting up a vote on Thursday. They have so far shown no indication they are willing to split up the bill, which would require the House—currently in recess—to take additional votes on or before Jan. 30 to avoid a shutdown.

Additional restrictions on DHS Democrats have sought include requiring third-party warrants to enter homes, additional training and performance requirements for new personnel and a prohibition on ICE detaining U.S. citizens.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said policy discussions on immigration ""are happening,"" noting Trump discussed the issue with Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., on Monday. Walz has joined many Democrats in demanding federal officers end their extended operations in his state. The governor said after the call that Trump would ""look into"" reducing the number of federal deployments in Minnesota and work with DHS to ensure the state can conduct an independent investigation in Pretti's death. Leavitt said lawmakers should back the minibus as previously negotiated.

“At this point, the White House supports the bipartisan work that was done to advance the bipartisan appropriations package and we want to see that passed,” Leavitt said.",https://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/cd/2026/01/27/01272026DHS/open-graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 11:21:48.846610

Illinois last month became the first state to pass such a law. Trump's administration swiftly filed a lawsuit seeking to block it, arguing that allowing civil rights lawsuits against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in state courts violates a key provision of the U.S. Constitution.

Democratic-backed legislation that would allow civil rights claims against ICE agents in state courts also is being considered in states including California, New York, Virginia, Maryland and Connecticut. The killings of two people - Renee Good and Alex Pretti - by ICE agents in Minneapolis this month and rough tactics used by the agency during deployments have brought new attention to these efforts, still in the early stages of the legislative process.

'HOLD ICE AGENTS ACCOUNTABLE'

New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said during a January 13 speech that she will ""move to allow New Yorkers to hold ICE agents accountable in court when they act outside the scope of their duties.""

ICE is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said in a statement to Reuters that Hochul ""continues to smear law enforcement who are simply enforcing the rule of law and are putting their lives on the line.""

""DHS law enforcement officers follow the law and the U.S. Constitution,"" McLaughlin added.

The state measures could pave the way for a wave of lawsuits by U.S. citizens and non-citizens alike seeking monetary damages from individual law enforcement officers accused of violating constitutional rights such as freedom of speech, due process and the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. The measures are intended to address what their supporters call an accountability gap in the U.S. legal system.

In 1871, the U.S. Congress passed a law that lets people bring civil rights lawsuits in federal courts against state and local government officials including police officers. This law, called Section 1983, has been a tool for addressing misconduct by police officers at the state and local levels.

But Congress has never passed a similar law allowing for such lawsuits in federal courts against individual federal agents, like ICE officers, accused of violating constitutional rights, with Democratic proposals stymied by Republican opposition.

One existing law, called the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, allows people to seek compensation from the U.S. government for negligent and wrongful acts by federal employees, though it does not allow these employees to be named as individual defendants in lawsuits.

A law firm representing Good's family said it is investigating whether to pursue legal action through the Federal Tort Claims Act but said that statute requires plaintiffs to deal with ""byzantine, time-consuming processes.""

Anya Bidwell, an Arlington, Virginia-based lawyer who brings civil rights claims on behalf of clients against law enforcement, called the proposed state measures that would allow for suits against federal agents in state courts ""a potential sea change"" in the American legal system. One of her clients is a California man - a U.S. citizen and Army veteran - who has said he was brutalized by ICE agents during an immigration raid.

'SUPREMACY CLAUSE'

The Illinois law allows civil lawsuits in state courts against federal agents who knowingly violate constitutional rights while enforcing U.S. immigration law. Under that law, plaintiffs who allege they have been unlawfully searched or detained by ICE agents could sue them in state court and seek monetary compensation, including punitive damages.

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit seeking to block the Illinois law, and has signaled it would challenge any similar state measure passed this year. It said the Illinois law violates a constitutional provision called the ""Supremacy Clause"" that makes federal laws supersede conflicting state laws.

McLaughlin described threats she said have been made against DHS personnel, and said that despite these ""our law enforcement show incredible restraint and professionalism in exhausting all options before any kind of non-lethal force is used.""

But Amar and Mazzone and some other legal experts support the core premise of the Illinois law and similar proposals under which states would create civil liability for federal agents who violate the Constitution.

""The Supremacy Clause only prevents states from imposing new legal obligations and restrictions on federal officers,"" said Lauren Bonds, director of the Redmond, Washington-based National Police Accountability Project advocacy group.

The Trump administration's lawsuit targeting the Illinois law eventually could reach the U.S. Supreme Court, Bidwell said.

The California legislation, called the No Kings Act in a nod to the anti-Trump protest movement of that name, was approved by a state Senate committee in an 11-2 vote this month. It has not yet been taken up by the full state Senate. It also would need approval by the state Assembly and Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.

The fact that the California proposal is modeled after Section 1983, a federal law already on the books, makes it more likely to withstand a legal challenge, Bidwell said.

""The courts would not need to reinvent the wheel,"" Bidwell said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) acting Director Todd Lyons, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Rodney Scott and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow will appear before the House panel on Feb. 10 and the Senate panel on Feb. 12.

Tuesday’s testimony agreement follows formal requests from House Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.) and Senate Committee Chairman Rand Paul (R-Ky.).

“I appreciate the Department of Homeland Security for working with us to make this hearing happen,” Garbarino said in a post on the social platform X on Tuesday. “We’ll continue our oversight work to ensure these agencies are carrying out their mission and keeping our communities and law enforcement safe.”

All three agencies are under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which has led a massive immigration crackdown effort, “Operation Metro Surge,” in Minnesota, among other cities across the U.S. DHS said the operation is the largest in agency history, with the department deploying over 2,000 federal agents to the state.

The crackdown has been the source of intense friction between Minnesotans and federal authorities, particularly since two fatal shootings this month. In Minneapolis, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, amid a protest. Additionally, federal agents shot a Venezuelan migrant in the leg while he attempted to evade detainment.

After federal authorities fatally shot 37-year-old intensive care nurse and Minnesota resident Alex Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called for an investigation into DHS’ operations in the state.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) called the situation “incredibly disturbing” in a post on the social platform X on Saturday.

“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” Cassidy said. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP831767902322-e1754484994935.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-28 10:14:36.969333

The agent was prevented from gaining access by consular officials, who acted ""to guarantee the protection of the Ecuadoreans who were inside the consulate at the time"", a statement by Ecuador's foreign ministry said.

The incident comes at a time of high tension in the US city, just days after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti was shot dead by border agents during protests against the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

Ecuador's foreign ministry said in a statement that an agent of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) had ""tried to enter the premises of the consulate"" at 11:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Tuesday.

According to the Convention, the authorities of the country where the consulate is located ""shall not enter"" the parts of the consulate used for work ""except with the consent of the head of the consular post"".

While the Vienna Convention goes on to say that consent may be assumed in certain cases, they are limited to incidents where ""prompt protective action"" is required, such as in the case of a fire or some other disaster.

In a video shared by Ecuadorean media, which has not been independently verified by the BBC, a consular official can be seen rushing to the entrance door and telling an ICE agent ""this is the consulate, you're not allowed in here"".

The agent tells the official that ""if you touch me, I will grab you"".

The consular official then states again that ""you can not enter here, this is a consulate, this is a foreign government's office"", before closing the door.

In its statement, Ecuador's foreign ministry said that it had ""immediately"" handed an official letter of protest to the US embassy in Quito.

Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign Tuesday, making them the first Republicans in Congress to say she should step down.

Asked whether he had confidence in Noem, Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters on Capitol Hill: “No, not at all. I think she should go.”

Tillis, who is not running seeking another term in Congress, said some of Noem's actions reflected ""amateurish assistant-manager-sort of thought processes,"" calling them ""unacceptable"" for someone in a Cabinet-level position.

""If I were in her position, I can't think of any point of pride over the last year,"" he said.

Murkowski, R-Alaska, whose term runs until January 2029, said Noem should not be running DHS.

“Yes, she should go,” Murkowski told NBC News.

Tillis and Murkowski, who have shown willingness to break with the administration more than other GOP lawmakers, made the comments days after federal officers shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, where an immigration officer killed Renee Good this month.

Tillis said Noem or President Donald Trump have to decide whether she should step down.

DHS did not provide a comment on the senators' remarks, but the White House pointed to Trump's comments earlier in the day.

In an interview with Fox News, Trump said he still has faith in Noem, calling her work at the border “a tremendous success,” while noting that her accomplishments happened alongside border “czar” Tom Homan “and the whole group.”

Homan on Tuesday took over the reins in Minneapolis, replacing Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino as the main point of contact for immigration enforcement operations on the ground there.

After Pretti was killed last week, Noem was quick to defend federal officials, claiming Pretti had approached officers with a gun “wishing to inflict harm” on them, and that he “violently resisted” when they ""attempted to disarm"" him. But eyewitness video contradicted that narrative, showing that Pretti did not have a weapon in hand during the confrontation that led to his death.

The White House on Monday distanced itself from Noem’s remarks, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying Trump “wants to let the facts and the investigation lead itself.”

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., sidestepped Tuesday when asked if he has confidence in Noem.

“She serves at the pleasure of the president,” he told reporters. “The important thing is that the president’s got confidence in his team.”

Some Republicans said they have confidence in Noem, including Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., while Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said she should implement “policy changes” at DHS and review the recent Minnesota shooting.

Centrist Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who chairs the Appropriations Committee that controls the DHS budget, didn't go as far as Murkowski or Tillis when asked about Noem.

“I have urged her to have a pause in both Minnesota and Maine on this surge of enforcement,” Collins said Tuesday.

Numerous congressional Democrats have said already said Noem should resign. Still, some warned that ousting Noem won’t change immigration policy, even if they would like to see her replaced.

“She’s unqualified, but so will the next DHS secretary,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “The name on the door of DHS doesn’t really matter. This is an operation being run by the president and Stephen Miller.”

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said dismissing Noem “would be the smart play for the administration.”

“But I don’t want DHS Secretary Steve Miller,"" he said, referring to the White House deputy chief of staff for policy. ""I mean, that removal isn’t enough, because then the question is, well, who are you going to put in next?”

The focus on Noem also comes as the Senate faces a crucial deadline of Friday at midnight to pass a massive funding bill or face a partial government shutdown starting Saturday. The bill is expected to come up Thursday. It requires 60 votes to advance, and Democrats have made clear they will block it unless the DHS portion is revised to include guardrails and accountability measures on immigration enforcement operations.

Murphy said no amount of executive actions or promises by Trump can win over Democrats.

“There’s nothing the administration can promise us that will do the job,” he said. “They can’t be trusted to keep to their promises. So we need to change the DHS bill and build reforms into the language of the bill.”

Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said that “constructive conversations are happening” about the path forward.

“I think we should be able to land this,” he said, though he wasn’t sure it could be done by the Friday deadline to prevent a shutdown. “I don’t know about timing.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260127-Tillis-Murkowski-aa-649-6714e4.jpg",N,,2026-01-28 13:18:52.587262

These lawsuits are not based on a law passed by Congress, but rather are a remedy created by the courts.
The law was passed in September, but the Trump administration challenged it in federal court, arguing that it violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.
The principle of federal supremacy establishes that federal law prevails over state laws.","The California Senate on Tuesday passed a bill that will allow people to file civil lawsuits in state courts against federal officials — including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents — who violate constitutional rights. The so-called No Kings Act seeks to create a new legal avenue under state law for seeking compensation, as President Donald Trump’s administration continues its immigration crackdown on cities governed by Democrats.

The bill now needs to be passed by the State Assembly and receive the approval of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom to become law. Democrats hold a supermajority in the Assembly, which should allow them to pass the legislation with little Republican opposition.

The No Kings Act — the name given to the massive protests against the Trump administration last year — seeks to fill the legal void of what are known as Bivens lawsuits, civil actions that allow people to sue federal agents directly — not the federal government as such — for violations of their constitutional rights.

These lawsuits are not based on a law passed by Congress, but rather are a remedy created by the courts. Their origin dates back to a 1971 Supreme Court ruling (Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents), in which the court determined that an individual could seek monetary damages directly from federal agents who had violated the Constitution. However, in recent decades, the courts have restricted the circumstances under which these lawsuits are permitted, arguing that it is up to Congress to legislate on the matter. As a result, many people who allege abuses by federal officials lack an effective legal alternative.

The bill’s author, Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, has said that the Trump administration “is attempting to wield unchecked power to illegally kidnap and deport people.”

“By passing the No Kings Act, we’re putting a stop to the impunity that’s enabling ICE and Border Patrol’s sickening terror rampage through American cities,” Wiener said in a statement. “We must close the loophole that makes it almost impossible for the families of Renee Good and Alex Pretti — who were executed in broad daylight — to seek justice for their family members. We must close the loophole that makes it almost impossible for the victims of Trump’s terror campaigns in our immigrant communities to seek justice [...] These agents must face real consequences for terrorizing our communities.""

The law would be applied retroactively from March 2025, before the start of the immigration offensive that sparked mass protests and later the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, as part of the Trump administration’s offensive against cities governed by Democrats.

Last summer, protests erupted in several parts of Los Angeles against Trump’s immigration offensive, following months of mass raids, arrests of people without criminal records, and allegations of racial profiling that resulted in a court order prohibiting arrests based on race, language, or employment, but was later overturned by the Supreme Court.

Trump ordered the deployment of more than 4,000 National Guard troops and hundreds of U.S. Marines without the consent of Governor Newsom, who challenged the move in court. It was the first deployment of the National Guard without state consent since the 1960s and served as a roadmap for an administration offensive against Democratic-run cities that later extended to Portland, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis, among others.

Hector Pereyra, director of the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice, celebrated the Senate’s passage of the bill, saying it is “more necessary than ever.” “We have seen federal agents go unpunished after shooting a family without facing significant consequences. This bill seeks to ensure that no one is above the Constitution and that federal agents can be held accountable when they violate constitutional rights.”

Senator Wiener — who is seeking to replace Nancy Pelosi in the U.S. Congress for District 11, which includes San Francisco — also championed another law last year called the No Secret Police Act, which prohibits law enforcement officers from wearing masks to conceal their identities during public interactions. The law was passed in September, but the Trump administration challenged it in federal court, arguing that it violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.

The principle of federal supremacy establishes that federal law prevails over state laws. However, it has been a double-edged sword for Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda, as several states have attempted to pass restrictive laws against immigrants that have subsequently been struck down under that same principle.

California voters in November approved a law championed by Governor Newsom to redraw the state’s congressional districts in favor of Democrats, in response to efforts by other states like Texas to solidify Republican majorities. The initiative allows the use of maps drawn by the Legislature for the 2026-2030 elections, potentially giving Democrats up to five additional seats in the U.S. Congress.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/PRCHDGE2TIEYG3K7K6RLTWVACE.jpg?auth=b0a384f2f8c943dfc1478efcfbf164565e848ab0cc958e93923fd1f231856e28&width=1200,N,,2026-01-28 07:58:52.551232

As a result, a serious breakdown in the collaboration between federal and local law enforcement in any jurisdiction is a breakdown in law enforcement more generally.
You can add it to the list of major political aberrations and ironies in the second Trump administration.","Already, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota has been seriously hobbled, but the full extent of the problems have only been partially visible to the public.

The office is supposed to have 50 criminal prosecutors on staff, but at the moment, there are only “about 17 prosecutors” left, according to David Lillehaug, who served as the U.S. Attorney in Minnesota during the Clinton administration and remains familiar with dynamics inside the office he once led. (A DOJ spokesperson declined to comment on personnel.)

Lillehaug, who later served as a judge on the Minnesota Supreme Court, was recently enlisted by the state’s bar association to brief roughly 150 lawyers on the legal response to the federal deployment and to moderate a brainstorming session on potential legal claims or defenses against the federal government’s overreach.

“Basically, what has been happening in slow motion with the Justice Department over a year” — an unprecedented number of resignations and firings — “hit the U.S. Attorney’s Office within a matter of days,” Lillehaug told me.

At least nine prosecutors have recently left the office, including “some of the crown jewels of the force,” he said. Some of the line prosecutors still there are now thinking about leaving in the wake of Pretti’s killing, but they are worried about things getting even worse in their absence. (A DOJ spokesperson again declined to comment on personnel.)

The Justice Department has quietly tried to paper over these problems. Lillehaug told me senior officials from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of Michigan have been brought in to effectively run the Minnesota office and that JAG lawyers who typically work in the military have been added to fill the gap, but this is not a long-term solution. A DOJ official said that the attorneys from the Eastern District of Michigan are assisting the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota and argued that this was a common occurrence when an office has an influx of cases or when specialized experience is needed. A person familiar with the situation added that JAGs are coming in to assist with charges against people assaulting, resisting or impeding federal officers.

The administration’s immigration enforcement push has also pulled prosecutors off critical investigations and cases. “What is happening in that office — [what] is happening all around the country — is that AUSAs who were in white-collar or doing narcotics or firearms are being transferred to immigration enforcement,” Lillehaug said. (A DOJ official said that federal prosecutors are capable of prioritizing multiple needs in order to keep people in their districts safe.)

The Justice Department is also antagonizing federal judges in the district — the judges that prosecutors have to appear before every day in order to do their jobs, and whose assessment of the DOJ’s credibility can make or break their prosecutions.

Patrick Schiltz, the chief U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota, already had to publicly dispute the Justice Department’s characterization of a highly unusual effort to charge protesters after a magistrate judge declined to sign off on an arrest warrant. On Tuesday, Schiltz ordered Todd Lyons, the acting head of ICE, to appear in his courtroom on Friday after finding that the agency had defied “dozens of court orders” in recent weeks. “The court’s patience is at an end,” Schiltz wrote. Within hours, ICE reportedly released the detainee at issue in the case.

Meanwhile, DOJ and FBI leaders have only made things worse with their own public remarks in recent weeks.

In the wake of Good’s death, several prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office resigned after the department decided to investigate Good’s widow instead of the federal officer who actually shot and killed her. Instead of adjusting course or tamping things down, Attorney General Pam Bondi went on a tirade on Fox News, claiming that the prosecutors had quit because they refused to defend federal law enforcement and announcing that she had summarily fired them instead of allowing them to take the remaining annual leave that they had accrued while working for the government.

More recently, in addition to opening a criminal investigation into elected Democrats in Minnesota, Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Tim Walz outlining a series of demands on local leaders that include giving the Trump administration access to the state’s voter rolls. The missive read more like a shakedown than an effort to ease the crisis.

For his part, FBI Director Kash Patel claimed in an interview that it was illegal for Pretti to bring a firearm to a public protest, but under Minnesota law, that is false. It sounded like another effort to blame Pretti for being needlessly killed by federal agents, but on top of that, the administration and its Republican allies are supposed to be staunch supporters of the First and Second amendments. The effort to demonize Pretti for lawfully carrying a firearm has not sit well with gun rights activists.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has taken the lead in public remarks for the Justice Department in the wake of Pretti’s killing, but he has not done any better than Bondi or Patel.

In multiple interviews in recent days, Blanche has also tried to blame state and local leaders for Pretti’s death, which, besides being unseemly and illogical — the number of federal agents in the state vastly outnumbers local law enforcement — prompted forceful pushback on the facts from Walz in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.

Blanche’s fumbling is not surprising if you have been following his public appearances in recent months. Last fall, Blanche called a federal judge “disgusting” after she blocked the Trump administration’s effort to summarily deport hundreds of children to Guatemala. Blanche indignantly claimed that the administration was simply trying to reunite the children with family members, but that claim turned out to be so false that the Justice Department later had to abandon it.

Despite the early hopes of some old colleagues, Blanche is at this point publicly indistinguishable from Bondi herself.

There is a conspicuous and troubling vacuum of accountability as well. After the Good shooting, officials in the White House and Justice Department refused to admit error and missed an important opportunity to deter additional killings, intentional or otherwise, by federal immigration officials. Many people pointed out — correctly — that this decision would have the effect of encouraging more reckless behavior by federal law enforcement, and Pretti is now dead.

Given the way that the Trump administration has conducted itself, there is no good reason to believe that there will be a credible federal criminal investigation into the conduct of the officers who killed Good or Pretti, much less a federal prosecution. State prosecutors can do their best, but with the federal government working at apparent cross purposes to prevent them from investigating the officers, the hurdles will be considerable. They include legal complications like “Supremacy Clause immunity,” which makes it difficult (though not impossible) for state governments to prosecute federal officials, as well as political complications, like the possibility that the Trump administration will abuse its authority to disburse federal funds to punish the state if it pursues serious charges.

Other effects — less tangible, but still significant — are likely to persist well beyond the current moment.

Lillehaug told me that he was “shocked and dismayed” by what has already transpired in the state, and that he is concerned that it will permanently damage what had been a very cooperative relationship between federal, state and local governments and law enforcement.

“Law enforcement in Minnesota is highly collaborative — more so than most states, having something to do, I’m sure, with the state’s culture,” he added. Senior FBI leaders in the state “will go to the retirement party of the Ramsey County Sheriff. The U.S. attorney will convene a group of heads of [state] agencies for coffee.”

It is not unheard of for federal agents to address issues in Minnesota, Lillehaug said. A DEA task force might come through to tackle open air drug markets, or an ATF temporary assignment might deal with gun tracing, but that would be no more than a dozen agents, not the 3,000 agents from mostly out of town on the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

The prognosis is not good. “It’s going to be harder for federal and state law enforcement efforts to be cooperative,” Lillehaug told me. “There will be a great deal of suspicion, especially with those who have not separated themselves from DHS and the U.S. Attorney’s Office.”

The friction could extend well beyond Minnesota, particularly in the jurisdictions run by Democratic leaders that have been the favored target of the Trump administration’s most aggressive law enforcement efforts. Trust and respect are vital to these federal-state relationships, but the Trump administration has generally chosen antagonism and public disdain whenever things do not go their way.

Cooperation between federal and local law enforcement is an essential component of public safety throughout the country. The two groups often complement one another’s efforts — with federal prosecutors picking up more complex and resource-intensive cases while local prosecutors handle the much larger volume of crimes, including violent crimes and property crimes like robbery and burglary, that generally do not require the federal government’s attention or limited resources. Senior leaders are often in regular contact with one another, comparing priorities and dividing work.

As a result, a serious breakdown in the collaboration between federal and local law enforcement in any jurisdiction is a breakdown in law enforcement more generally. Whether the Trump administration understands this is unclear, but it is one of the key lessons of the tragedies and the ongoing chaos in Minnesota.

You can add it to the list of major political aberrations and ironies in the second Trump administration.

ICE List is a website that claims to compile the names and photos of Department of Homeland Security employees. Its founder, Dominick Skinner, told POLITICO last July that he created the website as a way to hold ICE agents accountable for potential abuses of power.

The Trump administration has accused the project of doxing officers and putting their lives at risk. DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Skinner questioned Meta’s policy against posting links to websites that contained people’s personal information, noting that Meta’s platforms had no issues with posting people-finder websites such as White Pages that shared individuals’ phone numbers and family members.

Here's what to expect,"Garrett Downs, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/27/us-government-shutdown-over-dhs-funding.html,"The U.S. government is on the brink of a partial shutdown beginning at 12:01 a.m.
Democrats are demanding the DHS portion be stripped in exchange for their votes, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.
Certain government functions like Social Security payments and Medicare and Medicaid services typically continue during a shutdown, Quakenbush said.
The Internal Revenue Service is among the agencies that would lose funding during a shutdown.
That bill provided DHS with roughly $178 billion, which could be tapped to continue immigration operations during a shutdown.","The U.S. government is on the brink of a partial shutdown beginning at 12:01 a.m. ET Saturday in large part because of a second recent killing of a U.S. citizen by federal agents in Minneapolis. It would be different than last year's shutdown.

The killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, has galvanized fierce Senate Democratic opposition to a House-passed measure providing funding for the Department of Homeland Security and a slew of other agencies. The more-than-$1.2 trillion package cleared the House of Representatives last week and accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.

Democratic support will be required to pass the bill, which needs 60 votes to avert the filibuster in the Senate that Republicans control 53-47. Democrats are demanding the DHS portion be stripped in exchange for their votes, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., suggested on Tuesday that the Trump administration's recent retreat from its immigration actions in Minnesota would not be enough to drop the shutdown threat — raising the shutdown odds even higher.

""The fix should come from Congress; the public can't trust the administration to do the right thing on its own,"" Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor.

""In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds ICE until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue,"" Schumer said. ""If [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune insists on holding a vote on DHS legislation that he knows will not pass, then he will guarantee yet another unnecessary government shutdown this Friday.""

Thune, R-S.D., said Tuesday on the Senate floor that Pretti's death was a ""tragedy"" and warrants a ""full and impartial investigation."" He also said talks are underway to break a Democratic logjam of the appropriations bill.

""Productive talks are ongoing, and I urge my Democrat colleagues to continue their engagement and find a path forward that will avoid a needless shutdown,"" Thune said.

If the Senate alters the bill at all, it would have to be reapproved by the House, which is out on a prescheduled recess and has not announced plans to return before the deadline.

In addition to DHS, the bill would fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education.

Should the bill not pass by the Friday night deadline, those agencies would be deprived of funding and enter a shutdown posture — meaning ""nonessential"" employees would be furloughed and ""essential"" employees would work without pay. Spending bills that President Donald Trump already signed would keep the rest of the government open.

""Activities that are necessary to protect life and property continue, although the workers in those functions may not be paid while they are working,"" said Caleb Quakenbush, associate director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""Agencies have a lot of discretion in terms of who is essential and at what period.""

Agencies typically release contingency plans before a shutdown. So far, the agencies at risk of losing funding have not publicly released their plans.

Certain government functions like Social Security payments and Medicare and Medicaid services typically continue during a shutdown, Quakenbush said. The bill that reopened the government last year included funding for the Department of Agriculture through the fiscal year, meaning the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will not see a disruption as it did last year.

There are still a number of services that could see disruptions. A shutdown at the end of the week would be the first during tax season, which began Monday.

The Internal Revenue Service is among the agencies that would lose funding during a shutdown. Last year, the agency remained open in some capacity during the shutdown but did have to wind down some operations as the shutdown dragged on.

The IRS said in October that most tax refunds would not be issued during the last shutdown, with an exception for Form 1040s that are ""electronically filed, error-free tax returns that can be automatically processed and direct deposited.""

IRS walk-in taxpayer assistance centers were also shuttered during the last shutdown.

The Treasury Department did not respond to emails from CNBC seeking comment on the agency's contingency plans.

The Department of Transportation would also be shuttered, though some key functions would remain functioning. Air traffic controllers would be required to work without pay.

The Department of Health and Human Services would also be affected. Some Head Start programs were forced to close during the last shutdown, depriving families of critical child care.

DHS, however, would be able to largely operate without interruption due to funding provided to the agency through the Republicans' ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" law enacted last year. That bill provided DHS with roughly $178 billion, which could be tapped to continue immigration operations during a shutdown.

It's unclear whether the other agencies affected have identified similar pots of money that could be used to keep operations going. The length of a potential shutdown would also be critical in assessing how long those contingency funds would last.

Senate Republicans currently lack the 60 votes required to advance the measure.

Democratic Congressmembers Doris Matsui and Mike Thompson urged the Senate to reject the bill during a press conference Tuesday outside the John Moss Federal Building in downtown Sacramento. Protestors for weeks have rallied outside the building against the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in places like Minnesota and California.

Matsui, of Sacramento, said now is the time to stand up.

“We voted against the DHS bill, the funding bill,” she said, referring to House Democrats. “The Senate now has their opportunity to do that. And I think that what they’ve seen in Minneapolis will cause them to act.”

Thompson, of Napa, said cracks are emerging among Republicans who typically align with the Trump administration.

“We saw it with the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” he said. “We saw it with his nonsensical talks about Greenland. We saw it with the War Powers Act that came up and we’re seeing it now as well. Republicans better get on board or they’re going to end up on the wrong side of history.”

Democrats in Congress are pushing for the DHS spending bill to include stronger training for ICE agents and for agents to have to identify themselves, among other measures.

Republican leaders have blamed the recent unrest on sanctuary policies in states like Minnesota and California that limit cooperation between local and federal authorities.

Matsui and Thompson also called for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Thompson said recent killings involving federal agents in Minneapolis and Los Angeles show ICE has “gone rogue.”

“They’re led by someone who is completely incompetent,” he said. “Kristi Noem needs to go. She needs to quit, be fired or be impeached.”

But Giselle Garcia with the immigrant advocacy group NorCal Resist said she doesn’t expect Republicans to vote against additional funds for ICE.

“From our monitoring of the issue, I don’t think they’re there yet, despite the level of violence that we’re seeing across the board,” she said.

A NorCal Resist volunteer was hospitalized last Friday after being attacked outside of the downtown Sacramento federal building, where ICE operates. Another man was allegedly hit by a DHS vehicle, according to witnesses.

Yet, Garcia said the federal government’s continued denial about abuses happening across the country and in Sacramento is frustrating.

“Even with the images on the ground in Minneapolis, what we’ve seen in Chicago, LA and what’s happening here in our own city, people are still trying to deny fact,” she stressed.

Matsui has demanded transparency from DHS and called for an independent investigation into these incidents.

Scott Stauffer regularly protests near the parking lot entrance ICE agents typically use. He said he was shocked about the killing of intensive care nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend.

""ICE agents must not come to Italy because they are not aligned with our democratic way of ensuring security.""","Outrage has erupted in Italy after it emerged that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement unit would play a role in U.S. security for the Winter Olympics next month.

A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a part of ICE that focuses on transnational crime, would be involved in helping to ""vet and mitigate risks"" at the Milan Cortina Games starting a week from Friday.

It is not unusual for the division, which takes the lead in international human trafficking situations, to work on marquee events abroad. But its affiliation with ICE has sparked anger from some Italian politicians and media in light of the U.S. immigration crackdown and two fatal shootings by federal officers in Minnesota this month.

Milan's mayor described ICE as “a militia that kills,” saying it was not welcome in the host city.

“Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Tuesday. “At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations.”

She added, “All security operations remain under Italian authority.”

Homeland Security Investigations is an investigative arm of DHS, and though it technically falls under ICE, it focuses on investigating transnational crime and issues with global trade or financial systems.

Ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, Homeland Security Investigations said it was working with French officials “to secure” the Games “through the sharing of best practices.”

The U.S. Embassy in Italy said in a statement: “The State Department’s Diplomatic Security Service is leading the U.S. security effort at the Milano–Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. As in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative component.”

Some Italian officials had already reacted with fury.

""This is a militia that kills. It is a militia that enters people’s homes by signing its own permission — it is clear that they are not welcome in Milan,"" the city's mayor, Giuseppe Sala, told Italian radio RTL 102.5 on Tuesday.

""I wonder: Can we, for once, say no to Trump?"" Sala said, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump. ""ICE agents must not come to Italy because they are not aligned with our democratic way of ensuring security.""

Alessandro Zan, a lawmaker for Italy’s opposition Democratic Party, wrote Tuesday that it would be “paradoxical to entrust” Olympics security “to those who are themselves criminals, operating with violence and killing innocent people in cold blood,” referring to ICE.

“In Italy, we do not want those who trample on human rights and act outside of any democratic control. It is unacceptable to think that an agency of this kind could have any role whatsoever in our country,” he wrote on X.

Senators from the party formally requested clarification from the government and assurances that Italian and European Union privacy and cybersecurity standards were complied with.

The saga began Saturday when ICE's role was reported by the Italian newspaper Fatto Quotidiano, citing an anonymous source.

Later that day, Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi denied knowledge of this but did not rule it out.

""Every country delegation decides to protect their own athletes and staff in the way they want. I spoke with local officials and this is not what we heard,"" he told the ANSA news agency.

On Monday, Attilio Fontana, the president of the Lombardy region where the Games will be held, appeared to confirm it.

""ICE will only be here to watch over U.S. Vice President Vance and Secretary of State Rubio,"" he told ANSA, referring to JD Vance and Marco Rubio. ""So it will only be in a defensive measure. I am convinced that nothing will happen.""

But his office then said he did not have any specific information and was responding to a hypothetical question, according to Italian media.

John Fetterman’s Pittsburgh office during freezing temperatures Tuesday, calling for a “no” vote on funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Protesters held signs that read “abolish ICE” and “vote no on DHS funding” as speakers asked what happened to the senator they helped to elect. The group said Fetterman has failed to live up to his campaign promises of being a fighter for everyday people.

The assembly — organized by a coalition of groups including Indivisible Pittsburgh, Casa San Jose, and Center for Coalfield Justice — comes days after a second citizen was shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, and ahead of a vote in the U.S. Senate on a spending plan that would give ICE $10 billion for the fiscal year.

In a statement Monday, Fetterman said he “strongly disagrees” with ICE’s strategies in Minnesota. He followed that up with a Tuesday statement calling on Trump to fire Kristi Noem, who leads the Department of Homeland Security. Fetterman was one of seven Democrats to confirm her appointment to that office last year, but on Tuesday said she was “betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing [Trump’s] border security legacy.”

Fetterman has rejected calls to defund ICE, citing earlier promises to never vote for a government shutdown, which could result from the delay of the spending bill.

Monica Ruiz, executive director of Casa San Jose, told demonstrators that Fetterman’s words were disappointing.

“ If you think that you are immune to what is happening out in these streets, you're absolutely wrong. People are dying. Dying,” Ruiz said. “There is nothing else left. We are at our last lines of defense, and if you can't shut the government down for a couple days or a couple weeks or a couple months, then what do these lives mean to you?”

Barbara Herschlein of Penn Hills got choked up speaking about how important she feels it is to show up, and to make clear that people do not want to see more funding for ICE.

“ I just want to make a difference and do what's right and protect the people that are unable to be here, and the people that are really marginalized and not able to be protected,” Herschlein said.

Similar protests were slated to take place in other cities where Fetterman has offices. The protesters plan to gather in front of Fetterman’s office every day until the vote on the appropriations bill.

Pittsburgh City Council also called on Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senators to vote no on the DHS funding bill in a Will of Council passed Tuesday.

Reading from the resolution at the gathering, Councilmember Barb Warwick said “ nearly 1,000 Pittsburgh area residents have been taken into custody by ICE since January of 2025, more than triple the number of arrests in the previous year.”

The resolution said ICE is making communities “demonstrably less safe, putting residents in danger and increasing the workload on already overextended local law enforcement departments.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/974eb7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4080x2142+0+666/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcd%2F02%2F67e53bb24b73accaa3b55dba33f9%2Fpxl-20260127-165808276.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 11:22:08.350165

Immigration has been a centerpiece of the US president’s platform throughout more than a decade of political life, and was at the core of his 2024 election campaign.

But polls show public opinion has shifted amid the widely circulated operations carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and other federal agents in urban areas. Those operations have this month seen the shooting deaths of two US citizens in Minneapolis.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday local time, drawing responses from both before and after the killing of ICU nurse Alex Pretti, showed 53% of Americans disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, compared to 39% on the first day of his new term in January 2025. Approval on his immigration handling is at 39%, down from a high of 50% in February 2025.

Partisanship plays a role still — Republicans were, overall, supportive of ICE’s activities while more than 9 in 10 Democrats disapproved of the measures.

But nearly two thirds of voters who didn’t declare a party of support said ICE's actions had gone too far.

ICE has long been tasked with identifying and apprehending undocumented immigrants, but in Trump’s second term, the agency's activities have been met by protests, public accountability and monitoring campaigns, and heightened tensions on the streets.

It’s a coming together of several factors unprecedented in ICE’s operating history, said Kelsey Norman, director of the Women’s Rights, Human Rights, and Refugees Program at the Baker Institute for Public Policy in the US.

That includes the arrival of ICE officers in major cities, Donald Trump's personal target of one million deportations, a sharp increase of agency funding and officer recruitment, as well as the capturing of violent, and now lethal, conduct by the agency in the streets.

""A lot of these militarized practices have existed within immigration enforcement,"" Norman told DW, ""[It’s] just that they were being deployed in the border where they weren’t necessarily getting the kind of public attention that they are now.""

A challenge to America’s deeply held values

The deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti have thrown a global spotlight on ICE deployments in US cities. For everyday Americans, the operations highlight other potential risks — not just the potential for lethal force to be used against citizens.

Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a US-based libertarian think tank, said there is evidence that ICE's actions are infringing on civil protections under the US Constitution and Bill of Rights.

Olson told DW there have been apparent violations of Fourth Amendment ""search and seizure"" rights, where ICE has entered homes without judge-signed search warrants. Liberties guaranteed for citizens and non-citizens alike have also been violated, he said.

""We have seen multiple apparent violations of search and seizure rights, including breaking down homeowners' doors,"" Olson told DW. ""In other cases, more numerous, although less dramatic, the constitutional rules for when police can stop you on the street"" were violated.

Statements following Pretti’s death by prominent Trump administration officials and supporters have also drawn attention to the Second Amendment, which grants individuals the right to bear arms.

Pretti was a licenced gun owner in the state of Minnesota and authorized to carry a concealed weapon. None of the multiple bystander videos of his killing appear to show him drawing a firearm, yet key administration figures have remarked that Pretti should not have brought a weapon to a protest. This line of reasoning is receiving pushback within the Republican Party and other conservative movements, pointing to constitutional protections.

""Our Second Amendment has been very much treasured by the American conservative side of the spectrum for many decades,"" Olson said.

""The Trump administration... came out and said things like you should not be carrying a gun on the streets of the city, or you should not ever have a firearm at a demonstration, even if — and I'm going to cite the Minnesota situation — your state allows it, even if you have a license for concealed carry, even if you never use the gun or pull it out or brandish it.""

""This is a sharp, 180-degree turn from what the conservative position had been,"" Olson said.

He added that American citizens may also now be considering what these actions could signal for the future.

""For everyday Americans, the question I think they need to face is, if this can be done in this campaign against immigrants, where else can it be done when the campaign moves on to people who are considered subversive or 'un-American',"" Olson said.

Current actions unprecedented in democracies, including the US

ICE's mandate and role in immigration enforcement have evolved and shifted over its two-decade existence, but its conduct in Trump’s current term is unprecedented both within the US and other democracies, Norman told DW.

Often out of sight conducting border operations under previous administrations, including Trump’s first term, the shift to northern cities has pitched face-covered federal officers into highly populated areas where everyone has a camera phone and can monitor and document their activities.

That has enabled greater attention on Trump’s second-term approach to immigration policing and highlighted some of the more extreme tactics of its agents.

""The kind of tactics that ICE is deploying are things that you would see being carried out by police... in quite authoritarian countries,"" Norman said.

The use of force, including tear gas and pepper spray, against bystanders and grassroots accountability movements has also captured the attention of international policing bodies, including the International Association of Chiefs of Police.

It published a statement calling on the White House to bring law enforcement officials at all levels together to ""support calm, lawful engagement and policies grounded in proven practice. ""

Observers have previously raised concerns that a massive recruitment drive means that many ICE officers are operating with insufficient training.

The current tension could change public views on the quality and professionalism of almost 18,000 law enforcement agencies around the US, said Kathy O’Toole, a partner at 21CP Solutions, a consultancy born out of an Obama-era review into US policing.

O’Toole, herself a former chief of police in Boston and Seattle, said local police would likely have to deal with the fallout of the current ICE controversies.

""In several of the major cities now, there's so much tension between federal and local law enforcement that it serves nobody's purpose,"" O’Toole told DW.

""If there's a tragedy in a community at the hands of law enforcement, people don't necessarily differentiate between federal law enforcement and state or local,"" she said. ""If you look at what's happening in Minneapolis and some of these other major cities right now with all the demonstrations, it's the local police who have to deal with the fallout.""

Guy HedgecoeMadrid correspondent

The Spanish government has announced a plan to legalise the status of undocumented migrants, a measure expected to benefit at least half a million people.

Regularisation will be available to foreign nationals who do not have a criminal record and can prove they lived in Spain for at least five months prior to 31 December 2025.

""This is an historic day for our country,"" said Elma Saiz, Spain's minister of inclusion, social security and migration.

The measure will provide beneficiaries with an initial one-year residence permit, which can then be extended. Requests for legalisation are expected to begin in April and the process will remain open until the end of June.

""We are reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, integration, co-existence and which is compatible with economic growth and social cohesion,"" Saiz said.

Spain has seen a large influx of migrants in recent years, mainly from Latin America.

The conservative think-tank Funcas found that the number of undocumented migrants in Spain had risen from 107,409 in 2017 to 837,938 in 2025 - an eight-fold increase.

The highest number of undocumented arrivals currently living in Spain are believed to be from Colombia, Peru and Honduras.

Spain's socialist-led coalition government has been an outlier on this issue among the larger European nations, underlining the importance of migrants for the economy.

The country has been outperforming the other main EU economies in recent years, posting expected growth of close to 3% in 2025.

Unemployment, a longstanding weakness of the Spanish economy, has dipped below 10% for the first time since 2008, according to figures released on Tuesday.

Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has described immigrants as representing ""wealth, development and prosperity"" for Spain, pointing to their contribution to the social security system.

The government and parties on the left have also emphasised the need to treat migrants in a humane way.

""Providing rights is the answer to racism,"" said Irene Montero, of the far-left Podemos party and a former minister in a coalition government with the Socialists.

She has campaigned for this measure, which followed an agreement between the party and the government. A civic legislative proposal, calling for a mass migrant regularisation, received the support of around 700,000 people but had been languishing in parliament.

This measure will be approved by royal decree, meaning it does not require parliamentary approval.

It is the first large-scale migrant regularisation in Spain for two decades.

Several such initiatives, by governments of both the Socialists and the conservative People's Party (PP), legalised the status of an estimated half a million migrants between 1986 and 2005.

However, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, leader of the PP, said the latest mass legalisation would ""increase the pull effect and overwhelm our public services"".

Pepa Millán, spokeswoman for the far-right Vox, said the initiative ""attacks our identity"", adding that the party would appeal before the Supreme Court in a bid to block it.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c743/live/4120f660-fb9a-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 01:58:31.639978

“ICE and CBP must be overhauled from top to bottom,” DeLauro said.","WASHINGTON — At protests nationwide, a common demand adorns T-shirts, ball caps and posters: “DEFUND ICE.”

Cardinal Joseph Tobin of Newark, a ranking Catholic prelate in the city home to one of the largest immigrant detention centers, echoed that call Monday in an interfaith service and urged people to push Congress to block funding for the Trump administration’s anti-immigration agenda.

“Will you contact your congressional representatives, the senators and representatives from your district?” Tobin asked, denouncing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. “Will you ask them, for the love of God and the love of human beings, which can’t be separated, to vote against renewing funding for such a lawless organization?”

From the streets, the pulpit or beyond, that cry to defund ICE, the arm of the Trump administration whose agents have rounded up immigrants and American citizens alike as part of an anti-immigration dragnet that has become a hallmark of Donald Trump’s second term, is all but impossible to achieve.

Congress this week is debating a bundle of appropriations bills to fund the U.S. government, and Democrats are using their leverage in the Senate, where Republicans will need some Democratic votes to pass the appropriations legislation, to strip funding from ICE and put legislative restraints on the agency.

Their message to Republicans and the White House: Cut funding for the agency and rein it in with new legal standards, and we’ll vote for the spending package. Don’t and we won’t.

“Funding DHS is funding the killings of Americans through this Administration’s recklessness and extreme agenda,” Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) said in a statement Sunday.

But even if Democrats persuade the Republican-majority Congress with this argument, the two agencies tasked with the boots-on-the-ground deportation efforts — ICE and Customs and Border Protection — have cash reserves guaranteed until 2029, when Trump’s second term will end, thanks to a bill enshrined into law last year.

While most of the debate on that massive legislative package centered around its tax provisions and spending cuts to public health and food programs, it also included $178 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has drawn less attention than ICE but also has agents deployed on U.S. streets.

“President Trump’s signing the One Big Beautiful Bill is a win for law and order and the safety and security of the American people,” Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement last summer, trumpeting the new law and using its partisan name.

That $178 billion total is the largest single injection of cash DHS has received in its history, and that money is outside of the regular appropriations process, an annual cycle on Capitol Hill that provides additional money.

“Congressional Republicans gave Trump a slush fund for ICE and CBP in the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, said in a statement Sunday. “Tens of billions of dollars that is still usable even during a shutdown.”

The Trump administration has defended its anti-immigration sweeps and arrests as justified and called protests “domestic terrorists.”

The spending bill that passed the House and is pending in the Senate would keep ICE funding flat with its current budget level at $10 billion.

The legislation also contains language binding the administration to publish detailed information every month, including location, detentions and removals of U.S. citizens, lawful residents and former military veterans.

Democrats will focus on homeland security funding during the present spending talks, Rep. Herb Conaway (D-3rd) said in an interview last week.

“That’s going to be a standalone issue,” he said. “We are going to take a very strong position on bringing protections to the American people.”

The Trump administration has tried to erect barriers to restrict congressional oversight of its immigration agenda, in particular of ICE facility visits.

After this weekend’s lethal shooting of a Minnesota resident witnessing ICE’s presence in the state, Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, an influential Democrat who is her party’s top member on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, called for DHS to be reformed.

“ICE and CBP must be overhauled from top to bottom,” DeLauro said. “Many of these agents lack proper training, cannot be held accountable, and have behaved lawlessly. They have beaten, harassed, and escalated confrontations with peaceful demonstrators and innocent bystanders too many times to count.”

If they win control of the next Congress, Democrats could push to rescind funding for ICE or DHS using the same process Republicans did last year to cut funding for public media and overseas aid programs.

On Tuesday, Hakeem Jeffries, the top-ranking Democrat in the House, endorsed bringing impeachment articles against Noem, saying the country is “disgusted by what the Department of Homeland Security has done.”

California had a net population loss of 9,500 people in 2025, a stark change from the previous year, when it gained 232,000 residents, even though roughly the same number of Californians already living in the state moved out in both years. The difference was immigration since the number of net immigrants who moved into the state dropped from 361,000 people in 2024 to 109,000 in 2025.

Florida had year-to-year drops in both immigrants and people moving in from other states. The Sunshine State, which has become more expensive in recent years from surging property values and higher home insurance costs, had only 22,000 domestic migrants in 2025, compared with 64,000 people in 2024, and the net number of immigrants dropped from more than 411,000 people to 178,000 people.

New York added only 1,008 people in 2025, mostly because the state's net migration from immigrants dropped from 207,000 people to 95,600 people.

Tuesday's data release comes as researchers have been trying to determine the effects of the second Trump administration's immigration crackdown after the Republican president returned to the White House in January 2025. Trump made a surge of migrants at the southern border a central issue in his winning 2024 presidential campaign.

The numbers made public Tuesday reflect change from July 2024 to July 2025, covering the end of President Joe Biden's Democratic administration and the first half of Trump's first year back in office.

The figures capture a period that reflects the beginning of enforcement surges in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, but do not capture the impact on immigration after the Trump administration's crackdowns began in Chicago; New Orleans; Memphis, Tennessee; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The 2025 numbers were a jarring divergence from 2024, when net international migration accounted for 84% of the nation's 3.3 million-person increase from the year before. The jump in immigration two years ago was partly because of a new method of counting that added people who were admitted for humanitarian reasons.

""They do reflect recent trends we have seen in out-migration, where the numbers of people coming in is down and the numbers going out is up,"" Eric Jensen, a senior research scientist at the Census Bureau, said last week.

Unlike the once-a-decade census, which determines how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets, as well as the distribution of $2.8 trillion in annual government funding, the population estimates are calculated from government records and internal Census Bureau data.

The release of the 2025 population estimates was delayed by the federal government shutdown last fall and comes at a challenging time for the Census Bureau and other U.S. statistical agencies. The bureau, which is the largest statistical agency in the U.S., lost about 15% of its workforce last year due to buyouts and layoffs that were part of cost-cutting efforts by the White House and its Department of Government Efficiency.

Other recent actions by the Trump administration, such as the firing of Erika McEntarfer as Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, have raised concerns about political meddling at U.S. statistical agencies. But Brookings demographer William Frey said the bureau's staffers appear to have been ""doing this work as usual without interference.""

More than 100 people crammed into the hotel, a Hilton Garden Inn on Sixth Avenue near Canal Street, at about 6 p.m., condemning the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency with chants and anti-ICE slogans on their black T-shirts.

The protesters also directed their ire at Hilton for, they claimed, providing lodging to ICE agents. A hotel worker checking in guests, and guests themselves, seemed confused by the protest. It could not immediately be determined whether ICE agents were staying at the hotel.

The Manhattan protest followed a similar action on Sunday in Minneapolis, where the killings by federal agents of Renee Good and Alex Pretti this month have further inflamed residents angry about the crackdown and the methods employed to enforce it.

The Minneapolis protest, which began as a peaceful, if noisy, demonstration outside a Home2Suites by Hilton hotel, grew heated after some people in the crowd began to vandalize the building and federal agents responded with tear gas.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, declined to respond to a request for comment about protesters’ targeting of hotels where they believe ICE agents are staying. Hilton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mayor Zohran Mamdani, through a spokesman, praised the protesters for exercising their rights and the police for their response, and he said he was glad the demonstration had ended peacefully.

The spokesman, Sam Raskin, said in a statement that Mr. Mamdani believes “ICE is a rogue agency that has repeatedly carried out cruel, inhumane and lawless raids and arrests of American citizens.”

The Rev. Micah Bucey, the senior minister at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, was among those who stayed put. He said he was unfazed by the prospect of being arrested.

“I know that my God is telling me that I have to be here,” he said. “I am in solidarity with all of the people in Minneapolis. All of the people in Chicago, all of the people across the country, especially with my immigrant neighbors.”

Some of the protesters who left the lobby lingered in the cold outside, where they were joined by others who had walked over from a separate anti-ICE rally outside a federal building in Foley Square.

At about 7:30 p.m., officers with the Police Department’s Strategic Response Group began to make arrests, lifting protesters off the lobby floor, binding their hands with zip ties and escorting them through a back door to a waiting bus.

By 8 p.m., the lobby had been cleared, and some stray protesters outside the hotel continued to chant “Stop helping ICE” against the steady beat of a drum and the sound of bagpipes. Others had walked up Sixth Avenue to Washington Square Park, where the crowd dispersed.

The police said there had been “multiple” arrests but that neither a specific number nor the charges faced by those who had been arrested were immediately available.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27met-ice-protest01-photo-gqpt/27met-ice-protest01-photo-gqpt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 01:58:35.938148

Officers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle, according to a notification to Congress obtained by The Associated Press. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, “He’s got a gun!” multiple times, the official said.

A Border Patrol officer and a CBP officer each fired Glock pistols, the notice said.

Investigators from CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the analysis based on a review of body-worn camera footage and agency documentation, the notice said. The law requires the agency to inform relevant congressional committees about deaths in CBP custody within 72 hours.

The notification came a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following Pretti's death, which was the second fatal shooting this month of a person at the hands of immigration law enforcement.

Ecuador’s minister of foreign affairs, meanwhile, filed a protest with the U.S. Embassy after Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents tried to enter the Ecuadorian consulate in Minneapolis without permission Tuesday.

A video of the attempt on social media shows a consulate staffer running to the door to turn the ICE agents away, telling them, “This is the Ecuadorian consulate. You’re not allowed to enter.” One ICE officer can be heard responding by threatening to “grab” the staffer if he touched the agent before agreeing to leave.

International law generally prohibits law enforcement authorities from entering foreign consulates or embassies without permission, though sometimes permission may be assumed granted for life-threatening emergencies, like fires.

“Consulate officials immediately prevented the ICE officer from entering the consular building, thus ensuring the protection of the Ecuadorians who were present at the time and activating the emergency protocols issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Human Mobility,” the ministry wrote on X.

A “note of protest” was filed with the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador so that similar attempts aren’t made at other consulates, the ministry said. The State Department, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump says a ‘big investigation’ is underway in Pretti’s killing

By sending Homan to Minnesota, “we’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” Trump said during an interview on Fox News’ “Will Cain Show.” That’s significant since White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when questioned repeatedly Monday about Homan’s being dispatched to Minnesota, refused to say that doing so was an effort to calm the situation.

The president added of Homan, “Tom, as tough as he is, gets along” with governors and mayors, even in Democratic areas.

As he left the White House Tuesday, the president was asked whether Alex Pretti’s killing on Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a “big investigation” was underway. In the hours after Pretti’s death, some administration officials sought to blame the shooting on the 37-year-old intensive care nurse.

Trump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.

The seemingly softer tone emerged as immigration agents were still active across the Twin Cities region, and it was unclear if officials had changed tactics following the shift by the White House.

Walz’s office said Tuesday that the Democratic governor met with Homan and called for impartial investigations into the shootings involving federal officers. They agreed on the need to continue to talk, according to the governor.

Frey and Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said they also met with Homan and had a “productive conversation.” The mayor added that city leaders would stay in discussion with the border czar.

Homan posted on social media that the discussions “were a productive starting point.” Homan said that Walz, Frey, top law enforcement officials and he all agree that “we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets.”

The White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of immigration raids. But after Pretti's killing and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Trump says of sending Bovino to Minneapolis: ‘maybe it wasn’t good here.’

Trump said Bovino, the go-to architect for the president’s large-scale city-by-city immigration crackdowns, was “very good” but added “he’s a pretty out-there kind of a guy” and “maybe it wasn’t good here.”

Immigration enforcement activity witnessed by journalists in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs on Tuesday appeared comparable with recent weeks. As before, most didn’t result in major confrontations with agents. Activists say they continue to monitor enforcement operations through social media and chats on messaging apps.

In Texas, a federal judge issued a temporary order prohibiting the removal of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy and his father who were detained last week in Minnesota in an incident that further inflamed divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. U.S. Judge Fred Biery ruled Monday that any removal or transfer of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, is on hold while a court case proceeds.

On Tuesday, federal immigration authorities released an Ecuadorian man whose detention led the chief federal judge in Minnesota to order the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in his courtroom, the man's attorney said.

Attorney Graham Ojala-Barbour said the man, who is identified in court documents as “Juan T.R.,” was released in Texas. The lawyer said in an email to The Associated Press that he was notified in an email from the U.S. attorneys office in Minneapolis that his client had been freed.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz expressed frustration with the Trump administration’s handling of Juan’s and other immigration cases. He took the extraordinary step of ordering Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, to personally appear in his courtroom Friday.

Schiltz had said in his order that he would cancel Lyons’ appearance if the man was released from custody.

“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” he wrote.

Schiltz's order followed a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to halt the immigration enforcement surge. The judge in that case said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.

Schiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” he said.

The Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

A federal judge has temporarily blocked the removal of a five‑year‑old Ecuadorian boy and his father, whose arrest in Minnesota has intensified debate over US immigration enforcement.

Judge Fred Biery ordered that the boy and his father cannot be transferred or deported while their case moves forward.

The pair are being held at a family detention center in Dilley, Texas.

Their arrest drew outrage after neighbors and school officials claimed federal agents used the child to lure his mother to the door, a description Homeland Security calls “an abject lie.” The agency says the father fled and left the boy in a running vehicle.

Federal officials say the father was in the country illegally, while the family’s attorney maintains he had a pending asylum claim.

Tensions likely to wind down with Homan in Minnesota, Obama-era border official tells DW

Former US Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske welcomed deployment of Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, to Minnesota. Homan was sent to take charge of the Minnesota immigration crackdown from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

""I worked with Tom for the years that I was at Customs and Border Protection,"" said Kerlikowske. ""He understands the system.""

The former commissioner said it was highly unusual for federal agents to block local authorities from a deadly force investigation, as reportedly happened in the case of Alex Pretti. Kerlikowske also said he now hoped for more communication between federal and state investigators.

Homan's role in Minneapolis, Kerlikowske said, should include meetings with the city's police chief, as well as state investigators and political leaders, which could help de-escalate tensions locally.

""I think Tom will be open to meeting with the Minneapolis police chief, who has an excellent reputation not only in Minneapolis, but across the country as the head of a large city police department. I think he'll meet with state investigative agents, and he'll meet with some political officials,"" said Kerlikowske.

""I think there will be a significant winding down and turning down of the temperature by the officials that are still in Minneapolis.""

Border czar Tom Homan arrives in Minnesota amid reset

President Donald Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has arrived in Minnesota to take charge of federal immigration operations.

The Trump administration appears to be seeking a reset to its approach after national backlash over fatal shootings by federal agents.

Homan is replacing Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino in leading Operation Metro Surge, the broad immigration enforcement effort in Minneapolis and surrounding areas, a senior administration official confirmed.

After arriving in the state, Homan met Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat who ran for US vice president in 2024.

""Governor Walz met with Tom Homan this morning and reiterated Minnesota's priorities: impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, a swift, significant reduction in the number of federal forces in Minnesota, and an end to the campaign of retribution against Minnesota,"" the governor's office announced.

""The Governor and Homan agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday,"" the statement said.

Multiple GOP aides said the message frustrated lawmakers who felt DHS had once again gotten ahead of the facts.","After lockstep unity on immigration for the first year of Trump 2.0, a growing number of Republican lawmakers are calling for investigations and testimony from top Trump officials after the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti.

Why it matters: The dam is breaking, with Republicans more directly questioning the administration — including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem — for its handling of the tragedy in Minnesota.

""I disagree with Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,"" Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) posted on X on Monday.

Driving the news: Noem is expected to testify for an oversight hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 3, Chair Chuck Grassley's (R-Iowa) office confirmed.

The GOP chairs of Homeland Security committees in both chambers have also called on top DHS officials to testify in upcoming hearings.

""Today, I call on the heads of ICE, CBP, and USCIS to testify before the Homeland Security Committee,"" Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) posted Monday afternoon, along with screenshots of his requests.

What they're saying: ""I am deeply troubled by the shootings in Minneapolis involving federal agents,"" Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) posted on Monday.

""Our Constitution provides citizens protection from the government. We have a right to free speech, to peaceably assemble and to bear arms,"" Moran continued.

""I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy, and to say, we don't want anyone's lives to be lost,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) told reporters.

""I support a full and transparent investigation into the tragic event in Minneapolis,"" Sen. Todd. Young (R-Ind.) said in a statement. ""Congress has requested testimony from ICE, CBP, and USCIS leaders in an open hearing, and they should testify soon.""

This builds on other GOP statements from over the weekend — such as from Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Reps. Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.), Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Michael McCaul (R-Texas).

What we're hearing: Many congressional Republicans have been quietly frustrated by the administration's hasty public response to the shooting, aides tell Axios.

In an email sent to congressional Republicans on Saturday, obtained by Axios, the DHS communications director wrote that there was an ""incident between US Border Patrol officers and an illegal alien with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun,"" referring to the killing of Pretti.

Multiple GOP aides said the message frustrated lawmakers who felt DHS had once again gotten ahead of the facts.

What to watch: President Trump's softened tone and decision to dispatch White House Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota on Monday was welcomed by Republican lawmakers. More than a dozen of them publicly celebrated the move.

ICE ""duties must be exercised in a way that maintains and restores public trust. Tom Homan's deployment to Minnesota is a good move,"" Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) posted.

""Minnesotans deserve a state where the rule of law is respected. I welcome Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee these critical operations. His 'tough but fair' leadership is exactly what is needed to address the rising chaos,"" Rep. Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.) posted on X.

One GOP aide told Axios the positive reinforcement of Homan amounts to a subtle rebuke of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's handling of the situation.

The other side: ""There is only one page: the President's page. Everyone's on the same page,"" a senior DHS official told Axios.

""Secretary Noem is focused on restoring law and order and executing on the President's agenda for mass deportations—not publicity,"" the official continued.

In a post on X, Noem called Homan a ""major asset to our team,"" adding that Homan's deployment is a ""good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis.""

Zoom out: Despite the growing GOP concerns, there is very little appetite for allowing the Minnesota backlash to derail funding the federal government this week — despite Democrats' insistence that DHS funding be stripped.

""The tragic death of Alex Pretti has refocused attention on the Homeland Security bill, and I recognize that and share the concerns,"" Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said on the Senate floor.

The bottom line: Collins urged senators to recognize ""the vast majority of the funding in this bill, more than 80%, is for non-immigration and non-border security functions.""

""I urge my colleagues to recognize the vital role DHS plays across our country and the many agencies they oversee such as FEMA, the Coast Guard, TSA, Secret Service, and more,"" Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.), who chairs the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, said in a statement.

While she expressed support for an investigation, she warned against a shutdown. ""As we approach a government funding deadline, I remain committed to finding a pathway forward,"" she wrote.

They “should never be elected to office again,” Trump announced — with Collins the only in-cycle Republican among those targeted.
Collins also voted against the Trump-backed “Big, Beautiful Bill” last year and a separate $9 billion funding clawback pushed by the White House.
But her well-documented willingness to break from her party has done little to stop Democrats back home from linking her to Trump’s immigration enforcement policies.","Collins, who said earlier this month she didn’t “see the rationale for a large number of ICE agents” in Maine, spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Monday, later telling reporters Tuesday she urged Noem to pause “this surge of enforcement” in Minnesota and Maine “until we can get far better focus.”

On Capitol Hill, she’s part of a group of senators who are trying to defuse the shutdown fight, including by exploring actions President Donald Trump could have his agencies take without needing to strip DHS funding out of the pending spending package as Democrats are demanding.

“We are having conversations with all the parties,” Collins said in an interview Tuesday, referring to the White House and Democrats.

As to whether or not a shutdown is inevitable, she separately told reporters “it depends on whether people look at the consequences.”

She pointed to Trump’s decision to send border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis as a sign that the administration is willing to make policy changes in the wake of Saturday’s shooting. But just sending in Homan won’t be enough to appease Democrats.

Republicans, including Collins, are loath to do that because any changes to the six-bill package would virtually guarantee a partial shutdown starting 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The House would need to approve any changes to the package, and the chamber is in recess until Monday.

Republican leaders are also wary of an internal backlash to any revised bill, with the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus warning Monday that they would oppose any measure that did not include money for DHS.

Democrats say the deployment of DHS agents in Collins’ home state is justification enough for pulling apart the funding package she’s trying to salvage this week.

“All you have to do is look at what’s happening in Minnesota, look at what’s happening in Maine,” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a senior Democratic appropriator, told reporters. “And I think that this is why everyone’s got to vote to rein in Trump’s ICE operation.”

Collins acknowledged on the Senate floor Monday that the killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota Saturday refocused attention on Homeland Security funding and whether more guardrails are needed for the immigration agencies under its purview.

“I recognize that and share the concerns,” she said.

But she noted that the funding package includes “many safeguards” on DHS funding and that the majority of the department’s budget covers work unrelated to immigration enforcement, including TSA, the Coast Guard and FEMA.

The political backdrop could hardly be more fraught for Collins. She was already dealing with a complicated relationship with Trump, with the president attacking her and several other GOP senators just this month for supporting an effort to rein in military action in Venezuela. They “should never be elected to office again,” Trump announced — with Collins the only in-cycle Republican among those targeted.

Collins also voted against the Trump-backed “Big, Beautiful Bill” last year and a separate $9 billion funding clawback pushed by the White House. Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other GOP colleagues have publicly defended Collins as essential to keeping the Maine seat in Republican hands.

But her well-documented willingness to break from her party has done little to stop Democrats back home from linking her to Trump’s immigration enforcement policies. The Maine Democratic Party accused Collins of “choosing Donald Trump over the people of Maine” and “leading the charge to pass more funding for ICE.”

One of her aspiring Democratic challengers, Gov. Janet Mills, leaned into the immigration fight during her State of the State speech Tuesday night — the latest indication of how it is potentially reorienting midterm politics.

“Tonight, I say to the people of Maine: We will not be intimidated. We will not be silenced,” Mills said.

Back in Washington, Collins is speaking with Democrats on the Appropriations Committee and members of the Trump administration, as well as fellow Republicans including Thune and Sen. Katie Britt, the top Homeland Security appropriator.

Whether Collins can hold the funding package together and avoid a partial shutdown, most Hill Republicans believe, will ultimately come down to what Trump and congressional Democrats can agree to.

Thune cited “good conversations” involving Collins and Britt, before adding: “The other thing too is making sure that they’re engaged in the White House.”

Democrats believe Republicans are open to immigration enforcement changes — and are speaking out about Saturday’s shooting — in large part because of the potential electoral ramifications coming in November.

Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, another Democratic appropriator, said Republicans are only concerned about the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions “in the context of elections right now.”

“So they talk about Maine — there’s a reason that there’s extra attention to Maine,” Merkley said in an interview. “I’d like to see some actual principles exhorted by the Republican leadership in both houses — to stand up.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffc%2F66%2Fb90a782b4c13ad7fd81507163c69%2F2026-0127-congress-francis-44-2-50610.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 22:58:33.817012

On Saturday, Jan. 24 — as we continued to mourn the death of Minnesotan resident Renee Good — masked immigration enforcement agents murdered another American in Minneapolis: Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who worked for the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System.

For nearly a year, Congress rubberstamped the cruelty of a lawless mob of masked agents and turned Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection into a private army that serves the president’s worst authoritarian impulses. Thanks to Congress, ICE not only has a budget that is larger than all other federal law enforcement agencies combined, but also larger than 90 percent of the world’s militaries.

With the recent murders in Minneapolis, however, we have a rare opportunity to press for meaningful change. The Senate has reconsidered plans to continue funding ICE, and an increasing number of legislators who previously defended the agency are now calling for its investigation and reform.

Minnesotans also want federal agents out, and President Trump appears to be feeling the pressure: on Monday, he reportedly removed CBP Chief Greg Bovino — architect of the administration’s brutal enforcement tactics — from the state.

Here’s what you can do to prevent another tragedy in Minneapolis and other cities:

Demand that Congress rejects the Department of Homeland Security spending bill until accountability and reform measures are in place. This also means taking back the billions of taxpayer funds Congress stole from Americans’ health care and gave to ICE in the so-called One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.

We’re past the point of half-measures, and we’re way past the point of symbolic votes. That’s why NILC president Kica Matos sent Congress a letter articulating a clear set of reforms designed to stop DHS’s campaign of terror and hold it accountable when it violates the law.

Push state and local authorities to investigate federal agents responsible for committing crimes, including murder. The families of Renee Good and Alex Pretti — as well as Silverio Villegas González, Isaias Sanchez Barboza, Keith Porter, and others killed by federal agents — deserve justice. To avoid accountability, the Trump administration is trying to silence and intimidate the state and local officials who are investigating these murders. We need to make clear that if the Trump administration won’t protect Minnesotans, state and local officials must.

Sue the Trump administration to block and restrict unlawful policies that are harming people. If you or an organization you work with is harmed by the Trump administration’s policies, you may be able to protect others by suing to have the entire policy declared unlawful in court. For example, NILC’s legal team is currently preparing to challenge the domestic deployment of the military under the Insurrection Act. If you are aware of potentially unlawful authoritarian actions by federal agents, please reach out to us at DemocracyDefense@nilc.org.

Organize, mobilize, and resist. Minneapolis is showing us how it’s done:

The day before Alex Pretti was murdered, nearly 1 in 5 Minneapolis residents (75,000 people) took to the streets in sub-zero temperatures to demand justice.

Over 700 businesses participated in the ICE out of Minnesota Coalition’s “blackout” solidarity action. Local organizers are boycotting corporations that support, enable, or benefit from the administration’s authoritarian crackdown. They are also demanding that businesses refuse to work with ICE and deny immigration enforcement requests to enter without a warrant.

You can see the full list of demands as well as upcoming actions on the ICE out of Minnesota action page.

Support organizations on the ground. Community-based organizations, rapid response networks, and mutual aid groups in Minnesota are working around the clock to serve communities under siege, secure accountability for the murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and advocate for reforms to prevent future tragedies like this. Here’s how you can support them:

Donate. Here’s a curated list of Minnesota-based organizations you can donate to. If you’d like a recommendation, consider supporting Unidos MN, a NILC partner in Minnesota that organizes with immigrant communities, and advocates for and provides services to all Minnesotans.

Stay informed and know your rights, including when filming ICE, no matter what your immigration status is.

Volunteer. You can offer direct support to people and families targeted by ICE. Contact your local mutual aid group to find out how to provide rides, groceries, childcare, and other assistance.

Join a rapid response network. These networks provide on-the-ground support to people and families targeted by ICE. They can train you to lawfully observe, de-escalate, and uphold the rights of community members who are experiencing unlawful or abusive behavior by immigration enforcement agents.

In addition to the direct actions you can take to support Minnesotans and prevent similar atrocities across the country, you can advocate for new laws at the state and local levels to fortify communities against the federal government’s unlawful and abusive actions.

Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, which each saw roughly 70% of emergency docket orders lifting rulings that stemmed from their courts.","The Supreme Court is siding overwhelmingly with President Donald Trump when challenges arrive via the emergency docket, a Bloomberg Law analysis found.

The conservative-led high court has ruled in Trump’s favor in challenges to his second term policies more than 75% of the time in the last year, when considering matters before they’ve been fully briefed and argued before the justices.

Trump has taken an expansive view of executive power during his second term, issuing orders upending immigration enforcement, higher education and the federal workforce.

The justices’ interim orders, greenlighting Trump policies for months or longer while cases are fully considered, may prove irreversible for immigrants facing deportation or terminated federal workers—even if the high court eventually rules differently on the merits.

“They may describe these decisions as temporary. But for many people, and in some instances for everybody, this is it,” said Carolyn Shapiro, the founder and co-director of Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States. “There is no more.”

Trump has spent his first year back in office fighting off hundreds of legal challenges to his efforts to reshape executive power, many of which didn’t reach the high court, while railing against so-called “rogue” and “liberal” judges who have ruled against him.

The high court’s interim docket orders in those cases, issued during the 12 months following Trump’s second inauguration, tended to favor the administration regardless of the circuit where the case was initially heard, the analysis shows.

The justices have given his administration the green light to move forward with firing of certain federal workers, banning transgender people from serving in the military, and rescinding humanitarian immigration protections.

Four of the high court’s emergency docket orders in those cases were losses for the administration, while three others were mixed. Those losses included the Supreme Court’s orders preventing the administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants from Texas under a wartime authority, and deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

“There is definitely a sense in which this court, being conservative, is agreeing with this administration quite a lot and certainly more than many people, especially on the left, would like,” said Richard Re, a Harvard Law School professor who studies federal courts.

However, the data can also create an “exaggerated impression of what’s happening,” he said, since the administration’s lawyers are incentivized to ask the high court to weigh in only in cases they think they’ll win.

The Supreme Court’s emergency, or interim, docket contains decisions by the justices following emergency requests stemming from ongoing litigation in the lower courts.

It is sometimes referred to by critics as the “shadow docket” for its lack of transparency, as the high court’s majority usually doesn’t include their reasoning when handing down those orders. The justices may ultimately rule on a given issue on the merits down the road, and the interim order determines the status quo until then.

The docket has grown in recent years, drawing concerns from both liberal and conservative justices that it forces quick decisions without the full briefing that lower courts received.

Most high court emergency docket orders in cases challenging Trump administration policies stem from cases filed in appeals courts seen as more liberal. That’s in part due to challengers choosing to file lawsuits in courts they believe will be more favorable to their cause. The US solicitor general’s office can also choose which cases to raise to the Supreme Court.

Winning Record

Bloomberg Law reviewed 55 emergency docket orders between Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 and January 2026. Twenty-seven were in cases related to the administration, of which the justices issued interim decisions favorable to Trump in 21 orders, or roughly 78%.

The analysis doesn’t include death penalty or extradition cases, pro se filings, or state court appeals.

The analysis also excludes cases where the justices delayed deciding on a request for relief, such as in challenges to Trump’s efforts to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve and US Copyright Office director Shira Perlmutter. Re argued these delayed applications represent “a form of defeat for the administration,” since they left the lower court rulings against the administration in place.

While the orders aren’t always clear on how each justice ruled on the Trump administration’s request, the court’s liberal members have regularly issued dissents, sometimes referencing the apparent acquiescence to the government’s requests.

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor have penned some of the sharpest criticism in those dissenting opinions.

William Eskridge, a professor at Yale Law School, said that while the Supreme Court may be less divided along partisan lines for non-political cases, the Trump administration’s legal fights have exposed differences among the justices on ideological grounds.

“The cases that people are interested in and publicized, you are going to see that split,” Eskridge said. “And part of it is because the Trump administration is taking not just a partisan position, but a hyper-partisan position.”

The Biden administration made far fewer emergency requests to the Supreme Court during its first year.

The high court in 2021 and 2022 refused to halt a Texas trial court judge’s order reinstating the “Remain in Mexico” program and blocked an OSHA Covid-19 vaccine mandate. The justices came down on the administration’s side in choosing to not block an expiring eviction moratorium and upholding a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers at federally funded facilities.

Circuit Breakdown

During the first year of Trump’s second term, the Supreme Court was more likely to grant requests for relief from lower court rulings in challenges to the administration’s policies than it was in cases unrelated to the administration.

The justice granted requests for relief, at least partially, in 24 out of its 27 Trump-related orders. Most were wins or mixed rulings favoring Trump. But the high court let the underlying court rulings stand in all but three of the 28 orders unrelated to the administration that reached the emergency docket.

The federal appeals court that saw its decisions lifted most often by the justices when they reached the emergency docket, including Trump and non-Trump cases, was the Boston-based US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the data shows.

The justices granted requests for relief from lower court rulings in nearly 90% of the court’s emergency docket orders in the past year that originated from within that circuit, which covers trial courts in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico, the analysis shows.

Next are the US Courts of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, which each saw roughly 70% of emergency docket orders lifting rulings that stemmed from their courts. The high court granted relief in about 57% of its orders in cases out of the Richmond-based US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, according to the analysis.

The grant rates may be explained by the high volume of Trump administration challenges filed in those courts, legal scholars said. The First Circuit, for example, had two non-Trump cases reach the interim docket this past year, and the Supreme Court granted relief in one of them. The Supreme Court considered on its interim docket just one non-Trump related case out of the DC Circuit, and it let the lower court ruling stand.

The First Circuit has emerged as a magnet for lawsuits contesting executive actions, despite having the smallest bench of the circuits.

All of its six active circuit judges were Democratic appointees until November 2025, when Trump appointee Joshua Dunlap was confirmed.

The justices issued emergency docket decisions in nine cases originating from the First Circuit, the second most represented circuit at the interim docket nationally. The court with the most cases decided on the high court was the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit, the nation’s largest appeals court, with 10 orders.

The DC Circuit, sometimes the mandated forum for challenges to federal government actions, is also considered a more liberal court. Seven of its active members are Democratic appointees, compared to four Republican appointees, three of whom were nominated by Trump.

The DC Circuit’s Trump appointees have often lined up with the Supreme Court’s conservative members in saying they would allow the administration’s policies to move forward.

There were four DC Circuit cases on administration actions that had Trump appointees on the panel and were taken up to the high court. In each of those cases, those conservative appellate judges said they would rule in the government’s favor.

Bloomberg Law’s analysis includes interim docket orders issued from Jan. 20, 2025, through Jan. 20, 2026. It doesn’t include death penalty cases, extradition cases, pro se filings, or appeals from state court. Orders were gathered from the Supreme Court’s website and email notifications. Orders in cases classified as administration challenges are those contesting actions by the current administration. They do not include individual challenges against the federal government that are unrelated to administration actions, such as criminal or individual deportation cases. The analysis includes final orders on emergency relief requests, and it doesn’t include deferred decisions or short-term administrative stay orders.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/0f7de17/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbd%2F88%2F1cf6f8e74afe831745b83a02306b%2Froberts-trump.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 21:59:18.795819

The party in government would be well served to remember the part that protest and collective action played in its own foundation.","The killing of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents (News, Viewpoint 16 January) offers a stark warning to the UK Government of the danger in treating civic action as a security threat and a public-order problem rather than as a fundamental right and cornerstone of a free and functioning democracy.

The British Government likes to model itself as a country in which free speech, protest, and civic engagement are protected as core rights. The reality looks increasingly different. In the UK, as in the United States, democratic participation is becoming a progressively riskier exercise.

Human Rights Watch’s new report, Silencing the Streets, documents how protest rights in the UK are being steadily undermined — not through a single dramatic rupture, but through a series of incremental changes that collectively make it far easier to police and punish protests, and far harder for people to exercise their right to peaceful assembly.

During recent years, laws such as the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 and the Public Order Act 2023 have handed the police sweeping powers to restrict demonstrations that are deemed too noisy or disruptive, on the basis of deliberately vague and broad definitions. Peaceful tactics, such as slow marching and carrying protest materials, have been reclassified as criminal offences. Arrests for non-violent actions are increasingly common.

Even places of worship, including churches, which have traditionally offered both moral leadership and practical sanctuary when civic space has narrowed, are treated as a threat.

In a deeply troubling development, a peaceful meeting of youth activists discussing the climate crisis and Palestine at a Quaker meeting house, in London, was shut down, despite Quakers’ longstanding commitment to pacifism and non-violence. More than two dozen Metropolitan Police officers, some armed with stun guns, reportedly smashed down the door of the building and arrested the young women who had gathered.

The Recording Clerk for Quakers in Britain, Paul Parker, said that no one in living memory had been arrested in a Quaker meeting house. The intervention sent a chilling signal: even gatherings in places of worship devoted to peaceful discussion and witness could be treated as suspect.

The targeting of such spaces underscores just how far the reframing of protest as a security threat has gone: no longer confined to streets and public squares, but now extending into places traditionally understood as protected forums for conscience and collective moral expression.

Members of faith communities in Minnesota — from Emmanuel Christian Center to the Metropolitan Community Church and Peace United Church of Christ — have spoken out strongly against the circumstances of Ms Good’s killing, calling for peace, unity, and justice.

In the UK, the proscription of the group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation marked a further and alarming escalation in the Government’s treatment of protest as a security offence (Comment, 29 August 2025). This misuse of terrorism legislation to stifle legitimate activism has led to the arrest of more than 2700 people, the vast majority simply for holding signs (News, 15 August 2025).

This reframing of legitimate activism as terrorism has also provided cover for the extended pre-trial detention of pro-Palestinian activists, some held for well over a year — three times the maximum period that a person should ordinarily spend on remand — in conditions that, UN experts have warned, raise serious concerns under international human-rights law. Three of those held are currently on prolonged hunger strike. At least two, Heba Muraisi and Kamran Ahmed, are, at the time of writing, at imminent risk of death.

Renee Good, her wife explained, was on the street in Minneapolis to support her community by monitoring immigration enforcement officers operating in the area.

The lesson from Minneapolis is clear: when civic engagement and dissent are treated as threats and authorities are handed sweeping powers, participation becomes dangerous, and the space for legitimate disagreement narrows. In the US, while attention is now focused on Minnesota, the federal law-enforcement response to dissent in cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago paints a broader picture of the active suppression of civil action.

In the UK, rising fines, prison sentences, and ever-widening discretion over who can be stopped, searched, or arrested for protesting show that the same flawed logic is already at work.

Officials should remember that many of the rights that people enjoy today were won through protests that were disruptive, controversial, and directly opposed by the governments of the day. Recasting those same forms of action as inherently suspect risks forgetting that history and hollowing out the very rights that those struggles secured. The party in government would be well served to remember the part that protest and collective action played in its own foundation.

I. Introduction / Executive Summary

Gibson Dunn launched our Immigration Task Force a year ago in anticipation of a changing immigration landscape. The Task Force brought together our expertise in humanitarian immigration law, employment law, appellate and constitutional law, and administrative law and policy, with the goal of providing timely and thoughtful updates on immigration developments. The last year has been marked by significant legal and policy shifts that have dramatically changed the immigration landscape in this country for both individuals and employers. Taken together, these developments reflect a marked shift toward heightened enforcement, expanded detention, increased costs and administrative burdens for immigrants, and the narrowing or suspension of long-standing humanitarian protections. For impacted individuals and communities, the cumulative effect has been increased fear and instability. For employers, changes have increased uncertainty and in some cases made employing workers in various immigration statuses more challenging.

This retrospective surveys some of the major executive, regulatory, and enforcement actions affecting employment-based, humanitarian, and diversity-based immigration pathways, as well as changes to work authorization, vetting, detention, and removal practices. It also seeks to preview anticipated developments to watch in the year ahead. While much remains uncertain, the current landscape certainly underscores the need for vigilant monitoring of policy changes, litigation challenges, and other relevant announcements in the year (and years) to come. We have appreciated the opportunity to connect with so many of you through this Task Force over the last year and we look forward to additional opportunities to support one another in the year to come.

II. Changes to Employment, Humanitarian, and Diversity-Based Immigration Pathways

A. Employment-Based H-1B Visa Program

i. New $100,000 Fee for Certain H-1B Visa Petitions

On September 19, 2025, President Trump issued a Proclamation introducing changes to the H-1B nonimmigrant visa program, a visa classification for foreign workers hired by U.S. employers in specialty occupations.[1] Under the Proclamation, new H-1B petitions filed on or after September 21, 2025 for entry into the U.S. after such date must be accompanied by a $100,000 payment.[2] This new requirement is in effect for only one year, although the Secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Labor, and Secretary of Homeland Security must jointly submit to the President a recommendation on whether to extend it within thirty days after the upcoming H-1B lottery in March 2026 is completed.[3] The Proclamation contains one exception: if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines, in their discretion, that hiring a foreign worker as an H-1B specialty occupation worker is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, the $100,000 payment is not required.[4]

Following questions from foreign workers and U.S. companies that employ them,[5] U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued clarifying guidance on October 20, 2025 regarding the Proclamation’s scope.[6] Among other things, USCIS clarified that the Proclamation does not apply to any previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas or any petition that is requesting an amendment, extension of stay, or change of status (e.g., F-1 student visa holders seeking to change to H-1B status after graduation) for a petitioner in the U.S. where the petitioner is granted such amendment, extension, or change.[7] USCIS also clarified that the Proclamation does not prevent any holder of a current H-1B visa from traveling in and out of the United States.[8]

Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging the Proclamation and its new $100,000 fee. These include challenges by a coalition of labor unions, healthcare providers, schools, and religious organizations in Global Nurse Force, et al., v. Trump, et al., filed on October 3, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California;[9] the Chamber of Commerce and others in Chamber of Commerce, et al., v. DHS, et al., filed October 26, 2025 in the U.S. District Court for the District of D.C;[10] and twenty states in State of California, et al. v. Kristi Noem, et al., filed December 12, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.[11] The plaintiffs in these actions allege that the increased fee will make it difficult to fill critical physician, nursing, and teaching staffing shortages in the U.S., particularly in rural and other underserved areas, and will inflict significant harm on U.S. businesses, particularly in tech, manufacturing, and STEM industries.[12] They claim, among other things, that the Proclamation and related government actions exceed the President’s authority and violate the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), including because they are arbitrary and capricious and failed to provide notice and an opportunity for comment.[13]

On December 23, 2025, the district court judge in Chamber of Commerce ruled against the plaintiffs, granting the government’s motion for summary judgment.[14] In concluding that the Proclamation and related measures did not exceed the President’s power, the Court noted that the President has “broad authority to regulate entry into the United States for immigrants and nonimmigrants alike.”[15] Citing portions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Court explained that “Congress has decided to delegate broad power to the President to restrict entry of noncitizens ‘[w]henever the President finds that’ such entry ‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.’”[16] The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has set oral argument for March 9, 2026.[17]

The other two lawsuits remain pending in their respective district courts. In Global Nurse Force, on December 18, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the Proclamation, as well as a motion to certify a class.[18] A hearing on the two motions is currently set for February 12, 2026.[19] On January 6, 2026, the government asked the court to stay the case pending the outcome of the Chamber of Commerce appeal.[20] The court has not yet ruled on the government’s motion.

ii. New Weighted Selection Process for the H-1B Visa Lottery

On December 29, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security published a final rule changing the process by which USCIS selects H-1B registrations subject to the H-1B cap lottery to favor higher-paid applicants.[21] The new rule goes into effect on February 27, 2026, ahead of the March 2026 lottery.[22]

Congress has established limits on the number of foreign workers who may be granted H-1B visas each fiscal year, commonly known as the “cap.”[23] Certain petitions are exempt from the cap, including petitions for employment at an institution of higher education.[24] When demand exceeds the cap—which happens in significant numbers every year—USCIS selects petitioners pursuant to a lottery system.[25] Prior to the new rule, USCIS randomly selected petitioners.[26] Under the new rule, USCIS will instead be using a weighted selection system that gives applicants classified under higher wage levels a greater chance of selection than those with lower wage levels.[27] Thus, the new process broadly allows candidates for higher-salary roles a great chance for selection for the H-1B visa.

iii. New Employer Enforcement Initiative: “Project Firewall”

On September 19, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced “Project Firewall,” an enforcement initiative directed at employers of workers on H-1B visas focused on identifying fraud, abuse, and wage violations.[28] Under this initiative, DOL will work with DHS and other agencies to conduct investigations of employers with H-1B workers.[29] Violations may result in the collection of back wages owed to affected workers, the assessment of civil money penalties, and/or the inability to participate in the H-1B program.[30] The initiative is industry-neutral, meaning that any employer with H-1B workers could be impacted, though the agencies may focus on employers with large H-1B contingents.

B. Humanitarian Immigration Pathways

The Executive Branch also overhauled, terminated, and injected uncertainty into many forms of humanitarian immigration relief over the last year, narrowing and at times eliminating immigration pathways available to individuals fleeing war, famine, persecution, and violence in their countries of origin.

i. Asylum

Every year, tens of thousands[31] of individuals apply for asylum, a form of protection granted to a person who is unable or unwilling to return to their home country, and cannot obtain protection in that country, due to past persecution or a well-founded fear of being persecuted in the future on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. As of January 2025, there were more than 1 million affirmative asylum applications pending before USCIS, and at the end of Fiscal Year 2025, there were approximately 2.4 million defensive asylum applications pending in immigration courts.[32]

In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi took a number of actions limiting asylum eligibility. On September 2, 2025, exercising her authority as Attorney General to take cases from the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and decide them, Attorney General Bondi issued two decisions reversing Biden-era precedents and reviving precedents from the first Trump Administration. In Matter of S-S-F-M-, she reversed precedent on asylum claims involving harm by non-state actors that the state is unwilling or unable to control (in that case, a perpetrator of domestic violence), reviving an opinion that “victims of private criminal activity” will not qualify for asylum except perhaps in “exceptional circumstances,” language that has been read to create a strong presumption against asylum claims based on private conduct[33] In Matter of R-E-R-M- & J-D-R-M-, she reversed precedent on asylum claims involving family-based particular social groups, emphasizing the “importance of a ‘fact-based inquiry to determine whether’ a respondent’s family group is ‘defined with sufficient particularity and is socially distinct in his society.’”[34] On October 22, 2025, she issued Matter of Negusie, a decision that reinstated a decision from the first Trump Administration stating that asylum cannot be granted to people who engaged or assisted in the persecution of others, even if they were under duress or coerced into doing it.[35]

On April 11, 2025, citing the asylum backlog in immigration courts, the Acting Director of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) published a policy memorandum encouraging immigration judges to dismiss asylum applications without a hearing on the merits if they are found to be legally insufficient, a procedure known as “pretermission.”[36] In addition, in September 2025, it was reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved sending up to 600 military lawyers to the Justice Department to serve as temporary immigration judges.[37] At the same time, the Trump Administration has reportedly fired nearly 100 immigration judges (out of a total bench of approximately 700) in 2025.[38] Immigration judges not only adjudicate asylum cases, but all cases for non-citizens facing removal.

The Department of Homeland Security also has taken policy actions on asylum. On December 2, 2025, USCIS published a policy memorandum that, among other things, directed USCIS personnel to place a “hold” on adjudicating all applications for asylum currently pending with the agency until the hold is lifted by the Director of USCIS.[39] The adjudicative hold applies to all asylum-seekers, regardless of their country of origin, although it does not apply to asylum applications pending in immigration courts.[40] The policy memorandum was published less than one week after an Afghan national who had been granted asylum was named as being behind a shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. that left one of them dead and the other in critical condition. USCIS stated that it was implementing the adjudicative hold on all pending asylum applications to address “vulnerabilities” during USCIS’s processes and to conduct a comprehensive review of all USCIS policies, procedures, and guidance.[41] As of the date of publication of this alert, the pause has not been lifted. It is unclear what will result from USCIS’s ongoing review, but it seems likely that this widespread hold will further exacerbate the USCIS asylum decision backlog.

ii. Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS)

Recent agency actions have also significantly altered the landscape for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) beneficiaries and applicants.

1. Deferred Action Policy

SIJS provides a pathway for children who were abused, abandoned, or neglected in their home countries to obtain lawful permanent residency (i.e., green cards). Applying for SIJS is a two-part process, which first requires a state court to make findings that an adult sponsor (often, but not always, the child’s parent or other close relative) is suitable to be awarded guardianship of the child. After that, the child is able to petition USCIS for SIJS.

Because SIJS recipients cannot apply to adjust status until an immigrant visa is available, visa backlogs often result in years-long delays before they can obtain green cards. Pursuant to a 2022 SIJS Deferred Action Policy, USCIS had automatically considered SIJS recipients for deferred action, which enabled them to live and work in the United States while waiting to become eligible to become lawful permanent residents.

On June 6, 2025, USCIS issued new guidance rescinding its 2022 policy and “confirm[ing] that USCIS will no longer consider granting deferred action” to SIJS recipients and that SIJS recipients will not be eligible to apply for employment authorization pursuant to deferred action.[42] On November 19, 2025, an Eastern District of New York judge stayed USCIS’s rescission, finding it was likely arbitrary and capricious under the APA because USCIS failed to consider reliance interests and reasonable alternatives, and that it likely violated the APA’s notice-and-comment requirement and the Accardi Doctrine.[43] Accordingly, as of the date of publication of this alert, USCIS must automatically consider SIJS recipients for deferred action (and related employment authorization) pursuant to the 2022 Deferred Action Policy while the stay is in place.

2. Sponsorship Requirements

On March 25, 2025, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) promulgated an interim final rule that allows ORR to consider a would-be SIJS sponsor’s immigration status and share sponsor information with law enforcement and immigration agencies.[44] This rule rescinds a provision of the Biden-era Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule that had prohibited disqualifying would-be SIJS sponsors solely based on immigration status and restricted sharing sponsor information with immigration authorities.[45]

Following a challenge by five children representing a putative class of unaccompanied children, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia certified a class of all “unaccompanied children who are or will be in the custody of HHS and who have not been released to a sponsor because of ORR’s new documentation requirements” and issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the government from departing from its previous policy “without explaining how it weighed the disrupted reliance interests against other valid considerations.”[46] Currently, the immigration status of unaccompanied children’s proposed sponsors (often, a parent or another close relative) should not be considered when evaluating their ability to serve as the child’s guardian for SIJS purposes.

iii. Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Through the Immigration Act of 1990, The Secretary of Homeland Security is empowered to designate countries for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) due to civil war, natural disasters, or other extraordinary periods of unrest. TPS is a temporary immigration status (of 6, 12, or 18 months, which may be extended by the Secretary) made available to nationals of designated countries who are physically present in the U.S. at the time of the designation. Although TPS does not provide an independent pathway to permanent status in the United States, TPS holders are protected from removal and eligible for work authorization during the designated period. The Secretary periodically re-reviews TPS country designations and decides whether to re-designate the country for protection.

Secretary Noem announced the termination or non-re-designation of TPS of the majority of the existing TPS countries over the past year: Venezuela, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Nepal, Honduras, Nicaragua, Syria, Burma, Haiti, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia.[47] Only El Salvador, Lebanon, Ukraine, and Yemen retain TPS designations as of the date of publication of this alert.[48] Estimates suggest that of the approximately 1.3 million individuals living in the United States in early 2025, over the first year of the Administration, DHS has terminated (or announced its intent to terminate) TPS for over 1 million of them.[49]

These determinations have been the subject of much litigation. Challenges to the early termination – often without notice – of a TPS designation midway through the designation period have largely been successful, at least in obtaining temporary reprieve and some minimum notice to impact individuals (though with a notable exception of the Supreme Court granting an emergency stay in a case involving the termination of TPS for Venezuelans).[50] For example, on November 19, 2025, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York ordered that the early termination for Syria be postponed, finding that the plaintiffs had a substantial likelihood of succeeding on the merits of their claim that the termination was arbitrary and capricious.[51] (The government has since filed an Emergency Motion for a Stay).[52]

By contrast, legal challenges to Secretary Noem permitting TPS designations for other countries to expire without re-designating them for another period of TPS have not been successful.[53] This is likely because the Secretary has broad discretion over TPS designations, and the decision to designate (or not) a country for TPS is generally not subject to judicial review except in very narrow circumstances.

iv. Categorical Parole Pathways

USCIS has also terminated so-called “categorical” humanitarian parole programs. Humanitarian parole is temporary status that is granted “for urgent humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit.”[54] For example, applications for humanitarian parole were widely used by advocates, members of the armed forces, religious leaders, and others to secure the short-term evacuation of Afghan allies following the fall of Kabul in 2021.[55] Applicants are required to meet strict eligibility criteria, undergo comprehensive security vetting via multiple federal agencies, and satisfy financial sponsorship requirements.[56] Those granted parole can apply for employment authorization and pursue other forms of humanitarian relief, such as asylum or adjustment of status, but parole itself does not confer long-term immigration status.[57]

On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order, titled Securing Our Borders, that directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to “take appropriate action to . . . [t]erminate all categorical parole programs that are contrary to the policies of the United States established in [President Trump’s] Executive Orders, including the program known as the ‘Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans,’” also known as the CHNV program.[58] The CHNV program, which allowed certain nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to seek temporary parole into the United States for up to two years, was launched by the Biden administration on January 5, 2023.[59]

In accordance with President Trump’s January 20th executive order, USCIS announced on January 28, 2025, that it was pausing acceptance of Form-134A, which is a form required by parole pathways to demonstrate the existence of a financial sponsor.[60] In addition to that pause, which functionally suspended all parole programs, on March 25, 2025, DHS also announced the formal termination, effective immediately, of the CHNV Program, terminating parole for approximately 532,000 individuals.[61] Prior the executive order, DHS had already announced that it was terminating categorical parole processes for individuals from Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and Honduras under the Family Reunification Parole (FRP) processes. However, USCIS has paused issuance of FRP termination notices following the entry of a preliminary injunction by the District of Massachusetts staying termination of the parole processes pending the outcome of the litigation.[62] The FRP program has historically allowed certain beneficiaries of approved family-based immigrant visa petitions to be considered for temporary parole into the United States while awaiting visa availability.[63]

As discussed in greater detail below, on February 14, 2025, USCIS also ordered “an administrative hold on all pending benefit requests filed by” parolees, including requests for re-parole under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program.[64] USCIS has since resumed processing immigration benefits applications following an order by the District of Massachusetts mandating that it do so.[65] While no new applications are being processed under the U4U program, existing beneficiaries can apply for re-parole, which remains available on a discretionary, case-by-case basis.[66]

v. “Diversity” Visa Program

On December 18, 2025, USCIS and the State Department, at the direction of the President and the Director of Homeland Security, indefinitely suspended the Diversity Visa program.[67] Agency guidance indicates that the pause was initiated in light of concerns raised by the December 18, 2025, shooting at Brown University and killing of an MIT professor suspected to have been committed by an individual admitted to the United States through the Diversity Visa program.[68]

The program, which was created by Congress more than 35 years ago, makes available up to 50,000 immigrant visas annually from a random lottery selection of individuals from countries with “low rates of immigration” to the United States.[69] In past years, the chance of winning this visa lottery was under 1% (between 1 in every 200 to 400 applicants selected, depending on the year); overall, the green cards issued through the program are also just a small fraction of the total number of green cards issued each year.[70] Congress’s stated intent in passing the 1990 law creating the program was to create a visa category to increase immigration from countries other than the “major sending” countries, defined as a country that receives less than 7% of the total number of issued immigrant visas over the previous five year period.[71] This was also meant to ameliorate lasting effects of a prior national origin quota system.[72] While there have been several attempts in Congress to eliminate the program over the decades, none thus far have been successful. While active visas are not yet terminated, processing is currently paused for those with pending Diversity Visa applications, such as those selected for eligibility for FY2026.[73]

vi. Pause on Processing Immigrant Visas

On January 14, 2026, the Department of State announced it was indefinitely pausing immigrant visa processing for nationals of 75 countries, citing concerns that applicants from these countries were at a high risk of becoming a “public charge” on U.S. resources.[74] The pause took effect on January 21, meaning that no additional visas for would-be immigrants from these countries (including Colombia, Egypt, Iran, Morocco, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russia, and others) will be approved for those who remain in consular processing abroad.

Notably, the pause applies only to foreign nationals seeking immigrant visas – meaning those who seek to live and work permanently in the U.S. – not non-immigrant visa holders or applicants, such as student-, employment-, and tourism-based visas (like F-1, H-1B, and B1). Nevertheless, employers with global workforces may face significant disruption due to this processing pause. Forthcoming litigation challenges to the pause have been reported as anticipated.

III. Changes to Work Authorization Processes for Noncitizens

Multiple changes to the employment authorization process for noncitizens—such as the end of automatic extensions for timely filed renewal applications, decreased duration of employment authorization validity, increased application costs, and halted processing for nationals from certain countries—affected employers and employees across myriad industries over the last year. Employees face costlier, more frequent applications as well as a heightened risk of work authorization gaps that affect their ability to find and maintain employment. Employers may face increased administrative costs through more frequent I-9 reverifications and paperwork, heightened compliance risk, and the disruption of their businesses caused by the loss of personnel.[75]

A. End of Automatic Extensions for Timely Filed Renewal Applications

On October 30, 2025, DHS published an interim final rule amending DHS regulations to end the automatic extension of employment authorization for immigrants who timely filed a renewal application.[76] This rule impacts immigrants in many postures, including refugees, green card applicants, spouses of H-1B holders, asylum applicants, and more. The Federal Register notice stated that the purpose of this change was “to prioritize the proper vetting and screening of aliens before granting a new period of employment authorization” consistent with President Trump’s Executive Order 14159.[77] Previously, immigrants who timely (i.e., while still authorized to work in the United States) filed to renew their Employment Authorization Documents (EAD) were granted an automatic extension of the expiration date of their EAD.[78] During the Biden administration, certain immigrants were eligible for a 540-day automatic extension, while others received one-year extensions.[79] The Trump Administration ended this policy effective October 30, 2025, and subsequent renewal applications will not result in an automatic extension. [80] Currently, litigation is ongoing in a Central District of California case filed on January 8, 2026, challenging the interim final rule.[81]

If it remains in effect, this rule likely will cause temporary (and possibly quite lengthy) lapses in employment authorizations while USCIS processes renewals. Employers generally need to remove workers from payroll if they are unable to establish current employment authorization status, with no grace period. Unavoidable lapses in authorization are a highly likely scenario for many, given that some EAD applications take nine months or longer to process, and USCIS will not accept renewal requests until six months before the current EAD expires.[82] Therefore, the end of the automatic extension is likely to cost employers billions in labor turnover costs and the United States billions in tax revenue—a previous analysis by USCIS noted that, over a two-year period, the automatic extension prevented 800,000 individuals from work authorization gaps and saved U.S. employers $3.5 billion in labor turnover costs.[83]

B. Decreased Duration for Employment Authorization Documents

In addition to eliminating automatic extensions, USCIS also reduced the maximum validity period for initial and renewal EADs, effective December 5, 2025.[84] The validity period for EAD applications filed on or after this date was reduced to 18 months (from five years) for individuals who were admitted as refugees, granted asylum, granted withholding of deportation or removal, asylum-seekers, and others.[85] Validity periods also were shortened for initial and renewal EADs for TPS and parole holders, spouses of entrepreneur paroles, and those with a pending TPS application.[86] As a result, immigrants will be required to renew EAD applications more often—likely increasing already lengthy USCIS processing times—and compounding the risk of work authorization gaps as discussed above.

C. Increased Costs for Employment Authorization Documents

On July 22, 2025, DHS published a notice announcing new USCIS immigration fees as required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR-1).[87] These fee changes affected employment authorization applications (as well as many other immigration benefit applications) and, for many categories of work permit holders, dramatically increased the cost of obtaining and renewing work authorization. For example, EAD applications for asylum seekers and paroled refugees—which previously had no application fee—now have a $550 fee, with no fee waiver available.[88] On November 21, 2025, USCIS announced “inflationary adjustments to immigration-related fees administered by USCIS,” effective January 1, 2026, which increased EAD initial application and renewal fees by $5 or $10.[89] As a result, it is now significantly more costly for EAD applicants to submit applications, and some would-be applicants may no longer be able to afford to apply for work authorization, especially recent arrivals who entered the country without any financial resources.[90]

D. Work Authorization Benefits Hold for Nationals From “High-Risk Countries”

On December 2, 2025, USCIS issued a policy memorandum directing all USCIS personnel to place a hold on all “pending benefit requests” for immigrants from a list of dozens of “high-risk countries”.[91] This policy was later expanded and clarified in an updated policy memorandum issued on January 1, 2026.[92] USCIS has confirmed that this hold affects, among other benefits, employment authorization.[93] The only exceptions to this hold regarding work authorizations are initial applications from asylum-seeking immigrants, and requests from law enforcement for immigrants assisting law enforcement.[94] Otherwise, individuals from the 39 “high-risk countries” will only be able to obtain work authorization (or renew their work authorization) after “a comprehensive review.”[95] In particular, USCIS has stated that “a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview” is necessary for all immigrants from “high-risk countries” who entered the U.S. on or after January 20, 2021.[96] It is presently unclear what form the “comprehensive re-review” will take.

IV. Increased Vetting

A. Expansion of Vetting Procedures

i. Social Media and AI Vetting

Even before the creation of the vetting center in December, earlier in the year, immigration agencies began implementing social media and AI vetting policies. USCIS began screening non-citizens’ online presence in a number of contexts in 2025, for example. On April 9, 2025, for example, USCIS began “considering aliens’ antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.”[97] This screening applied to “aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity.”[98] On August 19, 2025, USCIS stated that it “expanded the types of benefit requests that receive social media vetting, and reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that vetting.”[99] In a report published November 11, 2025, USCIS announced that it “[i]n FY25, USCIS completed 12,502 individual social media checks,” to “determine whether an alien endorses, espouses, promotes, or supports anti-American activity and considering it as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests.”[100]

The State Department also announced that it would screen for “online presence” in making admissibility determinations and instructed that applicants for certain visas “adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to ‘public.’” On June 18, 2025, the State Department announced that it would conduct this “online presence” screening for “all student and exchange visitor applicants in the F, M, and J nonimmigrant classifications.”[101] On December 3, 2025, the State Department announced that, as of December 15, it would extend this requirement to “all H-1B applicants and their dependents, in addition to the students and exchange visitors already subject to this review.”[102]

The review is said to be conducted as a “national security decision”, ensuring that applicants “do not intend to harm Americans or . . . national interests”.[103] The review will also focus on credibility, such as whether an applicant’s information online matches with information on their application documents, such as employer name, job title, work history, and education.[104] Employers and their H-1B and H-4 applicants have already seen impacts of these this policy change in their consular processing.[105] Many interviews for visa applicants have been unexpectedly and suddenly delayed, due to consular officers requiring additional time to review applicants’ online presence.[106]

ii. Re-Vetting of Nationals from “Travel Ban” Countries

In addition to the universal “hold” on adjudication of asylum petitions filed by nationals of any country initially announced on December 2, described in Section II.B.i above, the same policy memo outlines DHS’s processing freeze on all forms of benefits applications (such as work permits, green cards, and more) for individuals from 19 so-called “high-risk countries.”[107] These countries were identified by presidential proclamation earlier last year via a travel ban suspending nearly all entries into the country for nationals of certain countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, and Sudan.[108] The “hold” was extended on January 1, 2026, to include all 39 countries listed in President Trump’s travel ban.[109]

In addition to pausing adjudication of benefits, the policy memorandum mandates that individuals from all of these countries who were granted many forms of immigration benefits or status since January of 2021 undergo a “thorough re-review process.” The memorandum also says that within 90 days, USCIS is to provide a list of high-priority individuals designated for re-review; it is presently unclear whether all individuals who received benefits over the past five years will be re-reviewed, or only the list anticipated from USCIS in early March. Estimates of the number of individuals who would be subject to former interpretation of the policy guidance for re-review are over one million.

USCIS is also instructed in the memorandum to review all policies, procedures, and screening/vetting processes for benefit requests by individuals from these travel-ban countries. As part of this set of actions focused on “vetting,” USCIS announced the creation of the USCIS Vetting Center, meant to “centralize the enhanced vetting of aliens and allow the agency to respond more nimbly to changes in a shifting threat landscape.”[110] The vetting center plans to use AI to assist in re-reviewing applications. This new vetting center preliminarily appears to be central to DHS and ICE’s spate of regionalized enforcement actions. For example, USCIS’s “fraud investigation” in Minnesota, called Operation PARRIS (Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening), launched on January 9, 2026, is being led by the vetting center.[111] USCIS describes that the vetting center has “adjudicators” who are “conducting thorough background checks, reinterviews, and merit reviews of refugee claims.”[112]

The combination of holds on many benefit applications and increased vetting will likely increase the existing backlog and delayed processing times for applications for all types of immigration benefit.[113] The “hold” on benefit processing for the 39 travel-ban countries is ongoing, and it is unclear when applications filed by individuals from those countries will be adjudicated. Additionally, the additional vetting work (including re-reviews, additional interviews, and repeat background checks) is likely to significantly increase administrative costs for USCIS—which may, in turn, lead to further increases in fees charged for benefit applications.[114]

V. Increased Immigration Enforcement and Detention

A. ICE Funding and Operational Capacity

During the administration’s first year, Congress’s annual appropriations and DHS’s adjustments to program allocations increased resources available to ICE, with funds steered toward enforcement and removal operations, transportation, and detention. Specifically, July 2025’s HR-1 allocates more than $170 billion over four years for border and interior enforcement – more than the yearly budget for all local and state law enforcement agencies combined across the entire United States.[115] The largest share of that budget went to ICE, whose FY2025 budget was approximately $28.7 billion – more than triple its annual budget from the prior year.[116]

Public budget documents and oversight correspondence reflect higher operations funding and flexibility to surge removal flights and custody capacity, enabling ICE to scale up interior enforcement and removal coordination alongside CBP’s border activities.[117] The administration paired these fiscal measures with operational directives to facilitate the goal of deporting 1 million immigrants per year as set out in HR-1.[118] ICE used its increased operational budget to, among other things, increase detention bed space, increase air and ground transportation assets for removals, enhance surveillance and data-sharing tools, and more closely coordinate with local law enforcement agencies.[119]

The administration has linked these investments to a broader deterrence strategy that coincided with reduced unlawful southwest border encounters relative to 2024 levels, with CBP reporting significant month-over-month declines in 2025.[120]

At the same time, increased apprehensions have outpaced adjudicatory capacity in portions of the system, given persistent docket backlogs and large-scale layoffs of immigration judges, creating tension between heightened front-end enforcement and the system’s ability to provide timely processing and adjudication of claims.[121] This may indicate a structural risk that expanded ICE enforcement resources can compound downstream bottlenecks, even as front-end crossing numbers decline.[122]

B. Expansion of Civil Detention

The Administration has significantly expanded the use of civil detention for noncitizens, with the number of detained individuals increasing by nearly 75 percent from roughly 40,000 in January 2025 to nearly 66,000 by December 2025.[123] This increase is the result of legislative and executive actions reflecting the enforcement priorities of this Administration.

i. Policy Changes Resulting in Mandatory Detentions

One early example of the year’s shift to mandatory detention was the Laken Riley Act, signed into law on January 29, 2025, which amended the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to make the detention of noncitizens convicted, or even only arrested for, theft offenses (including shoplifting) mandatory.[124] This law is notable for creating “no-bond” cases where individuals are detained indefinitely based on mere accusations or arrests, without a criminal conviction. The Laken Riley Act also removed discretion from immigration judges to make custody determinations based on individualized risk assessments.

Complementing this, in July 2025, the Acting ICE Director issued an internal memo instructing agents that all noncitizens who entered the country without inspection, including those who have been in the country for years or even decades, are to be considered “arriving aliens” with respect to INA Section 235(b).[125] (This, in connection with subsequent BIA decisions, has reversed longstanding interpretation of immigration law to declare any individual not admitted to the United States as an “arriving alien” under Section 235(b), regardless of whether they were apprehended at entry into the United States, or years after entry.)[126] Because “arriving aliens” are subject to mandatory detention under the INA, this memorandum has dramatically increased detention of noncitizens in the United States who have no criminal history of any kind. [127]

The surge in these no-bond cases led to a historic 2,450% increase in the detention of noncitizens with no criminal records by late 2025.[128] Without the right to a bond hearing, impacted individuals are instead looking to the federal courts for relief from what they argue is unconstitutional and unlawful detention.[129] Federal habeas corpus petitions in the immigration detention context skyrocketed from 200 in 2024 to over 9,000 by January 2026.

ii. Increased Encounters with Immigration Enforcement

Since January 2025, a marked escalation in enforcement facilitated by massive resource allocation has transformed routine interactions with federal agencies into high-risk scenarios for noncitizens. ICE has increasingly conducted arrests during routine check-ins and benefit adjudications at USCIS field offices, including marriage-based green card interviews, asylum screenings, and naturalization appointments.[130] Courts, including civil, state courts that have no jurisdiction over immigration cases, have also become frequent sites for enforcement; data from Boston, for example, recorded at least 54 arrests at municipal courthouses in 2025.[131]

The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services have agreed to share their data with Department of Homeland Security and ICE, including information on immigration status, address, phone number, date of birth, and Medicaid ID.[132] Although undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid coverage, they may be eligible for coverage of payments for emergency services, and thus their information may be at risk. Some states, like Washington, have had data within their Department of Licensing, such as license plate numbers and registration information, accessed by federal ICE agents to lead to immigration arrests.[133]

This escalation in enforcement has been supported by an unprecedented 120% expansion of the ICE workforce, which grew to over 22,000 officers and agents in 2025 following a hiring surge.[134]

iii. Increased Use of Existing Detention Facilities, Private Partnerships, and Military Assets

The increase of arrests and detention in 2025 required a corresponding expansion of detention space. Since January 2025, ICE has increased the number of detention facilities from 114 to 218, with 93 facilities holding an average of more than 100 people each day, and 20 facilities holding more than 1,000 people per day.[135] This expansion is driven by funding from H.R. 1, which provides $45 billion through FY2029 for immigration detention.[136] On his first day in office, President Trump reversed[137] a Biden-era executive order[138] limiting the use of private companies in federal prisons, and the government has since partnered with private prison companies to reopen previously shuttered prisons or expand capacity in state or private prisons that have the capacity to hold thousands of detainees.[139]

DHS has also utilized military bases to meet the increasing need for detention space. In his first month in office, President Trump signed a memorandum directing “high-priority criminal” immigrants to be held at a Migrant Operations Center at the Guantanamo Bay military base.[140] This practice faced criticism from a congressional delegation who visited Guantanamo in March, in part due to concerns about the high cost of housing migrants there (approximately $100,000 average daily cost per migrant versus $165 for in-country ICE detention).[141] The Administration has also built a tent camp at Fort Bliss military base near El Paso, Texas which currently houses over 2,700 individuals, and has been reported to have insufficient food, sanitation, and medical care, as well as a potential homicide by a guard who is alleged to have asphyxiated a detained migrant in early 2026.[142] The Administration plans to open similar camps in New Jersey[143] and Indiana.[144] The Trump Administration has also recently reopened two family detention centers in Texas, which is alleged to violate a longstanding settlement agreement with the federal government from the 1990’s governing the country’s detention of children.[145]

iv. Impact of Increased Detention: The Rise of “Self-Deportations”

A December 2025 DHS press release represents that over 1.9 million individuals “voluntarily self-deported” in 2025.[146] This is attributed to “Project Homecoming,” through which DHS offers would-be self-deportees “a complimentary plane ride home” and a $1000 “exit bonus”—which has since been raised to $2,600—upon return to their home country.[147] Notably, “self-deportation” is not a statutory term, but can cover a number of scenarios where individuals leave the United States at different stages in the process of seeking lawful status.[148] While the overall numbers of “self-deportations” has been subject to debate, it is clear that some noncitizens are choosing to voluntarily leave the United States, likely at a rate higher than in prior years. In fact, certain analysts believe that migration numbers in the country are negative for the first time in at least fifty years.[149] Commentators have suggested theories for this trend may include the psychological toll of detention, including that certain facilities may have minimal oversight, coupled with the lack of redressability with the removal of bond hearings.[150] Further, fee hikes for many common immigration applications and threats of hefty fines for immigrants who are unsuccessful in their ultimate claims for relief may create further financial pressure to depart the country.[151]

In October 2025, the Administration launched a program specifically geared toward encouraging unaccompanied immigrant children to self-deport.[152] As part of its “Freaky Friday” operation, ICE reportedly contacted unaccompanied children ages 14 and older in federal custody and encouraged them to withdraw pending immigration applications and to waive protections afforded to them under the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA).[153] Reports indicate that ICE warned children of possible transfer to ICE detention upon turning 18 and of potential enforcement consequences for family members in the United States if the children did not agree to depart.[154]

VI. Looking Ahead: Other Agency Action and Litigation to Watch in Year Two

A. Agency Action

Looking ahead to the second year of the second Trump Administration, advocates are keyed into proposed and final rules and agency action which seek to limit eligibility to forms of immigration relief and restrict access to immigration benefits.

For example, there are two proposed rules currently before the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs that would significantly impact employment authorization for noncitizens. In the Spring of 2025, a rule was proposed at OIRA reflecting ongoing consideration of whether rescind employment authorization for persons 1) who have final orders of removal but are temporarily released from custody on an order of supervision (OSUP), 2) are paroled into the United States temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit; or 3) have been granted deferred action.[155] Similarly, another rule was proposed at OIRA indicating DHS is “proposing to amend its regulations” related to employment authorization for asylum-seekers, which concluded review in November 2025 but has not yet moved forward with a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking.[156]

On November 19, 2025, the Administration published a proposed rule proposing to rescind 2022 public charge regulations and overhaul how public-charge inadmissibility is applied to immigrants seeking admission or adjustment of status.[157] Previously, “public charge,” a ground of inadmissibility that can render an applicant ineligible for a benefit like a green card, was defined narrowly and only a limited set of benefits counted toward the public-charge determination; other benefits (like Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance) generally were excluded.[158] The new proposed rule would apply a “totality of the circumstances” test that allows officers to consider any relevant evidence when deciding whether someone is likely to become a public charge.[159] That means while not automatic, any means-tested benefit—such as even limited use of Medicaid (including non-emergency care), SNAP, housing assistance, CHIP, or others—could potentially be considered evidence that an applicant might rely on public resources. The comment period for the rule ran through December 19, 2025, and until the final rule is published (which has not happened as of the date of publication of this alert), the 2022 public charge regulations remain in force.

B. Still Pending Litigation

There are many ongoing court cases around the country addressing various immigration-related policy changes and administrative actions by the Administration over the past year. Below are brief summaries of certain of those cases which may have the most potential for sweeping consequences to noncitizens in the country, as well as their employers, communities, and families.

i. Barbara v. Trump

On the first day of his second term, President Trump issued an executive order declaring that children born in the United States will not automatically be entitled to citizenship if (1) their mother is “unlawfully present” or (2) their mother’s presence is “lawful but temporary,” and their father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.[160] In response, individuals and organizations across the country challenged the EO in XX court cases, arguing that it violates the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Citizenship Clause). Several district court judges issued injunctions to stop the order’s enforcement. The Supreme Court eventually heard arguments related to the EO on a preliminary jurisdictional issue, and held that, with few exceptions, federal district courts do not have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions.[161] The Court did not, however, address the merits of the plaintiffs’ argument—whether the EO violates the Citizenship Clause.

But the Court will do so in its next term in Barbara v. Trump. The case involves a class of children, who were born after the EO went into effect and would be denied U.S. citizenship as a result, suing on behalf of themselves and other similarly situated children.[162] After provisionally certifying the class, the district court also enjoined the Trump Administration from enforcing the EO against the class members.[163] However, it also stayed enforcement of its injunction pending the Government’s appeal of the decision to the First Circuit. The Government then also moved for and obtained a hold on the appeal after requesting the Supreme Court’s intervention. On December 5, 2025, the Court granted certiorari in the case.[164]

The question presented is “whether the Executive Order complies on its face with the Citizenship Clause and with 8 U.S.C. 1401(a), which codifies that Clause.”[165] Notably, the Government also asked the Supreme Court to review a related Ninth Circuit decision in Washington v. Trump.[166] There, the Ninth Circuit held that the EO violates the Citizen Clause and § 1401 of the INA.[167] But the Supreme Court has not yet decided whether it will hear or consolidate the case with Barbara.

The Court’s decision in Barbara, or in Washington if it decides to hear it, will have a significant impact on the state of citizenship law in the United States. The issue has never been addressed by the Court head on, so the decision may solidify the longstanding interpretation of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[168] Or, the Court could adopt a narrower interpretation of the Citizenship Clause that has been implied by some judges in the past.[169]

ii. Noem v. Al Otro Lado

The Supreme Court will also review a case with broad implications for individuals seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.[170] The case arises from a 2016 policy that an individual seeking asylum does not “arrive[] in the United States” until they have formally crossed into the country.[171] In other words, they have not “arrived” by merely presenting themselves at a port of entry, only by stepping across the border. The policy has been implemented to allow presidents to limit how many asylum seekers can enter from Mexico

For example, towards the end of the Obama Administration and the first Trump Administration, this policy was purportedly implemented to allow border officials to deem a port of entry to be at capacity and turn away all other people without valid travel documents.[172] This was a practice known as metering.[173] The issue was that some ports of entry, migrants were already on U.S. soil before they were turned away.[174] And under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), a person who “arrives in the United States” may apply for asylum and, thus, must be inspected. To that end, the reinterpretation of the statute to exclude migrants already on U.S. soil if they had not yet crossed, even if they were at a point of entry, allowed the Government to reject asylum seekers out of hand.

The metering policy resulted in significant backlogs for asylum seekers, who accumulated on the Mexico side of the border and camped near ports of entry in dire straits, often without food, water, and medical attention, and subject to violence and crime.[175]

To that end, Al Otro Lado, an immigrants’ rights organization, along with thirteen individual asylum seekers, filed suit challenging the metering policy and CBP’s interpretation of § 1158(a)(1).[176] They argued that the policy violated the APA because CBP was withholding or unreasonably delaying action that they were required to take (inspection of asylum seekers) and that the policy was enacted in excess of DHS’s authority.[177] A judge in the Southern District of California granted a permanent injunction against the policy after granting summary judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor.[178] And though the Government, under the Biden Administration, rescinded the metering policy, it still maintained its interpretation of § 1158(a) was correct.[179] Thus, the Government appealed to the Ninth Circuit, seeking review of the district court’s grant of summary judgment, arguing that the district court was wrong to grant summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.[180] The Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision in part, finding that the Government’s interpretation was incorrect and that the metering policy violated the APA.[181]

Then, the Government sought and obtained a writ of certiorari as to whether a migrant who is physically present at the U.S.-Mexico border, but not yet admitted to the country, has “arrive[d] in the United States” under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).[182] The Court’s decision will have a significant impact for asylum seekers and how CBP officials will have to address their claims.

iii. D.V.D. v. Department of Homeland Security

On appeal before the First Circuit is the Trump Administration’s practice of removing noncitizens to third countries, a country of which they are not a citizen and often to which they have no connection.[183] The practice sometimes occurs when a noncitizen is ordered removed but the country they are designated to be deported to either won’t accept them or won’t work with the U.S. to coordinate their return.[184] Or, for example, when the noncitizen would be afforded protection from deportation to a country because their life or freedom would be threatened there.[185] In any of those cases, ICE can still deport the noncitizen to a third country.

The First Circuit case to follow, D.V.D. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., arose out of a deportation of a number of noncitizens without notice or an ability to claim protection from persecution or torture in that country.[186] The district court issued certified a class of noncitizens facing removal to third countries and issued an injunction, requiring the Government to provide written notice of where the noncitizen will be deported and afford them an opportunity to be heard about their safety in the third country.[187] The Government obtained of stay on that order, however, from the Supreme Court while the First Circuit reviews the merits. Oral argument is scheduled at the First Circuit for February 3, 2026.[188]

iv. Harvard v. Department of Homeland Security

The First Circuit Court of Appeals is also anticipated to soon hear oral arguments in a case involving Harvard University’s ability to host international students and employ nonimmigrant workers.[189] The case stems from DHS’s May 22, 2025 decision to cancel Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students through F-1 visas or employ J-1 nonimmigrant visa holders.[190] The next day, Harvard filed a lawsuit against DHS, challenging its revocation of Harvard’s status as a sponsor for foreign students and workers.[191] A judge in the District of Massachusetts immediately granted a TRO and later issued a preliminary injunction that restored Harvard’s ability to enroll and employ nonimmigrants.

Then, on June 5, 2025, the President Trump issued a Proclamation that suspended the entry of all foreign nationals “who enter or attempt to enter the United States to attend Harvard.” [192] In response, Harvard moved again for a TRO and preliminary injunction which the district court granted.[193]

The Government appealed these decisions to the First Circuit. It argues that the president has sweeping authority to suspend entry into the United States under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(f).[194] Harvard responds that the investigation that gave rise to DHS’s decision and the decision itself were a result of viewpoint discrimination and a violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights.[195]

This case could have significant impacts on how courts view allegedly punitive conduct by the Trump Administration, and how the executive can unilaterally regulate universities and employers that rely on enrollment or employment of foreign nationals.

The review makes no mention of the Department of Homeland Security’s earlier claims that Mr. Pretti, a U.S. citizen, “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Shortly after the shooting, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, claimed that Mr. Pretti had been “brandishing” a gun.

Officials had provided no evidence to back up the claim, which was contradicted by witness videos.

The initial review by C.B.P., which deployed more than 1,000 officers and agents to support the enforcement operation in Minnesota, represents the first official written assessment of Saturday’s shooting since administration officials rushed to blame Mr. Pretti.

“These notifications reflect standard Customs and Border Protection protocol and are issued in accordance with existing procedures,” Hilton Beckham, a C.B.P. spokeswoman, said in a statement. “They provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings. They are factual reports — not analytical judgments — and are provided to inform Congress and to promote transparency.”

The review was done by C.B.P.’s Office of Professional Responsibility, which normally conducts internal misconduct investigations following shootings, and was distributed to members of Congress on Tuesday, as required by law. It presents a detailed timeline of the events based on body camera footage and agency documentation.

At approximately 9 a.m. on Saturday, a federal officer was confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles, according to the review. Although the officer ordered them to move out of the road, they did not move.

The officer then “pushed them both away,” and one of the women ran to Mr. Pretti, the review said. After the officer attempted to move them out of the road and they did not move, the officer deployed pepper spray at them, according to the review.

Mr. Pretti then resisted attempts by C.B.P. officers to take him into custody, prompting a struggle, the review said. A Border Patrol agent multiple times yelled, “He’s got a gun!”

About five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent fired his Glock 19, and a C.B.P. officer also fired his Glock 47 at Mr. Pretti, according to the review.

A New York Times analysis of video footage from the scene found that officers fired 10 shots, including six after Mr. Pretti was laying motionless on the ground. Mr. Pretti had been disarmed before he was shot.

The government review said that after the shooting, a Border Patrol agent “advised he had possession of Pretti’s firearm” and “subsequently cleared and secured Pretti’s firearm in his vehicle.”

At approximately 9:02 a.m., C.B.P. personnel cut Mr. Pretti’s clothing and provided medical aid to him by placing chest seals on his wounds, according to the review. About three minutes later, local emergency medical services arrived at the scene.

Mr. Pretti was placed in an ambulance and transported to Hennepin County Medical Center before medical personnel pronounced him dead at approximately 9:32 a.m., the review said.

On Tuesday, President Trump faulted Mr. Pretti, who had a firearms permit, for bringing a gun to protest the enforcement operation. It is legal to openly carry a weapon in Minnesota. Still, Mr. Trump promised a “very honorable and honest investigation” into his killing.

C.B.P.’s Office of Professional Responsibility has a large investigative program to look into officer-involved shootings and other potential officer misconduct. Basic incident reports like the one distributed on Tuesday are required to be released within 72 hours of an officer shooting. But those are often followed by investigations from internal staff members, typically alongside F.B.I. officials conducting a review to see if criminal charges are warranted.

The review says instead that Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is investigating the incident while O.P.R. reviews those findings. The decision to have Homeland Security Investigations take the lead has provoked some consternation from former O.P.R. leaders.

In a statement on LinkedIn posted Tuesday morning, Daniel Altman and Matthew Klein, two former officials at the watchdog office who left the department last year, called on the administration to allow O.P.R. to do an internal review and the F.B.I. to conduct a criminal investigation into whether the officers violated civil rights laws.

They said that Homeland Security Investigations “does not have the mandate or expertise to conduct civil-rights use-of-force investigations.”

Mr. Altman and Mr. Klein were also critical of the initial rush to judgment by administration officials and called for more transparency.

“Public confidence has already been damaged,” they wrote. “Transparency — through disciplined, sequenced release of investigative findings — allows the public to judge the results for themselves.”

WHY IS ICE SO CONTROVERSIAL?

President Donald Trump is waging a massive campaign to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally, which also has snared some immigrants with legal status and U.S. citizens.

Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter. Sign up here.

Trump's administration has surged agents to several Democratic-led cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and most recently Minneapolis and St. Paul.

In Minneapolis, residents have been angered by several incidents, including the killing of two U.S. citizens, the detention of a U.S. citizen who was taken from his home in his shorts, and the detention of school children, including a 5-year-old boy.

Meanwhile, six deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers are known to have occurred just this month.

WHAT DO DEMOCRATS WANT?

Democrats have long been calling for tougher controls over immigration agent operations and practices. In the wake of Saturday's shooting of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti, they are demanding that such reforms be attached to legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security through September.

That bill was approved last week in the House of Representatives over the objection of most Democrats. The DHS funding was attached to broader legislation that also funds agencies ranging from the Defense Department to those operating medical research, housing and education programs.

Democrats are seeking: a prohibition on ICE detentions or deportations of American citizens; a ban on masks worn by ICE agents; a requirement to wear body cameras; explicit prohibitions on excessive use of force; prohibitions on raids of churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship, as well as hospitals and schools; and no absolute immunity from prosecution of agents violating codes of conduct.

Other Democrats have also urged improved training for agents and requiring court-issued warrants for immigration searches and detentions.

Democrats are also seeking to separate DHS spending from the larger package, to avoid disruption to other agencies. They have offered to agree to a temporary funding measure to provide more time for the two parties to find a compromise on additional ICE restrictions.

WHAT DO REPUBLICANS WANT?

Republicans do not want to change the funding bill and are pushing to pass it in the Senate by the January 30 deadline.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on Monday that the sprawling package already contains guardrails on ICE behavior.

For example, it provides $20 million for body-worn cameras, lays out protections for pregnant women in DHS custody, and prohibits the destruction of evidence involving the deaths of people in custody.

WHAT HAPPENS IF A DEAL IS NOT REACHED?

Immigration enforcement would likely be unaffected. During the last shutdown in October, DHS deemed 258,000 of its 272,000 employees ""essential,"" which meant they stayed on the job after funding expired. While essential employees typically do not get paid during a shutdown, Trump's administration kept pay flowing for immigration agents and other federal law enforcement.

DHS has another stream of funding as well. Last year's ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which was opposed by most Democrats, includes $75 billion in additional funding for ICE that allows it to significantly increase the size of its workforce and expand detention facilities, as DHS aims to meet Trump's goal of deporting 1 million people annually.

That money would be available even if Congress does not pass the DHS funding bill.

WHAT'S NEXT?

A large, widespread winter storm has hindered the ability of lawmakers to return to Washington to work on the spending legislation. Senators are expected back in town late on Tuesday, and Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday are scheduled to hold their separate policy lunches. That will be the next opportunity for the 53 Republican senators and 47 members of the Democratic caucus to try to chart their strategies in this battle.

“I think the question is, ‘What is it the Democrats want?’” Mr. Thune said as the Senate returned on Tuesday.","Demands for independent investigations. Scheduled oversight hearings. Overtures for proposed concessions to avert a government shutdown.

In the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a federal agent in Minneapolis, Republicans in Congress have starkly shifted their tone on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, offering some of the strongest and most pointed criticism of the administration since the start of President Trump’s second term and conceding that something must change.

Mr. Pretti’s killing over the weekend had drawn notable pushback from a small but significant group of G.O.P. lawmakers even before Mr. Trump switched rhetorical gears, distancing himself from his administration’s smears of Mr. Pretti and installing a new commander to oversee his deportation push in Minnesota.

But for a much broader group of Republicans who have been reluctant to challenge Mr. Trump or even gently criticize him, the president’s messaging pivot appeared to have provided license to air grave concerns about what happened in Minneapolis and the backlash it had generated among much of the American public.

The shift could be temporary and may be more of a matter of style over substance. It was not clear whether it would yield any immediate action by Republicans, who have largely ceded their power to Mr. Trump and who still solidly back his immigration policy. They have balked at Democrats’ demands to drop funding for the Department of Homeland Security bill from a spending package needed to avert a government shutdown on Friday.

Even so, Republicans have toned down the hyperpartisan language typical in the run-up to a shutdown. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, signaled openness on Tuesday to negotiating with Democrats on policy changes that might draw their votes for the homeland security spending measure, as he called for a full and impartial investigation into Mr. Pretti’s killing, which he described as “an inflection point.”

It all reflected a worry among congressional Republicans, shared by the president, that voters are souring on the immigration crackdown as they see a federal agency acting far beyond the limits of a police force — and that the party may pay a political price for it in November.

So after months of standing on the sidelines as Democrats and municipal and state leaders railed against the tactics of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other border agencies, Republicans have moved quickly this week to put the agency and Mr. Trump’s policy under scrutiny.

“Transparency and communication are needed to turn the temperature down,” Mr. Garbarino said in setting the date for the hearing.

Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who heads his chamber’s homeland security panel, announced a similar session on Feb. 12.

In another sign of Republican unease with the immigration push, Representative Mark Amodei of Nevada, who leads the spending panel responsible for the Homeland Security Department’s funding, criticized Secretary Kristi Noem’s response to the shootings in an interview with The Nevada Independent. He said a “pivot” in immigration enforcement tactics was necessary “because regardless of what side of immigration enforcement you’re on, we are not in a good place right now.”

Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican who has announced his retirement, went further on Tuesday, becoming the first in his party to call for Ms. Noem’s firing. “What she’s done in Minnesota should be disqualifying,” he said at the Capitol, adding, “She needs to go.”

In the House, Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Tom Suozzi, Democrat of New York, leaders of the Problem Solvers Caucus, wrote to Mr. Trump asking for a meeting to discuss a broad immigration overhaul, because his border successes “are now being overshadowed by the interior enforcement that has given rise to a growing rejection by the public.”

Those actions followed calls by several Senate Republicans — some of whom have never previously questioned the administration’s actions — for an independent investigation into the killings in Minneapolis.

Top Republicans are also taking a different approach to the intensifying clash with Senate Democrats over funding for the Department of Homeland Security as a partial government shutdown looms at the end of the week. Democrats are demanding tough new limits on federal immigration agents or they will oppose homeland security funding that is part of a six-bill spending package set for an initial vote on Thursday.

Rather than immediately accusing Democrats of acting irresponsibly and putting government services at risk, Republican leaders have taken a softer approach and have said they hope a resolution can be reached in talks between Democrats and the White House. It is a stark contrast from the last shutdown, when Republicans refused to even enter into negotiations on Democrats’ key demand, extending health care subsidies, until they agreed to end the shutdown.

“I think the question is, ‘What is it the Democrats want?’” Mr. Thune said as the Senate returned on Tuesday. “And if they can define that, then we should figure out if there’s a way to actually achieve it, or come to some agreement, if you will, to negotiate whatever their demands are.”

He added, “Obviously this is an inflection point, an opportunity to evaluate and to really assess the policies and the procedures” of the Trump administration in Minnesota.

Not all Republicans are dialing it down. In a statement on Tuesday posted on X, the members of the far-right House Freedom Caucus urged Mr. Trump to keep the immigration pressure on, illustrating how difficult it could be to secure House approval of any changes won by Democrats.

“We support @POTUS doing whatever is necessary to keep American streets safe from rapists, murderers, and pedophiles here illegally,” the Freedom Caucus statement said. “If Democrat-run Sanctuary Cities continue enabling Communist agitators assaulting ICE and federal law enforcement, then it is time to invoke the Insurrection Act to maintain law and order.”

Some Senate Republicans took a similar stand.

“Four months ago, Democrats shut down the government in an attempt to give illegal aliens free health care,” Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, wrote on X. “Now, they want to shut down the government to stop illegal aliens from being deported. Do Democrats work for the American people or illegal aliens?”

While Senate Republicans said Democrats should cut a deal with Mr. Trump for whatever policy changes they wanted to see in exchange for voting for the spending package, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, threw cold water on that idea.

“The fix should come from Congress,” Mr. Schumer said on Tuesday as he again called for Mr. Thune to break off the homeland security funding measure and allow the Senate to approve funding for the rest of the government while lawmakers negotiated new restrictions on immigration enforcement. “The public can’t trust the administration to do the right thing on its own. The Republicans and Democrats must work together to make that happen.”

Mr. Schumer also made it clear that he was not impressed with a tonal shift by Republicans and the president and that he wanted immediate results.

“What ICE is doing is state-sanctioned thuggery and it must be stopped,” he said. “ICE must leave Minnesota today. Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.”

Videos of confrontations between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Minneapolis residents have flooded social media, showing some of the 3,000 officers who are deployed in the city stopping, questioning and detaining residents.

In one case, immigration agents escorted a U.S. citizen who is a grandfather of Hmong ancestry out of his house in his underwear in freezing weather. In another case, a father of a 5-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a U.S. citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a 5-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.

The events have sparked protests and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain you? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public versus a private space, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?

Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.

What rights do people have when approached by ICE?

Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone — including immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specializing in immigration cases.

The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.

For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions — such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest — require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the U.S. illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.

Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption,” said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed or would be committed.

Agents must meet an even higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause,” which generally requires enough evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.

What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?

Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.

In the 2025 case Noem v. Perdomo, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favor of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.

Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area,” Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile.”

Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling,” said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.

But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not co-signed by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility,” said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump v. Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?

The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.

“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as if an officer encounters a violent crime in progress, or someone needing medical care.

Securing a judicial warrant is time consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.

In the past, federal immigration officers typically would not forcibly enter homes if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE itself, without a judge’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.

Specific ICE officials have authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.

A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press reported Jan. 22.

The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo.”

The May 12, 2025, memo, signed by ICE acting director Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

If this policy were to be challenged in court, it’s unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.

What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?

If you believe that your rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, your options for suing for compensation are limited.

Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil lawsuits against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions, before tightening them again.

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”",https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2258022749.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 21:59:29.156435

Ilhan Omar attacked with unidentified substance at town hall in Minneapolis

Shrai Popat

At her first town hall of the year in Minneapolis, congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with an unidentified substance while making her opening remarks. Omar had just started speaking when a man sprayed her from the front row of the community center where the event is taking place in the north of the city.

The man was swiftly tackled to the ground by security, but Omar insisted on continuing the town hall despite the incident – refusing to let it stop her addressing constituents. The attacker, who did not identify a particular political affiliation when he sprayed Omar, was quickly escorted out of the room, as the crowd applauded his removal.

“I learned at a young age that you don’t give into threats,” Omar said.

Republican Senator Susan Collins said she has asked Kristi Noem to pause immigration operations in her home state of Maine as well as Minnesota, and called for an investigation into the shooting death of Alex Pretti.

“I believe they should be reviewed and far more targeted in their scope,” Collins said in a statement posted on social media. “At this time of heightened tensions, these steps are necessary to help improve trust, accountability, and safety.”

The senator told Maine Public Radio that she’s received calls from constituents fearful and angry over the campaign in her state, which has affected residents who are in the US legally. The White House’s recent changes, such as the decision to send Tom Homan to Minnesota, made Collins hopeful, the outlet reported.

Homan, Trump’s border czar, sat down with Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and law enforcement in the state on Tuesday, a meeting both Homan and Frey described as “productive”.

“We all agree that we need to support our law enforcement officers and get criminals off the streets. While we don’t agree on everything, these meetings were a productive starting point and I look forward to more conversations with key stakeholders in the days ahead,” Homan said.

Both Frey and Walz have asked that Operation Metro Surge end as soon as possible.

Lauren Gambino

Speaking on the Senate floor earlier today, the Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said Noem was “vicious” and a “liar” and must be fired in the wake of two fatal shootings in Minnesota.

“Donald Trump must fire her at once before another American is killed under her watch,” Schumer said.

Schumer’s caucus is facing a major decision as they prepare to vote against DHS funding, which is presently tied to a broader government funding package. To avert a partial shutdown, Republicans must persuade 10 Democrats to support the bill. But support for the measure, which appeared on track to pass last week, collapsed after Pretti’s killing, with nearly all Senate Democrats refusing to lend their votes without significant guardrails being placed on DHS.

Democrats have asked the Senate majority leader, John Thune, to strip DHS funding from the package and allow a vote to proceed with bipartisan support on funding the other departments, including, among others, defense, transportation and housing.

“The ball is in Leader Thune’s court,” Schumer said.

Thune has indicated that he is unlikely to split the package, and called on Democrats to clearly state their demands.

“Productive talks are ongoing, and I urge my Democrat colleagues to continue their engagement and find a path forward that will avoid a needless shutdown and not jeopardize full funding for key agencies like FEMA and the Coast Guard,” Thune said earlier.

The Republican senators Lisa Murkowski and Thom Tillis on Tuesday said Kristi Noem should resign from her post as the Department of Homeland Security secretary.

The senators are the first Republicans in Congress to do so, and their comments come as top House Democrats told Donald Trump to fire Noem or they would launch impeachment proceedings against her. More than 75% of House Democrats support efforts to impeach Noem, a number that has grown in recent days following the killing of Alex Pretti.

Tillis told reporters on Capitol Hill that he did not have confidence in Noem, NBC News reported. “I think she should go,” he said, describing some of her actions as “unacceptable” and “amateurish”.

Murkowski also told the outlet that Noem should go.

Two federal officers fired shots during encounter that killed Alex Pretti, DHS tells Congress

A Customs and Border Protection official told Congress that two federal officers fired their weapons in the encounter in Minneapolis that killed Alex Pretti, an American citizen and ICU nurse.

The Associated Press reports that a communication sent to Congress, and obtained by the news outlet, states that a border patrol officer fired his Glock and a CBP officer fired his. The agency is required to send such notifications to Congress.

According to the notification, investigators with CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility reviewed body-worn camera footage and agency documentation. An official alleged that Pretti resisted officers as they tried to take him into custody, and that amid a struggle a border patrol agent yelled “he’s got a gun” several times.

The killing, which was captured on camera, has sparked outrage and protests, particularly as Trump administration officials have sought to paint Pretti as a “would-be assassin” who was acting violently. Video of the incident directly contradicts that characterization of the shooting, and shows Pretti holding a phone when he was swarmed by federal agents, taken to the ground, and shot.

As the administration faces growing pressure over the incident, Donald Trump, who said Pretti should not have been carrying a gun, said on Tuesday: “I want to see the investigation. I’m going to be watching over it, and I want a very honorable and honest investigation. I have to see it myself.”

More than 75% of House Democrats support the impeachment of homeland security secretary Kristi Noem.

The office of Robin Kelly, an Illinois congresswoman who introduced the articles of impeachment, reported that 162 of the 213 House Democrats had signed on as co-sponsors by Tuesday.

Noem has faced growing criticism in recent days following the killing of Alex Pretti, a US citizen killed in the street by federal immigration agents. The secretary has claimed Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon, and acting “violently” toward officers, a characterization contradicted by video footage of the incident.

Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, and other top Democrats have urged Donald Trump to fire Noem otherwise they will seek her impeachment.

“The violence unleashed on the American people by the Department of Homeland Security must end forthwith. Kristi Noem should be fired immediately, or we will commence impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives,” Jeffries said in a joint statement, along with his two deputies, Katherine Clark and Pete Aguilar.

Trump said today that Noem has “done a very good job”.

Federal judge blocks deportation of five-year-old Minnesota boy and his father

Sam Levin

A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that a five-year-old Minnesota boy and his father cannot be immediately deported, one week after their arrest sparked international outrage.

A Texas-based judge issued an order saying Liam Ramos, the preschooler, and his father, Adrian Conejo Arias, cannot be removed or transferred out of the judicial district where they are being held while the litigation challenging their detention proceeds.

Liam’s arrest seven days prior went viral and became a symbol of the Trump administration’s relentless crackdown on immigrant communities in the Minneapolis region. Attorneys for the family have said the father and son have an active asylum case and had entered the US at an authorized port of entry.

Donald Trump said his administration plans to “de-escalate” in Minnesota after weeks of a massive, and deadly, immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis-St Paul.

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, the US president defended his administration’s campaign in the state, stating that ICE had taken “thousands of criminals out of Minnesota”. The operation and the killings of two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, by federal agents has drawn fierce condemnation and major protests.

Trump said border czar Tom Homan met with Minnesota governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey on Tuesday, and that “we’re gonna de-escalate a little bit”.

Congressman Joaquin Castro is set to meet with Liam Ramos, the preschooler who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota, and his father at a Texas detention center.

The Texas lawmaker said that he planned to visit Dilley Detention Center alongside Representative Jasmine Crockett on Wednesday.

Federal agents took the father and son, who have an active asylum case, into custody last week as the five-year-old returned home from school. Images of the child in a blue hat and an agent gripping the Spiderman backpack he carried sparked widespread outrage.

“He has become emblematic of the monstrosity of the ICE system and the detention system,” Castro said in a video shared on social media. “But the truth is Liam will be one of many kids … who are there in Dilley at that detention center.”

While speaking to diners in Iowa, Trump was asked if the US is now a defacto member of OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) vis a vis Trump “running” Venezuela.

Trump didn’t answer directly: “We are a very strong presence in Venezuela. We’re going to get a lot of money for Venezuela. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world … And we are working beautifully with Venezuela.”

After the US capture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump said Venezuela “going to do better now than they ever did that they’ve done ever had any point, and we’re going to be making a lot of money for them and a lot of money for our country.”

He was then asked what this means for Cuba. Looking around at the diners in Iowa, Trump asked: “Anybody interested in Cuba? Not too many.” He then quipped that there were many people who cared about the island’s fate in Miami.

“Cuba will be failing pretty soon,” he continued. “Cuba is really a nation that is very close to failing.”

Trump says Alex Pretti 'shouldn’t have been carrying a gun' and claims ignorance of his team's false claims about slain VA nurse

Answering reporter questions in the restaurant, Trump once again declined to agree with characterizations by his own team of Pretti as a domestic terrorist, claiming not to have heard those comments.

“He shouldn’t have been carrying a gun,” Trump said, adding “I don’t like that he had a gun.” Minneapolis Police has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry a firearm. The assertion that he should not have carried a gun has drawn significant pushback from pro-second amendment groups, including the NRA, which are usually in lockstep with Republicans on matters of gun rights.

Even then, he said you’d have to be a “stupid person” not to think what happened to Pretti was “very unfortunate”.

Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, described Pretti as a “would-be assassin” and a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement”.

Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem claimed Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon, acting “violently” toward officers, which is plainly contradicted by video footage showing that he was holding a phone, not a gun, and was disarmed before he was killed.

Gregory Bovino, who has since left his post as Border Patrol commander, claimed without any evidence that Pretti wanted to “massacre law enforcement” and that the agents were “the victims”.

Since beginning his second term, U.S. President Donald Trump has sent federal and immigration agents into cities he has alleged are overridden with crime, including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Charlotte, N.C.

But Minneapolis has seen a greater number of federal agents, as well as sustained opposition from residents — and fatal violence.

Federal agents were initially sent into Minnesota's twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in early December.

But on Jan. 6, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it would add another 2,000 federal agents to the cities, prompting thousands of people to take to the streets on a near-daily basis, demanding ICE leave their city.

Since then, two U.S. citizens have been shot and killed in Minneapolis at the hands of ICE agents and a five-year-old child detained alongside his father.

Here’s how we got to this point.

Why was ICE sent to Minnesota?

ICE agents were part of a targeted operation at the University of Minnesota last fall that was linked to alleged fraud. During a press conference about the operation, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested more federal agents would be deployed to the Twin Cities, saying, “ If you’re here illegally, go home.”

On Dec. 1, DHS launched Operation Metro Surge, targeting the city’s “worst criminal illegal aliens.”

A few days later, Trump went on a tirade against Somali immigrants. He called them “garbage,” adding “we don’t want them in our country.”

Days before, his Treasury Secretary had shared a social media post from a conservative activist, known for his fight against critical race theory and DEI, about alleged fraud in the Somali community.

Minnesota has the largest population of Somali immigrants in the country. About 84,000 people of Somali descent live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Most of them are American citizens.

During the month of December, ICE agents carried out several raids and made several arrests in Minneapolis.

Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is of Somali descent, told CBS News her son was pulled over on Dec. 14 and asked to prove his citizenship. She said he did and was not detained, but that agents had also entered the mosque where her son prayed, and accused them of ""racially profiling"" people in her community.

""They are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented,"" Omar said.

Following hundreds of arrests and detentions in just the first two weeks of the operation, including of Americans who said they were targeted because of race, Somali Americans in Minneapolis told CBC News they were scared to leave their homes.

“There’s people that aren’t leaving their house, because they’re scared of being mistaken for someone else and being captured,” said Farah, a member of the Somali community who is an American citizen.

January surge

On Jan. 6, the Trump administration ordered a surge of 2,000 more ICE agents into Minneapolis.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Todd Lyons called the crackdown the agency's ""largest immigration operation ever"" in an interview on right-wing cable news network Newsmax.

Minnesota had been at the centre of several recent fraud scandals, including a $300-million US pandemic food fraud scheme revolving around the non-profit group Feeding Our Future, for which 57 defendants in the state have been convicted. Most of the defendants were Somali Americans.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democrats criticized Trump and his allies for statements that appeared to blame the entire diaspora for actions committed by just dozens of people and suggested the surge of ICE agents to the Twin Cities was directly related.

Reaction to the surge

The surge brought protesters to the streets. People called on ICE to leave.

One day later, Renee Nicole Good was shot and killed by an ICE agent. The agency said she was blocking the street.

Protests increased both in the city and across the country after Good’s death.

But Trump administration officials defended the agent’s actions, saying Good had “weaponized her vehicle” and tried to mow down the ICE agents. Video contradicted that account.

Over the next weeks, there were more arrests, and more high-profile incidents, including a woman who told agents she was autistic being pulled from her car and thrown to the ground, the detention of a five-year-old boy and, on Saturday, the fatal shooting of nurse Alex Pretti.

On Saturday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller on social media described Pretti as an ""assassin"" who ""tried to murder federal agents."" U.S. Vice-President JD Vance reshared the post. Video of the shooting appeared to contradict Miller's assessment.

Possible de-escalation

On Monday, Trump held calls with both Gov. Walz and Mayor Frey. Following the calls, which all sides said were productive, Frey said federal agents could start leaving the city as soon as Tuesday.

California legislative Democrats are urging their congressional colleagues to shut down the federal government and block further funding to immigration enforcement agencies after agents shot and killed another civilian in Minnesota over the weekend.

At least 50 Democratic state senators and assemblymembers — more than half the party’s caucus — on Monday decried the slaying of Alex Pretti, the Minneapolis resident and Veterans Affairs intensive care nurse who on Saturday was gunned down by federal immigration enforcement agents.

The lawmakers proclaimed their solidarity with Minnesota and other cities and states that have been targeted by federal law enforcement agents. They railed against what they called the Trump administration’s militarization of American cities as some wiped away tears.

The previously bipartisan spending package, which would fund the departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services and Homeland Security, awaits a vote in the U.S. Senate, where an increasing number of Democrats have vowed to filibuster it.

But California lawmakers warned that Senate Democrats, many of whom represent battleground states, might cave and give Republicans the votes they need to push the measure to President Donald Trump’s desk.

“This message is for Sen. Chuck Schumer,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, Democrat of Hayward. “Do your job. Stand for something. Don’t fold again.”

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, Democrat of Salinas, called for Schumer to “step aside” if he couldn’t keep his caucus in lockstep.

Rivas and his colleagues also had a message for Republican lawmakers.

“We need you to speak out. You cannot watch these videos coming out of Minneapolis, Minn. and think that this is acceptable,” Rivas said. “We need your voice, we need your solidarity, and standing up for American values.”

In reference to the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a permitted weapon, Assemblymember Mark Gonzalez of Los Angeles quoted a 2018 tweet from the late Charlie Kirk, which stated that the Second Amendment wasn’t for hunting or self protection, but “to ensure that free people can defend themselves if, god forbid, government became tyrannical and turned against its citizens.”

“What do you call a masked agent killing people in the street? What do you call children being taken from families?” Gonzalez said.

He noted that the National Rifle Association condemned premature conclusions about the shooting as “dangerous and wrong.”

“Even the NRA is calling out the dangerous ignorance of federal officials trying to excuse the killing of Alex Pretti,” Gonzalez said. “When even staunch defenders of the Second Amendment recognize the need for accountability, we must listen.”

So far, California Republicans have targeted their criticism mainly at Democrats. Republican legislative leadership deferred to other members of their caucus when asked for comment.

Sen. Tony Strickland, Republican of Huntington Beach, said Democratic officials have created risky and unsafe conditions for both the agents and civilian onlookers through so-called “sanctuary” policies that limit local and state law enforcement from working with federal immigration agents. They argue that those policies create risky situations where civilians like Pretti feel they need to monitor and track officers.

“Stop the rhetoric that ICE agents are Gestapo, that they’re secret police, that they’re Nazis,” said Assemblymember James Gallagher of Chico, the former Republican Assembly leader who recently announced his bid for the special election to fulfill the final months of the late Rep. Doug LaMalfa’s congressional term. “This type of rhetoric is helping to contribute to the chaotic environment in places like Minnesota.”

Gallagher called Pretti’s death a “terrible thing” and called for an independent investigation and accountability.

Legislation calls for greater ICE oversight

Some lawmakers are committing to introduce new measures to curtail the power of federal agents.

“Certainly this is a frustrating situation because so much of the power and the authority here is in the hands of the federal government in Washington, D.C., but that doesn’t mean that the answer for us is to do nothing,” said Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, Democrat of Encino.

Gabriel plans to introduce a bill that would require the California attorney general to conduct an independent investigation into any shooting by federal immigration enforcement agents in the state, an extension of an existing law that already requires such investigations for shootings by local and state law enforcement. He will also co-author a bill with Assemblymember Juan Carrillothat would ban federal immigration enforcement agencies from using state resources to facilitate their operations, such as staging equipment and personnel on state property.

“We have to use every tool at our disposal, every lawful opportunity that we have to use our power, our authority to think of all of the different ways that we can push back,” Gabriel said.

Also on deck for a vote in the California Senate this week is Senate Bill 747 co-authored by Sen. Aisha Wahab of Hayward and Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who is running to replace Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi in Congress, that would allow Californians to sue federal agents for civil rights violations. The bill builds upon Wiener’s measure from last year that banned federal immigration enforcement agents from wearing masks, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law.

Wiener argued that the issue should not be partisan.

“This is really about everyone’s rights under any federal administration,” Wiener told CalMatters on Monday. “Local and state law enforcement are already subject to civil rights liability if they violate someone’s rights, and federal agents effectively are not,” he said.

“This is simply seeking to apply the same standards for all law enforcement.”

The hearing was a chance for leaders in both cities to talk about what they've seen and what they've learned.

It comes as Chicago is preparing for what they expect will be renewed immigration enforcement activity in the area.

And Mayor Brandon Johnson is looking for ways to hold federal agents accountable.

Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino's days in Minneapolis are over. The news was welcomed cautiously by immigrant advocates there and in Chicago.

""Personally, I want to say that. I want to say, 'good riddance,'"" said Ald. Rosanna Rodriguez Sanchez, who represents the 33rd Ward and is chair of the Committee on Health and Human Relations. ""Second, I don't have any hopes that the Trump administration is going to send anybody that is more humane than him because what they have shown is a complete disregard for our humanity.""

The concerns about the deadly shootings of two people in Minneapolis this month, Renee Good and then Alex Pretti, prompted Mayor Johnson to call for new ways to respond besides demonstrations and protests.

""We have to seriously look at how local government can ultimately not just bring charges and investigation against the federal overreach, but how we can create a process that allows for prosecution of these individuals,"" Johnson said.

The City Council committee meeting was a chance for leaders from the Twin Cities and Chicago to share valuable lessons learned about federal agents' enforcement tactics and how to adapt.

""So, we're seeing folks, instead of military garb, they're wearing baseball caps, beanies, sunglasses, hoodies, puffy jackets, blue jeans, but to minimize their tactical gear because they are trying to blend in,"" St. Paul Council Vice President Hwa Jeong Kim said.

Chicago-area advocates are preparing for a possible resurgence in immigration enforcement in March. They're ready to adjust their response as needed.

""So I think, for us, it's to stay focused, keeps our eyes on the prize, which means continuing to do, 'know your rights,' continuing to educate people on what to do if they see ICE, and then also connecting people to the resources that they need once they are impacted by the raids,"" said Rey Wences, with Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.

Mayor Johnson wants to see more organized resistance.

""As what we saw organized or prepared during the civil rights movement, that we cannot just simply leave it to protest, that just react to the egregious and the harmful and deadly actions coming from the Trump administration,"" Johnson said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18487848_012726-wls-wall-ice-local-430p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-27 19:58:03.309281

During the debate on the state Senate floor Tuesday, several Democratic lawmakers called Pretti’s death an execution or murder.
Under U.S. Code Section 1983, a person can sue state and local officials who violate their constitutional rights.
A state law also allows lawsuits against state and local officials for interfering with a person’s constitutional rights by force or threat.
When it comes to filing legal action against federal officials, lawsuits can be brought through the Bivens doctrine, which refers to the 1971 Supreme Court ruling in Bivens vs. Six Unknown Federal Agents that established that federal officials can be sued for monetary damages for constitutional violations.","Amid a national uproar over the recent killing of a Minnesota man by immigration agents, the California Senate on Tuesday approved proposed legislation that would make it easier to sue law enforcement officials suspected of violating an individual’s constitutional rights.

Senate Bill 747 by Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) creates a pathway for residents to take legal action against federal agents for the excessive use of force, unlawful home searches, interfering with a right to protest and other violations.

The bill, which cleared a Senate committee earlier this year, passed 30-10, along Democrat and Republican party lines.

Other states, including New York and Connecticut, are weighing similar legislation following widespread anger over the actions during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns and raids.

Existing laws already allow lawsuits against state and local law enforcement officials. But it is much harder to bring claims against a federal officers. Wiener said his bill would rectify those impediments.

Several state law enforcement agencies oppose the legislation, arguing it will also be used to sue local officers.

Tuesday’s vote follows the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday by federal officials, who tackled him to the ground, appeared to remove his holstered handgun and then shot Pretti several times in the back. During the debate on the state Senate floor Tuesday, several Democratic lawmakers called Pretti’s death an execution or murder.

Renee Good, a 37-year old mother of three, was also shot and killed by agents earlier this month in Minnesota in what federal officials have alleged was an act of self defense when she drove her vehicle toward an officer — an assertion under dispute.

The deaths, as well as the government’s insistence that immigration agents don’t require judicial warrants to enter homes, have outraged Democrats leaders, who accuse federal officers of flouting laws as they seek to deport thousands of undocumented immigrants.

Wiener, speaking to reporters before Tuesday’s vote, said that his legislation would reform the law to ensure that federal officials are held accountable for wrongdoing.

“Under current law, if a local or state officer shoots your mom...or publicly executes an ICU nurse, you can sue,” said Wiener. “That’s longstanding civil rights law, but in the current law, it’s almost impossible to file that same lawsuit against the federal agent who does the exact same thing.”

During Tuesday’s debate on the senate floor, Sen. Tony Strickland (R-Huntington Beach) acknowledged the “chaos” in Minnesota, but criticized the bill as being about immigration politics. He urged his colleagues to focus on the state’s affordability crisis, rather than challenges to the federal government.

“We need to start focusing on California-specific issues like gas, gas prices,” said Strickland.

Strickland’s comments drew a rebuke from Sen. Susan Rubio, (D-West Covina) who said the bill wasn’t about immigration, but “about the egregious violation of people’s rights. and the murders that we are witnessing.”

“This is about equal justice under the law,” said Rubio, a one-time undocumented citizen.

Wiener’s bill now heads to the state Assembly. The senator, who is running to fill the seat by outgoing Rep. Nancy Pelosi, told reporters that he didn’t know if Gov. Gavin Newsom supports his legislation or if he would sign it into law if it passes the full Legislature.

Wiener’s proposed law was put forth after George Retes Jr, a California security guard was detained following a July raid in Camarillo. Retes, a U.S. citizen and Army veteran, said he was held for three days without the ability to make a phone call or see an attorney.

Retes has accused Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin of spreading false information about him to justify his detention. The Homeland Security department said in a statement last year that Retes impeded its operation, which he denies.

Under U.S. Code Section 1983, a person can sue state and local officials who violate their constitutional rights. A state law also allows lawsuits against state and local officials for interfering with a person’s constitutional rights by force or threat.

When it comes to filing legal action against federal officials, lawsuits can be brought through the Bivens doctrine, which refers to the 1971 Supreme Court ruling in Bivens vs. Six Unknown Federal Agents that established that federal officials can be sued for monetary damages for constitutional violations.

But in recent decades, the Supreme Court has repeatedly restricted the ability to sue under Bivens. Some Supreme Court justices have also argued that it’s up to Congress to pass a statute that would allow federal officers to be sued when they violate the Constitution.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a158841/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3787x1988+0+287/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2F91%2Fbb6cd72745e7ab3ec66077ad4e5a%2F1511112-me-0620-ice-action-bell-gem-014.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 19:58:34.293721

The deed, signed Jan. 22, shows the property was purchased from FRND-Hopewell, LLC for $102.4 million.

FRND-Hopewell is a holding company with the same address as RSE Capital, an investment firm started by Fundrise, a real estate investment crowdsourcing app.

The deed was unearthed by Project Salt Box, a Maryland ICE watchdog.

The Hagerstown warehouse was part of a leaked ICE list of multiple locations across the U.S. that are possibly being targeted for procurement to hold as many as 80,000 detained immigrants.

The possible creation of a detention center in Hagerstown has been a point of concern for the Maryland Congressional delegation, which sent a letter to DHS on Jan. 20 about it.

“It is our understanding that such a facility would be used to house noncitizens for as long as ‘a few weeks’ prior to their transfer to large-scale warehouses to facilitate deportations,” the members of the delegation wrote. “Recently, we learned that last week a DHS official visited a potential processing facility site which is not designed or outfitted to house, feed, or provide adequate care for detainees. It is deeply concerning that the proposed location is situated in an area of Washington County that is not zoned for overnight habitation, creating a direct conflict between DHS and local law.”

The delegation requested “all documentation, including but not limited to planning materials, solicitations, proposals, site assessments, and communications concerning the establishment of a processing facility in Hagerstown, Maryland and any other locations where ICE operations are planned or have been established in our state since January 20, 2025” in the letter.

DHS’s outright ownership of the facility may have been an attempt to circumvent Maryland’s Dignity Not Detention Act.

“Politically, it’s hurting our chances at the midterms — and I’m just being frank about it,” Gimenez told Newsmax.
Since the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) launch of “Operation Metro Surge” in the state, federal agents have shot and killed two people.
However, a growing number of GOP lawmakers are expressing their own concerns about federal agents’ tactics in Minnesota.
Following the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis, retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) called for a “thorough and impartial investigation.” “For this specific incident, that requires cooperation and transparency between federal, state, and local law enforcement,” he said.","Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez expressed concerns Tuesday that the Trump administration’s tactics in its hard-line immigration crackdown could hurt the GOP heading into the midterm elections.

“Politically, it’s hurting our chances at the midterms — and I’m just being frank about it,” Gimenez told Newsmax. “And the most important thing we have to do is actually keep the majority, because if not, we’re going to go back to the policies of President Biden and open borders, and that’s the last thing we want to do.”

Gimenez, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee’s Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security, said it’s “time we reevaluate how we do things” when it comes to cracking down on illegal immigration.

He pointed to the “loss of life” in Minnesota and welcomed Trump’s decision to send border czar Tom Homan to the state as the administration sidelines Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino.

The Florida Republican said he’s told the White House about his concerns, adding he’s “not comfortable with what’s happening in Minneapolis at this time.”

“There’s got to be a better way,” Gimenez said, arguing the administration should be going after criminals “one at a time,” adding that Americans did not support deporting “grandmothers or somebody who’s taking care of kids and has been here 10, 15 years.”

“And actually, we have to face reality: There is no practical way to actually deport 20 million people, so we have to find a solution to this,” he said.

Gimenez’s comments follow weeks of the Trump administration’s intense immigration operation in Minnesota. Since the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) launch of “Operation Metro Surge” in the state, federal agents have shot and killed two people.

The administration initially sought to label the latest victim, Alex Pretti, as a domestic terrorist over the weekend, but has since backed off that rhetoric, with Trump backing an “honorable” investigation into the shooting.

Democratic lawmakers have denounced federal law enforcement’s actions in the state, calling for the removal or impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Democrats in the Senate say they will block a major funding package this week unless funding allocated for DHS is stripped out. If the Senate fails to pass the funding by the Friday deadline, the government will be partially shut down.

Republican leadership has dismissed the idea of taking out provisions for DHS. However, a growing number of GOP lawmakers are expressing their own concerns about federal agents’ tactics in Minnesota.

Following the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis, retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) called for a “thorough and impartial investigation.”

“For this specific incident, that requires cooperation and transparency between federal, state, and local law enforcement,” he said. “Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”

A Customs and Border Protection official said in the notice that officers tried to take Pretti into custody and he resisted, leading to a struggle. During the struggle, a Border Patrol agent yelled, ""He's got a gun!"" multiple times, the official said.

In 2000, Schiltz returned to Minnesota to help re-launch the University of St. Thomas law school, a project driven by Catholics eager to establish Catholic-oriented legal education in the Twin Cities.","It’s only fitting, then, that Schiltz — a quintessential son of Minnesota who once wrote the literal chapter and verse on how to live a happy, balanced life as a lawyer — has long harbored a passion for professional wrestling.

Schiltz is perhaps an unlikely figure to emerge as the latest hero to the anti-Trump resistance. The Harvard Law School grad carved his professional identity in traditional conservative circles. He advocated for the appointment of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, took up conservative causes during his stint in private practice and clerked for Scalia twice — once on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and again at the Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed him unanimously to the bench in 2006.

“He comes from a traditionally conservative point of view, but he’s a rule of law guy,” said former federal prosecutor Mark Osler, now a law professor at the University of St. Thomas. “He’s been regarded as a rock-solid, generally-conservative judge on the bench, but with that comes things other than loyalty to the administration.”

As a newly minted lawyer, Schiltz lamented ideological orthodoxy among elite law students and described the faculty of those schools as “overwhelmingly leftist.” But his own early political leanings were somewhat murky. He worked as an intern and paid staffer for Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.), but also served as a delegate at Democratic Farmer-Labor Party conventions.

After law school and his Supreme Court clerkship, Schiltz returned to Minnesota and spent several years handling civil litigation at Faegre & Benson. He represented the Minnesota Vikings, the NFL, the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, several Roman Catholic dioceses and even the Star Tribune. But he and his wife quit big law in 1999 — forsaking a large payout from the firm’s Exxon Valdez settlement — and took jobs teaching at Notre Dame.

They have three adult children, including a son with Down Syndrome, who was at home under Schiltz’s care last week when the Justice Department urgently sought the Lemon arrest warrant, according to a letter the judge sent to a federal appeals court.

At Notre Dame, Schiltz taught Amy Coney (now Barrett) as a student, later recommending her for her own clerkship with Scalia.

In 2000, Schiltz returned to Minnesota to help re-launch the University of St. Thomas law school, a project driven by Catholics eager to establish Catholic-oriented legal education in the Twin Cities. “This founding group believed that there was a Catholic perspective that had something to offer,” Osler said.

Schiltz, who served as the school’s founding associate dean, described it as a “faith-in-action” approach. While St. Thomas is noted for having an intellectually diverse faculty, Schiltz told a Catholic magazine in 2002 that the professors included only two people who had ever voted Republican.

At his confirmation hearing in 2006, Schiltz said he’d helped advise C-SPAN on how to lobby the Supreme Court to open its arguments to TV cameras, even though his mentor, Scalia, remained adamantly opposed. In his Senate questionnaire, Schiltz also declared himself a member of Catholics Against Capital Punishment.

Schiltz’s position as chief judge is not an elected one. The seven-year-term is awarded on the basis of seniority, with judges ineligible to assume the position once they turn 65. Schiltz began his tenure as chief with a warning about the security of judges, telling the Star Tribune that “mobs” have increasingly made them targets of political rage and violent threats.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fbc%2F5b%2Fef755ffa4433aa55fab05a02a21e%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2257455073,N,,2026-01-27 18:59:26.073367

The Helena City Commission voted 4-1 on Monday on a resolution reiterating its support for immigrant communities and a reminder of its policy and procedures surrounding interaction with federal law enforcement. Additionally, the resolution stipulates city police officers can ask federal agents to unmask and identify themselves at their discretion and in situations that officers believe it isn’t interfering with federal work.

The city took up the resolution in the midst of two recent killings of citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents and increasing dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. It comes six months after a Helena resident was caught up in enforcement.

But some city officials expressed concerns such actions laid out in the resolution would potentially lead to being charged with obstruction of justice.

“I would be concerned with compelling that action of an officer, because it could be seen as obstructing justice,” Helena City Attorney Rebecca Dockter told the commission on Monday.

The resolution comes six months after Christopher Martinez was arrested by law enforcement after a request from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop him, believing him to be someone else they were investigating. A Helena Police Officer joked he was being kidnapped and Martinez, who was trying to stay in the country legally, faced deportation and eventually left to return to Mexico.

The case sparked outrage in Helena and beyond, with Martinez’s lawyers arguing in court he was racially profiled.

Since then, Helena has pulled out of a regional drug task force, city officials said on Monday night, and commenters on the resolution heavily praised steps the police force has taken, saying they’ve taken the concerns seriously.

“(Martinez) was arrested because he was mistaken for a different brown man. That is embarrassing, and I do think that the city recognizes that with how swift the response was, this resolution came out very quickly after the initial arrest,” Emilia Hitchcock, a Helena attorney, told the commission, adding “the Helena Police Department has clearly tried to make some changes.”

Many in attendance viewed the resolution as a first step as city officials were asked to protect their citizens from federal agents. Federal officers have killed two people in Minneapolis, including Alex Pretti, a 37-year old nurse at a VA Hospital who was shot Saturday. Some in attendance on Monday were openly wondering if similar events could play out in Helena.

“We’ve seen it happen elsewhere,” said Shani Henry, a Helena resident. “We should not kid ourselves that it won’t happen here.”

There was unfiltered disgust by those in attendance with violent immigration tactics and a deep anger that fundamental liberties Americans enjoy were being taken away.

“This is not public safety. This is not justice,” said Valerie Hellermann, executive director of the Helena Area Refugee Resettlement Team. “We don’t want this in Helena, our local law enforcement should not be obligated to cooperate with practices that undermine trust, due process, and human dignity.”

Overflow rooms were full at the City-County building, and 62 people gave comments to the City Commission in person, while another 11 spoke via Zoom. Additional written comments were also collected during the meeting. The meeting lasted about four hours, with around three of those dedicated to the resolution.

All but about five of the comments were in support of the resolution. Speakers included two Montana State senators — Laura Smith and Mary Ann Dunwell, both Democrats representing Helena — as well as community leaders at advocacy organizations, religious groups and a wave of concerned citizens.

“(The resolution) requests that the city take steps to ensure that the residents here know that the city is on our side and not on the side of a federal agency that is terrorizing black and brown people as a pretext for harassing cities that vote for Democrats,” said SK Rossi, who spoke on the resolution as a local business owner. “That’s the reality of what is happening here, and we should be opposing it with every fiber of our beings.”

One long-time Helena resident, an immigrant, spoke about the fear she has driving to Target with her daughter, and how they now have photos of their passports on their phones.

“You never know,” said Linda Cleatus, describing that fear.

Multiple members of the Helena LGBTQ+ community also spoke, relaying fears about how the persecution they’ve faced is now expanding to other groups.

“As a politically targeted community that has lived in increasing fear, we recognize and refuse to ignore it when we see it happening to other communities,” Shawn Reagor, with Montana Gender Alliance, told the Commission.

Well over 100 community members gathered before the City Commission meeting on the steps of the City-County building, waving signs over an hour before the Commission meeting started.

Some discussion was had over several amendments to the resolution proposed by Commissioner Melinda Reed. They dealt with data collection, including one with the ethnicity of the person being stopped and another asking the department track how often they “officially” coordinate with federal immigration officers. Coordination with various federal law enforcement agencies happens nearly daily, on a wide variety of issues, city officials said Monday.

Police officers also cannot legally ask a person’s race during a stop, but the data is informally collected by officers and reviewed twice per year. If there are issues with those stops, an internal investigation is launched, police officials said Monday night.

“If we notice flags or anything that’s super concerning on that, that would generate a review of their traffic stops,” said Helena Police Lt. Adam Shanks.

Additionally, racial data from stops is collected per state code, though Shanks said that he called the state Board of Crime Control and they didn’t have it on hand, because they’re not supposed to share the data unless it’s formally requested.

“The people I spoke with on the Board of Crime Control and Data Warehouse don’t actually know how to get that information,” Shanks said.

None of the amendments passed, leading to some frustration among attendees when the matter was put to vote at almost 10 p.m.

Sen. Ellie Boldman, a Missoula Democrat, has also proposed legislation to have immigration officers clearly mark who they are, to not wear masks and to have certain areas be protected from raids.

There was also a sense the resolution was just one step in protecting Helena citizens and more action was going to be asked for by members of the public.

“Today’s vote matters in and of itself for what it means to set a standard for a welcoming community committed to civil and to human rights,” Rachel Carroll Rivas, a longtime human rights activist in Helena, told the commission. “But today is also practice, practice for the potential consequential moments that are to come when you will be needed by this community to stand in your power in opposition to authoritarianism when it comes knocking on the door of Helena.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/HelenaCC1-2048x1315.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 18:58:51.020529

Republicans, led by a president who rose to power with promises to build a Southern border wall and carry out mass deportations, are now trying to dodge an issue that polls had long shown to be a strength for them.

Democrats, who have for years tried to change the political subject to health care or abortion rights, are now racing to talk about immigration and harness their voters’ rage over the fatal shootings in Minnesota.

The shift could be fleeting. American politics has rarely felt so unsettled and unpredictable, with President Trump just as responsive to television coverage as to on-the-ground realities. On Monday, he shook up the leadership of his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and seemed inclined to try to calm tensions, at least for now.

But in the meantime, both parties are adjusting on the fly as a midterm election year they thought would center on the cost of living abruptly seems far more focused on immigration and federal power.

In Illinois and New Mexico, Democratic candidates this week began running advertisements highlighting their opposition to federal immigration operations. Others in Maine and New Jersey have upended their campaign messaging, long directed at high costs, to address their voters’ anger about deportations. The party’s primary candidates for Senate spoke forcefully against Mr. Trump’s immigration policies during recent debates in Texas and Illinois.

Democratic members of Congress including Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Representative Ro Khanna of California have braved snowstorms and subzero temperatures to fly to Minneapolis and meet — and be seen — with activists on the ground. Others have led rallies against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in their home states. And Senate Democrats have quickly grown an appetite for again shutting down the federal government over funding for Mr. Trump’s Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE.

Top Republican leaders and many candidates in tough races have struggled for a response to the chaos in Minnesota. Speaker Mike Johnson has still not issued a statement, while Senator John Thune, the majority leader, praised Mr. Trump’s shake-up in Minnesota as a positive step for “turning down the temperature.”

At the same time, a parade of other politicians in the party have expressed concerns about the killings and the aggressiveness of federal immigration authorities.

Chris Madel, a Republican candidate for governor of Minnesota governor, called the federal immigration operation “a disaster” as he dropped out on Monday. Representative Glenn Grothman, from next-door Wisconsin, suggested that the latest shooting by a federal agent was “murder.” Even Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, known for his hard-line immigration approach, suggested that the White House should “recalibrate” its strategy.

“Immigration enforcement used to be a strong point for Republicans,” said Adam Jentleson, the president of the Searchlight Institute, a moderate Democratic think tank, who two weeks ago released a memo warning Democrats to avoid the phrase “Abolish ICE.” “Republicans thought that there was no version of enforcement that people would reject, and they were wrong about that.”

The political risks for Republicans in battleground states and districts have become clear, with polls showing voters souring on Mr. Trump’s immigration tactics. A New York Times/Siena poll released last week — conducted before the latest shooting in Minnesota — showed that while roughly half of voters supported his deportations, a sizable majority believed that ICE had gone too far, including a remarkable 71 percent of politically crucial independent voters.

“Even if the administration is telling the truth, the perception is immediately colored against ICE because of how much fear and anxiety has piled up,” said Preya Samsundar, a Republican strategist in Minneapolis. “If this continues to go on, it could cause some issues with the gains we have been able to make as a party.”

Democrats say their change in focus is being driven by fury from their voters, who want to know what their representatives will do to try to stop Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown.

“In every conversation, it is brought up,” said Tahesha Way, a Democratic former lieutenant governor of New Jersey who is running in a special election to the U.S. House next week. “People not only see what’s going on nationally in Minnesota — they’re living in fear as to what is happening on the ground here in New Jersey.”

The wave of Democratic outrage could force another government shutdown at the end of the week. Key Senate Democrats have promised to oppose bipartisan legislation to fund a broad swath of the government because it includes billions of dollars for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Several suggested they were open to eventually including such funding, but they demanded more guardrails to “rein in the abuses of ICE,” as Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, put it.

How Americans might respond to another shutdown is one uncertain factor in the ever-changing political calculus. And Republicans have hardly given up their tough-on-immigration stance: In television ads broadcast this year, there have been more than twice as many Republican ads highlighting such positions than Democratic spots criticizing ICE tactics, according to data from AdImpact, a media tracking firm.

Some Democrats warn that voters broadly have not rejected the overall goal of combating illegal immigration that helped twice elect Mr. Trump to the White House.

“This is a topic that Democrats have an imperative to engage on, but they still need to do it the right way,” said Molly Murphy, a Democratic pollster who worked in 2024 for the campaigns of President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Voters believe a secure border is important and that Trump’s tactics are not doing that.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/pol-campaign-immig-hjcq/pol-campaign-immig-hjcq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 20:59:05.030468

The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights announced a new lawsuit Monday against federal immigration agencies for claims of inhumane conditions at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County.

The organization claims people detained in the Adelanto facility lack drinkable water, healthy food, clean clothes, places to sleep and access to medical care. Failing to provide these basic necessities, CHIRLA says in court documents, amounts to punishment — violating detainees rights to due process.

“ We are really at a moment where we are seeing a human rights crisis right before our eyes,” CHIRLA policy director Jeanette Zanipatin said at a news conference Monday. “And the detention centers, especially the one at Adelanto, is where we are seeing it unfold in real time.”

Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.

“We’re asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.

ICE and Homeland Security have not responded to LAist about the case or claims in this article.

A question of constitutional rights

When CHIRLA announced the lawsuit on Monday, Zanipatin said there has been “a long history of unsafe and abusive conditions” at the Adelanto facility. She referenced a July 2025 report from the nonprofit Disability Rights California that found conditions at the facility were “dangerous and inadequate for all people, especially for those with disabilities.”

Court documents filed by CHIRLA also reference previous reports that found issues at the facility, including a 2018 report from the DHS Office of Inspector General that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”

Those issues included findings of nooses in detainees’ cells, improper use of disciplinary segregation and inadequate medical care.

“Based on interviews with detainees and medical staff and a review of independent reports,” the report states, “we concluded that detainees do not have timely access to proper medical care.”

CHIRLA claims in their lawsuit that Adelanto leadership rejected the findings of the inspector general report and took no corrective action.

The concerns raised by CHIRLA as they announced the lawsuit closely resemble the findings of Disability Rights California, which also claimed detainees were not provided adequate medical care, food, water or clean clothing. The organization also reported that some people had limited access to communication with their loved ones.

Huerta claimed that the conditions in the Adelanto facility are poor by design.

“ Adelanto, like most ICE prisons, is engineered to be so punishing, so relentlessly soul crushing, that people abandon their rights and accept deportation even when they have strong asylum claims or a clear pathway to legal status,” Huerta said.

He said 32 people died while detained by ICE nationwide in 2025, and at least 6 more have died in January. Two people died at Adelanto last fall, Huerta said.

Family members speak out

Mariel Garcia told LAist she would call her father, Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, nearly every day. That ended when he was detained by immigration agents in Costa Mesa on Oct. 14.

Garcia-Aviles had a work permit, his daughter said, but he was detained and taken to Adelanto. She said she tried many times to ask the facility staff to allow her to call her father, or even to get an update on his condition, but she was never able to talk to him again.

Worried, she said she got a call from the staff at Adelanto.

“ They called me the day he was passing away,” Garcia told LAist, “They’re like, go tell your family and friends to come and say their last goodbyes because your father’s in critical condition.”

Her brother, Gabriel Garcia, said that when they arrived at the hospital their father was intubated and “lifeless.” Still, he said, there were law enforcement officers standing outside the hospital room.

Garcia-Aviles died Oct. 23 at age 56.

Jose Ayala also talked about the loss of his brother, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, while he was detained in the Adelanto facility.

“ He was there for about a month and we knew nothing of his condition,” Ayala said at Monday’s press conference, “just that he was sick and that he wasn’t getting any help when he asked.”

Ayala said his family learned of his brother’s death when the police came and knocked at their door. He said staff at Adelanto did not tell them Ayala-Uribe had been hospitalized or that he needed a surgery, which ICE said in a news release was for an abscess.

Ayala told LAist that he was able to talk with his brother over the phone a couple of times when he was detained, and Ayala-Uribe was joking with him about the poor conditions of the facility causing him to lose weight.

“ One of the last things he told me,” Ayala recalled, “was, ‘We’ll see who comes out skinnier.’”

He said his brother was 39 when he died on Sept. 22, 2025.

CHIRLA alleges in court documents that staff at Adelanto were aware Ayala-Uribe was having a potentially life-threatening medical emergency three days before his death, but he was taken back to his cell after being seen by the facility’s medical team.

An ICE news release said Ayala-Uribe “was evaluated by an on-call medical provider Sept. 18, provided medication, and returned to his dormitory,” but did not mention the severity of his condition.

The cause of both deaths remain under investigation, CHIRLA said in an accompanying news release.",https://img.lbpost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/27134129/adelanto-lawsuit-scprbrightspotcdn-207983-0q8oxxwm-822023-ytLvJ5Yx.webp,N,,2026-01-27 21:59:41.438353

'Not afraid to push the envelope' ICE has led interior immigration enforcement since it was created in 2003, but the Border Patrol has been around much longer.","The commander of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in Minneapolis is leaving the city after federal agents fatally shot two people in less than three weeks.

Gregory Bovino had been the go-to architect for the large-scale immigration crackdowns ordered by Trump and the public face of his administration's city-by-city sweeps. The Border Patrol chief led agents in Los Angeles, Chicago and New Orleans before he headed to Minnesota in December for what the Department of Homeland Security called its largest-ever immigration enforcement operation.

He's also been heavily criticized for his norm-breaking tactics.

Here's what to know about Bovino's career, methods and approach:

Smashing car windows

Bovino revels in breaking norms. Agents have smashed car windows, blown open a door to a house and patrolled the fabled MacArthur Park in Los Angeles on horseback.

Smashing windows when a driver refuses to open and is subject to arrest is ""a safer tactic than letting someone drive away and then getting in a high-speed pursuit,"" he said.

Blasting the door off a home in Huntington Park, California, to search for a man accused of ramming a Border Patrol vehicle days earlier was a ""very, very prudent, thoughtful application of tactics,"" said Bovino, who joined that early-morning raid. ""I don't want to surround a house for hours and hours and hours and then create another riot.""

Bovino often appears in tactical gear, as he did outside California Gov. Gavin Newsom's news conference on congressional redistricting in August.

WATCH: Border Patrol's expanding role in Trump's immigration crackdown

Agents rappel from helicopter in Chicago

In Chicago, agents stormed an apartment complex by helicopter, deploying chemical agents near a public school and handcuffed a Chicago City Council member at a hospital.

Agents rappelled down to the apartment building from a Black Hawk helicopter. Authorities said they were targeting the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, but only two of the 37 immigrants arrested were gang members. The others were in the country illegally, they said, including some with criminal histories. One U.S. citizen was arrested on an outstanding narcotics warrant.

Activists, residents and leaders said the combative tactics sparked violence and fueled neighborhood tensions in the nation's third-largest city.

Bovino also drew a rare public rebuke from a federal judge who said he misled the court about the threats posed by protesters and deployed tear gas and pepper balls without justification during a chaotic confrontation downtown.

Vowing a 'turn and burn' approach

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency primarily responsible for interior immigration enforcement since its was created in 2003, has historically made arrests in the streets after lengthy investigations of individual targets, including surveillance that an official once likened to watching paint dry. Officials rarely have judicial warrants to enter a home, causing them to wait outside.

It is not a pace that will lead to the mass deportations Trump has promised.

WATCH: Border Patrol 'untrained and unskilled' for policing in urban areas, ex-CBP head says

""We're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next, and we're not going to stop,"" he said in an interview in a seventh-floor conference room of the federal building in West Los Angeles, where an unused office wing served as a sparsely furnished temporary base.

In an internal memo obtained this month by The Associated Press, ICE leadership stated administrative warrants were now sufficient for federal officers to forcibly enter people's homes if there's a final order of removal.

Almost forced to retire in 2023

Bovino was one of 20 regional Border Patrol chiefs around the country when he was relieved of his command leading leading the agency's sector in El Centro, California.

He blamed an online profile picture of him posing with an M4 assault rifle; social media posts that were considered inappropriate; and sworn congressional testimony that he and other sector chiefs gave on the state of the border during a record surge of migrants.

Thirty minutes after his second congressional hearing, Bovino said, he was removed from his position and asked, ""Are you going to retire now?""

He didn't retire. The change in administration from President Joe Biden to Trump in 2025 turned Bovino into a MAGA-world hero. The profile photo with the assault rifle was back online and by the summer, he was leading immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, where the Trump administration launched its first sustained blitz of a U.S. city.

Deporting people who 'skip the line'

Bovino joined the Border Patrol in 1996 and is nearing the agency's mandatory retirement age of 57. He eventually plans to return home to North Carolina to harvest apples.

He served as Border Patrol chief in El Centro, California, long a relatively quiet part of the southern border that has become even quieter as illegal crossings have plummeted to their lowest levels in six decades.

His media savvy is on display each summer when Border Patrol sector chiefs hold news conferences to warn against illegal crossings. In 2021, Bovino led journalists in swimming across the All-American Canal, whose deceptively swift current and smooth concrete lining result in migrant deaths every year. In 2023, he locked reporters in a vehicle trunk, saying he wanted them to appreciate the dangers firsthand.

While administration officials like to say they are deporting the ""worst of the worst,"" Bovino embraces arrests of hard-working people with deep roots in the country. He said they ""skip the line"" ahead of people waiting to enter the country legally.

""The folks undercutting American businesses, is that right?"" he said. ""Absolutely not. That's why we have immigration laws in the first place, and that's why I'm here.""

'Not afraid to push the envelope'

ICE has led interior immigration enforcement since it was created in 2003, but the Border Patrol has been around much longer. Bovino's sense of mission never strayed from the Border Patrol's roots. When assigned to lead a station in Blythe, California, he pitched his boss, Paul Beeson, on raiding the airport and bus stations in Las Vegas.

The 2010 operation was supposed to last three days but got called off after the first hour yielded dozens of arrests and unleashed a furious reaction from then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat.

""He's not afraid to push the envelope, very articulate, leads from the front,"" said Beeson, who, as a sector chief, selected Bovino to lead stations in Blythe and in Imperial Beach, California.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2026/01/2026-01-27T005713Z_234265899_RC2L0JAHR99E_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-BOVINO-REMOVAL-1024x684.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 20:59:09.562436

January 27, 2026

No funds for ICE and Border Patrol

Dear Members of Congress,

We, the undersigned 1,025 organizations, write to express our horror, outrage and deep grief about the news that federal agents have executed a human being in broad daylight on the streets of Minneapolis. How many more people have to die, how many more lies have to be told, and how many more children must be used as bait and abducted, before Congress fulfills its responsibilities and stops these out-of-control agencies from continuing to violently attack our immigrant communities and communities of color, as well as their many allies and supporters?

We demand an immediate halt in all funding for these deadly operations until the violence, abuses, and deaths in American communities and in immigration detention centers stop. Congress must refuse to provide one dollar to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Border Patrol through the appropriations process and immediately take action to revoke the tens of billions already given through last summer’s reconciliation bill.

We demand that you act decisively and show DHS and the communities you serve that this cruelty and lawlessness are unacceptable and must end now. When federal agents are patrolling the streets of American cities and gunning people down in broad daylight, the bare minimum response is to stop the funding that enables these violent agencies to carry out these atrocities. You have the power and responsibility to stop this. What you do now will be remembered for future generations – take a stand today while you still have the power to do so.

Read the full letter sent to Congress.

Sincerely,

Detention Watch Network

A federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration Monday in a ruling that blocks restrictions on tactics being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents while dealing with anti-ICE agitators in Minnesota.

The ruling by the three-judge panel 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals put a stay on a lower court ruling that prevented officers from arresting, detaining, pepper-spraying or retaliating against protesters in Minneapolis without probable cause as anti-ICE agitators continue to confront authorities carrying out enforcement operations.

""We accessed and viewed the same videos the district court did,"" the appeals court said in the ruling. ""What they show is observers and protesters engaging in a wide range of conduct, some of it peaceful but much of it not. They also show federal agents responding in various ways.""

The lawsuit alleged that federal authorities violated the civil rights of six protesters.

Last week, the court temporarily lifted restrictions on ICE agents' use of force against protesters in Minnesota. Monday's ruling grants a ""FULL STAY,"" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

""Liberal judges tried to handcuff our federal law enforcement officers, restrict their actions, and put their safety at risk when responding to violent agitators,"" she wrote on X. ""The DOJ went to court. We got a temporary stay. NOW, the 8th Circuit has fully agreed that this reckless attempt to undermine law enforcement cannot stand.""

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the ruling ""incredibly disappointing"" as ""as federal agents claim they can act with impunity and kill people in our streets.""

""But, we’ll be clear: Minnesotans have the right to safely assemble, document, and protest federal immigration agents actions in our communities and we will continue to work to ensure all Minnesotans are able to exercise those rights without fear of being harmed by ICE or any other government actor,"" said Deepinder Mayell, executive director of ACLU of Minnesota.

In a Jan. 16 ruling, U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez sided with the protesters and issued the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE over their treatment during immigration enforcement operations.

In her ruling, Menendez found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on claims that federal agents violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights during protests and observation of ICE activity tied to Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities.

Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within ICE that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. HSI officers are separate from the ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there was no indication ERO officers were being sent to Italy.

That distinction, however, wasn't immediately clear to local media on Tuesday morning.

Italy reacts to US security deployment

The reaction among some in Italy reflects not only a worsening perception abroad of the administration's tactics on immigration but also underscores a broader rift between the U.S. under President Donald Trump and its international allies.

Vague reports that ICE would be deployed in some capacity surfaced over the weekend, resulting in a series of online petitions gathering support of people opposed to the presence of ICE at the Games. They followed a RAI news report that aired Sunday showing an Italian news crew being threatened in Minneapolis by ICE agents. Trump's immigration crackdown has in recent weeks intensified in Minneapolis, leading to the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal immigration officers.

Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said that ICE would not be welcome in his city, which is hosting the Feb. 6 opening ceremony to be attended by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, as well as most ice sports.

""This is a militia that kills, a militia that enters into the homes of people, signing their own permission slips. It is clear they are not welcome in Milan, without a doubt,"" Sala told RTL Radio 102.

Italy's Interior Ministry said later that the HSI investigators would be stationed at a control room at the U.S. Consulate in Milan, in a support role with other U.S. law enforcement agencies, and that they would not include personnel involved in immigration controls in the United States. It noted in a statement issued after Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi and U.S. Ambassador Tilman Fertitta met Tuesday morning that HSI agents are present in more than 50 countries, including for many years Italy.

""All of the security operations in the territory remain as always the exclusive responsibility and direction of Italian authorities,'' the ministry said.

ICE units breakdown

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is broken into various arms. Enforcement and Removal Operations is the part of the agency that is tasked with monitoring, arresting and removing foreigners who no longer have the right to be in the U.S. They're the officers most directly tasked with carrying out Trump's mass deportation agenda.

Another arm of ICE is Homeland Security Investigations. Agents from HSI conduct investigations into anything that has a cross-border nexus from human smuggling to fentanyl trafficking to smuggling of cultural artifacts. Agents from HSI are stationed in embassies around the world to facilitate their investigations and build relations with local law enforcement in those countries.

The ICE agents deployed to Italy for the Games will have a different role from the one seen in immigration crackdowns in the U.S., officials have stressed.

""Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries,″ the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Tuesday.

""At the Olympics, ICE's Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations. All security operations remain under Italian authority.""

A U.S official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security measures said the general public likely wouldn't even see or be aware of the HSI agents on the ground during the Olympics. The official said HSI agents would be working behind the scenes, mainly in offices or the U.S. consulate in Milan, as they have done during previous international events.

For years HSI distanced itself from anything having to do with deportations or immigration enforcement. At one point they got new branding and email addresses to set themselves apart because agents working in parts of the country with strong political opposition to immigration enforcement wouldn't get their emails answered because they had an ICE.gov address.

Under the Trump administration, however, HSI agents have been working closer with ICE's other arm — the deportation officers — to focus more on immigration issues. They've been going out on operations with deportation officers and focusing more on immigration fraud cases.

Reaction underscores fraught ties

The International Olympic Committee underlined in a statement that security ""is the responsibility of the authorities of the host country, who work closely with the participating delegations.""

The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee said that it works with the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service, the IOC and the host nation for security planning, ""but not with U.S. domestic law enforcement or immigration agencies.''

The reaction in Italy highlights increasingly fraught relations between Trump and the U.S.' traditional allies in Europe, which have been tested during the president's second term over his threats to take over Greenland.

Piantedosi presided over a meeting of law enforcement and intelligence services on Tuesday to discuss security for the Games. More than 6,000 police and other agents will be deployed to secure what is billed as the most spread out Games in Olympic history, involving seven towns and cities spread across a broad swath of northern Italy from Milan to the Austrian border.

The Interior Minister is Italy's top law enforcement official, charged with security for the Games, which is coordinated with regional prefects.

Asked about the potential deployment over the weekend, he gave a diplomatic shrug: ""I don't see what the problem would be,″ the news agency ANSA quoted him as saying.

Federal officers have killed two people in Minneapolis, including Alex Pretti, a 37-year old nurse at a VA Hospital who was shot Saturday.","HELENA — Hundreds of people packed a Helena City Commission meeting this week to ask the city to protect them from aggressive immigration tactics by federal law enforcement agents.

The Helena City Commission voted 4-1 on Monday on a resolution reiterating its support for immigrant communities and a reminder of its policy and procedures surrounding interaction with federal law enforcement. Additionally, the resolution stipulates city police officers can ask federal agents to unmask and identify themselves at their discretion and in situations that officers believe it isn’t interfering with federal work.

The city took up the resolution in the midst of two recent killings of citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents and increasing dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement tactics. It comes six months after a Helena resident was caught up in enforcement.

But some city officials expressed concerns such actions laid out in the resolution would potentially lead to being charged with obstruction of justice.

“I would be concerned with compelling that action of an officer, because it could be seen as obstructing justice,” Helena City Attorney Rebecca Dockter told the commission on Monday.

The resolution comes six months after Christopher Martinez was arrested by law enforcement after a request from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop him, believing him to be someone else they were investigating. A Helena Police Officer joked he was being kidnapped and Martinez, who was trying to stay in the country legally, faced deportation and eventually left to return to Mexico.

The case sparked outrage in Helena and beyond, with Martinez’s lawyers arguing in court he was racially profiled.

Since then, Helena has pulled out of a regional drug task force, city officials said on Monday night, and commenters on the resolution heavily praised steps the police force has taken, saying they’ve taken the concerns seriously.

“(Martinez) was arrested because he was mistaken for a different brown man. That is embarrassing, and I do think that the city recognizes that with how swift the response was, this resolution came out very quickly after the initial arrest,” Emilia Hitchcock, a Helena attorney, told the commission, adding “the Helena Police Department has clearly tried to make some changes.”

Many in attendance viewed the resolution as a first step as city officials were asked to protect their citizens from federal agents. Federal officers have killed two people in Minneapolis, including Alex Pretti, a 37-year old nurse at a VA Hospital who was shot Saturday. Some in attendance on Monday were openly wondering if similar events could play out in Helena.

“We’ve seen it happen elsewhere,” said Shani Henry, a Helena resident. “We should not kid ourselves that it won’t happen here.”

There was unfiltered disgust by those in attendance with violent immigration tactics and a deep anger that fundamental liberties Americans enjoy were being taken away.

“This is not public safety. This is not justice,” said Valerie Hellermann, executive director of the Helena Area Refugee Resettlement Team. “We don’t want this in Helena, our local law enforcement should not be obligated to cooperate with practices that undermine trust, due process, and human dignity.”

Overflow rooms were full at the City-County building, and 62 people gave comments to the City Commission in person, while another 11 spoke via Zoom. Additional written comments were also collected during the meeting. The meeting lasted about four hours, with around three of those dedicated to the resolution.

All but about five of the comments were in support of the resolution. Speakers included two Montana State senators — Laura Smith and Mary Ann Dunwell, both Democrats representing Helena — as well as community leaders at advocacy organizations, religious groups and a wave of concerned citizens.

“(The resolution) requests that the city take steps to ensure that the residents here know that the city is on our side and not on the side of a federal agency that is terrorizing black and brown people as a pretext for harassing cities that vote for Democrats,” said SK Rossi, who spoke on the resolution as a local business owner. “That’s the reality of what is happening here, and we should be opposing it with every fiber of our beings.”

One long-time Helena resident, an immigrant, spoke about the fear she has driving to Target with her daughter, and how they now have photos of their passports on their phones.

“You never know,” said Linda Cleatus, describing that fear.

Multiple members of the Helena LGBTQ+ community also spoke, relaying fears about how the persecution they’ve faced is now expanding to other groups.

“As a politically targeted community that has lived in increasing fear, we recognize and refuse to ignore it when we see it happening to other communities,” Shawn Reagor, with Montana Gender Alliance, told the Commission.

Police officers also cannot legally ask a person’s race during a stop, but the data is informally collected by officers and reviewed twice per year. If there are issues with those stops, an internal investigation is launched, police officials said Monday night.

“If we notice flags or anything that’s super concerning on that, that would generate a review of their traffic stops,” said Helena Police Lt. Adam Shanks.

Additionally, racial data from stops is collected per state code, though Shanks said that he called the state Board of Crime Control and they didn’t have it on hand, because they’re not supposed to share the data unless it’s formally requested.

“The people I spoke with on the Board of Crime Control and Data Warehouse don’t actually know how to get that information,” Shanks said.

None of the amendments passed, leading to some frustration among attendees when the matter was put to vote at almost 10 p.m.

Sen. Ellie Boldman, a Missoula Democrat, has also proposed legislation to have immigration officers clearly mark who they are, to not wear masks and to have certain areas be protected from raids.

There was also a sense the resolution was just one step in protecting Helena citizens and more action was going to be asked for by members of the public.

“Today’s vote matters in and of itself for what it means to set a standard for a welcoming community committed to civil and to human rights,” Rachel Carroll Rivas, a longtime human rights activist in Helena, told the commission. “But today is also practice, practice for the potential consequential moments that are to come when you will be needed by this community to stand in your power in opposition to authoritarianism when it comes knocking on the door of Helena.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-89/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/helenacc1-1024x6571769551557.jpg?h=e69e7156&itok=fXL-84QQ,N,,2026-01-27 17:59:52.137620

Time after time, when federal agents used what seemed like extremely aggressive tactics during immigration sweeps and protests, conservative media outlets have been there to support them. After Alex Pretti was killed by federal immigration agents, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed he had come armed to massacre them. Videos contradict that. NPR's David Folkenflik has been following how some conservative news organizations now reject the official line from the government, and he's with us now to tell us about it. David, good morning.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Good morning, Michel.

MARTIN: So give us a feel for what this pushback in conservative media sounds like.

FOLKENFLIK: Yeah. It's more pushback than hashtag resistance, right? But take the center-right Free Press. It responded with an editorial titled ""Kristi Noem's Reckless Lies."" Yet the conservative Daily Wire had posted a piece about gun rights groups angered by the Trump administration's officials demonizing law-abiding armed citizens. Pretti had been armed but hadn't taken out his weapon. And in editorials, the Rupert Murdoch New York Post and Wall Street Journal separately called on ICE to scale back in Minneapolis and to ease tensions there.

MARTIN: What about on Fox News?

FOLKENFLIK: Well, I think the evolution on Fox in some ways best illustrates the story. Let's start with Saturday afternoon. I have a couple clips for you. Just hours after the shooting, you had Fox News contributor Joe Concha. He was condemning the governor of Minnesota and the mayor of Minneapolis for stirring up protesters against the crackdown.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOE CONCHA: And now here, literally, a guy pulls a gun on an ICE officer. He defends himself. And they're saying that, oh, no, he was only attacked at this point.

FOLKENFLIK: But Pretti literally had not pulled the gun he was carrying. It was holstered until an agent took it from him, and other agents shot him dead. Then Sunday, things start to change. Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin reports that numerous federal officials were expressing concern behind the scenes over the killing of Pretti. And just listen to how Fox News commentator Ted Williams, a former homicide detective, talks about the case in an appearance on Sunday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TED WILLIAMS: It was said that - by the White House that Mr. Pretti attacked those agents. No, he did not attack those agents. And one of the White House individuals called Mr. Pretti a domestic terrorist. This man is dead. He has a family. And to go out and call him a domestic terrorist without giving any more information is just unacceptable.

FOLKENFLIK: So you've seen a tone shift that you really haven't seen in similar situations, even in similar deadly situations in Minneapolis and elsewhere, and you're seeing President Trump shift. He's adopting less hostile rhetoric in the past 24 hours, and you're seeing some changes in policy and deployments.

MARTIN: So why do you think this moment is different?

FOLKENFLIK: Well, as you and I have talked about before in a bunch of different circumstances, video carries just a powerful punch. And in this case, the video is not particularly ambiguous. Mainstream news outlets, including Murdoch's Wall Street Journal, have broken down the multiple videos, offering multiple angles. None of them support Noem. None of them support federal claims on this. This is a pretty clear-cut killing, and there are fears that the rule of law is not being just tested but shattered by authorities.

And you're seeing this play out in other parts of society, too. When a place like The Wall Street Journal weighs in, it matters. Wall Street is being tested. Wall Street is being threatened. The head of the Federal Reserve is under Justice Department investigation after clashing with Trump. The head of JPMorgan Chase was sued by Trump shortly after criticizing him. So recognizing what's happening in front of our very eyes is becoming a test for us all.

MARTIN: That is NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. David, thank you.

FOLKENFLIK: You bet.

In L.G.M.L v. Noem, 1:25-cv-02942 (D.D.C.","The fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti highlighted for the public how often the federal government misrepresents key details about its immigration enforcement activities. What’s less commonly understood is that the administration also carries these types of misrepresentations into judicial proceedings. In fact, immigration-related cases account for most of the deception and noncompliance by the Trump administration in court.

A compilation compiled by New York University law professor Ryan Goodman and his associates at Just Security shows that immigration-related matters were at stake in 24 of 42 instances (57 percent) in which judges found that officials had misled the courts. Immigration-related cases also topped Just Security’s list of instances where judges have found noncompliance with their orders: 19 of the 31 instances were immigration-related.

My colleague Walter Olson, who has commented on the same Just Security analysis, has argued: “It all cries out for the [Supreme] Court as a whole to reevaluate whether the current executive has behaved with such rectitude as to continue to merit the old presumption of regularity.”

As Goodman and coauthors at Just Security describe it, the presumption of regularity “instructs courts to presume, unless there is clear evidence to the contrary, that executive officials have ‘properly discharged their official duties’ and that government agencies have acted with procedural regularity and with bona fide, non-pretextual reasons.” This presumption has always given the government more practical leeway to engage in misconduct and bad faith that other litigants could not. Despite this presumption, however, courts are still finding egregious misconduct by this administration—particularly in immigration-related matters.

The immigration cases—which include conclusions by numerous judges appointed by presidents of both parties—include striking rhetoric quoted in part in the long list below. One judge condemned the “willful disregard” of orders that are defied “willfully and gleefully”; another repudiated the “deliberate evasion” of the administration’s obligations to the court; another merely saw “zero effort to comply”; others puzzled over “shoddy affidavits and contradictory testimony” and why officials were “putting words in people’s mouths” or making claims “untethered to the facts.” Some bluntly determined to put aside the administration’s “nakedly misleading characterizations” and “outright lying.”

The stakes in these proceedings include everything from the release of a single individual from detention to a state losing all federal transportation funds to hundreds of immigrants being deported to a foreign prison without due process.

The Tip of the ICEberg

These are just the cases from January 2025 through November 2025. As Goodman and coauthors note, the Supreme Court also called out the first Trump administration for lying in Department of Commerce v. Trump for misrepresenting its reasons for adopting the citizenship question on the Census, stating “we cannot ignore the disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given.” Moreover, there were many new instances of deception and defiance in court since November of last year. Indeed, US District Judge Patrick Schiltz recently said that there have been “dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks.”

Just Security failed to include one particular case that is arguably as compelling as those on its list. In the case of J.G.G. v. Trump, the Supreme Court ordered on April 7, 2025, that individuals whom the government was attempting to remove under the Alien Enemies Act must “receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief.”

On April 17, 2025, the government issued notices of removal giving the subjects just 24 hours to seek relief, in English, and without any instructions about how to do so. As buses rolled toward the airport, the Supreme Court intervened to block the removals. On May 9, the Supreme Court had the chance to explain the blatant disregard of its order: “Under these circumstances, notice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster.”

This flagrant act of defiance occurred after the Supreme Court had found that the original set of removals was carried out unlawfully and in defiance of the district court’s order barring those removals, an instance of noncompliance that is included on the list.

There were also many clear violations of orders that no judge ultimately addressed, such as the illegal profiling raids blocked in Perdomo v. Noem. In order to further those raids in violation of the court order, the Justice Department actually fired Michele Beckwith, the acting US attorney in the Eastern District of California, who was overseeing and requiring compliance with the order.

She was not the only US attorney lost to the government’s attempt to evade judicial review. Acting deputy director in the Office of Immigration Litigation, Erez Reuveni, has said he was also fired for refusing to lie and accurately admitting that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was removed in error to El Salvador. He said that attorneys are being told to make misleading and false statements in courts by their superiors at the Justice Department. Similarly, the Chief of the Criminal Division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Tennessee, Ben Schader, quit rather than file politically motivated charges against Abrego Garcia.

According to Reuveni, after the president secretly invoked the Alien Enemies Act and covertly began loading Venezuelans onto planes to send them to El Salvador’s terrorism prison, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove—the third in command at the Justice Department—told attorneys how they would handle court challenges:

“Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what. Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, ‘f*** you.’”

Justice Department Attorney Drew Ensign, soon after, told a court that he did not know if planes would be leaving, even though Reuveni had said that he was in the same meeting as him, and the judge gave him time to confirm. “We really did tell the court, screw you,” said Reuveni.

There have also been dozens of cases of charges filed against ICE protesters and ICE observers based on lies that have ultimately resulted in acquittals or dismissals of charges that are largely not represented on this list. As my colleague Walter Olson notes, these lies can have significant effects even outside of the criminal case. In a dissent in a case involving the deployment of the National Guard to support ICE, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito described an incident where:

a federal vehicle carrying Border Patrol agents was boxed in on a public road by 10 civilian vehicles, and 2 of those vehicles rammed the Government vehicle. As the agents exited their vehicle, one of the civilian vehicles was driven directly at an agent, forcing the agent to fire in self-defense.

But this event never happened. It was a story invented by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to justify the shooting after the fact. There was one civilian car, not ten. The government’s vehicles were never boxed in, and the government’s criminal case against the preschool teacher driver was dismissed after video evidence showed it was DHS that rammed her vehicle and opened fire without provocation.

Honesty with Courts Matters

Immigration restrictionists had pushed the unfounded claim that people who cared about the rights of noncitizens to live and work peacefully in this country had no “respect for the rule of law.” The response that the best way to make the law respected is to make it respectable failed to satisfy them. Now, however, it is clear that those carrying out the most severe immigration restrictions in a century cared little for the rule of law anyway.

The Just Security analysis implies that the Justice Department under President Trump and Attorney General Pamela Bondi happily conspires to ignore court orders, but they are most willing to do so when it would advance President Trump’s deportation agenda. The administration has gone far down the road to rejecting the legitimacy of the courts. The White House Deputy Chief of Staff has called court orders limiting the president’s authority a “judicial coup” and said, “unelected communist judges are now trying to rule over us all.”

Americans depend on the courts to vindicate their rights when the government violates the law or the Constitution. When the executive branch misleads courts about its conduct or ignores their orders, courts cannot fulfill their role in limiting government, threatening the rights of everyone in the United States. Hopefully, this flurry of deception causes courts to scrutinize the government’s assertions more thoroughly than they have in the past.

Cases Involving Noncompliance

In J.G.G. v. Trump, April 16, 2025, regarding Venezuelans sent to El Salvador:

On the evening of Saturday, March 15, 2025, this Court issued a written Temporary Restraining Order barring the Government from transferring certain individuals into foreign custody pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act. At the time the Order issued, those individuals were on planes being flown overseas, having been spirited out of the United States by the Government before they could vindicate their due-process rights by contesting their removability in a federal court, as the law requires. Trump v. J.G.G., 2025 WL 1024097, at *2 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025) (per curiam). Rather than comply with the Court’s Order, the Government continued the hurried removal operation. Early on Sunday morning — hours after the Order issued — it transferred two planeloads of passengers protected by the TRO into a Salvadoran mega-prison.

As this Opinion will detail, the Court ultimately determines that the Government’s actions on that day demonstrate a willful disregard for its Order, sufficient for the Court to conclude that probable cause exists to find the Government in criminal contempt…. [B]oasts by Defendants intimated that they had defied the Court’s Order deliberately and gleefully. The Secretary of State, for instance, retweeted a post in which, above a news headline noting this Court’s Order to return the flights to the United States, the President of El Salvador wrote: “Oopsie … Too late 😂😂.” …what followed in the ensuing days was increasing obstructionism on the part of the Government as it refused to answer basic questions about what had happened.

In Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.), April 11, 2025, regarding the Supreme Court’s order to bring back wrongfully deported Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia:

For the reasons discussed during today’s status conference, the Court finds that the Defendants have failed to comply with this Court’s Order… As a result, counsel could not confirm, and thus did not advance any evidence, that Defendants had done anything to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return. This remained Defendants’ position even after this Court reminded them that the Supreme Court of the United States expressly affirmed this Court’s authority to require the Government “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return. See Noem v. Abrego Garcia, 25A949, 604 U.S. ___ (2025), Slip Op. at 2.

Again, in Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.), April 15, 2025, following a renewed order for information on efforts to return Abrego Garcia:

Defendants therefore remain obligated, at a minimum, to take the steps available to them toward aiding, assisting, or making easier Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and resuming his status quo ante. But the record reflects that Defendants have done nothing at all.… Plaintiffs’ request for expedited discovery focuses on securing compliance with this Court’s amended order at ECF No. 51 and other related directives, and in the face of ongoing refusal to comply, to assist the Court in determining whether contempt proceedings are warranted.

Again, in Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.), April 17, 2025, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals stated:

Thus, the government’s argument that all it must do is “remove any domestic barriers to [Abrego Garcia’s] return,” Mot. for Stay at 2, is not well taken in light of the Supreme Court’s command that the government facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador . “Facilitation” does not permit the admittedly erroneous deportation of an individual to the one country’s prisons that the withholding order forbids and, further, to do so in disregard of a court order that the government not so subtly spurns. “Facilitation” does not sanction the abrogation of habeas corpus through the transfer of custody to foreign detention centers in the manner attempted here. Allowing all this would “facilitate” foreign detention more than it would domestic return. It would reduce the rule of law to lawlessness and tarnish the very values for which Americans of diverse views and persuasions have always stood

Again, in Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.), April 22, 2025, following yet another order for discovery in the case:

Defendants’ answer to Interrogatory No. 5, in which they name exactly two individuals who “have been or will be involved in any of the actions responsive to Interrogatories 1–4 or in ordering or authorizing Abrego Garcia’s removal to El Salvador, his initial placement in CECOT or his continued confinement in CECOT,” reflects a deliberate evasion of their fundamental discovery obligations. … Defendants have failed to respond in good faith, and their refusal to do so can only be viewed as willful and intentional noncompliance.

Again, in Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.), May 13, 2025, following an order for the privilege log (a document recording which records were withheld because of a claim of executive privilege):

Evidently missing from the Defendants’ filing is the privilege log that this Court ordered to be produced. See ECF No. 115 (“On the same date, Defendants shall provide the privilege log discussed in ECF No. 112 to the Court.”). Accordingly, Defendants are ordered to correct this deficiency and file the privilege log by 3:00 PM today. Failure to file the privilege log or otherwise respond will be construed as an intentional refusal to comply with this Court’s orders.

In D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 1:25-cv-10676 (D. Mass.), May 23, 2025, regarding the wrongful deportation of a Guatemalan to Mexico:

The original version of the Errata filing included an exhibit that publicly revealed O.C.G.’s full name and other identifying information, see Dkt. 105 at 8, contrary to this Court’s prior order concerning the use of pseudonyms, Dkt. 13.

In D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 1:25-cv-10676 (D. Mass.), May 26, 2025, regarding removals of immigrants to third countries where they had no citizenship:

By racing to get six class members onto a plane to unstable South Sudan, clearly in breach of the law and this Court’s order, Defendants gave this Court no choice but to find that they were in violation of the Preliminary Injunction. Twice, well-founded allegations of non-compliance or imminent non-compliance led this Court to amend or clarify the Preliminary Injunction. See Dkts. 86, 91. Neither of those changed the substance of the Preliminary Injunction, which continued to require Defendants to give written notice of the third-country removal and a meaningful opportunity to make a CAT claim.

In Melgar-Salmeron v. Bondi, 23–7792 (2d Cir.), June 24, 2025, regarding another immigrant wrongfully deported in violation of a court order, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals stated:

As the Government recognizes in its filings, the removal was improper because it contradicted the Government’s assurance to the Court that it would forbear from removing Petitioner, which this Court relied upon in resolving the stay motion. It was also improper because it violated this Court’s order staying Petitioner’s removal from the United States during the pendency of this matter before this Court.

In J.O.P. v. DHS, 8:19-cv-01944-SA (D.Md.), May 28, 2025, regarding a wrongfully deported unaccompanied child to El Salvador:

This Court finds that Defendants utterly disregarded this Court’s May 20, 2025 Order. That Order directed Defendants to “provide a status report on the steps they have taken to facilitate the return of Cristian to the United States…on or before 5:00 PM ET on Tuesday, May 27, 2025” … Defendants’ untimely response is the functional equivalent of, “We haven’t done anything and don’t intend to.” Defendants’ filing disregarded the deadline and the substantive requests in this Court’s May 20, 2025 Order. …The remainder of the “status update” shows zero effort to comply with this Court’s April 23, 2025 Order, ECF 254, that Defendants “facilitate” Cristian’s return to the United States.

In Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 3:18-cv-00428 (S.D. Cal.), July 24, 2025, regarding the enforcement of a settlement agreement providing legal assistance to certain immigrants:

On June 10, 2025, this Court found Defendants in breach of the parties’ Settlement Agreement in this case, specifically, the sections regarding the provision of legal services to Class Members. (See ECF No. 795.) To remedy that breach, the Court ordered Defendants to reinstate their Legal Access Services for Reunified Families (“LASRF”) task order with Acacia so it could provide the necessary legal services, and set a status conference for June 27, 2025. (Id. at 17–19.) Defendants did not comply with the Court’s order to reinstate the task order with Acacia.

In National TPS Alliance v. Noem, 3:25-cv-01766 (N.D. Cal.), June 5, 2025, regarding a discovery order in a case over the termination of Temporary Protected Status, which was already ignored:

The government has failed to comply with the Court’s order and has not given a specific date by which it will comply. The Court orders the government to provide the declaration previously ordered by today, June 5, 2025.

In OCA – Asian Pacific American Advocates v. Rubio, 1:25-cv-00287, July 14, 2025, regarding the failure to submit filings related to the birthright citizenship executive order:

On this record, including Defendants’ continuing inexplicable failure to comply with the Court’s 6 Standing Order, Defendants have not shown good cause for a further extension.

In State of Oregon v. Trump, 3:25-cv-01756 (D. Or.), November 7, 2025, regarding the use of National Guard to deal with anti-ICE protesters in Portland:

this Court is deeply troubled by Defendants’ continued deployment of Oregon National Guardsmen at the Portland ICE facility in violation of the First TRO. In the seven hours that Defendants took to ‘convey the message’ of the First TRO ‘to people on the ground,’ Defendants simultaneously ‘convey[ed] the message’ to the U.S. Army Northern Command to send 200 of the federalized California National Guard personnel in Los Angeles to Portland. … In other words, Defendants had time to order and coordinate the transport of federalized California National Guardsmen from Los Angeles to Portland but needed more time to communicate with the Oregon National Guardsmen at the Portland ICE facility. This Court has not issued any finding of contempt based on Defendants’ apparent violation of the First TRO. However, this Court expects Defendants will provide further explanation when ordered to do so by this Court in the future, and this court retains jurisdiction over the issue.

In Castanon Nava v. Department of Homeland Security, 1:18-cv-03757 (N.D. Ill.), November 13, regarding arrests without warrants in violation of a consent decree:

To begin, in the parties’ joint status reports filed on November 7, 2025, the parties report that they have agreed—after an examination of the pertinent arrest records—that 46 class members were arrested in violation of the terms of the Consent Decree and are thus entitled to relief under the Decree. (Dckt. #244 at 3–4). However, the majority of these class members have already been removed from the United States, either involuntarily or voluntarily… plaintiffs assert that a large number of class members (including many of the 615 in question) were arrested in violation of the terms of the Consent Decree. Given the number of instances where the parties have agreed that the rights of class members were violated, it stands to reason that a significant number of additional violations will be uncovered as plaintiffs receive and analyze the arrest records of the remaining arrestees.

In State of Illinois v. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1:25-cv-00206 (D.R.I.), October 14, 2025, regarding an injunction prohibiting the conditioning of emergency grants to states based on their commitment to assist ICE:

Despite the Court’s order, Defendants have now inserted the contested conditions into Plaintiff States’ award letters for DHS grants, along with statements promising that “[i]f the injunction is stayed, vacated, or extinguished, the [contested conditions] will immediately become effective.” … In effect, Defendants have done precisely what the Memorandum and Order forbids, which is requiring Plaintiff States to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of DHS grants. The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference. No matter how confident Defendants may be of their chances on appeal, at present, the contested conditions are unlawful. Plaintiff States therefore have a right to accept the awards without regard to the contested conditions. Defendants’ new condition is not a good faith effort to comply with the order; it is a ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make at the risk of losing critical disaster and other funding already appropriated by Congress.

In Chicago Headline Club v. Noem, 1:25-cv-12173 (N.D. Ill.), November 20, regarding a temporary restraining orderprohibiting the indiscriminate use of force, tear gas, rubber bullets, and other violence against protesters:

Gregory Bovino, the Chief Border Patrol Agent of CBP’s El Centro Sector… admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters. … Defendants have engaged in an officially sanctioned common practice of violating the First and Fourth Amendment rights of protesters, journalists, and religious practitioners. …Their risk of future injury is not speculative, given the ongoing, sustained pattern of conduct that they have documented over the previous two months, even after the Court entered a TRO, with no sign of stopping.

In National TPS Alliance v. Noem, 3:25-cv-05687 (N.D. Cal.), October 16, 2025, regarding orders for disclosure of documents relating to the termination of Temporary Protected Status:

Now before the Court is the parties’ dispute regarding whether Defendants properly withheld or redacted documents based on the attorney-client privilege and/​or the deliberate process privilege. This is not the first time the Undersigned has reviewed documents in camera to address the parties’ disputes over Defendants’ claimed privileges. Unfortunately, Defendants do not seem to have considered the Undersigned’s prior Orders in this case and in National TPS Alliance v. Noem, No. 25-cv-01766-EMC. For example, Defendants continue to claim documents dated after Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) Secretary Kristi Noem’s decisions to deprive Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) holders from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua were made or that do not contain any opinions, recommendations, or advice. In the future, Defendants are admonished to consider the Undersigned’s prior rulings. …In light of the Undersigned’s previous orders requiring the disclosure of similar materials, Defendants failure to make this showing is particularly glaring.

In United States v. Abrego Garcia, 3:25-cr-00115 (M.D. Tenn.), October 27, 2025, regarding the administration’s continued public statements that would prejudice a jury pool despite an order barring that conduct:

It does not appear [government] agency employees have been notified by counsel of record about those employees’ obligation to adhere to the Local Rule [requiring officials to refrain from making prejudicial statements]. Mr. McGuire and Mr. Harley side-stepped the Court’s Order to report what they had done to comply with Local Rule 2.01(a)(4).

In Pedro Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, 2:25-cv-05605 (C.D. Cal.), November 13, regarding the temporary restraining order barring DHS from blocking access to attorneys:

although Access/​Detention Plaintiffs confirm the TRO Order has improved matters by allowing for some in-person visitation, the current record shows Defendants still are not fully in compliance with the TRO Order… The Court has examined all of the new evidence presented by both sides and decides once again that the federal government is partially blocking access to lawyers. Lawyer visiting hours have been closed down repeatedly without letting lawyers know—even though this Court ordered that the government should let the lawyers know. Officers insist on keeping the door open when lawyers are trying to have private conversations with their clients—even though this means the conversations are no longer private. Officers sometimes will not let lawyers meet with people who want to work with lawyers—even though they are not supposed to. Individuals in B‑18 do not get the free, confidential phone calls with their lawyers that even the government says they should have. And sometimes, individuals are moved from B‑18 to another location which does not allow lawyer visits at all. And, once again, the Court is ordering the federal government to stop—this time for the rest of this lawsuit.

In Barco Mercado v. Noem, 1:25-cv-06568 (S.D.N.Y.), regarding the conditions of ICE detainees (not included in Just Security’s list of failure to comply but on its list of misrepresentations, but added here as it is relevant):

[ICE assistant field office director] Ms. Zanello’s declarations in substantial measure avoided the thrust of plaintiff’s factual showing and offered unpersuasive statistics that concealed more than they disclosed despite the availability to defendants of much more illuminating data. Moreover, the record casts doubt on defendants’ compliance with the TRO [Note 220: Plaintiff has submitted declarations which indicate that inhumane conditions persist despite the Court’s TRO. A detainee in custody at 26 Fed from August 12 through August 14 reports that he received food only once or twice per day; he was not furnished with a sleeping mat or clean clothing; he observed detainees wait a day to receive medical care; he was not provided sufficient toilet paper or anything to clean his teeth; and he did not have access to regular, temporally unrestricted calls.]. The response to the motions thus gives no confidence that the defendants are seriously interested in making a full disclosure of conditions in the 26 Fed Hold Rooms, much less materially improving those conditions anytime soon except, perhaps, to the extent they are compelled by law.

Misrepresentations and Doubts about the Administration’s Honesty

In J.G.G. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00766 (D.D.C.), April 16, 2025, regarding removal flights under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador:

It asked the Government point blank whether there were any “removals under this Proclamation planned … in the next 24 or 48 hours.” Id. Government counsel said that he did not know, but that he could “investigate” and “report … back.” Id. …the Court adjourned the hearing until 6:00 p.m. and directed Government counsel to find out whether the Government was in the process of removing people under the Proclamation. Id. at 13–15…. during the short window that the Court was adjourned, two removal flights took off from Harlingen — one around 5:25 p.m. and the other at about 5:45 p.m…. Those later-discovered flight movements, however, were obscured from the Court when the hearing resumed shortly after 6:00 p.m. because the Government surprisingly represented that it still had no flight details to share…. When pressed, Government counsel stated that the “operational details” he had learned during the recess “raised potential national security issues,” so they could not be shared while the public and press listened to the hearing through a call-in line. See Mar. 15 Hrg. Tr. at 15. He suggested, however, that the Government could “provide [the Court] additional details in an in camera” setting. Id. So the Court arranged to do just that. It disconnected the public line so that only counsel for the parties were present and asked Government counsel to report. Id. at 15–16. Except that he did not: he clarified only that the “additional details” he had just mentioned could eventually be provided…

In J.G.G. v. Trump, 1:25-cv-00766 (D.D.C.), December 22, 2025 (using an updated citation), regarding the government’s claim in a brief that Venezuelans sent to El Salvador “were not detained on the behest of United States, nor was their ongoing detention because of the United States”:

once Plaintiffs had been removed to El Salvador, did the United States direct that country’s choice to imprison them? Here, the facts suggest that this was the case Before removing Plaintiffs from this country, the United States arranged for El Salvador to detain them in exchange for money… In a response to the United Nations Working Group, El Salvador itself indicated that it was working at the behest of the United States: it … stated that “the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities .…” …In the months following the Court’s June 4 Opinion, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her office have made multiple public statements casting CECOT as an extension of U.S. detention facilities.

In Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 25–1345 (4th Cir.), April 7, 2025, regarding the wrongful deportation of Salvadoran immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia in violation of a grant of withholding of removal:

In response to the candid responses by the Government attorney to the district court’s inquiry, that attorney has been put on administrative leave, ostensibly for lack of ‘zealous[] advocacy.’ … But, the duty of zealous representation is tempered by the duty of candor to the court, among other ethical obligations, and the duty to uphold the rule of law, particularly on the part of a Government attorney.

In D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, 1:25-cv-10676 (D. Mass.), May 23, 2025, regarding the wrongful deportation of a Guatemalan to Mexico:

Until one week ago, Defendants maintained that O.C.G. verbally stated that he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico, based on data entries made by immigration officers. See Dkt. 31 at 4. However, after speaking with those officers, Defendants no longer make that claim.… Finally, it must be said that, while mistakes obviously happen, the events leading up to this decision are troubling. The Court was given false information, upon which it relied, twice, to the detriment of a party at risk of serious and irreparable harm. Defendants then exacerbated that risk by placing O.C.G.’s full name on the public docket, in violation of this Court’s Order, Dkt. 13.1 See Dkt. 105 at 8. The Court has ordered discovery, including depositions of the individuals involved in the false declaration and underlying data entries, to better understand how this happened.

In Sanchez Puentes v. Charles, 1:25-cv-00509 (E.D. Va.), March 28, 2025, regarding the illegal detention of two Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status based on the claim that they are members of Tren de Aragua:

This is a terrible, terrible affidavit. If this were before me in a criminal case and you were asking to get a warrant issue on this, I’d throw you out of my chambers. No agent should do this type of editorializing, not when people’s liberty is at stake. I expect more from the government than this kind of very shoddy work. This is assumptions and putting words in people’s mouths. … I was shocked when I saw it.

In Sanchez Puentes v. Garite, 3:25-cv-00127 (W.D. Tex.), April 21, 2025, regarding the illegal detention of two Venezuelans with Temporary Protected Status:

Respondents declare, without providing this Court with a single piece of meaningful evidence, that ‘Petitioners are members of Tren de Aragua.’ … Of great concern to this Court is that Respondents contradict themselves throughout the entire record. … [T]he April 23, 2025 Habeas Corpus hearing in this Court, Respondents and the Government based the entirety of their case on multiple levels of hearsay, hidden within declarations of declarants who have no personal knowledge about the facts they are attesting to. … What is astonishing is that these declarants cannot even so much as identify what government official did receive the alleged information directly. Respondents ask this Court to accept their claims, going off of nearly nothing, to substantiate their mammoth claims. … The Court would not accept this evidence even in a case where only nominal damages were at stake, let alone what is at stake here.

Beyond these shoddy affidavits and contradictory testimony, Respondents haven’t provided ‘membership’ at all as it relates to Petitioner Sanchez Garcia … This Court takes clear offense to Respondents wasting judicial resources to admit to the Court it has no evidence, yet seek to have this Court determine Petitioner Sanchez Puentes is ‘guilty by association.’ This Court found no need to even allow closing arguments as to Petitioner Sanchez Puentes at the April 23, 2025 Habeas Corpus Hearing. … It is this Court’s finding that Respondents’ Response and testimony was replete with conclusions, declarations, and accusations, completely and wholly unsubstantiated by anything meaningful in the record.

In Abrego Garcia v. Noem, 8:25-cv-00951 (D. Md.), regarding Salvadoran immigrant’s continued detention:

[C]ounsel’s proffers seem patently incredible… [The court] began by directing Defendants to produce the ICE detainer currently in place, hoping at last to ascertain the basis upon which ICE sought to hold him in Tennessee. But the detainer raised more questions than it answered. The detainer stated simply that probable cause exists to remove Abrego Garcia, “based on … the pendency of ongoing removal proceedings.” Yet by Defendants’ own admission, there are no ongoing removal proceedings. … Thus, the ICE detainer seemed thin cover for Defendants to take Abrego Garcia into custody in Tennessee and next transfer him to any ICE facility in the United States. (See also: The judge expressed frequent frustrations with the Trump administration, saying it had presented a “totally inconsistent” case to keep the Maryland man in immigration detention.)

In League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of The President, 1:25-cv-00946 (D.D.C.), August 24, 2025, regarding whether the administration had already attempted to implement an executive order mandating voter identification in elections:

Defendants stressed that such implementation “may never occur.” Id. at 15 (original emphasis).… Unfortunately, three days before Defendants hitched their argument to this factual contention, on April 11, … the EAC’s Executive Director Brianna Schletz sent a letter on EAC letterhead to the chief election officials of each State “seeking consultation on development of” the Federal Form.… In short, the letter reveals that—contrary to Defendants’ representations to the Court—the EAC has, in fact, already begun to implement Section 2(a).29… . The contradiction between Defendants’ factual representations and the facts on the ground is particularly striking because Executive Director Schletz authored a declaration supporting Defendants’ Oppositions that was filed three days after she sent the letter to the States. … When pressed, counsel for Defendants asserted that he ‘had no knowledge of the letter.’

In J.O.P. v. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 8:19-cv-01944 (4th Cir.), May 19, 2025, regarding an unaccompanied immigrant child illegally deported to El Salvador in violation of a court order:

The Government then moved … to vacate or stay the portion of the district court’s order directing the Government to facilitate Cristian’s return.… The Government pointed to a May 1, 2025 “Indicative Asylum Decision” USCIS issued wherein it declared that, if Cristian were returned to the United States, it would deny his asylum application… Cristian contends that neither “USCIS regulation, policy, [n]or practice” 19 provides for “Indicative Asylum Decisions.” Resp. Br. at 21 (“[S]uch a practice appears nowhere in the agency’s 271-page procedural manual .…”). Cristian concludes that the Indicative Asylum Decision is a “litigation-driven” document—a “contrivance” “created just for this case.” Id. The Government has no response to this charge—a deafening silence.

In L.G.M.L v. Noem, 1:25-cv-02942 (D.D.C.), September 10, 2025, regarding the government’s claim that the parents of 300 Guatemalan children had requested their removals:

At the Aug. 31 hearing, the Justice Department stated: It’s outrageous that the plaintiffs are trying to interfere with these reunifications. All of these children have parents or guardians in Guatemala who have requested their return.

Per Politico: Prior to the government’s concession, [Judge] Kelly raised questions about the discrepancy between what [DOJ] told [Judge] Sooknanan and what the Guatemalan government reported about its interactions with the families. Ensign was not present for Wednesday’s hearing, instead leaving the argument to Sarah Welch, counsel to the assistant attorney general for Justice’s Civil Division. Welch said the administration’s initial claim that parents had requested their children’s return should be considered “withdrawn.”

In American Association of University Professors v. Rubio 1:25-cv-10685 (D. Mass), regarding the arrest of noncitizens for their political speech and the government’s claim that masks were necessary to carry out those arrests:

And there’s the issue of masks. This Court has listened carefully to the reasons given by Öztürk’s captors for masking up and has heard the same reasons advanced by the defendant Todd Lyons, Acting Director of ICE. It rejects this testimony as disingenuous, squalid and dishonorable.

In Barco Mercado v. Noem, 1:25-cv-06568 (S.D.N.Y.), regarding the conditions of ICE detainees:

[ICE assistant field office director] Ms. Zanello’s declarations in substantial measure avoided the thrust of plaintiff’s factual showing and offered unpersuasive statistics that concealed more than they disclosed despite the availability to defendants of much more illuminating data. Moreover, the record casts doubt on defendants’ compliance with the TRO. The response to the motions thus gives no confidence that the defendants are seriously interested in making a full disclosure of conditions in the 26 Fed Hold Rooms, much less materially improving those conditions anytime soon except, perhaps, to the extent they are compelled by law.

In State of Oregon v. Trump, 3:25-cv-01756 (D. Or.), October 4, 2025, regarding the deployment of National Guard to support ICE:

… Finally, the President’s own statements regarding the deployment of federalized National Guardsmen further support that his determination was not “conceived in good faith” or “in the face of the emergency and directly related to the quelling of the disorder or the prevention of its continuance.”… The President’s determination was simply untethered to the facts.

In State of Oregon v. Trump, 3:25-cv-01756 (D. Or.), November 7, 2025, regarding the facts in Oregon that justified the deployment of National Guard to support ICE:

The Court does not find this testimony to be credible… The Court has already discussed the reasons it does not find reliable [ICE Field Office] Director Wamsley’s testimony … it is inconsistent with every other piece of evidence received on the subject…

In Illinois v. Trump, 1:25-cv-12174 (N.D. Ill.), October 10, 2025, regarding the facts in Illinois that justified the deployment of the National Guard to support ICE:

the Court cannot conclude that Defendants’ declarations are reliable. Two of Defendants’ declarations refer to arrests made on September 27, 2025 of individuals who were carrying weapons and assaulting federal agents. See Doc. 62–2 at 19; Doc. 62–4 at 5. But neither declaration discloses that federal grand juries have refused to return an indictment against at least three of those individuals, which equates to a finding of a lack of probable cause that any crime occurred. … In addition to demonstrating a potential lack of candor by these affiants, it also calls into question their ability to accurately assess the facts.

In United States v. Jaime Alberto Quintanilla-Chavez, 5:25-CR-388 (W.D. Tex.), October 20, 2025, dismissing an indictment for assaulting an ICE agent arresting someone without a warrant:

The Government has presented inconsistent positions about the basis for the initial stop, for the arrest, and for the charges against the Defendant. The sworn affidavit submitted in support of the Criminal Complaint in this matter tells a very different—and largely fictional—story… the Assistant U.S. Attorney conceded at a bond hearing in July 2025 that Fuentes had “misrepresented what was going on.” …The stop was not made because of expired license plates—or even the domestic violence allegations, which were never investigated—but solely based on a tip about the Defendant’s immigration status…. At the bond hearing, the Government characterized the stop as a “probable cause” stop because of a suspected immigration violation. The story changed yet again at the hearing on the instant motions, when DO Hernandez himself acknowledged that he did not seek a warrant for the Defendant’s arrest precisely because he did not think, based on his investigation, he had enough information to establish that the Defendant was removable. … The inconsistencies do not end there….

In Shinwari v. Hyde, 1:25-cv-12021 (D. Mass.), October 20, 2025, regarding a habeas petition for a detained immigrant:

As for an arrest warrant, which does factor more directly into the relevant analysis, the respondents inaccurately describe the facts and cite no law to support their claim that the warrant “cannot be relied on to support a view of detention authority one way or the other.” Id. at 6. The warrant is dated months before Shinwari’s arrest (and before the expedited removal order the respondents inaccurately suggest issued “contemporaneously” with the warrant). … To the extent the respondents seek reconsideration based on their different (and decidedly incorrect) recitation of the events described in this paragraph, their motion is DENIED.

In Gomes v. Hyde, 1:25-cv-11571 (D. Mass.), July 7, 2025, regarding the statutory authority to detain an immigrant:

The Court cannot credit Respondents’ new position as to the basis for Mr. Lopez Benitez’s detention, which was adopted post hoc and raised for the first time in this litigation

In Lopez-Campos v. Raycraft, 2:25-cv-12486 (E.D. Mich.), August 29, 2025, regarding the statutory authority to detain an immigrant:

The Court cannot credit this new position that was adopted post-hoc, despite clear indication that Lopez-Campos was not detained under this provision.

In Santos Franco v. Raycraft, 2:25-cv-13188 (E.D. Mich.), October 21, 2025, regarding the statutory authority to detain an immigrant:

Three years after having initially released Santos Franco, and following his rearrest on August 16, 2025, Respondent now claims his detention was under Section 1225(b)(2)(A). … The Court cannot credit this new position that was adopted post-hoc, despite clear indication that Santos Franco was not detained under this provision when he was first encountered in 2016.

In Moreno Gonzalez v. Noem, 1:25-cv-13323, (N.D. Ill.), November 17, 2026, regarding

Via Capitol News Illinois: S. District Judge Robert Gettleman said the testimony “contradicted pretty thoroughly” a declaration from ICE Deputy Field Director Shawn Byers about the conditions in Broadview. “It’s just unacceptable.”

In State of California v. United States Department of Transportation, 1:25-cv-00208 (D.R.I.), November 4, 2025, regarding the conditioning of federal transportation grants on supporting deportation efforts:

Defendants contend, ad nauseam, that this “clarification” makes it clear that the IEC merely asks the States to certify compliance with federal law, and that “[t]o the extent that Plaintiffs fear that the government may have a different interpretation of what compliance with federal law means than they do, that is speculation that cannot support a facial challenge to all applications of the Immigration Conditions.” ECF No. 72 at 6. The Court will not indulge Defendants’ sophistry regarding the IEC…. Nevertheless, the plain text of the Duffy Order, the Duffy Directive, and the challenged grant conditions makes it unassailably clear that the IEC requires that states certify that they “will cooperate with Federal officials in the enforcement of Federal law.” … The Court has disposed of Defendants’ nakedly misleading characterization of what the [immigration enforcement condition (IEC)] requires. Deprived of that gimcrack defense, Defendants’ imposition of the IEC is patently arbitrary and capricious.

In Chicago Headline Club v. Noem, 1:25-cv-12173 (N.D. Ill.), November 20, regarding a temporary restraining order prohibiting the indiscriminate use of force, tear gas, rubber bullets, and other violence against protesters:

Turning to [Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg] Bovino, the Court specifically finds his testimony not credible. Bovino appeared evasive over the three days of his deposition, either providing “cute” responses to Plaintiffs’ counsel’s questions or outright lying.… Most tellingly, Bovino admitted in his deposition that he lied multiple times about the events that occurred in Little Village that prompted him to throw tear gas at protesters.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/2025-11/court%20room.jpg?itok=rrjMRFHQ,N,,2026-01-27 21:59:45.013509

However, Palantir expects data sharing among government agencies to be conducted in accordance with lawful authorities and compliant with applicable data sharing agreements.”","US immigration agents are using an app developed by Palantir that draws on the health records of millions of Americans to find and detain illegal immigrants.

The revelation comes as the US’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) comes under increased scrutiny after the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37 year old intensive care nurse, by ICE agents in Minneapolis over the weekend.

It has now emerged that data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is being fed—along with other commercial and public datasets—into an analytics app developed by Palantir, according to an investigation by news outlet 404 Media.1

Testimony from an ICE official and internal documents obtained by 404 show the app, Enhanced Leads Identification and Targeting for Enforcement (Elite), maps areas to help agents decide where to conduct detention raids.

The tool was reportedly used in recent operations, including a raid in Oregon in October in which 30 people were arrested.

According to the 404 investigation, Elite pulls names, addresses, and photos from health records. It reportedly works like Google Maps, showing ICE agents which areas have higher densities of people who could be detained. It also generates dossiers on individuals, including their name, photo, and “confidence scores” that they are at home.

An HHS spokesperson contacted by The BMJ did not clarify what information was given to ICE but said the information sharing was permitted under national law.

“Several federal laws authorise the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to make certain information available to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),” the spokesperson said. “Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, ‘any information in any records kept by any department or agency of the government as to the identity and location of aliens in the US shall be made available to’ immigration authorities.”

There is no data sharing agreement between CMS and DHS on “US citizens and lawful permanent residents,” they added.

In July 2025, it was revealed that a data sharing agreement between the US health department and ICE would see the personal data of 79 million Americans receiving Medicaid assistance handed over to the deportation agency.

This includes names, addresses, birth dates, and ethnic and racial information.2

Palantir, an American tech giant best known for its work with US defence and intelligence agencies, also works in the UK where it won a £330 million contract to develop data platforms that integrate information held across separate NHS trusts.

Doctors and patient advocacy and rights groups, as well as the BMA, have questioned if it is ethical for a US defence technology firm to handle sensitive health data and if the deal could undermine patient trust.3

Contacted by The BMJ, a Palantir spokesperson said it “cannot comment on specific data sources used by our customers in their confidential environments. However, Palantir expects data sharing among government agencies to be conducted in accordance with lawful authorities and compliant with applicable data sharing agreements.”",https://www.bmj.com/sites/default/files/highwire/bmj/392/8480.cover-source.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 18:59:19.450472

Real-time inspections are the only way to shed sunlight on the increasingly dangerous and inhumane conditions in ICE facilities.","Emergency Motion Filed After ICE Denies Minnesota Delegation Access to Facility, Citing Reinstated Policy in Secret Memo Issued by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem

Washington, D.C. — U.S. Representative Dan Goldman (NY-10) and twelve Members of Congress filed an amended complaint and emergency motion today seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) from the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to restore their right and duty to conduct oversight of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities.

In a joint statement, the plaintiffs said, “The Trump administration is using billions of taxpayer dollars to carry out a violent and lawless immigration agenda with virtually no transparency or accountability. This is not only deeply dangerous — it is an affront to the rule of law and to our constitutional duty as Members of Congress. 2025 marked the deadliest year for those in ICE custody in more than two decades, with record detentions and mounting reports of abuse and inhumane conditions. We can’t turn a blind eye. We are returning to court to restore congressional oversight and hold this administration accountable to the American people.”

The latest filing in Neguse et al. v. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al. comes after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unlawfully tried to restrict members of Congress from conducting unannounced oversight visits at ICE detention facilities, directly interfering with Congress’s right and duty to investigate conditions, ensure compliance with the law, and respond to rising reports of abuse and violence inside detention centers.

After the court preliminarily blocked(link is external) the policy in December 2025, and following the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by a federal agent in Minnesota, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem secretly reinstated the requirement through a previously undisclosed memorandum. The memo came to light only after multiple members of Congress were denied entry (link is external)to an ICE facility in Minnesota despite presenting a valid court order.

This filing adds Representative Kelly Morrison (MN-03) as a plaintiff in the case, after she was denied access to conduct lawful oversight at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minnesota.

Other plaintiffs include Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse; Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Rep. Adriano Espaillat; Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Rep. Bennie G. Thompson; Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin; House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia; House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement Ranking Member Rep. J. Luis Correa; Rep. Jason Crow; Rep. Veronica Escobar; Rep. Jimmy Gomez; Rep. Raul Ruiz; and Rep. Norma Torres.

The TRO asks the court to enforce the law by stopping DHS and ICE from obstructing oversight and restoring Congress’s ability to inspect detention facilities in real time. Without unannounced access, members cannot verify how taxpayer dollars are being spent, ensure people in government custody are treated humanely, or prevent agencies from concealing unlawful conditions before inspections occur.

The Members of Congress are represented in this suit by Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight.

“The Trump-Vance administration is trying to keep Americans from seeing what is really happening at these detention facilities to avoid accountability. We cannot avert our eyes, and our clients are entitled to use the levers of oversight that we have to get to the truth,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of Democracy Forward. “People – regardless of citizenship or immigration status – are being swept up in reckless raids, detained in overcrowded facilities, denied medical care and access to counsel, and, in some cases, dying in government custody. We are back in court because the administration continues to deny access to members of Congress from conducting essential oversight at a time when it is most needed.”

“The public has repeatedly witnessed the deadly consequences of ICE’s lawless conduct on American streets and learned of the abhorrent abuses inside its detention facilities,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “Enough is enough. Deliberately blocking Congress from exercising its lawful oversight authority to evade accountability is indefensible. Real-time inspections are the only way to shed sunlight on the increasingly dangerous and inhumane conditions in ICE facilities. Congress’s right to conduct them must be restored immediately so lawmakers can do their jobs and prevent the administration from abusing, harming, and killing more people.”

Since the start of this year, actions by the Administration have made clear that it intends to accelerate its already unprecedented and illegal efforts to punish residents of states President Trump considers political enemies or who disagree with the President, particularly on immigration enforcement.
This continues — and accelerates — a dangerous pattern from the first year of the Trump Administration, in which it illegally sought to withhold funds to coerce or punish perceived political opponents.
For example, during the government shutdown, the Administration targeted blue states[3] with funding freezes and cuts.
The Administration’s recent actions pose significant risks to families and communities across the country, to economic growth, and to the rule of law.","The Trump Administration’s extraordinary and politically motivated demand for information on nearly all federal funding going to 14 states and Washington, D.C. — all of which voted against the President in the 2024 election — continues a disturbing trend. Since the start of this year, actions by the Administration have made clear that it intends to accelerate its already unprecedented and illegal efforts to punish residents of states President Trump considers political enemies or who disagree with the President, particularly on immigration enforcement.

In early January, the Administration attempted to illegally freeze[1] billions of dollars that Congress had provided to support low-income families’ child care and other essential needs in five states led by Democratic governors. While alluding to vague, unsubstantiated concerns about fraud, the Administration provided no evidence to justify its actions, and a district court quickly blocked[2] the effort, at least temporarily.

This continues — and accelerates — a dangerous pattern from the first year of the Trump Administration, in which it illegally sought to withhold funds to coerce or punish perceived political opponents. For example, during the government shutdown, the Administration targeted blue states[3] with funding freezes and cuts. The Administration was clear about its intent: in a January court ruling finding that the Trump Administration had illegally cancelled[4] more than $7 billion in support for clean energy projects, the judge noted that federal officials “freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024.”

And recent reporting has documented how the Trump Administration embarked on a politically motivated set of attacks on major universities. Political officials directed[5] career Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers to open investigations into specific universities without first conducting factfinding to determine if there were violations of federal law. As one DOJ attorney who was involved in the investigations and subsequently resigned noted[6], “We were only told to investigate cases that were in blue states, and cases or investigations involving red states or that didn’t involve perceived political enemies of the administration never moved forward.”

The Administration is poised to expand its unlawful weaponization of federal funding to even more states. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently launched[8] a government-wide effort to identify nearly all federal spending provided to governments, institutions of higher education, and nonprofits in 14 states and the District of Columbia that all voted against President Trump in the 2024 election. (With the exception of Vermont, all of these jurisdictions are led by a Democrat.) The OMB memorandum[9] provides no rationale for why funding to only these states would be targeted, nor does it make clear why the data gathering is needed. But in stating that it “does not involve withholding funds, and therefore does not violate any court order,” it implicitly acknowledges the obvious: the intent is to facilitate exactly such withholdings — perhaps across an even greater scale of programs and recipients — even though many such efforts have already been found to be illegal. For example, in the short-term, this effort could facilitate President Trump’s stated plan[10] to punish states with jurisdictions that choose not to enter into his preferred arrangement for how local law enforcement agencies engage with federal immigration agencies — arrangements that many jurisdictions view as hindering public safety.

The Administration’s recent actions pose significant risks to families and communities across the country, to economic growth, and to the rule of law. Given the Administration’s willingness to freeze, cancel, or withhold[11] funding with little notice or justification, based on scant or no evidence, and seemingly little regard for the human impact of their actions, all federal funding in all states must be considered under continual threat of being frozen, terminated, or withheld where the Administration sees an opportunity for coercion or some kind of political benefit. Even if it only remains a threat, this uncertainty is corrosive, making it hard for businesses to invest and grow, for states and localities to undertake long-term projects[12], and for families to trust that federally supported programs and services will be there when they need them.

By destroying the trust and reliability built up over decades, the Administration’s actions poison the long-standing, productive, and necessary partnership with states, local governments, and nonprofits to provide critical services that people in every state depend on. Federal tax dollars are used to fix roads and bridges, respond to disease outbreaks and other public health threats, fund public schools, help lower the costs of essentials for families, drive foundational research that leads to medical cures and scientific breakthroughs, support entrepreneurs and small businesses, invest in safe water and clean air, and much more.",https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/iStock-584476958.jpg?itok=_ESSFDLv,N,,2026-01-27 18:58:38.271533

In south Minneapolis, snow and ice still blanketed Nicollet Avenue when federal agents fanned out and started tackling heckling protesters on Saturday, about a block away from where Alex Pretti was shot and killed.

“Shame!” the protesters yelled. “Why did you murder another one of our neighbors?” they said. The agents charged, launching gas canisters, yelling at the protesters. “Get back!” “Get out of the street!”

The agents grabbed a protester who had only a painter’s mask covering his mouth and little else to protect himself from the gas. He gasped, choking for air as he was cuffed.

Standing in front of him was a federal agent armed with a grenade launcher, used here for launching tear gas or smoke. The agent also carried a Glock handgun with two spare magazines, a stun gun and a spare magazine for an AR-15-style rifle.

The detritus left behind tells the story of deep-winter protests in subzero weather: a warm hat, a shirt, Kirkland chewy bars and hand warmers.

Nestled in the snow were two grenades for tear gas and smoke. Without traditional policing tactics, federal agents rely on these tools to push back protesters and onlookers.

Another federal agent is seen with his grenade launcher almost at his shoulder. His equipment is not uniform. His outfit — including the patch on his helmet, Nike shoes and his vest’s camouflage pattern — mirrors a distinct look promoted by military influencers selling products to newer generations eager to define themselves.

Most of the Minneapolis area appears normal. There are no signs of unrest. But an aggressive immigration crackdown by heavily armed federal agents has led to clashes with a population that largely rejects their presence.

Two centuries ago, Nicollet Avenue was a military route, connecting St. Anthony Falls to Fort Snelling. Over the weekend, it became the stage for a violent confrontation between protesters and the government’s military-like law enforcement operation in the wake of the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident.

Mexico in particular has been part of a symbiotic relationship with Vail dating back to the ski area’s opening day on Dec. 15, 1962, when its founders were actively trying to lure Mexican visitors and homeowners in Aspen to their fledging resort.

But the ripple effects from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions near Vail last week have carried over to this week, with the word “fear” featuring prominently in discussions around town.

“At the end of the day, we can’t stop what President Trump continues to do in targeting Colorado and having negative consequences. I hope we can all just maybe realize and our representatives out in D.C. can make the case that this is not a partisan issue,” state Sen. Dylan Roberts, whose district includes Vail, said in a recent phone interview.

“This is about keeping small businesses open. This is about making sure that these communities can continue to operate or else they’re going to see significant closures and impacts on people that want to call this place home,” Roberts said, pointing to discussions at the current legislative session in Denver. “I wish there was more that we could do directly at the state level, but we’re trying to consider every option, continuing to talk about it I think is helpful.”

Eagle County Commissioner Jeanne McQueeney, whose board drafted and passed a resolution of immigrant support in April, said in a recent phone interview, “The best thing we can do is be sure that people understand, immigrants understand, their rights. And those people who want to be allies to the immigrant, migrant community need to know what their role can be.”

The nonprofit Mountain Dreamers advocacy group in Summit County, which has an office in Eagle, runs a website with information in English and Spanish and a “Know Your Rights” page for people worried about interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Call Mountain Dreamers at 970-368-6354.

“You’re allowed to videotape. You’re allowed to loudly say, ‘ICE is in the area,’ You’re allowed to tell people, ‘Know your rights; you don’t have to open your door,'” McQueeney said. “That’s our role is just know how we can be an ally and how the community can be an ally.”

Vail Police Chief Ryan Kenney said ICE officials in Colorado have consistently told him they are looking for people with felony warrants when they’re operating in Eagle County. Kenney points to a state law prohibiting local law enforcement from enforcing federal immigration laws.

“They have done nothing that I know of to countermand what they’ve told me,” Kenney said. “I’m not telling people not to be worried; that’s not what I’m saying. What I am saying is what I’ve seen so far is it’s very specific enforcement here. Now, I know that that can change at any minute … but we don’t care about (immigration status). It’s not something we even consider or even ask. We want people to know that we’re here to serve them and that that will not change.”

Avon Police Chief Greg Daly celebrates the diversity that built Vail, and he notes that Vail itself was in part founded by European immigrants from ski-mad nations such as Austria and Germany.

“One of the great things about our community is it is very diverse in all different aspects of diversity,” Daly told the Gazette newspapers in December. “From a cultural perspective, we have a lot of immigrants from lots of different countries here that make this area so successful. One of the reasons I celebrate is I’m an immigrant myself. I arrived here in the Vail Valley in 1994, and I am proud of my U.S. citizenship, but I’m also proud of being Irish and my culture (in) Ireland.”

Daly said about 50% of the population of Avon identifies as Latino or Hispanic, and therefore five of his officers and one of his administrators are bilingual.

Asked if he is surprised that President Trump — who has used both J-1 visa recipients and even undocumented workers at his hotels and golf resorts — is not more sympathetic to the needs of resort areas , Vail Mayor Barry Davis said this in a recent phone interview:

“The law-and-order strawman is using a red herring to distract from the real law-and-order issues in our country,” Davis said. “Let’s pretend this was the most important law enforcement issue that our country was facing, if you’re not addressing the negative consequences of how it’s affecting our community, it’s tone deaf. No one’s called me today saying they feel safer.”

Vail business owner and Town Council member Jonathan Staufer said he had to shut down early last week because his J-1 (cultural exchange student visa) staff member was afraid, despite legally working in one of America’s most famous ski towns.

“The entire point of a republic is that people don’t have to live in fear. I wish the Republican Party would start remembering that,” Staufer said. “In order for Vail to function, you need both ends. You need people to work in those places, you need people to shop and dine in those places.

The polling picture Democrats are condemning ICE and stances on funding or abolishing the agency altogether are shifting as Americans have expressed increasing concerns with its tactics.","As the nation reckons with the shooting death of Alex Pretti at the hands of Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis, Democrats intensified Monday calls for far-reaching consequences for the country’s immigration agencies.

Their push for a transformation is playing out in Congress, in national Democratic messaging and, increasingly, in new campaign ads as Democratic primaries begin to take shape ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

Some Democrats want to all-out gut Immigration and Customs Enforcement and reform Customs and Border Protection, slash funding or hold congressional hearings. Others are calling for the impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Others want to go still further.

“Prosecute ICE,” reads a new ad from Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois’ 9th District. She and fellow Democrat Daniel Biss, the mayor of the Chicago suburb of Evanston, have tangled with immigration officers at suburban Chicago’s Broadview immigrant processing facility since early last year. Biss, too, has called for months for investigations and potential future prosecutions of immigration agents.

“Under his watch, Evanston was one of the first cities to send local law enforcement to document ICE abductions, the first step toward accountability for federal agents,” Biss' campaign told NBC News in a statement. “After the recent shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, Daniel has been crystal clear that the perpetrators of these murders must be brought to justice.”

While calls to defund ICE had been growing louder in some corners of the party for months, the sentiment to overhaul ICE and DHS is taking off. Candidates from deep-blue districts in the Chicago area to ruby-red states like Texas are elevating the issue in their campaigns, showing how rapidly the political landscape is evolving amid broad concern about Pretti's death and other recent incidents.

Things are also shifting quickly within the Democratic Party, which has struggled to navigate immigration issues in recent elections.

A Democratic think tank that recently warned the party against using “Abolish ICE” language is acknowledging the politics have dramatically shifted since Pretti was killed over the weekend.

Unlike a warning it gave less than two weeks ago, a new memo from Third Way, first shared with NBC News on Monday, does not address using the term “abolish ICE” one way or another.

The document outlines recommended talking points for Democrats as they ramp up the fight in Congress and on the campaign trail, including demanding a complete overhaul of both ICE and the Border Patrol and saying: “Secretary Noem is incompetent and must go. Where misconduct rises to the level of abuse of power, impeachment is not radical — it is a constitutional responsibility.”

Questions over ICE support are already being used in Democratic primary attack ads, including in Illinois, where violent deportation actions played out for months. Lt. Gov Juliana Stratton commissioned a mobile billboard Monday night to roam outside her Senate primary debate against Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, seizing on past contributions to his campaign.

Last month, Krishnamoorthi donated past contributions he received from a Palantir executive to an immigration rights group after a Chicago Sun-Times story raised questions about them. Krishnamoorthi released a TV ad Monday in which he says: ""We should abolish Trump’s ICE. We can’t have a government or ICE running out of control.""

Wave of responses

Pretti’s killing led a cascade of Democrats to pledge to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security, including some who had just crossed party lines to vote for the funding.

“I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis,” said Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., who represents a Long Island-based district that Donald Trump won in 2024. He was one of just seven Democrats to support the DHS funding package.

“I hear the anger from my constituents, and I take responsibility for that. I have long been critical of ICE’s unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that,” Suozzi said on Facebook, later calling on Trump to “immediately end” ICE operations in Minneapolis.

Democratic Rep. Laura Gillen, who also represents a competitive district on Long Island and voted for the DHS funding measure, said in response to Pretti’s killing that Noem “must be impeached immediately.”

Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota and is weighing a run for governor, said Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that she would oppose DHS funding. She stopped short of saying ICE should be abolished.

“We’re always going to have some immigration enforcement in this country and border control,” Klobuchar said. “I think most Americans believe that. But the way that this agency has been functioning is completely against every tenet of law enforcement.”

Democrats running for the Senate in deep-red Texas are also calling for changes to ICE after Saturday’s shooting. During their debate late Saturday afternoon, neither Rep. Jasmine Crockett nor state Rep. James Talarico used the word “abolish” to describe their positions on ICE — but both called for overhauling it.

“We absolutely have to clean house, whatever that looks like,” Crockett said.

Talarico said, “It’s time to tear down this secret police force and replace it with an agency that actually is going to focus on public safety.”

On Friday, Gov. Janet Mills, who is running for the Senate in Maine, called on Congress to “curtail” funding for ICE. After Pretti was killed, she went a step further, saying the Senate “should reject the Department of Homeland Security funding bill until there are measures in place to stop ICE’s abuses of power and lawless, dangerous conduct.”

Her primary opponent, military veteran and oyster farmer Graham Platner, attended an anti-ICE rally in Maine and wrote on X after Pretti was killed, “ICE needs to be dismantled.” At a town hall late last year, he was more direct: “Organizations that are used to kidnap Americans are not organizations that should exist in the future,” he said.

The polling picture

Democrats are condemning ICE and stances on funding or abolishing the agency altogether are shifting as Americans have expressed increasing concerns with its tactics.

Polling conducted before Pretti was killed but after an ICE agent in Minneapolis shot and killed Renee Good this month, found majorities disapproving of the agency’s operations.

A Democratic aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly, questioned how far Democrats in Congress would really go once the rubber hit the road.

“I don’t know if people are truly committed to imagining something new. It’s a lot of talking, little action,” the staffer said, adding that even with emotions high Monday, some elected officials were still reluctant to step forward as co-sponsors for new legislation. “If not now, when is the moment?”

A New York Times/Siena College poll conducted two weeks ago found 61% of registered voters saying ICE’s tactics have gone “too far,” compared with 26% who said they were just right and 11% who said they have not gone far enough.

Another poll, a CBS/YouGov survey also conducted in mid-January, found the same 61% share of Americans saying ICE is “too tough” when it stops and detains people, while 24% said it is about right and 15% said it is not tough enough.

Negative views of ICE have also increased in recent years.

Half of registered voters surveyed by NBC News in late October had negative views of ICE — a 24-point increase from April 2018, when the agency was being criticized during Trump's first term. The increase in negative views since then is driven largely by Democrats and independents.

Early dividing lines

Positions on ICE are emerging as early dividing lines in some Democratic primaries, even as the party shifts toward reining in the agency and DHS broadly.

In Michigan, home to a key Senate race this year, progressive physician Abdul El-Sayed called out his Democratic primary opponents for failing to explicitly say ICE should be abolished. His campaign noted in a new release that Rep. Haley Stevens and state Sen. Mallory McMorrow have not gone as far as El-Sayed in saying it should no longer exist.

“ICE is a paramilitary force deployed against our Constitutional order for the service of one would-be dictator. How many more people do they need to shoot?” El-Sayed said in a statement, later adding, “Rather than protecting us, it has become the thing from which we need to be protected. Abolishing this agency is the only safe path forward.”

McMorrow said Monday in a video on social media that ICE “needs a complete overhaul,” and over the weekend she encouraged Congress not to send “one more penny” to ICE “until we get the same oversight and accountability we demand from every law enforcement agency.”

Stevens, who voted against a government funding bill that included funding for DHS last week, announced over the weekend that she would co-sponsor a measure to move ICE funding to state and local law enforcement.

“Not one penny more should go to ICE. Kristi Noem must be impeached,” Stevens said in a statement. “It’s past time for Donald Trump to listen to state and local officials and call off his lawless federal agents.”

Potential 2028 presidential candidates are calibrating their positions, too. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has called for abolishing “Trump’s ICE,” a cushioned stance that is similar to Krishnamoorthi’s.

But right now, the divides over ICE are already beginning to play out on the airwaves, most notably in a crowded Democratic primary in New Jersey. The Feb. 5 special primary will choose a likely successor in Congress to Gov. Mikie Sherrill, who resigned her seat to take her new job.

United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the pro-Israel advocacy group AIPAC, launched an ad against Democratic former Rep. Tom Malinowski in the race, saying Malinowski “voted with Trump and the Republicans to fund ICE, more than 200 million for Trump’s deportation force,” when he was in Congress in 2019. The vote in question was for a broader government funding bill that won support from just over half of Democrats in the House at the time.

Malinowski pushed back against the attack on X, writing that “I want to defund ICE’s brutality” and noting that he voted with other New Jersey Democrats for funds for “humanitarian aid and security at the border.”

An outside group dubbed 218 Project launched a response ad to boost Malinowski, with the narrator saying, “Malinowski will defund ICE.”

Brendan Gill, another top candidate in the race, launched an ad featuring his wife talking about their daughter’s being frightened, saying: “Kids at school said ICE was going to deport her. It’s heartbreaking knowing her fear is what Trump wants.”

Gill says in the ad, “I won’t stand for it, not for my kids, not for anyone.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260127-ice-rs-6f1c64.jpg",N,,2026-01-27 16:58:17.720210

A federal court previously ruled that she does not hold that job.
Even grand juries — which are normally known for rubber stamping prosecutors’ requests to indict a criminal suspect — have begun to doubt the Trump Justice Department’s claims.
Still, the Supreme Court hears only a tiny fraction of all federal court cases.
Even this Supreme Court is unlikely to intervene in every single case where a federal judge orders someone illegally detained by the Trump administration to be released.","The chief judge of Minnesota’s federal district court, a George W. Bush appointee who clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, just issued a remarkable order commanding the head of ICE to appear personally before him to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court.

Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz’s order in Juan T.R. v. Noem seeks to enforce a fairly straightforward decision he handed down earlier this month.

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested an immigrant man, identified only as “Juan T.R.” in court documents, and sought to detain him under a provision of federal law that calls for detention “in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission.” But Juan is not applying to be admitted to the United States. According to Schiltz’s original order, Juan arrived in the United States around 1999. So the Trump administration’s legal justification for detaining him is simply inapplicable to this case.

Accordingly, Schiltz ordered ICE to either provide Juan with a bond hearing within seven days, or to immediately release him from detention. That order is dated January 14.

Schiltz’s second order, meanwhile, is dated January 26 — five days after the original seven day deadline expired — and it notes that “Juan has not received a bond hearing and remains detained.” Worse, Schiltz writes that his January 14 order is “one of dozens of court orders with which [the Trump administration has] failed to comply in recent weeks.”

In some cases, according to Schiltz, the Trump administration has instead extended detention without justification. In others, it has flown “an alien who should remain in Minnesota” to Texas — sometimes releasing them there and telling them to “figure out a way to get home.”

And so, after declaring that “the Court’s patience is at an end,” Schiltz ordered “Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court.” Schiltz’s order also states that Lyons may miss this January 30 hearing, and avoid contempt, if Juan is released from custody prior to the hearing.

The courts are losing patience with the Trump administration’s incompetence

One of the most striking lines in Schiltz’s order suggests a reason why ICE has been unable to comply with court orders. The Trump administration, the judge writes, “decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result.”

Indeed, if anything, the Department of Justice has lost capacity to respond to these petitions and lawsuits since Trump’s occupation of Minneapolis began. At least six DOJ attorneys in Minnesota, including the second-in-command lawyer in the US Attorney’s Office, resigned after the Trump administration pressed for a criminal investigation into the widow of Renee Good, who was killed by federal immigration officer Jonathan Ross on January 7.

Nor is Schiltz the only judge who has threatened sanctions or other harsh consequences against the Trump administration or its officials because of their incompetence.

On Monday, for example, Judge Katherine Menendez, who is hearing a lawsuit brought by the state of Minnesota that seeks to end the occupation of Minneapolis, ordered the Justice Department to explain a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi. That letter indicated that the purpose of the occupation was to coerce Minnesota into making several policy concessions to Trump, including turning over the state’s voter rolls.

While the federal government may sometimes withdraw federal funds from a state that does not comply with certain congressional demands, it may not use force against a state’s citizens in order to coerce the state into changing its policies. Such a use of force violates the 10th Amendment.

Nor is Lyons the only Trump administration official that a judge threatened with sanctions after they failed to comply with a court order. Earlier this month, a Trump-appointed judge in Richmond, Virginia threatened to disbar or otherwise discipline Lindsey Halligan, who was then a Justice Department lawyer, after she falsely claimed in a court filing that she was the US attorney in eastern Virginia. A federal court previously ruled that she does not hold that job.

Halligan has since left the Justice Department, according to NBC News.

Other judges have come very close to accusing Trump’s lawyers of lying to them in court proceedings. Even grand juries — which are normally known for rubber stamping prosecutors’ requests to indict a criminal suspect — have begun to doubt the Trump Justice Department’s claims. Just last September, grand juries in Washington, DC, alone refused to allow seven criminal cases to move forward.

By contrast, in all of 2016 — the last year before Trump took office the first time — federal prosecutors initiated over 155,000 criminal matters, and grand juries only refused an indictment in six of these cases.

It remains to be seen how much the Justice Department’s incompetence will matter, because the seniormost judges in the country are largely in the tank for Trump. In 2024, the Supreme Court’s Republican majority held that Trump may use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes.

Still, the Supreme Court hears only a tiny fraction of all federal court cases. So even if the Republican justices continue to run interference for the leader of their political party, it will be administratively quite difficult for Trump’s Justice Department to process all of the many thousands of cases it brings to federal court if the rank-and-file judges in those courts don’t trust them to be honest or to obey court orders.

Among other things, as Schiltz notes in his most recent order, hundreds of cases are likely to arise from the Minneapolis occupation, many of them involving straightforward violations of federal law, such as the Juan T.R. case. Even this Supreme Court is unlikely to intervene in every single case where a federal judge orders someone illegally detained by the Trump administration to be released.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-2258022757.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2026-01-27 19:58:42.520363

Italicized quotes pulled from the pages of George Orwell’s 77-year-old dystopian novel “1984” being repurposed as introductions to pressing issues written about on editorial pages are borderline commonplace these days. They’re cliché, really; hardly a technique that oozes creative innovation.

But in the United States in 2026, it’s not a stretch to say it can be done every day, as the line blurs between things happening today and what Orwell warned about the dangers of a totalitarian central government controlling and molding every aspect of human life to bolster its own power.

Now, we can take the most damning, famous-for-its-outrageousness statement from that cautionary tale and directly relate it to a government agent’s senseless killing of a citizen exercising Constitutional rights in broad daylight on the streets of an American city. Because the government’s first course of action afterward was a brazen demand to ignore what is obvious, and believe them instead.

The video is clear: Alex Pretti, a registered nurse we later learned cared for sick and injured veterans, is standing across the street from a doughnut shop in Minneapolis’ Whittier neighborhood. Video footage and eyewitness accounts indicate he is recording ICE agents attempting to enter the locked doughnut shop in pursuit of a suspect.

Two agents walked into the street to confront him and others; Pretti argues with several agents in the street, and one pushes him backward, onto the sidewalk. He extends his arms, still holding his cellphone, and both sides back away.

Pretti, at one point after that, entered the street, directing traffic while still filming the ICE action. Nearby, an ICE agent shoved a woman apparently protesting, and as she stumbled forward, she grabbed hold of Pretti. The agent pepper-sprayed Pretti. Another woman enters the video and is also pushed by the agent, falling to the ground.

Pretti and the first woman attempted to help the fallen woman to her feet, with his back to the agent who continued to spray the chemical irritant toward his face. A few more ICE agents arrive and pull Pretti away; video and eyewitness accounts confirm he is being beaten. He is facing the ground when one agent removes a loaded weapon from a waistband holster. A second later, at least 10 shots can be heard, at least one agent firing bullets into Pretti, who died at the scene.

Video indicates Pretti never brandished the gun, which local authorities confirmed he was licensed to carry, and he was shot after it was removed from his reach. Without that, it is difficult to justify any claim he was a threat to the agents who took his life.

But within hours of the shooting, Trump administration officials made claims about the incident that almost fully contradicted multiple angles of video.

In an initial statement, the Department of Homeland Security officials wrote that Pretti “approached…officers with a 9-mm semi-automatic handgun.” Again, he never brandished the weapon.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem insisted Pretti “impeded” operations and “attacked” officers. No footage or eyewitness accounts indicate he came within half a street and a sidewalk away from the operation, and the claim of an attack on officers is unfounded on all accounts. Despite that, both Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called Pretti “a domestic terrorist.”

ICE’s presence in Minnesota has led to legitimate questions about how narrowly Trump Administration officials view the First, Fourth and, now, Second Amendments when any are seen as an interference in immigration operations. It is a clear indication of the government’s view that our Constitutional rights are pliable, bent and reinterpreted to suit the needs and narratives of those in charge.

In that respect, we call on our representatives in Congress to demand a full, open and honest investigation into the killings of Renee Good and Pretti. We again stress the need for state and local officials to look into and enact any policies that provide instruction on how state and local governments must cooperate with federal agents, what rules they must follow and what restrictions can be placed on how they police federal policies in our communities. Lawmakers at the federal level should also push for laws mandating cooperative efforts between federal, state and local authorities investigating ICE-involved shootings.

Undocumented migrants eligible if in Spain for 5 months by 2025

Measure benefits about 500,000 people, mostly Latin Americans

Economists link Spain's falling unemployment to migrant openness

MADRID, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist-led government presented a draft decree on Tuesday to expedite legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, in its latest move to integrate migrant workers even as other European countries curb immigration.

Spain's economic growth has by far outpaced most European peers in the past two years, at least in part boosted by an openness to immigration that has dynamised key sectors like hospitality and care, and bolstered the welfare state.

Migration Minister Elma Saiz told a news conference irregular migrants who have lived in Spain for at least five months as of the end of 2025 and have no criminal record, as well as those who had applied for asylum before the end of the year, would be eligible for the accelerated residence permit.

Some 500,000 people, mostly from Latin America, stand to benefit from the measure, according to government estimates.

The permit will be valid for a year - or five in the case of children -- and renewable. After 10 years, the migrants could become citizens, or even quicker if they are from Latin America countries or refugees.

""We are strengthening a migration model based on human rights and integration, compatible with economic growth and social cohesion,"" Saiz told reporters, noting that economists across the region have attributed Spain's falling unemployment and strong growth in part to its openness to migrants.

Research from think tank Funcas suggests that around 840,000 people, a third of all non-EU migrants in Spain, were undocumented at the start of last year, a sharp increase from eight years ago when the figure stood at roughly 100,000.

A citizen-backed proposal to legalise undocumented migrants signed by 700,000 people and backed by 900 rights groups and the Catholic Church was filed over a year ago, but stalled in parliament, where disputes with splinter parties across the political spectrum have crippled the government's ability to approve legislation.

In its current form, the decree can be enacted by the cabinet within a few weeks' time without parliamentary approval. Conservative opposition leader Alberto Nuñez Feijoo has vowed to overturn the government's migratory policies if his party wins the next election, taking place at the latest next year.

2. Is the administration doing an investigation into the Pretti matter? You have claimed you are, but you have not said exactly what and who is being investigated; is it Pretti or the agents or both? Is it, as has been reported, only a “use of force” review?

Follow up questions:

a) Is Pretti a “suspect” as Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino described him (on January 25) and a domestic terrorist? Is Renee Good or Becca Good?

b) If you are investigating the federal agents involved in shooting Pretti, why not the same for Agent Ross in the Good case?

3. How can the Trump administration conclude with no investigation that both the Good and Pretti shootings were justified?

4. How do you justify bullets 2 and 3 in the Good case, when Good and her car were well past Agent Ross at the time? (The autopsy suggests it was one of those shots that killed her.)

5. How can you justify the repeated shooting of Pretti when he was lying motionless on the ground?

6. Did Pretti ever brandish a gun? if not, how can the Trump administration claim he was going to use it, or say he was going to kill law enforcement?

7. On January 26, Deputy Attorney Todd Blanche said he would not make any statement that Pretti is a “domestic terrorist,” because that would prejudice any investigation. Given that Secretary Noem made that exact statement repeatedly, why hasn’t she (and administration officials parroting that false claim) prejudiced the investigation? By contrast state and local prosecutorial authorities have not made such statements, and they routinely partner with federal authorities on these investigations; why have you not done so here, and even barred them having access to the evidence? What are you afraid of?

8. How can the Trump administration do an independent and impartial investigation when senior leaders have already announced the conclusion that both shootings were justified in self defense?

9. If having a gun at a protest is impermissible, as the FBI Director Patel has said, does that apply to the armed people who attacked the Capitol on January 6th and would the Capitol police have been justified in shooting them?

10. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Meet the Press: “[Y]ou just described what every American has seen, which is video, shortly ahead of the incident, where he was screaming in the face of ICE. He had a phone up right into ICE’s face. You tell me, is that protesting peacefully?” How is that relevant to his being shot to death if he was not an imminent danger to anyone? Does filming or shouting at federal agents during a protest justify federal agents use of deadly force? How was the conduct of Pretti not peaceful?",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Minneapolis.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 15:58:51.743515

No matter where you stand on immigration enforcement, the shootings show that what the country has been doing is not working.

The loudest voices on each extreme have retreated to their usual corners. They have an interest in keeping our immigration problems unsolved and politically divisive. Everyone else must see that Congress and the president need to embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy that acknowledges Americans’ many legitimate concerns about how the government has conducted immigration policy.

That starts with reviewing how we got here. During President Joe Biden’s term, lenient border policies and foolish state and local laws offering shelter and benefits to illegal immigrants resulted in millions of migrants entering the United States, overwhelming our cities, our legal and public education systems, and our social safety net.

Americans demanded action, electing Donald Trump in 2024. Now, just months from the November midterm elections, polls suggest that Americans are increasingly concerned about the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement operations, including in Minneapolis. Americans do not want chaos. They want a common-sense bipartisan solution.

During the Biden and Trump administrations I have helped write bills with anyone from any party who would collaborate with me on finding that solution. A workable plan requires a secure border. Thankfully, the Trump administration has effectively stopped illegal border crossings and deported, by its own count, over 675,000 illegal immigrants. Any balanced immigration policy would preserve and expand on this progress — but humanely.

Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are conducting forceful operations in American communities. They should reassess their current tactics.

Irresponsible politicians have increased the danger by delegitimizing ICE — with some calling to abolish it — and standing behind sanctuary city policies that restrict necessary cooperation between immigration enforcement officers and state and local police. Local police departments are better suited to interact with the public. Collaboration among federal, state and local law enforcement officials might have prevented some of the chaos in Minneapolis.

Collaboration should start now. The F.B.I. and state and local departments should together investigate the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. A transparent and accountable process that protects the rights of everyone involved, including the deceased and their families, would ensure all relevant evidence is collected and bolster the public’s confidence in immigration enforcement and our justice system.

Congressional scrutiny would help, too. Lawmakers should immediately convene hearings with the leadership of Homeland Security, ICE, the Border Patrol and Citizenship and Immigration Services — not to provide a platform for partisan grandstanding, but to promote an honest national conversation about immigration enforcement.

After tensions have calmed, Congress can then piece together the rest of an immigration plan that settles the issue. Along with building on Mr. Trump’s border policies, a realistic plan would provide a path to legal status — not citizenship — for long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records. This path would be rigorous and fair, and it would aim to keep families together. Fair means those who benefit would face mandatory work requirements, forgo public assistance and pay fines and any back taxes they might owe.

Congress would have to change the legal immigration system, too. Lawmakers should create a system in which applicants’ merit matters more than it does now, better accounting for the country’s economic needs. I am the husband of a naturalized citizen. My wife came to the United States in pursuit of a better life. I will always fight to provide opportunity to others who have the potential and desire to contribute to America’s success.

We must be a nation of laws but also one that offers dignity and compassion to those seeking to pursue their American dream. The events of the past several years show that there will be no Democratic or Republican solution on immigration, only an American one.

After 40 years of failure — and, now, two more deaths that did not need to occur — my colleagues and I should feel only more profoundly the responsibility to rebuild trust and act in America’s common interest.

While backing the measure, Podemos argued that refusing to grant migrants a regular status only increased labor exploitation and feeds racist hatred.","In order to get the regularization process over the line, Spain’s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez reportedly reached an agreement with the left-wing Podemos party, which previously worked in coalition with Sanchez.

The agreement was approved on Tuesday (January 27), reported the Turkish news agency Anadolu (AA). Elma Saiz, Spain’s Minister for Migration, called it a ""historic day. A migration model based on human rights and compatible with economic growth."" Spanish bishops also called for the measure to be supported.

Applications for the scheme are expected to open at the beginning of April. Once started, this would represent the first mass regularization program in almost 20 years.

To be eligible for the program, migrants will need to document at least five months of continuous stay within the country. Applicants will also need to have no relevant criminal record. Documentation needed to prove eligibility can include municipal registration, medical reports, utility contracts or money transfer certificates, reported Morocco World News (MWN).

Campaigners had been pushing for the regularization for a number of years now, finally gathering enough signatures in 2024 to get it put to a vote in parliament.

Immigration key to Spain's economic boom

Residence permit, access to healthcare and right to work

If accepted, the decree will suspend any expulsion procedures and would allow for the issue of a one-year provisional residence permit, renewable on ""standard terms,"" reports the website VisaHQ. The website exists as a paid-for service to allow people to make visa applications, but it also prints news relating to visas and residence.

Anyone granted one of the new regularized documents would have the right to work, access to the public health system and the right to register for social security. Estimates regarding how many people will be able to take up the offer range slightly. The Podemos party thinks that just over half a million people might be able to apply.

The leader of Podemos, Ione Belarra, said she believed the regularization could benefit between 500,000 and 800,000 people. Funcas, an independent think-tank dedicated to economic and social research in Spain, estimates the figure might be closer to 600,000.

Belarra underlined that the measure was for migrants who are already in Spain, ""who are working without rights."" Belarra added on social media that it was one of the biggest labor rights advances in years.

Increasing tax revenues?

According to Visa HQ, the Spanish government wants to use the measure to try and reduce the number of irregular migrants in the country. Some estimates suggest that there could be as many as 840,000 people. Reducing that number, they hope, should help reduce the risks of labor exploitation and increase tax revenues for the government.

In 2005, a similar regularization amnesty was issued to around 580,000 people. Supporters of this measure say it helped boost GDP and formal employment.

The Spanish economy is looking for more legally employed workers in the hospitality industry, logistics and elderly care. A deadline for applications is expected to remain open until June 30.

The Interior Ministry has promised to deploy around 400 temporary caseworkers and open an online portal to try and prevent backlogs in the application process. However, some civil society organizations, while welcoming the measure, are worried that Spain’s immigration offices are already overstretched and that they might not be able to cope with demand.

Spain -- an outlier in the EU

Spain remains fairly unusual within the EU bloc in its approach to migration. Countries like Italy and Germany are also seeking more skilled workers and legal pathways into their countries, but have not announced similar amnesties for the regularization of irregular migrants.

Similar regularization programs do occur across Europe periodically, depending on labor demands. According to MWN, Italy and Portugal last initiated such programs in 2020 and Greece in 2023. Sometimes the programs might also be linked to particular migrant populations, following agreements with third countries, from where the majority of migrants needed in a particular sector have been coming.

France has gone in the other direction, actually reducing regularization by over 42 percent, reports MWN over the last two years and Belgium has conducted just three mass regularization initiatives since 1974.

Over the past two years, Spain has been the fastest-growing major economy in the Eurozone. Economic data released on Tuesday, reports AA, also showed that Spain’s unemployment rate fell below ten percent for the first time in 17 years.

Nevertheless, many of Spain’s brightest qualified graduates are still seeking work in other parts of Europe, citing the difficulty of finding employment and pay commensurate with their qualifications and expectations in Spain, and or the potential possibility of earning more for the same jobs abroad.

Measure will help achieve 'social justice' thinks Podemos

The government has promised to issue decisions to applicants within 15 days of submission, reported MWN. The measure was introduced following a popular legislative initiative, which garnered around 700,000 signatures and was supported in parliament by 310 votes in favor to 33 against. The far-right and anti-migrant Vox party voted against the measure.

Podemos has promised that this measure is intended to achieve ""social justice"" for people living and working in Spain, who had been, according to the party, previously ""denied basic rights through institutional racism,"" reported MWN. While backing the measure, Podemos argued that refusing to grant migrants a regular status only increased labor exploitation and feeds racist hatred.

However, according to MWN, Sanchez has conceded on the regularization measure in order to win Podemos votes for an even more crucial 'omnibus' decree, which includes pension increases and housing measures for Spanish citizens.

Podemos had reportedly threatened to vote against the omnibus decree, which would have potentially brought down key government legislation.

“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” wrote Schiltz.

The order comes after Trump ordered “border czar” Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the death of a second person this month at the hands of an immigration law enforcement officer.

Trump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had “great calls” with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.

The White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for protests of federal officers conducting immigration raids, but after Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti and videos of the incident suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Bystander videos also suggested that 37-year-old mother of three Renee Nicole Good had not been a threat when she was shot earlier this month. Both victims were US citizens.

Schiltz’s order also follows a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St Paul for a judge to order a halt to the immigration law enforcement surge.

Immigration agents remained active Tuesday across both cities.

Schiltz wrote that he recognises ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary, “but the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed.”

The order lists the petitioner by first name and last initials: Juan TR. It says the court granted a petition on January 14 from the person to provide him with a bond hearing within seven days. On January 23, Juan’s lawyers told the court that he remained detained. Court documents show the petitioner is a citizen of Ecuador who came to the US around 1999.

A group of conservatives, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), is vowing to oppose any effort to strip out DHS funding.

But Democrats believe they have leverage as Americans recoil at Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics in Minnesota and elsewhere.

The captured-on-video killing of Alex Pretti has sparked public unease even from Trump allies in Congress and fueled new questions about how the administration is enacting its agenda, putting intense pressure on Democrats to dig in and fight.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that the “responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown” lies in the hands of Majority Leader John Thune and his fellow Senate Republicans. He called on them to agree to strip out and renegotiate the DHS bill while allowing the rest of the package — which would fund nearly three-quarters of annual agency spending — to be passed into law.

As recently as Friday, enough senators were expected to help pass the full set of funding bills, which was negotiated over the course of months by bipartisan appropriators. Now, according to a person granted anonymity to disclose private discussions, Democrats are quickly “coalescing” around a number of changes they want to the DHS bill, which won only seven Democratic votes in the House.

Those include requiring judicial warrants for immigration arrests, overruling a recently disclosed ICE memo asserting they are not required. Other potential Democratic amendments would mandate federal agents identify themselves, require DHS to cooperate with state and local investigations and limit the “mission creep of federal agencies.”

Despite the concern that has emerged within the GOP ranks after Saturday’s shooting, Republicans are moving forward with the six-bill package as currently drafted, taking a first step Monday to put it on the floor. Senators are expected to take an initial vote Thursday, when at least eight Democrats will be needed to leap a 60-vote hurdle.

Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) told reporters Monday that she did not favor removing the DHS bill from the six-bill package but that there are ongoing discussions about “further reforms or procedural protections.”

“My hope is that we’re not going to get to that point, that everyone would recognize that a government shutdown is extremely harmful and should be avoided,” Collins said when asked about the prospects for a partial shutdown.

Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.), who leads the Appropriations subcommittee dealing with DHS and met with Collins Monday, also told reporters the Senate should pass the funding package as is but that there could be actions taken “within the purview of the administration” to address Democrats’ concerns.

Some lawmakers and aides held out hope that some of Trump’s moves Monday, which included sending border czar Tom Homan to oversee the Minnesota enforcement surge, would soften the ground for a possible deal. Others were encouraged that lines of communications remained open between the parties early in the week.

Republicans are facing their own internal pressures as they seek to avoid a shutdown. A group of conservatives, including Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), is vowing to oppose any effort to strip out DHS funding. And because the Senate is locked in a time crunch with the Friday midnight deadline looming, any one senator can block an attempt to quickly amend the legislation.

At the same time, there are some Democratic qualms about pushing agencies to the brink less than three months after ending a record 43-day shutdown fought over health care. Some are noting that ICE and Border Patrol will continue to be funded in any case through the GOP megabill enacted last year while other DHS agencies such as FEMA and TSA would be subject to the shutdown.

But so far Democrats are insisting that Republicans agree to rewrite the bill. Democrats are skeptical that the administration can be trusted to take executive action or that standalone legislation reining in DHS would ever make it through the House.

“My options are to do nothing or to recognize that two U.S. citizens were recently … executed by federal agents,” Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) told reporters Monday. “We need to at least bring some level of pressure on DHS or on our Republican colleagues to explain to the American public why we are going to continue funding this without any changes.”

Even sending an amended bill back to the House would carry the risk of an extended standoff. One senior House Republican granted anonymity said that would open a new “hellscape” in the funding talks, with the fractious GOP conference divided over the way forward.

“Democrats already had a say in DHS funding during the bipartisan negotiations that occurred on each and every individual appropriations bill,” said a House GOP aide granted anonymity to speak candidly about the dynamics. “If they renege on the agreement on any of these bipartisan bills, then it would open a bigger can of worms.”

Privately, many Republicans on Capitol Hill believe that any off-ramp to be found before Friday night’s deadline will need to come from the White House, according to two people granted anonymity to disclose private thinking.

But the administration said Monday it wants to see the six-bill package passed as written — without the DHS funding separated out.

“Policy discussions on immigration in Minnesota are happening,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, adding that those talks “should not be at the expense of government funding for the American people.”

Speaker Mike Johnson’s leadership circle is still weighing options as the partial shutdown looms.

In a hearing, U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he would dismiss the suit and issue a final written opinion in the coming days. The updated docket for the case showed that Oregon’s move to dismiss the case was granted.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield welcomed the move.

“The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,” he said in an emailed statement. “Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can’t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Kasubhai scheduled the hearing after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dated Saturday, the same day federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, which has seen widespread protests over increased immigration enforcement and the previous killing of Renee Good by an immigration officer.

In her letter, Bondi asked the Democratic governor to support immigration officers and shared three “simple steps” to “help bring back law and order” — including by giving the Justice Department the ability to “access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota’s voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

Bondi also asked for the state’s records of its Medicaid and food assistance programs, and for the repeal of sanctuary policies that limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Officials in many states have said turning over such information would violate both state and federal privacy laws.

The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data. Last week a federal judge in Georgia dismissed such a suit after ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city, and earlier this month a federal judge in California dismissed a suit there after finding the government’s request was “unprecedented and illegal.”

The department has said it needs to access detailed voter data to ensure election officials are following federal election laws. Election officials have disputed that and raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.

In a July letter, the department asked Oregon for an electronic copy of its statewide registration list and details on the steps it has taken to remove ineligible voters, court filings show. It sent another letter in August saying it needed the voter list to assess compliance with federal law, and that the list must include information such as full names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers.

Oregon officials responded in August that the department lacked the authority to request the list and offered to provide the publicly available list, court filings show. The department argued it has the authority to request the data under multiple federal laws and is complying with privacy laws.

Kasubhai called for the Monday hearing in Oregon’s lawsuit so that attorneys on both sides could provide additional arguments on how Bondi’s letter was relevant in interpreting the “basis and purpose” of the department’s request for voter data.

The department argued it had authority under the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to request voter records, as the law says such records are to be made available to the U.S. Attorney General upon a demand in writing that states the basis and purpose of the request. Yet Kasubhai said the department’s August letter did not satisfy the law’s requirement for stating a basis and purpose when requesting voter records. He added that he read the congressional record of the time when the law was passed, and found it was “unequivocal” on the release of records being associated with investigations involving discrimination in elections.

The Justice Department’s outreach has raised alarm among some election officials because the agency doesn’t have the constitutional authority to run elections. That power is granted to states and Congress. Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260126-Oregon-voting-file-aa-1105-71814d.jpg",N,,2026-01-27 14:59:41.721303

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, putting Congress back on the brink of another spending fight.

What we know:

A House-passed bill would fund six federal agencies, including DHS, but the weekend’s events in Minneapolis have shifted the debate.

The measure now sits in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have vowed to block DHS funding, arguing the agency’s immigration enforcement has grown out of control.

Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said her constituents have overwhelmingly urged her to oppose funding for the department.

""That's overwhelmingly what my constituents have asked me to do. Do not go to fund ICE. What I think most Americans would rather have me support them and stand up to the Trump administration. All we're asking the Republicans to do is pull out the funding for DHS and let's work on fixing the problems in it and let's work on adding things that will rein in ICE. I want money to go back to local law enforcement,"" Duckworth said.

Seven Democrats would need to support the bill to overcome a filibuster and advance it. Republicans have not said whether they are open to negotiations or cuts to DHS funding to secure Democratic votes.

Some Democrats are taking a harder line, pledging to block any action until DHS Secretary Kristi Noem resigns.

The rally took place along Second Avenue outside the federal building as a spending bill moves through the Senate. Demonstrators chanted “ICE out” and called on lawmakers to reject any additional funding for ICE and Customs and Border Protection.

Organizers said the event was planned in less than 24 hours and was part of a broader effort to pressure federal lawmakers.

Roxana Norouzi, executive director of OneAmerica, said the demonstration reflected both anger and grief over the impact of immigration enforcement.

“I feel angry, I feel heartbroken that this is what we have to be here doing,” Norouzi said. “Not only lives lost, but families separated because of this cruelty.”

Norouzi said the group’s primary demand was that senators oppose funding for ICE and push for greater accountability.

“We want Senator Murray and Cantwell to not only vote no, but use the power they have to refuse to give even one more dollar to ICE or Customs and Border Patrol,” she said.

The rally remained peaceful and took on the atmosphere of a demonstration rather than a march, with live music and speeches. No arrests were reported.

Cameron Lavi-Jones, a musician who performed at the rally, said the event was intended to encourage action beyond public demonstrations.

“My goal here today is to remind people that there’s still tangible actions that we can do,” Cameron said. “This only works if there’s tangible action.”

Lavi-Jones said fear within immigrant communities was a driving force behind the protest.

“People are scared to leave their houses.

In a statement reported by CNN, Walz said he had outlined the state's priorities to Homan, including impartial investigations into the two shootings and reducing the 3,000-strong force of federal agents that has been deployed to the city. Homan and Walz agreed to ""continue working toward those goals,"" the governor said.

The move to install Homan in place of top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who sources said is leaving after having led most of Trump's crackdowns in Democratic-led cities, is part of a broader reset by the president amid some advisers' concerns that the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents could derail his immigration agenda.

Homan's job in Minneapolis is to ""recalibrate tactics"" and improve cooperation with state and local officials, a source with ties to the White House said.

""The goal is to scale back, eventually pull out,"" the source added.

Homan is also expected to sit down with Mayor Jacob Frey, Trump said on social media.

The president spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers to reassess the administration's response to Pretti's death on Saturday, according to the same source and a White House official.

The discussions included reducing the number of agents in Minnesota, recalibrating the mission to focus more narrowly on deportations rather than broad enforcement operations and exploring greater coordination with state authorities. Trump also weighed whether immigration officers should be required to have body-worn cameras, as many police officers do, according to the White House official.

SUPPORT FOR TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION DRIVE WANES

The killing of Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents on Saturday during daytime protests, has become a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations.

Coupled with the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti's shooting sparked renewed anger over the aggressive tactics of the federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.

Late on Monday, Minnesota's chief federal judge threatened to hold the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, in contempt for his agency's failures to comply with court orders that some detainees receive bond hearings.

""The court's patience is at an end,"" U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote in ordering Lyons to appear before him on Friday.

Bystander video of Pretti's killing was widely shared, contradicting some Trump officials' initial claims that Pretti, who was legally carrying a concealed gun but never touched it prior to being shot, posed a threat to law enforcement.

Public support for Trump's immigration enforcement tactics appeared to be waning both before and after the Pretti shooting, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. The issue has put Republicans on the defensive ahead of November's midterm elections, when the party's narrow congressional majorities are at stake.

TRUMP IN DAMAGE CONTROL MODE

The president held a two-hour meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office on Monday evening after Noem asked to meet, a source briefed on the matter confirmed. Noem's job is not in jeopardy, the source said. The New York Times first reported the meeting.

The typically combative Trump has also struck a more conciliatory tone in public remarks. He characterized private conversations with both Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday as productive, while the two Democratic leaders offered similarly positive comments, a far cry from the vitriol the two sides had previously exchanged.

Walz's office said Trump had agreed to direct DHS to ensure state authorities could conduct their own investigation into the Pretti shooting, while Frey said on X that his understanding was that some federal agents would begin leaving the city on Tuesday.

Privately, Trump made clear to advisers he did not want to defend the agent's actions or attack Pretti, after Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller labeled Pretti an ""assassin"" and Bovino suggested he intended to ""massacre"" officers, among other attacks from administration officials. Video footage of the incident verified by Reuters contradicted those allegations.

Senior aides were asked not to target Pretti publicly, and the president discussed distancing himself from public comments made by Miller and Noem, the White House official said.

Bovino, who said the officers who killed Pretti were the true victims in Saturday's shooting, is expected to depart Minneapolis along with some Border Patrol agents deployed with him, a senior administration official told Reuters on Monday.

Another person familiar with the matter said Bovino had been stripped of his specially created title of ""commander at large"" and would return to his former job as a chief patrol agent along California's El Centro sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, before retiring soon after.

Asked about Bovino's future on Tuesday, DHS pointed to a statement from spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin on Monday that said, ""Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties.""

DHS officials described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun, even though video showed Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as agents wrestled him to the ground.

It also showed officers removing a firearm from his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner who lived half a mile from the scene.

Gun rights groups have pushed back on Trump administration officials' suggestion that Pretti should not have been armed, a rare election-year rift between Republicans and one of their most loyal voting blocs.

Some other states, largely Republican-led ones, have provided their voter data to a separate but related program in the Department of Homeland Security.
The Justice Department has sued at least 24 states and territories, including Minnesota, to force them to turn over their voter data.","After federal immigration agents shot and killed an American citizen in Minneapolis for the second time this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota that outlined what she described as three “simple steps” to “bring back law and order.”

Her final step, however, seemed to have little to do with immigration or the state’s fraud scandal, the stated reasons for the federal government’s presence in Minnesota.

“Third, allow the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota’s voter registration practices comply with federal law,” she wrote. Minnesota’s secretary of state, Steve Simon, a Democrat, swiftly rejected the demand, calling it an “outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. citizens in violation of state and federal law.”

Ms. Bondi’s request was part of a nearly yearlong fight in which the Trump administration has sought voters’ private data from states across the country. Numerous states, including Minnesota, have not complied, and the Justice Department has sued them.

Here’s a look at what is happening and the concerns over privacy and elections that have arisen:

What, exactly, are these voter rolls?

Nearly every state has a public version of its voter roll that includes basic information like first and last names. Some of these rolls include addresses.

But the complete, unredacted voter file includes personal identifying information, like driver’s license numbers and Social Security numbers. This list is kept private and is maintained by top election officials in each state.

Traditionally, no one can obtain it through public records requests — not even the Justice Department.

Why does the Justice Department want these files?

Ms. Bondi has said that the Trump administration is trying to keep elections secure. But President Trump and his allies — who tried to overturn the 2020 election and continue to deny its legitimacy — have long pushed unsubstantiated claims about undocumented immigrants voting illegally.

And last year, the Justice Department began to try to build the largest set of national voter roll data it has ever collected, raising concerns that the data could be used to cast doubt on future election results.

Is this a normal request?

No, it’s highly unusual.

The Justice Department has taken aggressive steps in the past to try to root out voter fraud, including during former President George W. Bush’s administration. But the idea of the federal government obtaining states’ private voter information was long seen as an overreach, because the Constitution dictates that elections are run mainly by individual states, not the administration in Washington.

How many states have complied?

At least 11, all of them at least partly run by Republicans, according to data from the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights and democracy group. Some other states, largely Republican-led ones, have provided their voter data to a separate but related program in the Department of Homeland Security.

But roughly half of the country’s states, most of them led by Democrats, have rejected the requests. The Justice Department has sued at least 24 states and territories, including Minnesota, to force them to turn over their voter data.

Why have states refused?

Some states, including Minnesota, have laws that prevent the transfer of private information. Others have expressed worries about how the Justice Department will keep the enormous troves of private information secure.

But for many election officials and voting rights experts, the main concern is that the Justice Department’s effort is led by Trump allies who long falsely denied that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won the 2020 election.

“These data can be manipulated to support false claims about ineligible voting and justify efforts to thwart free and fair elections,” Wendy Weiser, who directs the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, wrote on social media.

The Minnesota secretary of state, Mr. Simon, said this possibility was on his mind.

“Though I’m not necessarily predicting direct federal interference with elections, I am planning for it,” he said in an interview, “and it would be irresponsible to not do that.”

Do states have a right to withhold the data?

This is still being litigated, but some legal experts have pointed to the Constitution’s language that the “times, places and manner” of elections are governed by the states, and that only Congress — not the president — can make or change election laws.

This month, a federal judge in California dismissed the Justice Department’s lawsuit against California seeking to obtain its full voter roll.

“The taking of democracy does not occur in one fell swoop; it is chipped away piece-by-piece until there is nothing left,” wrote Judge David O. Carter, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. “The erosion of privacy and rolling back of voting rights is a decision for open and public debate within the legislative branch, not the executive.”

And on Monday, a federal judge in Oregon said during a hearing that he was dismissing the Justice Department’s lawsuit against the state, with a written opinion to follow in the coming days.

The judge, Mustafa T. Kasubhai, had called the hearing to address Ms. Bondi’s letter, but he said he was making his decision on other legal grounds. Still, he suggested that he had concerns about “the basis and the purpose” of the Justice Department’s pursuit of voter records based on what Ms. Bondi wrote.

Are there any other concerns?

Election officials also say that any national voter roll within the Justice Department would probably be rife with errors because each state’s voter file is updated every day, changing as voters move away or die.

“If any state were to provide a voter list, and the list against which the federal government or anyone else is checking it is out of date, you’re going to have a lot of falsely identified ineligible voters,” Mr. Simon said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/us/politics/pol-minnesota-voter-rolls/pol-minnesota-voter-rolls-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:58:36.417224

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said Jan. 26 that he's spoken with staff at the Milwaukee Police Department and the County Sheriff's Office and neither agency has heard ""anything from any federal agency up until this point"" about a major enforcement operation in the city.

Meanwhile, local immigrants' rights groups that work to confirm ICE arrests are asking people to pause before sharing rumors online and to realize the chatter adds to fear in immigrant communities.

But they also want people to be prepared and vigilant, recognizing that ICE agents are continually operating in the Milwaukee area, mostly making targeted arrests of individuals.

""It makes people afraid to attend important appointments and can lead to more fear and confusion. Please help us keep our community safe and calm by only sharing confirmed information.""

Hotel rumor spreads without evidence

One widely-spread rumor claims that ICE booked rooms at a Hilton hotel in downtown Milwaukee, implying that it is part of a buildup of agents for a large-scale crackdown. The posts appeared on Facebook, X, Threads and elsewhere.

Physician Kristin Lyerly, a Democrat who ran for the 8th District Congressional seat in northeast Wisconsin, joined in repeating the hotel rumor in a Jan. 26 post on X that was viewed more than 364,000 times.

Lyerly deleted the post hours later, after pushback. She said in a statement she deleted the post after she spoke to a local leader and ""it became clear that there wasn't enough evidence to support it, and there was potential for causing more harm than good.""

Those who say they have debunked the hotel rumor include Comité sin Fronteras and its parent group Voces de la Frontera, Darryl Morin of Forward Latino, Emilio de Torre of Milwaukee Turners, and state Rep. Ryan Clancy.

Others on social media have claimed to have spotted U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in public places, or they say they have inside information about an upcoming major operation in Wisconsin, often without providing a credible source.

""At this time (Sunday, Jan 25th) there is not an emergency/ high alert / risk situation,"" Voces de la Frontera wrote on Facebook.

Morin, of Forward Latino, wrote about the flood of calls his office has gotten: ""Please know that the vast majority of these reports have been incorrect.""

Clancy, a Democrat who represents Milwaukee in the state Legislature, said he appreciates the public trying to help. But spreading misinformation can overwhelm groups like Voces de la Frontera who work to verify reports, he said.

“We have seen many people, some of whom are well-intentioned, and some of whom are, I think, seeking attention,” he said. “I would ask people very explicitly not to share unfounded rumors.""

Clancy said he checked with a service industry contact about the Hilton rumor and looked up room availability online to see that prices had not surged due to a large-scale booking.

The Hilton brand in particular has been in the spotlight after a Hampton Inn in Lakeville, Minnesota canceled ICE agents' bookings. Hilton removed the hotel from its system and apologized in response. The company did not respond to Journal Sentinel requests for comment.

Unverified reports about ICE tap into emotions, can spread fast

Rumors about potential ICE operations may be misinformation — inaccurate information spread mistakenly or unknowingly — or disinformation — which is willful lying spread for a specific purpose.

Regardless, the hot-button topic of immigration enforcement taps into emotions and fear, said Daniel Lawrence, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Superior and a digital media theorist.

""Sometimes it's the most emotionally evocative information which spreads most rapidly throughout a population,"" he said, rather than facts.

What's more: ""No one thinks that they're susceptible to disinformation or misinformation,"" Lawrence said, although they likely are.

It can be difficult for people to verify information online, especially with the rise of content generated by artificial intelligence that can be hard to identify. ""Viral"" posts can spread quickly from one person to the next, without anyone checking if it's true.

In one recent post, a social media user shares a screenshot about the hotel booking rumor and says they cannot not confirm if it is true, but asks their followers to help verify it. By trying to keep their friends informed, the user unintentionally spreads the false rumor farther.

""We’re vectors for really harmful viruses and we may not even realize it a lot of the time,"" Lawrence said.

Tips for using social media with a critical eye

Voces de la Frontera asks people to call its statewide hotline to report credible ICE sightings and details about what they saw.

Morin, of Forward Latino, offered tips for how to document and report ICE operations:

Take video or photos

Write down the exact address

Note the number of agents and number of detainees

Include other descriptions such as vehicles, uniforms, and markings for certain agencies.

The best way to operate online is to be ""constantly asking questions,"" Lawrence said. For every post users engage with, and every bit of information they see, they should stop and ask: Where did it come from? Is this a credible source?

Increasingly important, he said, is: How did this information end up in my feed? Targeted advertisements can masquerade as organic content. Algorithms tailor what people see.

""If I'm having a strong reaction to something, then let's research it further,"" Lawrence said. ""And then try to find some truth in the hurricane of information that's going around us.""

UNI affiliates including CWA, SEIU, UFCW and UNITE HERE have been out front and vocal in Minnesota and around the country.

Condemning the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE, CWA President Claude Cummings said: “I honour the bravery of every American with the courage to peacefully protest or picket today.”

Additionally, CWA locals in Minnesota are mobilizing for the families of two members abducted by ICE.

SEIU Minnesota issued a forceful call:

“Children are being taken, our neighbours afraid to leave their homes and Minnesotans being killed by federal agents in our streets. ENOUGH. Our families are not safe with ICE here. ICE MUST LEAVE MINNESOTA NOW.”

With a significant portion of their membership made of immigrants, UNITE HERE Local 17 has stepped up mutual aid efforts so that union members can have food and other essentials while in hiding from ICE.

In a statement praising the 23 January day of action, UFCW 663 said:

“With ICE activity continuing to strike fear into essential workers across the country and reaching more extreme and even deadly levels, it is critical that we take action to protect our members. Every UFCW member, every worker and every person, deserves to live and work free from fear. Our communities and local economies cannot thrive unless people feel safe.”

Praising unions for pushing back against state violence and repression head-on, UNI General Secretary Christy Hoffman said:

“The Trump administration is not just targeting immigrants. It is attacking justice and truth at their core. The resistance unions are leading now matters far beyond U.S. borders. When workers stand up to defend immigrants, families and communities against abuse, they are defending fundamental human rights everywhere. The global trade union movement stands with them and supports this struggle in every way possible.”",https://uniglobalunion.org/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2718204069-1000x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:59:00.747393

(AP) — A federal judge in Oregon dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit seeking Oregon's unredacted voter rolls on Monday in another setback to wide-ranging efforts by President Donald Trump's administration to get detailed voter data from states.
""Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can’t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.” The Justice Department declined to comment.
The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers.
The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data.
Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.","PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A federal judge in Oregon dismissed a Justice Department lawsuit seeking Oregon's unredacted voter rolls on Monday in another setback to wide-ranging efforts by President Donald Trump's administration to get detailed voter data from states.

In a hearing, U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he would dismiss the suit and issue a final written opinion in the coming days. The updated docket for the case showed that Oregon's move to dismiss the case was granted.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield welcomed the move.

“The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,” he said in an emailed statement. ""Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can’t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Kasubhai scheduled the hearing after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dated Saturday, the same day federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, which has seen widespread protests over increased immigration enforcement and the previous killing of Renee Good by an immigration officer.

In her letter, Bondi asked the Democratic governor to support immigration officers and shared three “simple steps” to “help bring back law and order"" — including by giving the Justice Department the ability to “access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

Bondi also asked for the state's records of its Medicaid and food assistance programs, and for the repeal of sanctuary policies that limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Officials in many states have said turning over such information would violate both state and federal privacy laws.

The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data. Last week a federal judge in Georgia dismissed such a suit after ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city, and earlier this month a federal judge in California dismissed a suit there after finding the government’s request was “unprecedented and illegal.”

The department has said it needs to access detailed voter data to ensure election officials are following federal election laws. Election officials have disputed that and raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.

In a July letter, the department asked Oregon for an electronic copy of its statewide registration list and details on the steps it has taken to remove ineligible voters, court filings show. It sent another letter in August saying it needed the voter list to assess compliance with federal law, and that the list must include information such as full names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers.

Oregon officials responded in August that the department lacked the authority to request the list and offered to provide the publicly available list, court filings show. The department argued it has the authority to request the data under multiple federal laws and is complying with privacy laws.

Kasubhai called for the Monday hearing in Oregon's lawsuit so that attorneys on both sides could provide additional arguments on how Bondi's letter was relevant in interpreting the “basis and purpose” of the department's request for voter data.

The department argued it had authority under the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to request voter records, as the law says such records are to be made available to the U.S. Attorney General upon a demand in writing that states the basis and purpose of the request. Yet Kasubhai said the department's August letter did not satisfy the law's requirement for stating a basis and purpose when requesting voter records. He added that he read the congressional record of the time when the law was passed, and found it was “unequivocal” on the release of records being associated with investigations involving discrimination in elections.

The Justice Department’s outreach has raised alarm among some election officials because the agency doesn’t have the constitutional authority to run elections. That power is granted to states and Congress. Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schiltz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

""This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,"" the judge wrote.

The order comes a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the second death this month of a person at the hands of an immigration law enforcement officer.

Trump said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that he had ""great calls"" with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, mirroring comments he made immediately after the calls.

As he left the White House, the president was asked whether Alex Pretti's killing by a Border Patrol officer Saturday was justified. He responded by saying that a ""big investigation"" was underway.

Walz's office said Tuesday that the Democratic governor met with Homan and called for impartial investigations into the shootings involving federal officers. They agreed on the need to continue to talk, according to the governor.

WATCH: Sadness, anger and exhaustion grip Twin Cities after latest killing by federal agents

The White House had tried to blame Democratic leaders for the protests of federal officers conducting immigration raids. But after the killing of Pretti on Saturday and videos suggesting he was not an active threat, the administration tapped Homan to take charge of the Minnesota operation from Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino.

Immigration agents were active Tuesday across the Twin Cities region, and it was unclear if officials had changed tactics after the shift in tone from the White House.

The streets appeared largely quiet in many south Minneapolis neighborhoods where unmarked convoys of immigration agents have been sighted regularly in recent weeks, including the neighborhoods where the two deaths occurred. But Associated Press staff saw carloads of agents in northeast Minneapolis, as well as the northern suburb of Little Canada.

Schiltz's order also follows a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to order a halt to the immigration law enforcement surge. The judge said she would prioritize the ruling but did not give a timeline for a decision.

Schiltz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. ""But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,"" he said.

""Respondents have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders, and that they have taken steps to ensure that those orders will be honored going forward,"" he wrote. ""Unfortunately, though, the violations continue.""

The Associated Press left messages Tuesday with ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

The order lists the petitioner by first name and last initials: Juan T.R. It says the court granted a petition on Jan. 14 to provide him with a bond hearing within seven days. On Jan. 23, his lawyers told the court the petitioner was still detained. Court documents show the petitioner is a citizen of Ecuador who came to the United States around 1999.

The order says Schiltz will cancel Lyons' appearance if the petitioner is released from custody.

Catalini reported from Trenton, New Jersey. Associated Press writer Tim Sullivan in Minneapolis contributed to this report.

This story has been corrected to show the judge is called Patrick J. Schiltz not Schlitz.

Walz's office said in a statement that he had a ""productive"" call with the president about an hour after Trump himself said the two were on a ""similar wavelength.""

The comments mark a major tonal shift and come amid growing backlash after federal immigration agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis this month, including Pretti, an ICU nurse who treated veterans, and Renee Nicole Good, a poet and mother of three.

Republican lawmakers have increasingly called for investigations into the killing of Pretti as Democrats refuse to fund the Department of Homeland Security despite the likelihood of a government shutdown.

Trump on Monday said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to lead some operations on the ground. In Minneapolis, thousands of protesters braved subzero temperatures to decry the shooting and call for an end to the federal intervention.

Meanwhile, a federal judge on Monday heard arguments over the legality of the ongoing immigration enforcement in Minnesota. Another judge will consider whether to extend an order barring federal authorities from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the deadly shooting of Pretti.

Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino leaving Minneapolis

Homeland Security’s top immigration enforcer is reportedly leaving Minneapolis amid the ongoing fallout in the city.

Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino will leave the Midwestern city, The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press and The New York Times reported on Monday, citing officials familiar with the matter.

Bovino’s departure from Minnesota comes as the White House on Monday announced that border czar Tom Homan is being sent to the state as the Trump administration’s new point person for immigration enforcement operations.

The Atlantic Magazine reported Monday evening that Bovino is set to return to his post at the El Centro Border Station in California. CNN reported his access to social media accounts had been suspended.

Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin in a statement vehemently denied the shakeup.

""Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties,"" said McLaughlin, adding the chief remains ""a key part of the President’s team and a great American.""

Bovino has spearheaded the Trump administration's militarized approach to immigration enforcement, tussling with protesters and throwing chemical irritants into crowds in multiple states. In Minneapolis, the Border Patrol commander-at-large has declared that the agents who killed Alex Pretti were victims, not the slain nurse.

""The suspect put himself in that situation; the victims are the Border Patrol agents,"" Bovino said of Pretti.

Poll shows Trump's immigration approval drops to new low

American approval of the president’s immigration policy dropped to its lowest level since his return to the White House, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll found, amid growing backlash after federal immigration agents fatally shot two people in Minneapolis this month.

The poll, conducted nationwide Jan. 23 through Jan. 25, gathered responses before and after immigration officers on Jan. 24 killed a second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis. About 53% of Americans polled disapprove of the president's immigration policy, while 39% approve of the job Trump is doing on immigration, down from 41% in the prior Reuters/Ipsos poll this month.

Poll results show a steep drop in approval from where Trump began after his inauguration. Immigration was a brighter spot then; in Feb. 2025, 50% approved and 41% disapproved.

Alex Pretti sister issues statement: 'When does this end?'

Pretti’s sister shared a statement Monday celebrating her older brother’s efforts to help others and slamming federal officials spreading ""disgusting lies"" about him.

""All Alex ever wanted was to help someone — anyone,"" Micayla Pretti said in a statement, according to The Associated Press. ""Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that.""

Micayla Pretti also called out federal officials for their characterization of her sibling. Top figures in the Trump administration described Pretti as a ""would-be assassin"" and ""domestic terrorist.""

""When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?"" Micayla Pretti asked. ""Hearing disgusting lies spread about my brother is absolutely gut-wrenching.""

Pretti remembered at Green Bay school board meeting by former teachers

What would’ve been a normal Green Bay School Board meeting, held on Jan. 26, opened instead with a speech by board president James Lyerly, honoring Pretti as a ""conscientious, civic-minded individual.""

""His life reflects the values that we strive to instill in our students,"" Lyerly said. ""Compassion, service and responsibility to others.""

Pretti was a former Green Bay Preble High School student who was deeply involved in the performing arts.

Seven people spoke for about 30 minutes during the open forum portion of the meeting, memorializing the singer, helper and leader they knew in school.

""We will always value his leadership and spread some of the kindness that he gave to others,"" Carol Miller, former Preble musical director, said. ""That’s the ripple effect. And I think that’s where his legacy therein lies.""

Susan McAllister said she could still see Pretti, who was her music student for all four years of high school, standing in the bass section of the choir.

""My heart is broken under Alex’s death. And of course, like everybody else, I am deeply angry,"" McAllister said. ""But I am also so, so proud of the young man I knew.""

Trump speaks to Minneapolis Mayor Frey, touts ‘lots of progress’

Trump said he spoke to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey by phone on Monday, characterizing it as a positive discussion after speaking earlier in the day with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The communication with the two Democratic officials comes as the White House tries to calm tensions following Alex's Pretti's death on Saturday.

“I just had a very good telephone conversation with Mayor Jacob Frey, of Minneapolis,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “Lots of progress is being made!”

Trump also said his new point person for immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota, border czar Tom Homan, will meet with Frey on Tuesday “in order to continue the discussion.”

DHS has body-worn camera footage of Pretti shooting: report

Homeland Security officials said the agency has body-worn camera footage of Alex Pretti’s fatal shooting, according to a report from NBC News.

Agency Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told NBC that Homeland Security investigators have videos recorded by multiple agents of the shooting that’s sparked outrage across the country.

Several bystanders recorded cell phone video of the shooting, and witnesses provided sworn testimony to what they saw. But the body-worn cameras could provide the clearest picture yet of the shooting and moments that led up to it.

Homeland Security officials did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's requests for comment.

Leavitt addresses 'domestic terrorism' allegations from White House officials

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt appeared to distance President Donald Trump from White House officials’ allegations that Alex Pretti was committing “domestic terrorism” when he was shot and killed by federal authorities.

Stephen Miller, deputy White House chief of staff, called Pretti a “would-be assassin” shortly after Saturday’s killing and said the 37 year old was attempting to “murder federal agents.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Pretti of being a domestic terrorist.

“I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way; however, I have heard the president say he wants to let the facts of the investigation to lead itself,” Leavitt said during a Monday briefing with reporters when asked whether the president shares Miller’s and Noem’s positions.

A reporter asked Leavitt whether Miller would be apologizing to Pretti’s family over his comments.

“Look, again, this incident remains under investigation,"" Leavitt responded. ""And nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives on American streets.”

White House blames Democrats for Pretti fatal shooting

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats in Minnesota for the killing of Alex Pretti.

Leavitt accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey of “spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers,” blocking state and local officials from cooperating with immigration authorities and using their platforms to encourage “left-wing agitators” to confront and obstruct agents.

“Let's be clear about the circumstances which led to that moment on Saturday,” Leavitt said during a Monday press briefing. “This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.”

Levitt noted that the federal investigation into Pretti’s killing remains open.

""Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,"" Leavitt said. ""This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement, and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals.""

Leavitt said later in the briefing that actions by Walz and Frey are what ""led to the moment that we are in today,"" where Trump and Walz got on the phone to discuss the situation. She described the call as a ""constructive and productive conversation to end the chaos and the lawlessness that has taken place"" in Walz' home state.

White House says Minnesota, Minneapolis need to help enforce immigration laws

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said there is “a clear and simple path” that Minnesota could take to assist federal law enforcement so that “Customs and Border Patrol will not be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota.”

She said Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey need to turn over unauthorized immigrants with criminal records who are in their prisons.

She said state and local police should turn over all undocumented immigrants in custody.

She said state and local police need to help with immigration enforcement against people wanted for crimes, “especially violent crimes.”

A report by the libertarian Cato Institute found that only 5% of people had violent convictions, and 73% had no criminal convictions. A report from the Guardian found that immigrants with no criminal records are driving the record high number of detentions.

Walz’s office said in a previous statement that the state of Minnesota honors Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainers, and “there is not a single documented case of the department’s releasing someone from state prison without offering to ensure a smooth transfer of custody.”

Trump says DOJ is investigating Rep. Ilhan Omar over her wealth

Trump said the Justice Department is investigating Rep. Ilhan Omar over the Minnesota Democrat's personal wealth, escalating his attacks against a political rival he's said should be deported.

Trump announced the move in a Monday post on Truth Social, saying the Justice Department and Congress ""are looking at 'Congresswoman' Illhan Omar, who left Somalia with NOTHING, and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars. Time will tell all."" Trump misspelled the congresswoman's first name in the post.

The president has ramped up his insults and attacks on Omar, a Somali-American, in recent weeks following revelations of a massive fraud scheme involving state and federal welfare assistance programs tied primarily to a group of Somali immigrants.

Trump has questioned how Omar, a U.S. citizen since 2000, accumulated her wealth. According to a financial disclosure filed with Congress, Omar's net worth skyrocketed in 2025, with the lawmaker posting between $6 million and $30 million in income through her spouse's stake in a California winery and a venture capital firm.

Gov. Walz’s office says call with Trump ‘productive'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asked President Donald Trump for “impartial investigations” into federal shootings in Minneapolis and to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota, according to a statement from the governor’s office.

“The president agreed that he would talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,” the statement said.

“The president also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals,” the statement continued.

Walz's office also said he “reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn’t a U.S. citizen.

“There is not a single documented case of the department’s releasing someone from state prison without offering to ensure a smooth transfer of custody,” the statement said.

Patel says FBI is investigating protests in Minneapolis

FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday the agency is investigating tips from conservative influencers about coordinated protests in Minneapolis that may cross into incitement of violence or threats to law enforcement.

Patel said he’ll balance the First and Second Amendment protections in his decisions, but warned that funding and instigating violence would draw his attention. “You cannot create a scenario that illegally entraps or puts law enforcement in harm’s way,” Patel said.

On Jan. 25, Patel said the FBI arrested an individual in connection with an incident in Minneapolis where an individual allegedly stole an agent’s identification and threatened the agent’s family. He pledged more arrests related to the Jan. 14 incident.

Mike Pence calls for probe of Pretti shooting, joining other Republicans

Former Vice President Mike Pence said footage of the killing of Alex Pretti was ""troubling"" and called for a ""full and transparent investigation"" into the shooting.

Pence joins a growing list of Republicans who've called for an investigation into the Border Patrol shooting, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis and Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky.

""The focus now should be to bring together law enforcement at every level to address the concerns in the community even while ensuring that dangerous illegal aliens are apprehended and no longer a threat to families in Minneapolis,"" Pence said on X.

""The American people deserve to have safe streets, our laws enforced and our constitutional rights of Freedom of Speech, peaceable assembly and the right to keep and bear Arms respected and preserved all at the same time,"" he added.

'Protesting is fine. The violence I don't like'

Outside a hotel in Minneapolis where protesters and federal agents clashed Sunday night, Geri McKerlie and her husband packed their minivan for a three-hour drive back to Wisconsin. The retired couple arrived in town Jan. 23 for a cat-showing for a competition and were woken up overnight by protesters outside.

As the couple loaded up cat carriers, they noticed a small black SUV with broken windows, covered in red spray paint. The Home2 Suites was covered in red and black spray painted epithets and demands that ICE leave. The doors were locked to non-guests and at least one uniformed security officer was visible inside the lobby the morning of Jan. 26.

“Protesting is fine. The violence I don’t like,” McKerlie said as she supervised her husband, her breath steaming in the -5 degree morning. “When it sounded like they were down here playing drums I wondered if they were out there beating on cars.”

McKerlie they were relieved to be leaving Minneapolis following the Jan. 24 shooting of protest attendee Alex Pretti. “Illegals should be removed but ICE shouldn’t be going into churches and schools,” McKerlie said, referring to immigrants in the country illegally. “And ICE is making it worse- they need better training. They think of protesters as insurgents. They come at them with that attitude.”

Noem thanks Trump for sending border czar to Minnesota

The White House’s border czar Tom Homan will be ""managing ICE Operations on the ground in Minnesota,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. Trump had announced earlier in a Truth Social post that Homan will be sent to the state and report directly to him.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked the president for dispatching Homan, writing on X: ""This is good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis.""

""I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis,"" Noem added.

Protesters, federal agents clash at Minneapolis hotel

A group of protesters and federal agents clashed at a hotel in Minneapolis where demonstrators believed immigration officers were staying. Images show windows smashed and other tagged with graffiti reading “ICE OUT.”

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety said state patrol were called to assist with property damage at a hotel in the Prospect Park neighborhood.

The agency said the “demonstration was not peaceful,” but added that as officers worked to encircle the group and begin conducting arrests “federal agents arrived without communication and deployed chemical irritants, clearing the group.”

Trump sending border czar Homan to Minnesota

Trump said in a Truth Social post on Monday morning that he was sending the White House’s border czar, Tom Homan, to Minnesota, in an apparent shake-up in leadership of the ICE operation.

Homan, he noted, has not been involved. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump said.

The shift came as a group of Republicans in Congress publicly pushed the administration to rethink its approach after top Trump officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, made a series of assertions about the shooting that contradicted bystander video.

Sen. Thom Tillis warned that a rush to judgement would be an “incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy,” while House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said if “there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives” the president should consider withdrawing immigration agents from Minneapolis.

Judge to weigh order barring feds from destroying evidence

A judge in Minnesota is set to discuss a recent order barring federal officials from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti.

The order came hours after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension sued the Department of Homeland Security, accusing federal authorities of blocking state investigators from the scene of the shooting as well as key evidence.

A White House official told POLITICO on Monday that “Homan going is not a vote of confidence for” Noem.
Noem also elevated Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to serve as the essential head of operations in Minneapolis.
In the days after that shooting, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, a Noem ally who ran South Dakota’s Republican Party when Noem was the state’s governor, left her post in January to run for Congress in Ohio.
“It would be a win for the anti-border radicals” and “embolden” efforts to resist ICE operations elsewhere, Krikorian said.","“I disagree with Secretary Noem’s premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,” Curtis wrote.

Noem is also now expected to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee after maneuvering from the panel’s chair, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).

Conservative radio host Erick Erickson, an influential voice with evangelical voters central to the MAGA base, has jabbed Noem in social media posts since Saturday’s shooting, accusing her of “driving tensions” in the name of “great coverage.”

Frustrations with Noem are palpable among immigration hawks as well. Mark Krikorian, who leads the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions on legal immigration and crackdowns on unauthorized migration, said when asked about Noem’s standing in the administration that Noem has “made herself a lightning rod” for criticism.

Publicly, the White House is standing by Noem. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Monday that she enjoys “the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States.”

But the White House’s decision Monday to dispatch border czar Tom Homan to oversee ICE operations in Minneapolis suggests that Trump wants changes from the approach Noem has championed to date.

A White House official told POLITICO on Monday that “Homan going is not a vote of confidence for” Noem.

Noem has butted heads previously with Homan on how to approach enforcement. Homan, who spent most of his career working as an immigration officer, has pushed to protect ICE as an institution and focus efforts on deporting unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Noem, meanwhile, has focused on using social media to project an image of exceedingly aggressive immigration enforcement.

Noem also elevated Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino to serve as the essential head of operations in Minneapolis. Leavitt told reporters Monday that Homan, not Bovino, would be the “main point of contact” going forward in Minneapolis. Bovino is also being moved out of Minneapolis, an administration official told POLITICO.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Noem has said little since Trump distanced himself from the shooting on Sunday night, but she praised Trump’s decision to send Homan to Minneapolis in a social media post on Monday.

A senior DHS official, granted anonymity to speak about internal thinking, insisted Noem did her best to inform the public about the shooting and swatted away suggestions that discord exists among the president’s team.

“There is only one page: the president’s page. Everyone’s on the same page,” the official said.

Some in the administration were already frustrated with Noem’s reaction to the shooting of 37-year-old Nicole Good on Jan. 7, also in Minneapolis. The DHS chief seemingly rushed to respond to that incident before all the facts were known. In the days after that shooting, ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, a Noem ally who ran South Dakota’s Republican Party when Noem was the state’s governor, left her post in January to run for Congress in Ohio.

Voters have soured on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in recent months. Republican polling firm Echelon Insights found in a survey of registered voters published Monday that more people now say ICE operations in public areas make them feel unsafe, a drop from their findings a few months ago when attitudes were more evenly split.

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats have ramped up calls for Noem to resign or face impeachment proceedings over the way ICE and Border Patrol have conducted immigration enforcement operations and for allegedly mismanaging a major infusion of federal funds into the department allocated via the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Other Republican lawmakers, while not naming Noem, have called on the agency leaders that report to her to testify. Some, such as House Homeland Security Chair Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), represent states or congressional districts where Trump only narrowly defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections.

Despite the growing pressure on Noem, Krikorian argued she’s unlikely to be ousted.

Chief US district judge Patrick Schiltz demanded ICE lead Todd Lyons explain himself personally in a three-page order issued Monday evening, declaring that “the court’s patience is at an end”.

The rebuke follows weeks of tilting anger during the so-called “Operation Metro Surge”, the Trump administration’s large-scale, aggressive and now deadly immigration enforcement campaign in Minneapolis-St Paul. The operation has generated numerous emergency lawsuits from immigrants claiming unlawful arrest or detention, with judges consistently ruling in their favor.

Schiltz, appointed by George W Bush, accused the Trump administration of deliberately delaying or ignoring judicial directives across Minnesota’s federal courts. His order came in the case of a man he had ordered released on 15 January who remained in custody as of Monday night.

The judge said the government’s non-compliance had caused “significant hardship” to immigrants, many of whom had lived and worked legally in the United States for years. He described detained individuals being sent to Texas when they should remain in Minnesota, or being released far from home without means to return.

Other Minnesota federal judges have voiced similar concerns. US district judge Michael Davis, a Clinton appointee, accused the administration of attempting to “defy court orders” and “deny noncitizens their due process rights”.

Several judges are now considering broader legal challenges that could significantly restrict federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota or halt Operation Metro Surge entirely. Another federal judge is weighing whether the deployment of 3,000 immigration agents constitutes an unconstitutional occupation, a case that’s gained momentum following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal officers last week.

US district judge Kate Menendez has ordered government lawyers to respond by Wednesday evening to claims the operation was designed to punish the state for its sanctuary policies.

Schiltz also clashed with the administration last week when federal prosecutors sought his help arresting former CNN anchor Don Lemon and others linked to an anti-ICE church protest. After he declined to overturn a magistrate’s denial of arrest warrants, the justice department appealed directly to the eighth circuit court of appeals.

The circuit court rejected the government’s request, prompting Schiltz to write letters criticising the justice department’s approach and highlighting the flood of what he termed “illegal” detention cases overwhelming Minnesota courts.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d63349b9f6a16dd8f42787f4dbb84c2287542f9c/524_0_3166_2533/master/3166.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=273158b497a3dab6988dc74709399534",N,,2026-01-27 13:59:20.344746

Educators have mobilised to support traumatised students and vulnerable families and to stop the authoritarian turn at the top of US politics.

Students detained to meet deportation quotas

In May 2025, Sara Lopez Garcia was an honour student with a near-perfect 4.0 GPA and a bright future ahead of her. “A stellar student,” says Cynthia Eaton, one of Sara’s professors at Suffolk County Community College. The day before her graduation from Suffolk, Sara and her mother were detained in an ICE raid at their home. Sara had special immigration status and was working towards obtaining her U.S. citizenship. Both she and her mother had valid Social Security numbers and valid work permits. In fact, Sara and her mother had not been targeted by ICE at all. Federal agents were looking for a previous tenant when they came across the family. After two harrowing months of isolation, uncertainty and stress in a detention centre in South Louisiana, Sara agreed to be deported to her native Colombia. The deportation went ahead in July 2025, just months before what should have been her wedding day.

Sara’s story is not an isolated incident. Immigration raids have spiked across the U.S. since the Trump administration came to power in January 2025. Despite promises that ICE would target criminals, educators have reported many instances where students with no criminal history, no arrests, no deportation orders were abducted and deported to meet the arbitrary deportation quota of 3,000 people per day imposed by the Trump administration.

Just this month, the picture of five-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos being detained by ICE agents in Minneapolis made headlines around the world. He is one of four students detained by ICE over the course of a single week in a suburb of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Despite the outcry, the majority of cases where children are arrested and deported are not covered in the media.

In Minnesota, ICE agents have been roaming neighborhoods, circling schools, and following the district’s yellow school buses, school officials said. In January, immigration agents pepper sprayed students and detained a staff member outside a Minneapolis high school during dismissal time. Immediately after this incident, the district cancelled classes which resumed a few days later with an option for virtual learning for students who are afraid to come to school.

School communities living in fear

The effect of immigration raids is felt in every corner of the classroom. Educators report plummeting attendance, emotional withdrawal, and families disappearing overnight.

The fear of ICE raids during school drop-off and pick-ups or at school bus stops is keeping many children and families away from school and inflicts immeasurable academic and emotional harm.

This crisis was directly caused by the Department of Homeland Security’s decision to rescind the “sensitive locations” memo, which once discouraged immigration raids in schools, churches, and hospitals.

Teachers report that even the students who are still attending class are displaying symptoms of traumatic stress. While some fear for themselves and their immigrant families, others are worried about their friends and the upheaval their communities are going through.

In Minneapolis where the administration has deployed over 3,000 ICE agents, the community is on edge. This month, masked, heavily armed federal agents shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, after she dropped off her 6-year-old son at school. Another person was shot in the leg and just last week Alex Pretti, a registered nurse, was shot and killed after being restrained by ICE agents. Federal agents have been filmed acting violently and with impunity towards members of the community engaged in peaceful protest.

Impartial investigations into these incidents are not forthcoming as the Trump administration has consistently spread false narratives about the murders, has refused to allow local law enforcement to investigate, and has closed ranks to protect the ICE agents involved.

According to the National Education Association (NEA), “the Trump administration is now threatening to invoke the Insurrection Act and unleash the military in Minneapolis, in an escalation of federal force against those exercising their First Amendment rights. This is straight out of the authoritarian playbook. What we are witnessing is a federal occupation of a major American city—and it is not isolated. It is a warning to the entire country.”

Educators on the frontlines to protect students and families

Teachers and education staff have been mobilising in their schools and communities to protect students and vulnerable families.

Affiliated to both the NEA and the AFT, Education Minnesota has taken collective action against ICE presence in the state, joining the January 23rd protests.

Teachers and education support personnel in Minnesota and across the country have organised to protect immigrant families. School staff provide information and support to families in private because of fears that large school events would be targeted by ICE. Educators are also distributing red cards—wallet-size cards with language to assert one’s legal rights if approached by ICE agents.

Many are taking “Know Your Rights” trainings to learn how to respond safely during encounters with ICE, with unions providing resources to support these efforts. In just two days, the St. Paul Federation of Educators in Minesota trained 400 people to serve as school patrol volunteers. The union also has coordinated workshops for immigrant parents on how to complete the legal paperwork they need to keep their children safe, in case the parents are detained or deported.

Educators also work to help students navigate the anxiety and support families too afraid to leave their homes. Many spend their evenings arranging food and supply drop off or helping families register for food banks and employment resources.

“We cannot and will not be silent. As educators, we have a moral and professional responsibility to keep all students safe, no matter where they were born or who they are, both in school and in their communities. Federal terror has no place in public education or in a democracy. This moment requires moral clarity and courage—because this is not just an immigration issue. It is a human rights issue, a civil rights issue, and a democracy issue,” said Becky Pringle, EI vice-president, President of the NEA, the largest labour union in the U.S. and an Education International affiliate.

Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), also an EI affiliate, stressed that “ICE must leave our schools and communities immediately—they are making us less, not more, safe. This is a moral moment to come together as Americans around the principle that schools and communities must be safe and welcoming places, not targets for militarized incursions designed to pit us against each other.”

Both the NEA and the AFT have called on elected officials at every level to act to protect students and keep ICE and other federal agents out of schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

“Arresting and deporting preschool children, honor students, and teaches, killing people, including US citizens, with impunity is state terror and deliberate cruelty, and we will not stand for it. Teachers and education workers in the United States are rallying for their students and their communities. They do not stand alone. The entire global education community stands with them as they rise to protect democracy, the rule of law, and basic humanity in the United States”, stated David Edwards, Education International General Secretary.",https://www.ei-ie.org/image/Ax4EYOq6m30mVTq9YLb35v9EojELQrlmUzhQtwH2.jpg/lead.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:21:51.086323

Zoom in: Trump's most significant move came Monday morning, when he dispatched White House border czar Tom Homan to the Twin Cities — and essentially cut Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem out of the shambolic Minneapolis operation.

Soon after Homan's appointment, DHS announced that the hard-charging head of the controversial immigration efforts, U.S. Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, would leave the state and return to his old job leading his sector in El Centro, Calif.

""He's a cowboy, and it was a mess. It was only escalation, and no one was going to back down,"" a source familiar with the operations said. ""Homan going is a good thing. Someone needed to step in.""

Driving the news: Trump spent Sunday lamenting his administration's botched response to Pretti's shooting, including news conferences by Bovino and Noem in which they seemed ""callous"" about the man's death, a confidant who spoke with Trump told Axios.

The White House wants to get the Minnesota immigration operation on solid footing as Senate Democrats threaten to shut down the federal government Friday because of the administration's controversial immigration enforcement efforts.

""So it's Tom Homan to the rescue,"" the confidant said.

Zoom out: A career immigration official who served under President Obama and Trump during his first term, Homan has a measure of credibility with the Democrats who run Minnesota that Noem — a committed Republican partisan — does not.

Homan plans to meet with law enforcement on the ground, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both of whom have accused immigration agents of terrorizing Minnesotans and called on the agents to leave.

Trump spoke with Walz and Frey on Monday and struck a new tone of cooperation.

A person familiar with Homan's plans said he'll help steer operational decisions and media presence.

Homan ""understands the silos that every single person has to operate in,"" a second source familiar with DHS operations said, referring to Homan's experience as a local police officer, CBP and ICE agent.

An administration official said Homan is likely to emphasize more targeted enforcement efforts with fewer confrontational tactics than Bovino, whose roving squads of masked officers were caught on video accosting residents such as two Target employees, both U.S. citizens, who were roughed up earlier this month.

The big picture: Trump wants a peace-with-honor withdrawal from Minnesota that doesn't look like his immigration surge was a loss driven by botched law enforcement efforts under Bovino, and plummeting poll numbers.

The administration wants Minnesota law enforcement to help with traffic and crowd control so that DHS can make immigration arrests without interference from the well-organized protesters in the Twin Cities.

Walz and local officials want an end to the heavy-handed federal immigration tactics that became a hallmark of Bovino's time there.

Three demonstrators have been shot by federal agents this month, including two fatally — Pretti and Renee Good.

Reality check: Trump has made friendly calls and peace offerings to Minnesota officials, but he's not going to pack up and leave the state.

""We can't lose Minneapolis because if we do, we lose Chicago and Los Angeles,"" an administration adviser said.

""We're not going to let the people who lost the presidential election over immigration dictate to us on immigration,"" the official said, referring to Democrats.

The backstory: Bovino and CBP agents have deployed to different operations across the country for months. They've been responsible for many of the aggressive arrest tactics and crowd confrontations caught in viral videos.

During Operation Midway Blitz in Chicago, Border Patrol agents drew litigation over their use of force and chemical agents such as tear gas, plus a non-fatal shooting after which the agent involved was caught bragging about the act in text messages that were revealed in court.

Border Patrol officers ""train differently .... They're being deployed to the [U.S.] interior when they're used to dealing with single adult, military age males that could be cartel members or Chinese terrorists,"" the second source said.

What we know

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to leave Minneapolis today as President Donald Trump plans to reshuffle his immigration operation amid widespread backlash to two high-profile killings of civilians.

Bovino is losing his ""commander"" title, federal officials told NBC News, and will return to the border in El Centro, California, to resume his previous job as sector chief there.

Trump sent border ""czar"" Tom Homan to Minnesota to manage ICE operations on the ground. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott will be joining Homan, sources told NBC News.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Homan met today, where they ""agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals,"" according to the governor's office. Homan and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are set to meet today.

Bovino and others within the Trump administration have been roundly criticized following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, involving ICE and Border Patrol, amid a broader immigration crackdown.

Trump administration officials and allies told NBC News the president is ""concerned"" about the sustainability of the Minneapolis operations following Pretti's shooting.

Trump said on the radio show ""Sid & Friends in the Morning"" today that his calls with Frey and Walz were ""very good"" and ""very respectful.""

Walz tells Homan to end federal 'campaign of retribution' against Minnesota

In a meeting with Trump border czar Tom Homan this morning, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called for ""impartial investigations"" into the killings of Good and Pretti, a ""swift, significant reduction"" in the number of federal forces in the state, and ""an end to the campaign of retribution"" there.

Trump on Monday sent Homan to Minnesota, where the law enforcement officer will oversee ICE operations on the ground.

Walz and Homan ""agreed on the need for an ongoing dialogue and will continue working toward those goals, which the President also agreed to yesterday,"" the second-term Democratic governor's office said in a statement.

Walz tasked the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as the ""primary liaison to Homan to ensure these goals are met,"" Walz's office said in closing.

Woman charged with assault on a federal officer after biting off the tip of an agent’s finger

A woman is facing charges after allegedly biting off the tip of a finger of a federal immigration enforcement agent in Minnesota during a protest on Saturday morning.

Claire Feng was charged with forcibly assaulting a federal officer in performance of their duties in connection with the Saturday morning incident that occurred after Pretti was fatally shot.

According to an affidavit, federal agents witnessed an interaction between protestors and other federal law enforcement at around 9:25 a.m., where a chemical agent canister was kicked towards the agents.

An arrest was made to arrest the individual who kicked the canister, and a melee ensued, the affidavit states. During the attempted arrest, a CBP agent fell to the ground and was tackled by an individual later identified as Feng, the affidavit states.

Agents from HSI tried to pull Feng off the CBP officer, and Feng ended up face down on the ground with her hands underneath her.

The affidavit states that a Customs and Border Protection Agent gained control of one of Feng’s arms, and reached under Feng’s body and across her face to grasp her other hand in an attempt to secure Feng’s second arm, according to the affidavit. “Feng then forcibly bit the right ring finger of the Victim,” a Customs and Border Protection Agent, the affidavit states.

“The victim was extremely cold, and the Victim’s vision was distorted due to wearing a gas mask. As a result, the Victim was not wore of the severity of Feng’s bit but knew he was injured,” the affidavit states. “The Victim then removed his glove and noticed the tip of his right ring finger had been bitten off by Feng from the nailed, leaving his bone exposed.”

The affidavit indicates the victim found the tip of his finger inside his glove and was able to get medical attention almost an hour after the incident occurred.

Feng was released from custody by a federal judge on her own recognizance. A preliminary hearing in the matter has yet to be set.

Rep. Ilhan Omar to hold town hall amid war of words with Trump

Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., plans to host her first in-person town hall meeting of the year tonight in North Minneapolis, where she will ""provide an update on the work being done at the local, state, and federal levels to hold ICE accountable"" for its immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.

The town hall comes a day after Trump said the Justice Department and Congress are ""looking at"" Omar, a vocal progressive critic of the president who has frequently been in his crosshairs. Trump's administration is investigating massive fraud in Minnesota, which the president has said is ""at least partially responsible for the violent, organized protests going on in the streets.""

Omar has denied any wrongdoing and accused the president of ""deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me.""

Biden says Minneapolis violence 'betrays our most basic values'

Former President Joe Biden on Tuesday condemned the killings of Renée Good and Alex Pretti, and praised Minnesotans for ""speaking out against injustice when they see it.""

""What has unfolded in Minneapolis this past month betrays our most basic values as Americans,"" Biden said in a three-paragraph post on X. ""We are not a nation that guns down our citizens in the street. We are not a nation that allows our citizens to be brutalized for exercising their constitutional rights. We are not a nation that tramples the 4th Amendment and tolerates our neighbors being terrorized.""

The former Democratic president said Minnesotans protesting the federal government's immigration crackdown have ""reminded us what it is to be American, and they have suffered enough at the hands of this Administration.""

Biden did not mention Trump by name, but he alluded to the president, saying in part: ""No single person can destroy what America stands for and believes in, not even a President, if we — all of America — stand up and speak out.""

In closing, Biden called for ""full, fair and transparent investigations"" in the fatal shootings of Good and Pretti ""as we all mourn their senseless deaths.""

Here's where senators stand on addressing the shooting

A dozen Senate Republicans have called for an investigation into Pretti's killing in Minneapolis. This includes Sens. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania, Katie Britt of Alabama, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Mike Crapo of Idaho.

Across the aisle, 11 Senate Democrats have called for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be fired, impeached or to resign. The group includes Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Jacky Rosen of Nevada, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Alex Padilla of California.

A group of Senate Democrats, too, has said they will vote against an appropriations package if it includes DHS funding. If the appropriations package does not pass by the end of the month, the government will enter a partial shutdown.

Border Patrol commander and some agents to leave Minneapolis, a source says

Amid ongoing tensions in Minneapolis, a Trump administration official tells NBC News that an unknown number of federal agents will leave the city and border czar Tom Homan will now take over operations and replace controversial Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino. The staffing change comes amid deepening fallout over the death of Alex Pretti.

The Department of Homeland Security confirms multiple body cameras worn by the agents involved captured the shooting, which investigators are now reviewing.

GOP Rep. Mike Lawler calls for Congress and Trump to 'embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy'

Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said in an op-ed for The New York Times that Congress and Trump must ""embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy that acknowledges Americans’ many legitimate concerns about how the government has conducted immigration policy.""

He urged collaboration between federal, state and local law enforcement, as well as congressional hearings with top immigration enforcement officials.

""After tensions have calmed, Congress can then piece together the rest of an immigration plan that settles the issue,"" Lawler wrote. ""Along with building on Mr. Trump’s border policies, a realistic plan would provide a path to legal status — not citizenship — for long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records.""

The Republican chairs of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have called for testimony from the leaders of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Sen. Rand Paul says officers in Pretti shooting should be put on leave

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said today the officers involved in the Pretti shooting should ""immediately"" be placed on administrative leave ""until an independent investigation is concluded.""

""For calm to be restored, an independent investigation is the least that should be done,"" Paul said in a post on X.

Paul announced yesterday he is calling the heads of three Department of Homeland Security agencies — ICE, CBP and USCIS — to testify before his Senate committee Feb. 12.

The third-term Republican has quickly become a leading GOP congressional voice calling for investigations and oversight on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota.

DHS confirms ICE will be present at Olympics

The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that ICE will be present at the Olympics.

""Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries. At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations. All security operations remain under Italian authority,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The U.S. Embassy in Rome said that ""as in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative component.""

Sen. John Fetterman calls for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to be fired

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., urged Trump in a post on X to ""immediately fire"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

""Americans have died,"" he said. ""She is betraying DHS’s core mission and trashing your border security legacy. DO NOT make the mistake President Biden made for not firing a grossly incompetent DHS Secretary.""

Fetterman had been one of the handful of Democrats who voted to confirm Noem to her Cabinet position.

Alex Pretti's sister condemns 'disgusting lies' about her brother

Micayla Pretti, the younger sister of Alex Pretti, has paid tribute to her brother and attacked the ""disgusting lies"" she said are being told to him.

""All Alex ever wanted was to help someone — anyone,"" she said in a statement reported by The Associated Press. ""Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that.""

Micayla Pretti said her brother ""touched more lives than he probably ever realized"" through his job as an ICU nurse and work with the Veterans Association.

""When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?"" she wrote. ""Hearing disgusting lies spread about my brother is absolutely gut-wrenching.""

Trump on Minnesota immigration enforcement: 'If you give us the criminals, it all goes away'

Trump said in an interview this morning on the radio show ""Sid & Friends in the Morning"" that his calls with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were ""very good"" and ""very respectful.""

Asked about the possibility of a compromise with Minnesota officials, Trump said, ""I think so.""

""What we need is their criminals,"" Trump said. ""You know, they have criminals. And all I said, 'Just give us your criminals. And if you give us the criminals, it all goes away.' They’re there to pick up murderers.""

Walz said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed yesterday that ""the Minnesota Department of Corrections honors all federal and local detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn’t a U.S. citizen.""

CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott to join Homan in Minneapolis

Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Rodney Scott will be joining border czar Tom Homan in Minneapolis, one law enforcement official and a source familiar with the decision told NBC News.

Previously, Scott had been taking a back seat in Trump’s plans for mass deportations, as Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino was commanding the agents. As we reported last night, Bovino has now been removed from that position and sent back to his job as sector chief in El Centro, California.

Minnesota federal judge orders acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to appear in court

Chief Judge Patrick Schilz has ordered acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to appear in federal court to explain why a detainee was not given a bond hearing or released from detention in Minnesota.

Schilz had ordered the Trump administration to either give the detainee, named ""Juan,"" a bond hearing or let him go following his arrest this month in Minnesota.

""The Court’s patience is at an end,” Schilz said. “The Court acknowledges that ordering the head of a federal agency to personally appear is an extraordinary step, but the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed.”

The judge said he will hold a hearing Friday at 1:00 p.m. local time in Minneapolis, where Lyons ""must appear in person to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for violating the Court’s January 14, 2026, order.""

If the parties file a notice before the hearing indicating that Juan has been released from custody, the court will cancel the hearing and will not require Lyons to appear, Schilz said.

Online fundraiser for Alex Pretti's family receives $1.5 million

More than $1.5 million has been donated to a fundraising campaign for the family of Alex Pretti, who was killed in Minneapolis on Saturday.

A GoFundMe page titled ""Alex Pretti is an American hero"" and verified by NBC News has received more than 37,000 donations.

""This fundraiser is intended to support the loved ones he leaves behind with immediate and ongoing needs. Because details are still unfolding, and to ensure the money goes to the right person, funds will not be distributed until we can verify next-of-kin and identify the appropriate family representative to manage anything raised,"" the page said.

The page added that if Pretti's next of kin can't be identified, the funds will go to the Immigrant Defense Project, ""a nonprofit that provides litigation, advocacy, and community-defense resources to help immigrants defend their rights and fight deportation.""

First lady Melania Trump calls for 'unity' in Minnesota

First lady Melania Trump has called for ""unity"" amid the ongoing protests and federal immigration operations in Minnesota, during which two people have been fatally shot.

Asked about the tensions in Minneapolis while appearing on ""Fox and Friends"" this morning, she said: ""We need to unify. I'm calling for unity. I know my husband, the president, had a great call yesterday with the governor and the mayor, and they're working together to make it peaceful and without riots. I'm against the violence.""

Melania Trump also urged protesters to ""protest in peace."" Local groups have organized peaceful protests involving thousands of people in recent weeks. Vice President JD Vance said in a speech in Minneapolis last week that the protesters there had been ""mostly peaceful.""

Investigators are reviewing body-camera videos in the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti

Investigators are reviewing body-camera videos from immigration agents in the fatal shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to NBC News.

Homeland Security investigators have videos recorded by cameras worn by multiple agents, department spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said.

The agents involved in the Pretti shooting were part of the Border Patrol Tactical Unit, a specialized force, McLaughlin said. Two law enforcement officials told NBC News that the unit has more body-worn cameras.

Pretti was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Saturday, the city’s second fatal shooting by a federal officer this month amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in Minnesota.

Trump reshuffles his Minnesota operation after backlash from second fatal shooting

The fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by Border Patrol over the weekend has Donald Trump “concerned” about the sustainability of his administration’s ongoing Minneapolis operations, according to Trump administration officials and allies.

These individuals acknowledged to NBC News that they needed a strategic shift amid a public uproar over Pretti’s killing, though the White House is still very much focused on its original agenda of cracking down on immigration and fraud.

Still, the changes made yesterday are noticeable. Saturday’s shooting has prompted a leadership shakeup, a reduction of agents in the city, a reset with key Democratic officials in the state and an attempt to distance the president from some of the more extreme comments from some of his top advisers.

“The visuals were not playing well. He understands TV. … He saw it for himself,” said a Republican lawmaker who, like others in this article, was granted anonymity to speak candidly.

And we should note we asked officials from Border Patrol, ICE and the White House to join us for an interview, but they declined our requests.

Meanwhile, the crackdown in Minnesota and the deadly shootings of two U.S. citizens are raising questions about the tactics used by federal immigration agents.

To discuss that, I'm joined by former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske. He also served as the chief of local police departments in multiple cities.

Gil, welcome back to the ""News Hour."" Thanks for being with us.

Gil Kerlikowske, Former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner: Sure.

Amna Nawaz:

So you have seen a number of videos circulating online, some even frame-by-frame analyses by different news outlets. I'm just curious, what stands out to you from what you have seen?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, the fact that they took him to the ground.

And he is resisting. But you would think that, with the number of agents that they had, they would be able to get his hands behind his back and get him secured and get him handcuffed. And it reminded you of kind of a football scrum, where they were all at different angles. So I didn't see them doing a particularly good job of securing him and getting him in custody.

Amna Nawaz:

Based on what you know about what happened before that interaction, what should have agents done in that case, in those circumstances?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, I think what they don't do and what they should be doing is that when they're confronted with somebody who is attempting to interfere or attempting to obstruct, they should tell that person we're arresting you.

This use of chemical munitions, just bringing out pepper spray, et cetera, just makes little sense. Police officers deal with these things all the time and they make a physical arrest. And that actually then deters some other people from getting involved or obstructing.

But, remember, this is a group of people, the Border Patrol in particular, who are completely untrained and unskilled for policing an urban environment.

Amna Nawaz:

I want to ask you a little bit more about that training. But can I just pick up on something you mentioned about attempting to interfere or attempting to obstruct, which is something we have heard from administration officials.

When you see the videos, is that what you see Alex Pretti doing? Many people say they see him stepping in to help a woman who was knocked down. Is that interference to you?

Gil Kerlikowske:

I see him stepping in where the agent has already knocked this woman down. And I don't condone that. I mean, that is totally wrong.

But as a person who's there to protest, observe, record, you want to not get involved. Even the guidelines the protest groups give you say you should stay five or six or seven feet away. Alex was in the heat of the moment and he didn't do that. And I wish he had.

Amna Nawaz:

You mentioned the training that these federal agents have before they go. And I want to point out a slight distinction here. When we talked about the shooting and killing of Renee Good, that was by an ICE agent. This was -- it looks like it was a Border Patrol agent in the shooting and killing of Alex Pretti.

From what you know, are they trained to work in these kinds of environments, crowd control, urban policing?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Not at all.

Commander Bovino from the Border Patrol talked about how they have offices in some different cities like Buffalo. I was the police commissioner in Buffalo for five years. I never saw a Border Patrol agent in the city. So they don't have that kind of experience and background and training to work in an environment that can actually become a bit hostile.

And city police officers know how to handle those things. It's very obvious that ICE and the Border Patrol do not.

Amna Nawaz:

The other thing we have heard from the administration officials is this idea that Alex Pretti was someone who was intent on harming federal agents. They say he approached officers with a gun, intended to massacre law enforcement.

The DHS secretary said that officers were acting defensively in their actions. I know there's a lot of video we haven't seen yet, but have you seen any evidence of those claims in the videos that are circulating now?

Gil Kerlikowske:

I did not see any of that. The only thing I did see in his hand was a cell phone.

Amna Nawaz:

So, to follow on that, we know that there's body camera footage from the federal agents that investigators are looking into, reportedly. There's also the phone that Alex Pretti himself seemed to be recording on. What do you think we can learn from those additional camera angles?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, body cameras have become very popular, and for a number of years.

And when I was at Customs and Border Protection, we experimented and the Border Patrol agents were keen to use them. The problem was, at that time, the technology did not hold up well in the environment that they worked in. But they said, look, this body camera will protect me more. It will show that what I did is lawful and restrained.

And now the administration doesn't want to use body cameras.

Amna Nawaz:

Can I ask big picture here? Because you mentioned these are not agents who are trained in the environment in which they're currently operating.

Two American citizens have now been killed by those federal agents in Minnesota. What do you think needs to happen so there's not a third citizen killed?

Gil Kerlikowske:

Well, one, the Border Patrol is clearly the wrong tool to be leading this effort, to be working in an urban environment.

And, frankly, the ICE section, the removal section, ERO, they were pretty good at being able to target people who were dangerous, target people with final orders of deportation and make those arrests. This walking through Walmart and Home Depot lot makes little sense.

And all Iran really does is, one, cause chaos, but you've also pretty much eroded the trust that law enforcement has gained in the last five years after the murder of George Floyd.

Amna Nawaz:

That is the former Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske joining us tonight.

Thank you so much for your time.

Key observations and summary Read the report in full Read the response of the national authorities in full","In a report released today, the Council of Europe's Committee for the prevention of torture (CPT) calls on the state, entity and cantonal levels authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to issue a clear statement of zero tolerance of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, provide targeted training on manual control techniques, introduce audio-visual recording of all police interviews, and better regulate the use of force and the independent assessment of the proportionality of its use.

The primary objective of the report, based on a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina in September 2024, was to examine the treatment of detainees, as well as that of sentenced and remand prisoners held in prison establishments. The situation of the residents of three social-care institutions in both entities that make up the state (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska (RS)) was also examined, along with that of foreign nationals deprived of their liberty under national immigration law.

Ill-treatment in detention documented

During the visit the committee received numerous allegations of physical ill-treatment of detainees by police officers in both entities. The alleged ill-treatment generally consisted of slaps, punches, kicks, blows with batons and from the barrel of pistols or assault rifles to various parts of the body. It was primarily inflicted by members of special intervention units of the Sarajevo and Tuzla cantonal special intervention police, the gendarmerie and the anti-terrorist unit of the Republika Srpska police (SAJ). The committee concludes that persons deprived of their liberty by these law-enforcement agencies are at risk of physical ill-treatment and of suffering serious injury.

The committee notes a downward trend in the prison population across state and entity prison systems and ongoing renovation efforts but calls for an end to the use of padded cells with straitjackets at Zenica prison and highlights sub-standard conditions in the remand section of Tuzla prison, including overcrowding, poor ventilation, inadequate hygiene and maintenance, vermin, and insufficient healthcare staffing. It also reiterates concerns about the de facto prolonged segregation of female remand prisoners due to the fragmented prison system. It recommends specific medical screening to identify risks, including mental-health needs and prior sexual or other gender-based violence.

Conditions in social care homes inadequate

The CPT found extremely poor living conditions in all three social care homes visited, with serious shortcomings in maintenance, cleanliness and hygiene. The worst conditions were in pavilions IV and V in Višegrad, where dilapidated facilities, broken furniture and appalling hygiene were observed, including residents lying in soiled bedding, lacking basic items such as pillows or bedding, and in some cases being found naked. The CPT considers that conditions in these two units may amount to inhuman and degrading treatment and calls for urgent improvements. It also demanded immediate action in a case where a female resident had been attached to a bed for several years. The committee urges reduced use of restraints and alternative measures to prevent self-harm.

Conditions for foreign nationals detained in a prefabricated container at Sarajevo airport were extremely poor, including a mother with young children held for three days without activities or outdoor exercise. The committee urged the authorities to replace it with a suitable holding facility. At Lukavica immigration detention centre, several detainees alleged severe physical ill-treatment by security staff of a foreign national with a serious mental disorder, who was found in critical condition in disciplinary solitary confinement and in urgent need of psychiatric care.

In their response, the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina focused on developments such as the training of police officers on the prevention of ill-treatment, and the creation of more effective systems for the reporting and investigation of allegations of police misconduct. The response also includes an update on the establishment of a preventive mechanism for the prevention of torture within the Ombudsman of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as its staffing and operationalisation.

That was the sign I held at the Minneapolis-St.Paul airport years ago as a refugee family emerged at baggage claim. They walked toward us tired and smiling, strangers waving American flags and holding handmade signs, welcoming them to their new home in the United States. They arrived with children in arms, several suitcases, and jackets that would soon prove no match for a Minnesota winter.

Two weeks earlier, the resettlement agency had called on short notice and asked if our group could assist with this family’s resettlement. We cleaned a rundown apartment, gathered donated furniture, found car seats and coats, bought phones, and stocked the fridge. All in the hope that when they arrived, they would feel comfortable.

That is what safety looks like in real life.

And now it is at risk.

In 1968, the United States ratified the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, committing the United States to a core legal protection known as non-refoulement. In plain terms, it prohibits returning refugees to persecution or torture. The United States later reinforced that obligation by ratifying the Convention Against Torture in 1994, which separately bars returning anyone to torture, regardless of immigration status.

That promise is not symbolic; it is codified in U.S. law. If a person has a well-founded fear of persecution or torture, the government is legally barred from returning them. The exceptions are narrow and require due process.

The treaty imposes additional obligations. People may not be punished solely for seeking safety, and detention is permitted only when necessary and subject to judicial review.

A treaty is only as strong as the system that enforces it. U.S. law and international human rights law agree on a basic point: The promise not to return someone to persecution or torture has meaning only if people are given a genuine opportunity to seek protection. That requires access to asylum screening, individualized hearings and a functional legal process.

Non-refoulement is therefore not merely a rule about outcomes. It is what’s known as a process-dependent obligation. When the immigration system is pushed so far beyond capacity that individuals cannot meaningfully present their claims for protection, the United States risks violating its legal commitments. That risk exists even without intent, and even before anyone is actually removed, when access to asylum or fair process is undermined.

Immigration enforcement is an executive function, but it is defined and limited by Congress. Congress defines the system, sets limits, and implements treaty obligations. For non-self-executing treaties like the Refugee Protocol, it is Congress, not the president that must give them legal effect. Without clear laws and oversight, treaty commitments risk being undermined by unilateral executive action.

The risk is no longer theoretical; three executive actions are now compounding decades of immigration system dysfunction and placing the United States at risk of violating its treaty obligations.

First, the federal government is rapidly expanding large-scale immigration enforcement.

In Minnesota, the Department of Homeland Security has deployed at least 3,000 federal immigration agents in what state and city officials describe in court filings as a sweeping operation. Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have sued DHS alleging constitutional violations, including excessive force, warrantless arrests, and racial profiling.

The surge has coincided with the fatal shooting of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents, an autopsy-ruled homicide of a Cuban immigrant held by ICE in Texas, and documented abuse in overcrowded detention facilities. While these incidents differ in cause and context, they illustrate systemic stresses created by this administration’s immigration enforcement approach and raise questions regarding compliance with constitutional laws.

This is not an argument against immigration enforcement, but an argument against enforcement approaches that outpace due process and strain the very systems responsible for ensuring lawful removals. When enforcement overwhelms courts, attorneys, and detention capacity, the risk of refoulement rises sharply. That procedural failure is illustrated by the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador despite a standing court order barring his removal. It is also illustrated by the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, asylum seekers with active pending cases who are protected under both international and federal law.

Second, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has begun reopening settled refugee cases at scale.

In November, USCIS announced a review of refugees admitted between 2021 and 2025. On Jan. 9, it launched an operation targeting already-vetted and resettled refugees for what it terms “intensive verification.”

The initial focus is on 5,600 people in Minnesota who remain in refugee status while awaiting green cards. Resettlement agencies report that refugee families, including children, have been detained, separated and transferred out of state without access to counsel.

At the same time, a new USCIS policy is effectively preventing refugees from adjusting to lawful permanent resident status, undermining the requirements of the 1967 Protocol.

Under federal law, refugee determinations are made on a case-by-case basis and are considered settled unless the government proves fraud, material misrepresentation or a national security risk. The government must submit evidence and follow established legal procedures. To date, the administration has not pointed to any systemic failure in the refugee screening process, demonstrated patterns of fraud or any national security lapse that would justify reopening cases at this scale.

Courts have repeatedly held under administrative law that agencies must respect reliance interests and cannot reverse settled determinations without reasoned explanation, evidence and procedural safeguards. Large-scale reopenings of settled refugee cases are therefore legally vulnerable to challenge.

Third, the administration is moving to normalize denaturalization, the stripping of American citizenship.

On June 11, 2025, the Department of Justice instructed its attorneys to “prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings,” authorizing pursuit of any case officials deem “sufficiently important” and, according to internal guidance, setting targets of up to 100-200 denaturalization cases per month, a scale without modern precedent.

Denaturalization is an extraordinary remedy. It can occur only through federal court and only after the government meets a very high evidentiary standard, a process that typically takes years. Treating it as routine fraud enforcement transforms the nature of citizenship itself.

For refugees and asylees who later naturalize, citizenship is intended to be the final safeguard against return to persecution. Once revoked, a person becomes deportable and subject to the United States’ non-refoulement obligations. Even where citizenship is revoked for fraud, that determination does not resolve the separate legal question of whether removal would expose a person to persecution or torture, which requires its own evidentiary showing and individualized assessment under U.S. law. By expanding the pool of people subject to removal without clarifying evidentiary standards or selection criteria, the administration is placing new pressure on the courts and potentially re-exposing individuals to the very harms citizenship is meant to prevent.

The constitutional concern is not the existence of denaturalization authority, but its transformation from a rare remedy into a volume-driven enforcement tool.

Taken together, these actions reflect an executive branch pushing against judicial limits and setting the stage for a surge of constitutional challenges and denaturalization proceedings in federal court. At the same time, current executive enforcement approaches are overextending a federal immigration system carrying roughly 3.4 million immigration cases, a volume that strains due process and protective treaty compliance. When courts cannot hear claims in time, or access to counsel collapses under volume, non-refoulement is at serious risk of being violated in practice even if it remains intact on paper, a risk heightened as enforcement mechanisms grow more complex and removal pathways more indirect.

Congress exists to restrain executive power. Instead, it has underfunded immigration and federal courts through appropriations and largely abandoned its oversight role, leaving the judiciary to absorb the fallout of executive action under mounting capacity constraints.

When the system falters, the consequences do not remain in Washington. Raids happen in neighborhoods. Detentions overwhelm county jails. Arrests unfold on city streets. Requiring governors, mayors, police chiefs, judges, and local leaders to manage the fallout from federal decisions they did not make and congressional inaction they did not choose.

Some of these actions have already resulted in documented violations of court orders, statutory protections, and constitutional limits. Others are placing the system under conditions where further violations are not speculative but structurally inevitable.

The question now facing the country is simple: Will executive power remain bound by the Constitution, and will the United States honor its legal commitments at home and abroad?

This question cannot be answered by the courts alone. It requires a Congress willing to reclaim its constitutional authority before executive power hardens into unchecked rule. The Constitution is not a backdrop. It’s an active constraint that requires maintenance. As James Madison warned, the accumulation of power in a single branch of government is the definition of tyranny.

For constituents, this isn’t abstract. Members of Congress decide how many immigration judges are hired; whether DHS is meaningfully overseen; and whether agencies can reopen settled refugee cases without clear statutory limits. When those guardrails fail, treaty protections fail with them. Voters should press their representatives to explain how a system Congress designed became incapable of carrying out the law Congress enacted.

That means demanding oversight hearings on Homeland Security enforcement practices, statutory limits on post-admission refugee case reopenings, clear protections against routine denaturalization, and appropriations sufficient to restore due process in the immigration system.

Minnesota once met refugees at the airport with flags and handmade signs. We met them with coats, stocked fridges, and open doors. We told them that even in the coldest winters, they would not be alone.

That is the Minnesota they came to, and the Minnesota I remember.

That same Minnesota stands in the cold today, patrolling school drop-off points to protect children, delivering food to neighbors, and standing between fear and families as federal agents sweep through residential streets.

Minnesota kept its word.

Now the federal government must honor its law.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trumpjan132026-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:22:08.636527

""I will believe this president when he calls off the mission, when he ends it, when he sends these federal troops home and out of Minnesota and stops wreaking havoc on our communities,"" Shapiro added.

Shapiro on Noem: ""Trump should fire her""

Asked whether Noem should be impeached, following growing support for the move among House Democrats, Shapiro said ""she was wholly unqualified when she got the job.""

""Trump should fire her,"" Shapiro added. ""And if Trump doesn't fire, the Congress should act.""

But Shapiro said he's most focused on ""whether or not Congress is going to stand up"" to oppose funds for immigration enforcement within the DHS funding measure, which is part of a six-bill package set to move through the Senate this week to avert a partial government shutdown at week's end.

""Congress needs to step up,"" Shapiro said. ""It's one thing for Ted Cruz and Greg Abbott and others to begin to show a little bit of spine here and standing up to the president. It's a whole other thing for them to vote to stop funding these kinds of missions. That's the most important vote this week.""

Shapiro argued that a shutdown wouldn't be necessary, citing some ""bipartisan consensus that the manner in which this deployment in Minnesota has been carried out is wrong and needs to end.""

""All the Congress needs to do is pull back on the funding and put specific language in the bill that says you can't fund an operation like what's going on in Minnesota,"" Shapiro said. ""There should be bipartisan consensus for that.""

Any changes to the legislation would require approval by the House, which is away on recess this week. Government funding expires after Friday, Jan. 30.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/27/17d6a7cf-2096-46ae-a7fa-4d3d2dbd4637/thumbnail/1200x630/6e32c791908879c8ebdcd18e6e5be32e/1769521759055.png,N,,2026-01-27 12:21:17.984721

Get the Facts: What is due process?

Due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

In the United States, due process is meant to safeguard against government overreach. The clause states that no state may deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of the law. The concept dates back to the Magna Carta of 1215, and due process remains at the core of the U.S. Constitution.

This week, the chief federal judge in Minnesota said the Trump administration failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him on Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

What is due process?

In simple terms, due process is what it means to have a fair trial. The due process clause, found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, is applied at the federal and state levels. It states that the government must follow certain procedures before depriving a person of their life, liberty or property. These procedures include, but are not limited to:

Providing reasoning for legal action, such as an arrest.

Being granted a chance to challenge any accusations made against you.

Receiving a fair and impartial jury of your peers, should you go to trial.

Under the U.S. Constitution, due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

Two types of due process

There are two types of due process. Substantive due process determines whether a law violates fundamental rights such as the right to marry or privacy. While these rights are not directly stated in the Constitution, they are so fundamental to human welfare or well-being that we follow them anyway.

Procedural due process refers to how laws are carried out in legal proceedings. This includes key protections in the 5th Amendment such as protection against double jeopardy (cannot be tried for the same crime twice), the right against self-incrimination or ""I plead the fifth"" and the right to a grand jury indictment (if you are charged with a crime, a grand jury must determine that there is enough evidence to bring you to a trial).

Civil vs. criminal legal proceedings

A civil case usually involves disputes between at least two private parties. In these cases, parties turn to civil court to resolve their disputes. An example of a civil dispute is if one party sues another for a breach of contract.

Criminal cases involve actions that harm the state or people, like murder or robbery. Unlike a civil case, where defendants pay monetary damages if convicted, the defendant faces imprisonment in criminal cases.

Under the 6th Amendment, which does not directly state due process but aids in the procedures that uphold it, individuals in criminal or civil proceedings have the right to an attorney. In criminal cases, defendants have the right to a public defender, meaning their attorney is paid for by the government. In civil cases, the government is not required to pay for an individual’s attorney.

Immigration court is classified as a civil, not criminal. So, although individuals in immigration court have a right to an attorney, the court is not obligated to provide one for them. You might hear a judge say, they have the right to counsel “at no expense to the government.""

Some organizations that assist immigrants in need of legal representation are the ACLU, Legal Services Corporation (generally limited to those with legal status), National Lawyers Guild and The Equal Justice Initiative.

Violations of due process

What happens if this constitutional right is violated? Here are some actions that would be considered a violation of your rights:

Failure to be heard in court

A biased judge

A prosecutor failing to disclose evidence that suggests a defendant may be innocent of the crime

Failure to be notified before action is taken

An unreasonable delay in legal proceedings

Coerced confessions used in court

If you believe your rights have been violated, Trujillo recommends that you act urgently.

""Speak to a lawyer. Immediately speak to a lawyer,"" he says.

Document everything pertaining to the alleged violation, report it to the Department of Justice and consider filing a lawsuit. If you cannot afford a lawyer or want to learn more about your options, go to ACLU.org, or contact your local bar association or civil rights organizations that may provide “know your rights” training.

Violations can lead to overturned convictions, dismissal of charges or reinstated benefits.

Today, a coalition of researchers and immigrants rights’ and environmental organizations published a new report detailing conditions at Glades County Detention Center (Glades) in Moore Haven, FL, and documenting ongoing, widespread environmental and human rights concerns. This report draws historic parallels between the exploitative sugarcane industry and current carceral land use and documents the jail as a site of environmental and carceral violence. The report examines the years between 2008–2022, when thousands of immigrants spent hundreds of cumulative years detained at Glades, a county jail on the western shore of Lake Okeechobee, close to the Everglades Agricultural Area.

According to the report, the Glades County Detention Center promised jobs and economic development for this rural county. But instead of bringing economic benefit to Glades County, the jail drew from public funds to siphon money to out-of-state bondholders. Rather than generating local prosperity, Glades drained and diverted public money and harmed detained people, who were systematically exposed to environmental hazards.

Through exhaustive documentation, research, and interviews, this report shows three major sources of concern of toxic exposures and human rights abuses at Glades.

Industrial Chemical Disinfectant Misuse: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, two disinfectant sprays were used at Glades: Mint and Maxim Neutral. Both contain antimicrobial quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), a highly toxic industrial pesticide. Both were administered at much higher concentrations than allowable by the manufacturer or the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Complaints and testimonies detail that people detained inside Glades experienced painful, burning, red, and swollen eyes, nose, and throat; difficulty breathing, accompanied by sneezing and coughing that sometimes produced blood; severe nausea; stomach pain; and headaches as a direct result of hazardous chemicals being sprayed on them.

Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: In 2021, a carbon monoxide buildup in the Glades County Detention Center kitchen poisoned nine people: six detained kitchen workers and three Glades staff members. The poisoning incident was so severe that four detained men (and at least one Glades Sheriff’s Office employee) were hospitalized following the exposure. Carbon monoxide poisoning is easily preventable, but the Glades detention center lacked a carbon monoxide monitor. The failure to install carbon monoxide monitors was part of a pattern of neglect that rendered the air inside the jail unbreathable.

Pepper Spray: Pepper spray was systematically deployed as a form of punishment, and in retaliation when detained people asked for basic necessities like water and toilet paper. In addition, a series of complaints and legal cases established that pepper spray was disproportionately used against Black people detained at Glades.

Even if detained only for a short time, the negative health impacts on those detained from these toxic exposures can last a lifetime.

The Glades County Detention Center exemplifies a broader trend in Florida: the repurposing of state and local infrastructure, capacities, and resources to criminalize, confine, and punish immigrants. Florida has long been a laboratory for diverting public money and political will away from community needs and towards the criminalization of immigrants. The state has redirected unprecedented public resources toward the surveillance and confinement of immigrants, embedding immigration policing into government at every scale. Beyond Florida, and across the U.S., immigration detention increasingly relies on county jails to detain people in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody.

Guadalupe de la Cruz, Editor and Program Director of AFSC Florida said:

“This report reveals a detention system that dehumanizes people and harms them in profound ways. Glades is not an anomaly; it reflects how immigrant detention inflicts deep and lasting suffering on people and communities. The Glades County Detention Center exemplifies a broader trend in Florida: the repurposing of state and local infrastructure, capacities, and resources to criminalize, confine, and punish immigrants. Florida has long been a laboratory for diverting public money and political will away from community needs and towards the criminalization of immigrants. That is why we are calling on state and local leaders to end their participation in immigrant detention and permanently close the Glades County Detention Center.”

Emma Shaw Crane, lead author and Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University, said, “This report documents widespread and systemic environmental violence at the Glades County Detention Center. Extensive testimony documents that detained people were sprayed with antimicrobial sprays at toxic concentrations, exposed to a disabling carbon monoxide leak, and pepper sprayed as punishment for asking for necessities like water and toilet paper. These hazards made the air inside the jail unbreathable and collectively punished detained people who could not breathe freely inside this facility. When Glades County built this jail, they inadvertently opened a black hole: one that disappeared detained people, who experienced profound environmental violence at Glades, and devoured and diverted public funds, which should have instead been used to support the health and wellbeing of Glades County residents.”

Nanci Palacios Godinez, Organizing and Membership Director at Detention Watch Network, said: “This timely report adds to the overwhelming evidence bank illustrating how immigration detention is inherently inhumane and abusive in Florida and beyond. In no uncertain terms, ICE has repeatedly proven that no one is safe in its custody. This report details the record of abuse at Glades, which exemplifies the realities people face in detention across the country. As the Trump administration continues to ruthlessly pursue detention expansion, including growing ICE partnerships with local sheriffs and county jails, we need real leaders who aren’t afraid to unite against Trump and advocate for the rights and dignity of everyone.”

“This is just one of several immigration detention facilities in Florida in recent years in which we’ve seen a troubling disregard for the health of people detained or the surrounding environment,” said Dominique Burkhardt, Earthjustice attorney. “The courageous effort by advocates and those detained to expose these conditions is vital in an immigration detention system that would otherwise operate as a black box.”

“Led by immigrants detained in Glades County, communities successfully organized to run ICE out of town before, and will do so again,” said Jeff Migliozzi, communications director at Freedom for Immigrants. “As this report makes clear, the Glades County Detention Center will perpetuate the ugliest chapters of U.S. history as long as it remains standing. On top of this facility’s heinous record of brutality and human rights abuses against Black and brown people, immigration detention is a bad deal for local communities. Across the country, there are hundreds of rural counties like Glades in need of healthy and sustainable investments and jobs. And as is the case in so many other places, the promised economic growth from incarceration has not materialized for local residents. The story of Glades County is a potent reminder that our struggle for clean air, good jobs, and freedom are all interconnected.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2026-01-27 12:22:18.713863

""This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,"" Schiltz wrote Monday.","A top federal judge in Minnesota ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to personally appear at a hearing in Minneapolis on Friday to explain why he should not be held in contempt of court after his agency repeatedly violated judicial orders related to immigration enforcement actions.

The three-page order issued late Monday to ICE acting Director Todd Lyons by U.S. District Court Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz was scathing, accusing federal immigration authorities of failing to comply with ""dozens of court orders"" in recent weeks, including one issued by the judge mandating a bond hearing for a detained immigrant.

""This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,"" Schiltz wrote in the order.

""This Court's patience is at an end,"" Schiltz wrote.

The judge said that the Department of Homeland Security and Lyons' agency, which is a division of DHS, ""have continually assured the Court that they recognize their obligation to comply with Court orders,"" and that they would take steps to honor those orders.

""Unfortunately, though, the violations continue,"" Schiltz wrote.

""Accordingly, the Court will order Todd Lyons, the Acting Director of ICE, to appear personally before the Court and show cause why he should not be held in contempt of Court,"" Schiltz wrote.

CNBC has requested comment from ICE on the order.

The judge called his order ""an extraordinary step.""

""But the extent of ICE's violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,"" Schiltz wrote.

The order comes as Minnesota state officials press for ICE and other federal immigration authorities to cease aggressive actions rounding up undocumented people in Minneapolis and elsewhere in the state.

Schiltz's order also came two days after federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse on a Minneapolis street, and weeks after an ICE agent shot and killed mom of three Renee Good in her car. Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens.

Those, and other incidents, have sparked widespread outrage in the state and nationally.

The judge's order does not relate to either shooting but to his previous order that DHS and ICE grant a detained immigrant a bond hearing by last Wednesday.

That man remains detained despite Schiltz's directive, according to a court filing by the man's lawyer.

""This is one of dozens of court orders with which respondents have failed to comply in recent weeks,"" Schiltz wrote Monday.

""The practical consequence of respondents' failure to comply has almost always been significant hardship to aliens (many of whom have lawfully lived and worked in the United States for years and done absolutely nothing wrong): The detention of an alien is extended, or an alien who should remain in Minnesota is flown to Texas, or an alien who has been flown to Texas is released there and told to figure out a way to get home,"" the judge wrote.

Schiltz said that if, before the hearing, the parties inform him that the detained man ""has been released from custody, the Court will cancel the hearing and will not require Lyons to appear.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108220731-1762195354742-gettyimages-2244371866-AFP_82W4627.jpeg?v=1769528507&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-27 14:59:45.716577

Sources at the US embassy in Rome confirmed a statement from ICE, the agency embroiled in a brutal immigration crackdown in the US, saying that federal agents would support diplomatic security details during the Milan-Cortina games but would not run any enforcement operations.

The statement said: “At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations.

“All security operations remain under Italian authority.”

Speculation in Italy over ICE’s involvement in the Games, which begin on 6 February, had been brewing for days and mounted further on Monday after the president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, said on Monday that the US vice-president, JD Vance, and secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would be protected by ICE “bodyguards” at the Olympics.

The speculation fuelled outrage in Italy over ICE’s immigration operations, especially after the fatal shootings this month of the US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

The daily newspaper La Repubblica claimed Italy’s far-right government, which has nurtured friendly relations with Donald Trump’s administration, had briefly looked into blocking the participation of ICE agents in the delegation, but that would have required a departure from how US officials are usually protected during similar high-profile visits abroad.

Milan’s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, told RTL radio that the agents would not be welcome in the city “because they don’t guarantee they’re aligned with our democratic security management methods”.

“This is a militia that kills,” he said. “It’s clear that they are not welcome in Milan, there’s no doubt about it. Can’t we just say no to Trump for once?

“We can take care of their security ourselves. We don’t need ICE.”

Alessandro Zan, a member of the European parliament for the centre-left Democratic party, said the presence of ICE agents would be unacceptable.

“In Italy, we don’t want those who trample on human rights and act outside of any democratic control,” he wrote on X.

Two small opposition parties – the Green and Left Alliance (AVS) and Azione – have started petitions calling on the Italian government and the Olympic organising committee to prevent the ICE agents’ entry and involvement in the security operations.

“ICE is the militia that shoots people on the streets of Minneapolis and takes children away from their families,” AVS said.

Speaking on the sidelines of a Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony in Rome, Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, sought to play down concerns.

“It’s not like the SS are coming,” he said, referring to the Nazi paramilitary organisation. “Let’s be clear. They’re not coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets.

The decree, expected to come into effect in April, will apply to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and people in Spain with irregular status.
Saiz said the programme, which is being brought in by royal decree meaning it does not require parliamentary approval, would benefit Spain as a whole.
“The key is in managing it well.” The announcement was welcomed by the Brussels-based Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (Picum).
“For thousands of undocumented people who have built their lives in Spain, this could mean dignity, stability and access to basic rights.","Spain’s socialist-led coalition government has approved a decree it said would regularise 500,000 undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, rejecting the anti-migration policies and rhetoric prevalent across much of Europe.

The decree, expected to come into effect in April, will apply to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and people in Spain with irregular status. To qualify for regularisation, applicants will have to prove they do not have a criminal record and had lived in Spain for at least five months – or had sought international protection – before 31 December 2025.

Announcing the decision after Tuesday’s weekly cabinet meeting, Elma Saiz, Spain’s minister for inclusion, social security and migration, said it was a “historic day”, adding the initiative was designed to “break the bureaucratic barriers of the past”.

Saiz said the programme, which is being brought in by royal decree meaning it does not require parliamentary approval, would benefit Spain as a whole. “We’re reinforcing a migratory model based on human rights, on integration and on coexistence that’s compatible with both economic growth and social cohesion,” she said.

The decree followed pressure from the socialists’ former allies in the leftwing Podemos party, which has a fraught relationship with the government.

“We reached a deal with the [socialist party] for the extraordinary regularisation of undocumented people,” Podemos’s leader, Ione Belarra, wrote on social media on Tuesday morning. “No one else has to work without rights … Today and always, yes we can!”

In recent years, Spain has become a European outlier on migration. Addressing parliament in October 2024, the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country was at a demographic crossroads and needed migration to grow its economy and sustain its welfare state.

“Throughout history, migration has been one of the great drivers of the development of nations while hatred and xenophobia have been – and continue to be – the greatest destroyer of nations,” he said. “The key is in managing it well.”

The announcement was welcomed by the Brussels-based Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (Picum).

“Today’s decision by the Spanish government to adopt a broad regularisation measure is a powerful reminder that regularisation is not only possible – it works, and it’s the right thing to do,” said Laetitia Van der Vennet, a senior advocacy officer at Picum.

“For thousands of undocumented people who have built their lives in Spain, this could mean dignity, stability and access to basic rights. At a time when a hostile environment against migrants is spreading on both sides of the Atlantic, this move shows both humanity and common sense. We hope more governments will follow this example and invest in policies that protect, empower and include people, and make societies stronger.”

The decision also drew approval from Spain’s Regularisation Now! movement, which added it had come “in an international context marked by the tightening of immigration policies, border closures, and the criminalisation of migrants in much of Europe”.

However, the move has been bitterly criticised by the conservative People’s party (PP) – even though the party ordered similar initiatives when in government – and by the far-right Vox party.

The PP’s leader, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, accused the prime minister of using the announcement to deflect attention from the government’s response to last week’s deadly rail crash, in which at least 45 people died. “Sánchez’s first response is a massive regularisation to distract attention, to increase the pull effect and to overwhelm our public services,” he said. “In socialist Spain, illegality is rewarded.”

Vox, which is rising in the polls and outflanking the PP on the right with an explicitly anti-migrant discourse, went further by using familiar tropes about the great replacement theory and urging the mass deportation of migrants, euphemistically referred to by the far right as “remigration”.

“Five hundred thousand illegals!” said its leader, Santiago Abascal. “Sánchez the tyrant hates the Spanish people. He wants to replace them – that’s why he’s using a decree to promote the pull effect and to accelerate the invasion. He must be stopped. Repatriations, deportations and remigration.”

Regularisation programmes have long been used across the EU, with 43 put in place by more than a dozen countries between 1996 and 2008. In Spain, nine such programmes have been carried out since the country’s return to democracy, with the PP conducting more regularisation programmes than any other party.

The roots of the current push lie in a citizens’ initiative, signed by more than 700,000 people and backed by about 900 social organisations, presented to parliament in 2024.

Unemployment levels have fallen to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis, and Spain’s economy is outperforming those of its neighbours.

Sánchez hailed the unemployment news in a post on X on Tuesday, saying: “For the first time since 2008, unemployment falls below 10%. Spain has almost 22.5 million people with jobs, a new record.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c8b789e0fd10c68ebc61454599ae37b8afc0e6/0_0_3445_2756/master/3445.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=42a7d39b8a328ccf291efd7e6cf5176b",N,,2026-01-27 12:22:21.626863

Lawyers for Minnesota and the governments of the Twin Cities argued that the surge is violating the 10th Amendment, which protects states from encroachment by the federal government.
“They’re trying to hijack the state’s legislative process,” Brian Carter, a lawyer with the Minnesota Attorney General’s office, said of the Trump administration.
She also challenged the state’s lawyers about when a federal law enforcement operation would become so large or oppressive that it would amount to a 10th Amendment violation.","Menendez declined to rule on the matter immediately and seemed to agonize over how to draw a line between legitimate federal law enforcement and an unconstitutional incursion on Minnesota’s sovereignty. Complicating the matter were signals of deescalation by Trump, who spoke Monday with Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and suggested they were on the same “wavelength” about the way forward.

“Not all crises have a fix from a district court injunction,” the Biden-appointed judge said. “It must be that work is being done elsewhere … not just counting on a single district court issuing a single injunction.”

But the judge faced demands from Minnesota’s leaders to act quickly, in light of the killing Friday of VA nurse Alex Pretti by a federal agent, amid an escalating federal presence.

“We ask the court to issue a [restraining order] today,” said Lindsey Middlecamp, a lawyer for the state. “Not tomorrow. Not next week, but today.”

During the nearly three-hour hearing in Minneapolis federal court, the judge repeatedly focused on Trump’s vow on social media earlier this month to bring “a day of reckoning and retribution” to Minnesota, and on a Saturday letter from Bondi to Walz that appeared to set conditions for the administration to wind down the surge. Lawyers for the state described Bondi’s missive as a “shakedown” and a “ransom note.”

While one of Bondi’s demands involved access to immigrants being released from state jails and prisons, two others seemed to link the surge to issues not related directly to immigration enforcement such as fraud in the SNAP program, better known as food stamps, and a dispute over the Trump administration’s demand for access to Minnesota’s voter rolls.

Lawyers for Minnesota and the governments of the Twin Cities argued that the surge is violating the 10th Amendment, which protects states from encroachment by the federal government. The provision has been held both to prevent the federal government from “commandeering” local officials and from using coercion to force a state to comply with federal demands.

“They’re trying to hijack the state’s legislative process,” Brian Carter, a lawyer with the Minnesota Attorney General’s office, said of the Trump administration. “They’re trying to get us to turn over voter rolls. What does that have to do [with immigration?] The federal government is attempting to bend the state’s will to its own and that is not allowed under the Constitution.”

Lawyers for the state also complained that the surge seemed intended to sideline the courts by forcing the state to knuckle under on matters that are currently being litigated.

“This administration … is not content with the rule of law,” Carter said. “They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. Instead, they put violence into the streets of Minnesota to get what they want. That has to violate the 10th amendment.”

Menendez seemed to accept some aspects of the state’s case, but expressed concerns about how to fashion an order that would end the surge without tying the federal government’s hands to carry out more traditional immigration enforcement. She also challenged the state’s lawyers about when a federal law enforcement operation would become so large or oppressive that it would amount to a 10th Amendment violation.

Justice Department attorney Brantley Mayers said the surge wasn’t a form of retaliation but instead a response to lawlessness engendered by the state and local policies.

“The state cannot use the 10th Amendment as a shield and say, ‘We’re not going to help you,’ and then when we come to enforce federal immigration law, then turn around and say, ‘The 10th Amendment would actually prevent you from [doing that.]’ That would turn federalism on its head,” Mayers said. “We are here because of this law enforcement vacuum.”

Menendez pressed Mayers for a tally of the number of federal officers involved in the surge, which has been estimated at 3,000 to 4,000 people. The attorney said he didn’t have a current number but would provide one to the court.

Acting in a separate lawsuit earlier this month brought by anti-immigration-enforcement protesters and observers, Menendez issued an order barring Homeland Security agents from using chemical irritants against peaceful protesters. Her order was quickly paused by a federal appeals court.

Menendez made no promise Monday about when she would rule on the state’s request for a broader restraining order ending the surge, but made clear the case is now her highest priority.

“If I had a burner in front of the front burner, this would be on it,” the judge said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Faa%2F93%2Fe42b21844da18f186370f2482362%2Fimmigration-enforcement-minnesota-51157.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:03:07.384163

“I’m so confused, why on earth would ICE agents come to Italy?","Outrage is growing in Italy over the deployment of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to assist US security operations at the Winter Olympics next month.

Current and former lawmakers have urged Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to intervene to block the agents’ presence in the wake of two fatal shootings during an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed the reports in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.

ICE will serve “a security role” at the Olympics, a DHS spokesperson said. “They don’t do immigration enforcement (operations) in a foreign country obviously,” the spokesperson said.

The agency is “supporting” the US diplomatic security service at the Games, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin added later Tuesday, saying that, “All security operations remain under Italian authority.”

“At the Olympics, ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,” McLaughlin told CNN in a statement.

Federal agencies have supported security for US diplomats in previous Olympics, including Homeland Security Investigations, which is a part of ICE, a State Department spokesperson told CNN on background. The State Department also specified that its Diplomatic Security Service is leading security effort in Milan.

Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi met with US Ambassador Tilman Fertitta on Tuesday, according to the Interior Ministry, which confirmed that ICE’s investigative arm, not the operational arm, will be present at the Milan-Cortina Olympics. “The agency will work exclusively within their diplomatic missions and not on the ground,” the ministry said in a social media post.

“It is important to reiterate that Homeland Security Investigation investigators will not be represented by operational personnel like those engaged in immigration controls in the US, but by representatives exclusively specialized in investigations,” the ministry added.

Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, sought to placate his colleagues’ concerns over the use of ICE by the US diplomatic security detail, following increasingly aggressive tactics by the agency in the US.

“Let’s be clear: it’s not like they’re coming to maintain public order in the middle of the streets. They’re coming to collaborate in the operations rooms,” Tajani told Italian radio station RAI on Tuesday.

“It’s not like they’re the ones on the streets of Minneapolis,” the foreign minister said. “It’s not like the SS are coming.

“The problem isn’t that those with machine guns are coming with their faces covered. They’re coming from a specific unit. They’re coming because it’s the unit responsible for counterterrorism,” Tajani added.

‘A militia that kills’

The former Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged the country’s government to “set our own limits” and “make clear decisions.”

“After street violence and murders in the US, we now learn from their spokesperson that ICE agents will come to Italy to ensure security at the Milan-Cortina Olympics,” Conte posted on X on Tuesday, referring to reports quoting ICE in Italian media.

“We cannot allow this,” he added. “Our government tried to downplay the situation, but these latest statements speak clearly of ICE’s determination to come and ensure ‘security’ in Italy as well. Enough with the bowing,” Conte added.

That same day, the Mayor of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, declared that authorities “don’t need ICE” to implement security at the Olympics, telling local radio, “They’re not welcome in Milan.”

“This is a militia that kills,” Sala told Italian radio station RTL 102.5 on Tuesday. “Could we ever say ‘No’ to Trump? This isn’t about severing relations or creating a diplomatic incident, but could we say ‘No?’”

“I believe they shouldn’t come to Italy because they don’t guarantee they’re aligned with our democratic security management methods,” added Sala.

Another Italian lawmaker warned ICE agents “must not set foot in Italy.” “It is a violent, unprepared, and out-of-control militia,” Carlo Calenda, a veteran politician, told RTL 102.5 on Tuesday.

Over the weekend, Italian media reports of ICE’s deployment to the northern city of Milan drew criticism and prompted petitions, amid increased scrutiny over the jurisdiction and force leveraged by immigration officers in the US.

In recent weeks, ICE federal law enforcement agents killed two US citizens in the city of Minneapolis – against the backdrop of intensified protests demanding a halt to sweeping immigration raids by the White House.

Several Americans living in Milan reacted to the move by US authorities with incredulity, expressing concern over their country’s reputation on the world stage under US President Donald Trump’s domestic and foreign policy agenda. They spoke to CNN under the condition of anonymity, for fear of retaliation.

“I’m so confused, why on earth would ICE agents come to Italy? They don’t have jurisdiction here,” one person said on Tuesday.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256091466.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-27 13:59:16.911892

Get the Facts: What is due process?

Due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

In the United States, due process is meant to safeguard against government overreach. The clause states that no state may deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of the law. The concept dates back to the Magna Carta of 1215, and due process remains at the core of the U.S. Constitution.

This week, the chief federal judge in Minnesota said the Trump administration failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear before him on Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.

In an order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

What is due process?

In simple terms, due process is what it means to have a fair trial. The due process clause, found in the 5th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, is applied at the federal and state levels. It states that the government must follow certain procedures before depriving a person of their life, liberty or property. These procedures include, but are not limited to:

Providing reasoning for legal action, such as an arrest.

Being granted a chance to challenge any accusations made against you.

Receiving a fair and impartial jury of your peers, should you go to trial.

Under the U.S. Constitution, due process applies to everyone in the United States, regardless of background or immigration status.

Two types of due process

There are two types of due process. Substantive due process determines whether a law violates fundamental rights such as the right to marry or privacy. While these rights are not directly stated in the Constitution, they are so fundamental to human welfare or well-being that we follow them anyway.

Procedural due process refers to how laws are carried out in legal proceedings. This includes key protections in the 5th Amendment such as protection against double jeopardy (cannot be tried for the same crime twice), the right against self-incrimination or ""I plead the fifth"" and the right to a grand jury indictment (if you are charged with a crime, a grand jury must determine that there is enough evidence to bring you to a trial).

Civil vs. criminal legal proceedings

A civil case usually involves disputes between at least two private parties. In these cases, parties turn to civil court to resolve their disputes. An example of a civil dispute is if one party sues another for a breach of contract.

Criminal cases involve actions that harm the state or people, like murder or robbery. Unlike a civil case, where defendants pay monetary damages if convicted, the defendant faces imprisonment in criminal cases.

Under the 6th Amendment, which does not directly state due process but aids in the procedures that uphold it, individuals in criminal or civil proceedings have the right to an attorney. In criminal cases, defendants have the right to a public defender, meaning their attorney is paid for by the government. In civil cases, the government is not required to pay for an individual’s attorney.

Immigration court is classified as a civil, not criminal. So, although individuals in immigration court have a right to an attorney, the court is not obligated to provide one for them. You might hear a judge say, they have the right to counsel “at no expense to the government.""

Some organizations that assist immigrants in need of legal representation are the ACLU, Legal Services Corporation (generally limited to those with legal status), National Lawyers Guild and The Equal Justice Initiative.

Violations of due process

What happens if this constitutional right is violated? Here are some actions that would be considered a violation of your rights:

Failure to be heard in court

A biased judge

A prosecutor failing to disclose evidence that suggests a defendant may be innocent of the crime

Failure to be notified before action is taken

An unreasonable delay in legal proceedings

Coerced confessions used in court

If you believe your rights have been violated, Trujillo recommends that you act urgently.

""Speak to a lawyer. Immediately speak to a lawyer,"" he says.

Document everything pertaining to the alleged violation, report it to the Department of Justice and consider filing a lawsuit. If you cannot afford a lawyer or want to learn more about your options, go to ACLU.org, or contact your local bar association or civil rights organizations that may provide “know your rights” training.

Violations can lead to overturned convictions, dismissal of charges or reinstated benefits.

Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.","A growing number of Republicans are questioning or criticizing the Trump administration's response to the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.

The criticism has extended beyond the handful of Republicans who are known for periodically differing from President Trump. Some Trump allies are also among those questioning immigration agents' tactics or the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting. At minimum, they are calling for an investigation into Pretti's shooting.

GOP lawmakers accuse Trump administration of rushing to judgment

Some Republicans have chafed at the fact that top Trump administration officials almost immediately argued the shooting was justified and accused Pretti of threatening federal agents.

Hours after the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleged Pretti ""approached"" Border Patrol agents with a gun and ""violently resisted"" after officers tried to disarm him. But videos show Pretti was holding up a cellphone, not his gun, when he was approached by agents. Pretti was being held on the ground when an officer appeared to remove a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a ""would-be assassin"" and a ""domestic terrorist,"" without offering any evidence, and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino accused Pretti of trying to ""massacre law enforcement."" Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry. He had no criminal record.

GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on his podcast that the Trump administration could improve ""the tone with which they're describing this.""

""Escalating the rhetoric doesn't help, and it actually loses credibility,"" the senator said on Monday's episode of ""Verdict with Ted Cruz."" ""And so I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy and to say, we don't want anyone, anyone's lives, to be lost, and the politicians who are pouring gasoline on this fire, they need to stop.""

Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah specifically criticized Noem.

""I disagree with Secretary Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,"" Curtis wrote on X, calling for a ""transparent, independent investigation"" and for ""those responsible"" to be ""held accountable.""

GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said administration officials rushing to judgment and trying to ""shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.""

Focus on Pretti's gun frustrates some Republicans

A few Trump administration officials have highlighted the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a handgun before he was shot — drawing pushback from gun rights groups and their traditional GOP allies in Congress.

Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, argued on X that law enforcement is often ""legally justified"" in shooting someone who approaches with a gun. And FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that ""no one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines.""

Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested the FBI was ""adopting every leftist gun-banner talking point"" and said Essayli may not be fit for the job.

""Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,"" Massie said.

Essayli's comments were also criticized by the National Rifle Association, which called them ""dangerous and wrong.""

Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he also supports ""a full and impartial investigation"" into Pretti's death, and pointed specifically to gun rights.

""His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,"" he said.

Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana wrote, seemingly in response to the shooting: ""Your Second Amendment rights don't disappear when you exercise your other rights. The Constitution is crystal clear: 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.'""

Shooting described as ""shocking"" and ""disturbing""

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska called Pretti's killing ""shocking"" and said it should ""raise serious questions"" about ""the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.""

Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge this year, wrote on X: ""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska called the shooting a ""horrifying situation.""

""My support for funding ICE remains the same. Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security. But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble,"" said Ricketts. ""I expect a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident.""

And GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said he's ""troubled by the events that have unfolded.""

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called Pretti's death a ""real tragedy"" in an interview on CNN. He argued most Americans want Mr. Trump to address immigration, but urged the administration to define its ""endgame,"" which he said can't be to ""deport every single non-U.S. citizen.""

""I think the death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,"" he said. ""Americans don't like what they're seeing right now.""

When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked on a talk radio show about ICE's rocky approval ratings, the Trump-allied governor said the White House should ""recalibrate"" and ""maybe work from a different direction.""

He said immigration agencies should ""go about their job in a more structured way to make sure that they are going to remove these people without causing all the kinds of problems and fighting in communities that they are experiencing right now.""

Chris Madel, a Republican who was running for Minnesota governor, ended his bid on Monday. He cited the administration's immigration crackdown in the state as an ""unmitigated disaster.""

""United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That's unconstitutional and it's wrong,"" he said.

In his announcement, Madel noted he has provided legal advice to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.

GOP Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania called for a ""full investigation"" and said that ""we must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust.""

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she's ""appalled at the violence in Minneapolis"" before turning her attention to an impending fight over a bill to fund DHS for the rest of the fiscal year. She noted that the bill includes funding for body-warn cameras, law enforcement de-escalation training and more oversight for detention facilities — provisions she said ""would make such incidents less likely to occur.""

In the wake of Pretti's death, a growing list of Senate Democrats have said they won't vote for the DHS funding bill unless changes are made, posing a problem for lawmakers' plan to bundle it with five other funding bills that have already passed the House. If the Senate doesn't pass that package of bills by the end of the day Friday, a partial government shutdown will begin.

Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation

Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.

Patel has said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch will lead a federal probe into the shooting. Current and former agency officials told CBS News that approach is unusual since it tasks ICE with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.

Meanwhile, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have requested that the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services appear before the panels in the coming weeks.

The letters, sent by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Andrew Gabarino of New York, did not mention the killings of Pretti and Good, but would provide a chance for lawmakers to question officials about the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.

""As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,"" Paul said in the letters, which were dated Monday. ""Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people.""

Noem, meanwhile, is expected to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 3, according to a spokesperson for GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the panel.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/06/17/fb9e9eee-b946-42da-aa14-9e970c085d4d/thumbnail/1200x630/48457b0e3b447b3d3463465b403dd15a/ap25167801559617.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:58:52.689009

Paul KirbyEurope digital editor

The US immigration agency whose officers have been involved in two fatal shootings in Minneapolis has said it is sending agents to help support American security operations during the Winter Olympics, which start in Italy on 6 February.

Confirmation of the agency's role came from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), after reports prompted alarm and anger in Italy.

""This is a militia that kills... of course they're not welcome in Milan,"" the city's mayor, Beppe Sala, told Italian radio on Tuesday.

An ICE spokesperson stressed that ""all security operations remain under Italian authority"".

US embassy sources in Rome had already explained to Italian media that various federal agencies had worked at previous Games in the past, although it was not clear if the customs and enforcement agency had itself taken part.

The agency's statement on Tuesday explained that ""ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations"".

It would ""obviously"" not conduct immigration enforcement operations outside the US, it said.

Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Pantedosi had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: ""I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.""

But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets.

In the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot on the streets of Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.

The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.

The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide ""yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump"".

The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that ""ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory"".

The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.

The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed.

The Department of Homeland Security and ICE did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

Other judges in Minnesota have been raising alarms for weeks. U.S. District Judge Michael Davis, a Bill Clinton appointee, similarly accused the administration of “an undeniable move … to defy court orders or at least to stretch the legal process to the breaking point in an attempt to deny noncitizens their due process rights.”

Several of Schiltz’s colleagues are weighing broader lawsuits that would sharply curtail federal immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota or end Operation Metro Surge altogether. Those lawsuits gained new urgency last week after the shooting death of Alex Pretti by federal officers.

Schiltz tangled with the Trump administration last week as well, after federal prosecutors pressed him to help facilitate the arrest of former CNN anchor Don Lemon and others linked to an anti-ICE protest in a church earlier this month.

Minnesota also went to court to preserve evidence from the Saturday shooting of Alex Pretti after its own investigators were blocked from the scene by federal authorities.

Experts say the line being drawn between Minnesota and the U.S. government goes against years of cooperation between local and federal agencies on law enforcement missions.

But they also said the state’s hand has been forced by an administration that has acted against decades of practice — from declining to allow state officials access to evidence gathered by federal authorities to barring its own Civil Rights division from probing the shootings of Pretti and Renee Good, who was shot to death by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7.

Former federal prosecutors under Republican and Democratic presidential administrations said the divide was deeply troubling, though a call Monday between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and President Donald Trump may signal a way forward after both expressed that progress was made.

An unusual website launch

The Minnesota Department of Corrections launched a website its leaders said was dedicated to combatting Department of Homeland Security misinformation after Pretti was killed. The site includes examples where Minnesota officials honored federal requests to hold people under deportation orders to refute the Trump administration claim that those people are routinely allowed to go free.

Department officials also published videos showing peaceful transfers of custody from prison to federal authorities of several individuals the Trump administration had claimed were arrested by immigration agents as part of the ongoing immigration enforcement action.

The department also issued a news release trying to dispel federal claims about the criminal records of people sought by federal agents, including the person at the center of an operation Saturday near where Pretti was shot. The release said the department never had custody of the man and could only find decade-old misdemeanor traffic-related violations. U.S. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino had said at a news conference Saturday that the man had a significant criminal history.

Jimmy Gurulé, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said he saw turf battles and other disagreements when he was a federal prosecutor working with local authorities on task forces in Los Angeles, and again when he was an undersecretary at the U.S. Treasury Department overseeing law enforcement operations under George W. Bush. But, he said, the situation in Minnesota is “unprecedented” in his experience.

“The disagreements were always handled behind the scenes. There were never any public statements criticizing other agencies,” Gurulé said.

“It’s not even a question of collaboration at this point. It’s such a broken relationship,” he said. “How did it get to this point, where state and local law enforcement have such little trust in the federal agencies they feel they need to go to court?”

Seeking relief in court

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office filed a lawsuit in federal court after the shooting Saturday seeking to preserve evidence collected by federal officials from the Pretti shooting. A federal judge granted a motion blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence.”

Federal officials called the lawsuit and claims the federal government would destroy evidence “ridiculous.”

But state officials are not alone in having concern over a departure from decades of standard practice, which has been the Department of Justice and its Civil Rights Division investigating the constitutionality of an officer’s use of force, especially when fatal. DHS officials have instead said their own department would investigate the two Minneapolis shootings.

“What you would expect in normal times is the Justice Department would open an investigation into the circumstances of the shooting,” said Chris Mattei, a former federal prosecutor in Connecticut under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “They have been the independent body that would investigate it. But it would seem that this Justice Department and this Civil Rights division have zero interest in enforcing constitutional rights for citizens in the immigration context.”

Mattei, now a partner at the Koskoff Koskoff & Bieder law firm that represents several former FBI employees in lawsuits over their terminations, said under Trump it appears the justice department doesn’t want to change the wide latitude agents have been given to conduct immigration enforcement.

“These are career investigators,” he said. “They may have different opinions on how to pursue an investigation or how certain evidence should be handled. But usually in my experience they have the same objective to conduct a credible investigation.”

Gurulé called the state lawsuit, specifically the motion over preserving evidence, “shocking.”

“The implication was they are not just keeping evidence from them but possibly destroying it,” he said. “Clearly the state attorney general and the Minneapolis police have grave distrust with ICE and DHS. Clearly there are strong disagreements with the tactics that ICE has used.”

Signs reconciliation might be possible

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt Monday moved to distance President Trump from statements made by deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller characterizing Pretti as an assassin, saying the situation had moved quickly since Saturday and noting Trump had never used those words.

Gurulé said statements like that erode the public’s confidence that investigations are impartial.

“You don’t express your conclusion before an investigation and make it public. That is unheard of and upside down,” he said.

In his call with Trump, Walz’s office said the governor made the case for an impartial investigation of the shootings and that Trump had agreed to talk to DHS about ensuring state investigators would be able to conduct an independent investigation.

Trump and Walz also discussed working in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement. The governor’s office reiterated the state would continue honoring requests to hold incarcerated individuals who are not U.S. citizens until federal authorities can take them into custody.

No matter where you stand on immigration enforcement, the shootings show that what the country has been doing is not working.

The loudest voices on each extreme have retreated to their usual corners. They have an interest in keeping our immigration problems unsolved and politically divisive. Everyone else must see that Congress and the president need to embrace a new comprehensive national immigration policy that acknowledges Americans’ many legitimate concerns about how the government has conducted immigration policy.

That starts with reviewing how we got here. During President Joe Biden’s term, lenient border policies and foolish state and local laws offering shelter and benefits to illegal immigrants resulted in millions of migrants entering the United States, overwhelming our cities, our legal and public education systems, and our social safety net.

Americans demanded action, electing Donald Trump in 2024. Now, just months from the November midterm elections, polls suggest that Americans are increasingly concerned about the Department of Homeland Security’s enforcement operations, including in Minneapolis. Americans do not want chaos. They want a common-sense bipartisan solution.

During the Biden and Trump administrations I have helped write bills with anyone from any party who would collaborate with me on finding that solution. A workable plan requires a secure border. Thankfully, the Trump administration has effectively stopped illegal border crossings and deported, by its own count, over 675,000 illegal immigrants. Any balanced immigration policy would preserve and expand on this progress — but humanely.

Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are conducting forceful operations in American communities. They should reassess their current tactics.

Irresponsible politicians have increased the danger by delegitimizing ICE — with some calling to abolish it — and standing behind sanctuary city policies that restrict necessary cooperation between immigration enforcement officers and state and local police. Local police departments are better suited to interact with the public. Collaboration among federal, state and local law enforcement officials might have prevented some of the chaos in Minneapolis.

Collaboration should start now. The F.B.I. and state and local departments should together investigate the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. A transparent and accountable process that protects the rights of everyone involved, including the deceased and their families, would ensure all relevant evidence is collected and bolster the public’s confidence in immigration enforcement and our justice system.

Congressional scrutiny would help, too. Lawmakers should immediately convene hearings with the leadership of Homeland Security, ICE, the Border Patrol and Citizenship and Immigration Services — not to provide a platform for partisan grandstanding, but to promote an honest national conversation about immigration enforcement.

After tensions have calmed, Congress can then piece together the rest of an immigration plan that settles the issue. Along with building on Mr. Trump’s border policies, a realistic plan would provide a path to legal status — not citizenship — for long-term illegal immigrants without criminal records. This path would be rigorous and fair, and it would aim to keep families together. Fair means those who benefit would face mandatory work requirements, forgo public assistance and pay fines and any back taxes they might owe.

Congress would have to change the legal immigration system, too. Lawmakers should create a system in which applicants’ merit matters more than it does now, better accounting for the country’s economic needs. I am the husband of a naturalized citizen. My wife came to the United States in pursuit of a better life. I will always fight to provide opportunity to others who have the potential and desire to contribute to America’s success.

We must be a nation of laws but also one that offers dignity and compassion to those seeking to pursue their American dream. The events of the past several years show that there will be no Democratic or Republican solution on immigration, only an American one.

After 40 years of failure — and, now, two more deaths that did not need to occur — my colleagues and I should feel only more profoundly the responsibility to rebuild trust and act in America’s common interest.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/27/multimedia/27lawler-gvbq/27lawler-gvbq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 12:21:25.444647

At least six immigrants have died in the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency already in 2026, and a seventh person was fatally shot by an off-duty ICE officer.

Last year, 32 deaths were reported in ICE custody.

While most of the deaths were due to health complications, some of the late detainees’ families have made accusations of abuse and medical neglect against ICE.

Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, was killed by immigration officers on Saturday morning in Minneapolis. Good was shot on January 7, also in Minneapolis, after she tried to drive away from federal agents who surrounded her car.

Here are the stories of the others whose death is linked to immigration law enforcement:

Keith Porter

On New Year’s Eve, an off-duty ICE agent shot Porter, 43, to death in Los Angeles.

The exact circumstances of the shooting remain contested, and there are no known videos of the incident.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) described Porter – who was Black – as an “active shooter”, but his family insists that he was merely firing his gun to welcome the new year, which is an illegal but widely observed US tradition.

“No parent should ever have to bury their child, and the pain of this loss is something I would not wish on anyone,” Porter’s mother, Franceola Armstrong, said in a statement on an online fundraiser.

“My son leaves behind two beautiful daughters, ages 10 and 20. They were his heart. Everything he did, every plan he made, was for them.”

No charges have been filed in the case.

DHS has pushed to justify the shooting, accusing Porter of shooting at the officer.

The department said the agent went outside his apartment complex to investigate the sound of gunshots, and when he encountered Porter, he ordered him to drop his weapon.

“When the subject refused to comply, the officer fired defensively with his service weapon at the subject to disarm him. The subject fired at least three rounds at the officer,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

The ICE agent was not harmed in the incident.

Porter’s family lawyer has raised questions over the DHS account, calling for evidence that the slain father of two fired at the officer.

Jamal Tooson, the lawyer, also criticised the ICE agent for confronting Porter with his weapon instead of involving the local police, who are well-trained and familiar with the community.

“Had he just stayed in his apartment for five minutes, Keith would be with us,” Tooson said in a news conference.

Geraldo Lunas Campos

Earlier this month, ICE announced that Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, died on January 3 at the agency’s largest detention facility – Camp East Montana in Texas.

Since then, contradicting details have emerged about his death, which a medical examiner has ruled as a homicide – meaning caused by another person.

ICE initially said Lunas Campos “became disruptive while in line for medication and refused to return to his assigned dorm” and was placed in segregation.

He then became distressed, according to the agency.

“Medical staff responded, initiated lifesaving measures, and requested emergency medical services. Lunas was pronounced deceased by EMS,” ICE said in a January 9 statement.

The agency repeatedly highlighted Lunas Campos’s criminal record.

The authorities later changed their own story, claiming that Lunas Campos tried to kill himself.

“Campos violently resisted the security staff and continued to attempt to take his life,” DHS’s McLaughlin said. “During the ensuing struggle, Campos stopped breathing and lost consciousness.”

But an autopsy report found that Linas Campos was killed by someone.

“Based on the investigative and examination findings, it is my opinion that the cause of death is asphyxia due to neck and torso compression,” Adam Gonzalez, deputy medical examiner for El Paso County, said in the report, according to The Washington Post.

“The manner of death is homicide.”

Lunas Campos’ three children have filed a legal petition aiming to block the deportation of any detainees who may have witnessed the incident, as they prepare to file a wrongful death lawsuit.

“According to an eyewitness to Mr Lunas Campos’s death, guards at the facility choked him to death,” the petition said.

Victor Manuel Diaz

Immigration authorities arrested Nicaraguan immigrant Victor Manuel Diaz on January 6 in Minneapolis as part of their immigration crackdown in Minnesota. Eight days later, he died in ICE custody at Camp East Montana in Texas.

“Contract security staff found Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room,” ICE said in a statement. “He died of a presumed suicide; however, the official cause of his death remains under investigation.”

But Diaz’s family is questioning the government’s story.

“I don’t believe he took his life,” Diaz’s brother Yorlan told ABC News. “He was not a criminal; he was looking for a better life and he wanted to help our mother.”

The family has also raised concerns over how the authorities are handling the investigation.

According to several US media reports, Diaz’s body was transferred to William Beaumont Army Medical Center for an autopsy, instead of the county medical examiner.

“This, taking of the body and doing the autopsy report and not letting the medical examiner do it? You’re then having the fox guarding the henhouse,” Randall Kallinen, the family’s lawyer, told the local outlet KTSM.

“It was with the federal government where the individual was staying and where he was killed. And now it’s the federal government who is controlling the investigation and the information included in the autopsy report.”

Parady La

Cambodian immigrant Parady La, 46, had been in the US since 1981. He had come to the US legally as a child but lost his Green Card due to criminal convictions.

Immigration authorities arrested him on January 6 and sent him to the Federal Detention Center (FDC) in Philadelphia, where he started experiencing “severe drug withdrawal” symptoms, according to ICE.

“The next day, La was found unresponsive in his cell. FDC officers immediately administered CPR and several doses of NARCAN and called for medical assistance,” the US agency said.

NARCAN is a drug used for people experiencing a drug overdose, not withdrawals.

La was transferred to a hospital and diagnosed with “anoxic brain injury, post-cardiac arrest, shock and multiple organ failures” before he died, ICE said.

But La’s family is voicing scepticism about the level of care he received.

His nephew, Michael La, said ICE’s version of the events leading to his uncle’s death “didn’t add up”.

“As we keep fighting for information, we’re finding out that there’s like levels of information that just become locked, you know?” Michael La told local public radio WHYY. “We’re still fighting for answers and still trying to figure out what’s going on.”

Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz

A father of three, Luis Beltran Yanez-Cruz, 68, had been in the US for more than 20 years when ICE picked him up in New Jersey in November and transferred him to a detention centre in California.

He died on January 6 of “heart-related health issues” after being transferred to a hospital.

But his family has said that he was feeling ill for weeks and was only given pain medication.

“As a father, he was an excellent dad,” his daughter, Josselyn Yanez, told the news website northjersey.com. “As a grandfather, the best grandfather of all. We hoped our father would get out of that place, that he would come out alive – not the way he did.”

Heber Sanchez Dominguez

Seven days after ICE picked up Heber Sanchez Dominguez, the 34-year-old Mexican national was found dead in his cell at the Robert A Deyton (RAD) Detention Facility in Georgia on January 14.

“RAD medical staff discovered Sanchaz (sic) hanging by the neck and unresponsive in his sleeping quarters at approximately 2:05 am,” ICE said in a statement.

The lack of details has prompted calls for investigation, including from Mexican officials.

Sanchez Dominguez was arrested in Georgia for driving without a licence before being transferred to ICE custody.

“In coordination with the relevant US authorities, the Consulate General has requested that the circumstances of the incident be clarified and is cooperating in the necessary steps to ensure that the investigation is carried out promptly and transparently,” Mexico’s consulate in Atlanta said after Sanchez Dominguez’s death.

The Clayton County Democratic Committee in Georgia also called on state officials to push for an investigation.

“We further demand the immediate release of all records and documentation related to Mr. Sanchez Dominguez’s detention, medical treatment, and the events leading up to his death. Transparency is not optional, it is a moral and legal obligation,” the group said in a statement.

Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres

ICE has said that Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, a 42-year-old immigrant from Honduras, died on January 5 at a hospital in Houston, Texas, after being admitted for “chronic heart-related health issues”.

Nunez did not have a criminal record, but he had entered the country irregularly. ICE nabbed him during an immigration enforcement operation in November 2025 and transferred him to the Joe Corley Processing Center in Texas.

“ICE is committed to ensuring that all those in custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments,” the agency said in a statement, after Nunez’s death.

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-01-27T014324Z_1431659653_RC249JAB28MK_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-1769510651.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-27 13:03:22.465593

Last Saturday in Minneapolis, a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, during an altercation between federal immigration officials and protestors.

In a statement immediately following the shooting, the Department of Homeland Security said Pretti was shot after he “approached” Border Patrol officers with a handgun. Bystander videos of the shooting show Pretti holding a phone in his hand, but none appear to show him holding a gun. Videos show federal law enforcement personnel shouting, “he’s got a gun,” and removing a handgun from Pretti’s waistband moments before the fatal shooting. He was licensed to carry a concealed weapon.

According to the Associated Press, Pretti is the sixth person to die during the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement campaign in the U.S.

VA Secretary Doug Collins confirmed on Sunday that Pretti was a nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center.

“As President Trump has said, nobody wants to see chaos and death in American cities, and we send our condolences to the Pretti family. Such tragedies are unfortunately happening in Minnesota because of state and local officials’ refusal to cooperate with the federal government to enforce the law and deport dangerous illegal criminals,” Collins wrote.

VA employees expressed outrage over Pretti’s death. Coworkers remembered him as someone who cared deeply for his patients.

An internal document obtained by Federal News Network shows that Pretti recently received a “VA gratitude” email message from his supervisors.

“Thanks for staying on your day off and helping out taking care of the veterans,” the email to Pretti states. “You are an invaluable member of the team!”

“Alex Pretti was a great nurse and researcher,” a VA employee told Federal News Network on Saturday.

Doug Massey, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 17, which represents VA Central Office employees, said members are “generally upset and very concerned following” the shooting. Massey said it was a “senseless” shooting, and that Pretti was trying to assist a protester on the ground moments before the shooting.

“I know a lot of nurses, and they tend to be that type where they like to help people. He saw the woman getting pushed down,” Massey said.

Daniel Amyx, a rehab and extended care nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, said he spoke with some of Pretti’s ICU coworkers following the shooting, and that they described him as “very kind and gentle,” and a “great guy to work with.”

“Alex was a dedicated nurse. He was science-minded, evidenced by the fact that he moved from research into becoming a nurse, and I heard that he very much cared for his patients,” Amyx said in a virtual meeting hosted by the Federal Unionists Network on Sunday. Amyx said the Minneapolis VAMC is planning a memorial service for Pretti.

Sharda Fornnarino, a VA registered nurse in Colorado and secretary of the VA division for National Nurses United, called Pretti’s death a “blatant attack on federal workers.”

“VA workers, we’re shocked, stunned and now we’re getting angry,” Fornnarino said.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the shooting a “tragedy,” during a briefing with reporters on Monday, but said it “occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.”

“This incident remains under investigation and nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives in American streets,” Leavitt said.

Matthew Silverman, national president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, said in a statement that “respect for lawful authority and adherence to the rule of law are essential to preventing further tragedies.”

“In an era of rising threats against law enforcement, it is critical that officers are supported, not second-guessed in real time, as they carry out their duties under extraordinary pressure,” Silverman said.

Before the shooting, a comprehensive spending deal for the rest of fiscal 2026 was slated for a full Senate vote. But following Pretti’s death, Senate Democrats are calling on the Senate to pull DHS funding from the six-bill package.

This package currently includes the full-year funding bills for DHS and the departments of Defense, Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services, State, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, as well as several other agencies. The House of Representatives approved these six bills last week.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), ranking member of the Senate Appropriation Committee’s subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, called on the Senate to pull the DHS funding bill from the final package of spending bills for the rest of fiscal 2026.

Van Hollen told Federal Drive with Terry Gerton that this would allow lawmakers to “dive in and make necessary changes to the Department of Homeland Security budget.”

“There’s no reason that Republicans should hold all of those bills hostage as we work to rein in and dramatically reform the parts of DHS that need to be dramatically reined in. That will be the question — whether or not Republicans in the Senate are willing to do that,” Van Hollen said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Monday that Senate Democrats plan to advance five of the spending bills, separately from the DHS funding bill, before the Jan. 30 deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown.

“The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans,” Schumer said in a statement.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Susan Collins (R-Maine) urged her colleagues on Monday to vote for the full six-bill package that includes DHS funding, to “show that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to finish the job.”

“It is so important that we do so, because looming is a government shutdown — another harmful, unnecessary and disastrous government shutdown if we do not complete our work,” Collins said on the Senate floor.

Collins said more than 80% of the DHS spending bill covers non-immigration and non-border security functions — such as cybersecurity and funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration.

Last week, almost all House Democrats voted against the Homeland Security bill, as the package was sent the Senate.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The shooting deaths of two American citizens during the Trump administration's deportation operations in Minneapolis have upended the politics of immigration in Congress, plunging the country toward another government shutdown.

Democrats have awakened to what they see as a moral moment for the country, refusing funds for the Department of Homeland Security's military-style immigration enforcement operations unless there are new restraints. Two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, have broken from retirement to speak out.

At the same time, Republicans who have championed President Donald Trump's tough approach to immigration are signaling second thoughts. A growing number of Republicans want a full investigation into the shooting death of Alex Pretti and congressional hearings about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.

“Americans are horrified & don’t want their tax dollars funding this brutality,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., wrote on social media. “Not another dime to this lawless operation.”

The result is a rapidly changing political environment as the nation considers the reach of the Trump administration's well-funded immigration enforcement machinery and Congress spirals toward a partial federal shutdown if no resolution is reached by midnight Friday.

“The tragic death of Alex Pretti has refocused attention on the Homeland Security bill, and I recognize and share the concerns,"" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the GOP chair of the Appropriations Committee, in brief remarks Monday.

Still, she urged colleagues to stick to the funding deal and avoid a “detrimental shutdown.”

Searching for a way out of a crisis

As Congress seeks to defuse a crisis, the next steps are uncertain.

The White House has indicated its own shifting strategy, sending Trump's border czar Tom Homan to Minneapolis to take over for hard-charging Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, which many Republicans see as a potential turning point to calm operations.

“This is a positive development — one that I hope leads to turning down the temperature and restoring order in Minnesota,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune posted about Homan.

Behind the scenes, the White House is reaching out to congressional leaders, and even individual Democratic senators, in search of a way out of another government shutdown.

At stake is a six-bill government funding package, not just for Homeland Security but for Defense, Health and other departments, making up more than 70% of federal operations.

Even though Homeland Security has billions from Trump's big tax break bill, Democrats are coalescing around changes to ICE operations. ""We can still have some legitimate restriction on how these people are conducting themselves,” said Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.

But it appears doubtful the Trump administration would readily agree to Democrats' demands to rein in immigration operations. Proposals for unmasking federal agents or limiting their reach into schools, hospitals or churches would be difficult to quickly approve in Congress.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that while conversations are underway, Trump wants to see the bipartisan spending package approved to avoid the possibility of a government shutdown.

“We absolutely do not want to see that funding lapse,” Leavitt said.

Politics reflect changing attitudes on Trump's immigration agenda

The political climate is a turnaround from just a year ago, when Congress easily passed the Laken Riley Act, the first bill Trump signed into law in his second term.

At the time, dozens of Democrats joined the GOP majority in passing the bill named after a Georgia nursing student who was killed by a Venezuelan man who had entered the country illegally.

Many Democrats had worried about the Biden administration's record of having allowed untold immigrants into the country. The party was increasingly seen as soft on crime following the “defund the police” protests and the aftermath of the death of George Floyd at the the hands of law enforcement.

But the Trump administrations tactics changed all that.

Just 38% of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling immigration, down from 49% in March, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in January, shortly after the death of Renee Good, who was shot and killed by a ICE officer in Minnesota.

Last week, almost all House Democrats voted against the Homeland Security bill, as the package was sent the Senate.

Then there was the shooting death of Pretti over the weekend in Minneapolis.

Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York, who was among the seven Democrats who had voted to approve the Homeland Security funds, reversed course Monday in a Facebook post.

“I hear the anger from my constituents, and I take responsibility for that,” Suozzi wrote.

He said he “failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis.”

Voting ahead as shutdown risk grows

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday the responsibility for averting another shutdown falls to Republicans, who have majority control, to break apart the six-bill package, removing the homeland funds while allowing the others to go forward.

“We can pass them right away,” Schumer said.

But the White House panned that approach and House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has blamed Democrats for last year's shutdown, the longest in history, has been mum. The GOP speaker would need to recall lawmakers to Washington to vote.

Republicans believe they will be able to portray Democrats as radical if the government shuts down over Homeland Security funds, and certain centrist Democrats have warned the party against strong anti-ICE language.

A memo from centrist Democratic group Third Way had earlier warned lawmakers against proposals to ""abolish” ICE as “emotionally satisfying, politically lethal.” In a new memo Monday it proposed “Overhauling ICE” with top-to-bottom changes, including removing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem from her job.

GOP faces a divide on deportations

But Republicans also risk being sideways with public opinion over Trump's immigration and deportation agenda.

Republicans prefer to keep the focus on Trump's ability to secure the U.S.-Mexico border, with illegal crossings at all-time lows, instead of the military-style deportation agenda. They are particularly sensitive to concerns from gun owners' groups that Pretti, who was apparently licensed to carry a firearm, is being criticized for having a gun with him before he was killed.

GOP Sen. Rand Paul, the chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Oversight Committee, demanded that acting ICE director Todd Lyons appear for a hearing — joining a similar demand from House Republicans over the weekend.

At the same time, many GOP lawmakers continue to embrace the Trump administration's deportation strategy.

“I want to be very clear,” said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., in a post. “I will not support any efforts to strip DHS of its funding.”",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c6bab0e/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fdf%2F7f90ed7ff9d2bc29894b82a3e6f3da%2F108f8bd226364d31b5f981965d0f1c44Winter_Weather_Washington_29779.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:03:11.768072

The shooting and killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis this weekend may have a big effect on Congress. Funding for several federal agencies expires midnight Friday. Senate Democrats have now mobilized to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security in response to Pretti's death. And if lawmakers are unable to break the impasse, that could lead to a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. Joining us now to discuss all of this is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Hey, Claudia.

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Scott.

DETROW: So the Senate was on track to pass this final round of funding bills, with bipartisan support. How has the death of Alex Pretti changed that?

GRISALES: Right. And to recap, the House passed this $1.3 trillion spending package to fund big areas of the federal government past Friday night, and it would include funding for the departments of Defense and Health and Human Services and others, and it did draw bipartisan votes. But Senate Democrats, on their end, had signaled this would be easily passed in their chamber this week. However, with the death of Pretti, we saw a 180. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer says Democrats will block this entire funding package unless the DHS funding is split off from it. And Schumer said that the legislation, as written, is, quote, ""woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,"" end quote.

DETROW: Now, let's turn our head back to the last shutdown. There was that split among Democrats about holding out for health care subsidies. Are you seeing similar tension, similar splits in the caucus when it comes to what to do with Homeland Security funding?

GRISALES: No, this is very different, even as Republicans push back on Democrats' plans to block this entire funding package if DHS is not pulled out of it. One aide told me that when we saw the killing of Renee Good earlier this month, that some said this was a one-off. But they argue that with the death of Alex Pretti, this is now part of a disturbing and alarming trend. And for Democrats, the intensity of the resolve is higher this time. And the Democrats we saw defect last time to end the government shutdown, such as Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, have already said they're nos this time. And so far, we've just seen one Democrat say he'll vote for the package. That's John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. He says he doesn't vote for shutdowns. So he may be on an island for his party this time around.

DETROW: What are Republicans saying?

GRISALES: Well, most Republicans are standing by the administration's policy in general, but we're seeing more and more call for answers. That includes Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick, who said he agreed with a statement issued by the NRA that there needs to be a full investigation. The NRA had taken issue with comments from Trump officials saying that Pretti was armed, so his killing may have been justified. We also know that the chair of House Homeland Security, New York's Andrew Garbarino, is also calling for an oversight hearing with DHS officials. We know DHS Secretary Kristi Noem will go before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, but that is not soon enough for many.

As for leadership, we're hearing Senate Majority Leader John Thune applaud Trump's decision to send Tom Homan to Minneapolis. He is hoping that will cool down temperatures there. And a spokesman for Thune said Monday, Republicans do not plan to separate the DHS funding bill out. So at this rate, we could be headed for a partial shutdown come this weekend.

DETROW: That is NPR congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales. Claudia, thanks so much.

Menendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, is also weighing a request by Minnesota state officials for an order pausing the deployment of thousands of immigration enforcement officers in the state.

Menendez told lawyers at a hearing Monday that she was wrestling with the broad scope of the state’s request to pause Operation Metro Surge and order officers off the street while the legal fight continues. US officials have “a lot of power” to carry out immigration laws, she noted.

But the judge also questioned the Justice Department’s assertion that the goal of the surge isn’t to force Minnesota to change its policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, highlighting a disconnect between US officials’ public statements and the government’s arguments in court.

The poll, conducted between Friday and Sunday, comes amid an outcry over a US border agent’s fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, over the weekend.

Pretti was the second person to be killed by a federal agent in the city in less than a month, following the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, on January 7 by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent.

Facing growing backlash, Trump said on Monday that he would send his border tsar, Tom Homan, to Minneapolis and struck a positive tone on his administration’s relations with Minnesota’s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, following what he described as “a very good” telephone conversation between the two men.

In the new poll, 58 percent of respondents said US Immigration and Customs agents had gone “too far” in their crackdown on unauthorised migration, compared with 26 percent who said their actions were “about right” and 12 percent who said they did not go far enough.

The polling mirrors the findings of several opinion surveys carried out before Pretti’s killing.

In a poll conducted by The New York Times/Siena University and released on Friday, 61 percent of respondents said ICE’s tactics had gone too far, compared with 26 percent who said they were “about right” and 11 percent who believed they did not go far enough.

In a written statement Monday, a spokesperson characterized those arrested as ""illegal aliens.""

But in many cases, immigration lawyers, employers and family members of those detained say many are pursuing lawful immigration pathways such as asylum, and have legal documents to work in the U.S.

The DHS statement highlighted four people it says have criminal records — the same four people it highlighted in a press release last Wednesday announcing the operation.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills continued to criticize the ongoing surge of immigration enforcement in the state.

The governor said ICE's tactics are unnecessarily confrontational with observers and that it's detaining people who are lawfully present in the U.S.

Speaking on Maine Calling Monday, Mills said ICE is pursuing detention quotas instead of targeting illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.

She said businesses are calling her office because their workers are getting detained and that they are asylum seekers and others authorized to work and live in Maine.

""I'm getting calls from employers. They're saying, 'my people are getting ... kidnapped and taken out of their homes and their cars and they're just gone,"" she said.

Mills, a Democrat, has also been critical of Republican Sen. Susan Collins, whom she hopes to challenge in this year's midterm election.

Mills said Collins isn't using her position on the Senate budget committee to hold ICE accountable.

Collins was not available for an interview. In response to questions about ICE's conduct in Maine and Minnesota, her spokesperson said the senator has asked the Department of Homeland Security to explain how it's targeting detainees and why ICE is allowing agents to enter homes without judicial warrants.

""Senator Collins has contacted the Department of Homeland Security about the ICE activities occurring in Maine, including with respect to the specific detentions as reported in the Maine press,"" the spokesperson said. ""She has asked for answers about the legal bases for these actions and about how ICE is prioritizing its activities to target what it calls 'the worst of the worst.'""

She requested additional court filings from Trump administration lawyers by Wednesday.","MINNEAPOLIS — After ""very good"" phone calls with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday, President Trump announced that border czar Tom Homan will be heading to the midwestern state to lead federal immigration enforcement efforts there.

The surge of agents to Minneapolis has resulted in waves of protest, legal action, and political backlash against the Trump administration, especially after the shooting deaths of two American citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, at the hands of federal immigration agents.

In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters on Monday, Gov. Walz described a ""more collaborative tone"" from Trump, and said the president agreed to consider reducing the number of federal immigration agents in the Twin Cities. He further confirmed that Gregory Bovino, the bombastic and controversial Border Patrol chief leading the surge, will soon leave the state.

Bovino's exit may help to turn down the temperature of protests in Minneapolis, which have been peaceful but fraught in the days since Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot by CBP officers. Bovino repeatedly defended the actions of his officers, saying without evidence that Pretti intended to ""massacre"" federal agents, and that he ""assaulted"" them.

The video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far contradict that assertion. The Trump administration has not provided evidence to support Bovino's claims.

State officials say they were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's killing on Saturday, and have sued over access to DHS-controlled evidence, which includes body camera footage from the officers involved.

The state is also trying to end the surge through legal avenues. On Monday, state officials sought an immediate restraining order to end what the Trump administration has dubbed ""Operation Metro Surge"" and return the number of federal immigration enforcement officers in Minneapolis to pre-surge levels.

""They tell us, and this is their words, this is the single largest deployment of immigration officers in one place at one time,"" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison told reporters outside federal court in Minneapolis on Monday. ""What justifies this disproportionate flood? Nothing legitimate.""

The state's legal team pointed to a social media post from President Trump in which he promised a day of ""RECKONING & RETRIBUTION"" for Minnesota, and to a letter sent to the state over the weekend by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, which they characterized as a ""ransom note"" offering to end the DHS surge in exchange for voter registration records and the end of the state's sanctuary policies.

Representatives for the Trump administration told the judge that the letter simply acknowledges the fact that, without sanctuary policies, the federal government would not have to send as many officers into the state.

The U.S. District Court judge overseeing the case, Katherine Menendez, declined to grant a restraining order in the state's case.

Over the weekend, Bovino had scrapped with lawmakers and others online, responding to their posts on X about the shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti.
Bovino is expected to depart Minneapolis tomorrow, and President Donald Trump said he is sending border czar Tom Homan to lead the operation there.","Approximately 26 people were arrested Monday night during a protest outside a suburban Twin Cities hotel, police told CNN.

Video from the Associated Press showed dozens of protesters gathered at the SpringHill Suites in Maple Grove, where they believed top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino was staying. The protesters used pots, pans and kitchen utensils to make noise outside the building.

“The situation escalated when individuals in the crowd engaged in unlawful behavior,” the Maple Grove Police Department said in a statement on Facebook. “Property damage occurred and objects were thrown at officers.”

Police issued a dispersal order and “those who failed to comply with lawful orders or committed crimes were arrested,” the statement said.

By 10 p.m., the crowd had dispersed, the police statement read.

Police told CNN they were still processing the arrests and the final number may change.

CNN has reached out to CBP an DHS for more information. The hotel declined to comment.

Micayla Pretti, Alex Pretti’s younger sister, remembered her brother in a statement Monday as a “kind, generous” person who “had a way of lighting up every room he walked into,” and calling him her hero.

“All Alex ever wanted was to help someone––anyone. Even in his very last moments on this earth, he was simply trying to do just that,” she went on to say, apparently referencing videos showing the ICU nurse putting himself between immigration officers and a woman they’d just shoved before they spray him with a chemical irritant and, moments later, shoot him.

“When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?” Micayla Pretti said.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he felt “a definite change of tone” during his phone conversation with President Donald Trump Monday, telling MPR News, “I’m going to take them for their word right now.”

During the conversation, Walz said he asked Trump to allow the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to conduct an independent investigation into the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti – both US citizens shot by federal officers during the sweeping immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities. “He said he would look into it,” Walz said of Trump’s response.

The president also agreed to consider reducing the number of immigration enforcement agents in the state, Walz told MPR.

The governor said he plans to speak with Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, and strike a collaborative plan. Homan is expected take over immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino leaves the state.

“We’ve laid out the case that we do the right thing. We don’t want criminals here, but we also recognize that someone coming here to find a better life should be treated with dignity, that Americans shouldn’t be fearing for their lives to go out of their house just because of the color of their skin,” Walz said.

“I think Donald Trump understands it, too,” he added.

FBI Director Kash Patel said Monday his agency is looking into Signal group chats allegedly used by Minneapolis residents to share sightings of federal agents, warning that people cannot “create a scenario that illegally entraps and puts law enforcement in harm’s way.”

Patel told conservative influencer Benny Johnson in a podcast interview the FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken in Signal group chats.

Patel did not elaborate on specific instances where Signal groups allegedly led to a crime being committed. CNN has reached out to the FBI for more information.

Signal is a messaging app known for its robust security features, such as end-to-end encryption, meaning data is scrambled in transit and can only be seen by the sender and recipient.

As the Trump administration deploys thousands of federal officers to carry out turbocharged immigration operations across the country – with the Minneapolis area now the epicenter – growing networks of volunteers who call themselves ICE observers appear to be intensifying their efforts, CNN previously reported.

Volunteers document arrests, some tail ICE agents in vehicles, while others blow whistles warning community members of ICE enforcement.

The Justice Department has formally withdrawn its request for the chief judge in Minnesota’s federal court to issue arrest warrants for journalist Don Lemon and four others for their alleged involvement in an anti-ICE protest that disrupted a church service in Minnesota.

Their request was made after a lower court judge refused to approve criminal complaints against several people the department claims were part of the protest. A person familiar with the matter said that Lemon is one the individuals whose arrest warrants were declined.

Despite their withdrawal, the DOJ can still attempt to bring charges against Lemon, including through a grand jury indictment. Officials have not publicly said what their plans are moving forward.

Lemon has said that he was present at the demonstration as a journalist and not as a protester. In a video of the episode that he posted on YouTube, Lemon says “I’m just here photographing, I’m not part of the group … I’m a journalist.”

Three other people have been charged in connection to the protest.

The Department of Homeland Security on Monday said approximately 3,000 officers and agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection are currently conducting immigration operations in the Minneapolis area.

The agency’s response, noted in a court filing, comes after a federal judge earlier Monday requested details of the current scale of “Operation Metro Surge.”

During the earlier hearing, the Justice Department said a total of 4,000 federal agents had been surged statewide, with roughly 2,000 coming from ICE and 2,000 from CBP.

Some agents are expected to leave Minneapolis Tuesday, along with top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, sources say.

Patient of Alex Pretti describes moment she found out he was shot and killed

06:05

Alex Pretti was inspired to start protesting against ICE in Minneapolis after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, according to Marta Crownhart, a Navy veteran who was treated by Pretti earlier this month.

Crownhart said she’d discussed Good’s killing with Pretti while she was his patient at the Minneapolis VA hospital.

“He just knew that she was a good person, from what he had heard, and that she was killed for no good reason,” she said in an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.

Pretti “felt so strongly about how Renee Good had died,” Crownhart said, and had described “the difference that he wanted to make in the world and in Minneapolis.”

Crownhart remembered him as a “very caring, kind-hearted” person who treated each patient like they were his only responsibility.

“He was never preoccupied,” she said. “He never was thinking about anybody else. He was always there for you.”

Returning to the Minneapolis VA, where she volunteers, it was “very difficult to look at the doors and know that he’s not there.”

But what hurt the most, according to Crownhart, was hearing DHS Secretary Kristi Noem call Pretti a “domestic terrorist” shortly after he was killed.

“I can’t imagine his parents listening to that or hearing what she had said about him,” she said, tearing up. “I think that hurt worse than anything.”

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he’s happy with the news that top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will be leaving Minneapolis, but he still maintains “zero trust” that the Department of Homeland Security will “do the right thing” in the investigation into Alex Pretti’s death.

“There’s no way I can trust anything that they say or do, including preserve evidence,” Ellison told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “Why would they preserve evidence of a crime … in a case where they’re denying that there was any crime committed by these officers at all? I just don’t believe it.”

Ellison’s comments follow a federal judge’s Saturday ruling in Minnesota granting a temporary restraining order that blocks federal agencies from destroying or altering evidence related to the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Pretti.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office requested the order after suing the Trump administration earlier Saturday.

“I don’t trust them at all, and I hope the court rules in our favor to protect this evidence,” Ellison said.

A Monday afternoon hearing ended without a decision from the judge on whether to keep the TRO in place, though he said he would rule “forthwith.”

CORRECTION: A previous version of this post misstated the day the judge granted the temporary restraining order. It was Saturday.

Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, one of the Democrats who said she will block a government spending bill following the killing of Alex Pretti by a federal agent, cast doubt on the ability of the Department of Homeland Security to fairly investigate the death of the 37-year-old ICU nurse and pushed for more cooperation between state and local officials.

Pointing to how Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was prevented from accessing the scene of Pretti’s shooting to collect evidence in its own investigation, Smith said it was unusual because state and federal investigators typically collaborate “to gather the evidence and understand what’s happening” in probing officer-involved shootings.

“And it’s one of the reasons why people in Minnesota and I think around the country are just saying, this looks like a cover up. How could you have any credibility when you have the department investigating itself?” she told CNN’s Anderson Cooper.

Smith’s comments come hours after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said today that President Donald Trump had agreed to allow the state’s investigation to continue. The BCA was granted an order from a federal judge over the weekend prohibiting DHS from destroying or altering any evidence gathered around the shooting.

Dr. Aasma Shaukat, a co-worker and mentor of Alex Pretti at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, said the 37-year-old ICU nurse was full of empathy and compassion and easily connected with the veteran patients he cared for at work.

“He really connected with patients, particularly veterans, that he thought were a vulnerable group, and he truly believed he was helping them. Not everybody can do that as easily as Alex,” Shaukat told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

Shaukat, who worked alongside Pretti for six years, said she wasn’t surprised to learn that he was engaged in peaceful protests in the community.

“He was all about being a good citizen, standing up for your neighbors, your community, and standing up for what he believed was unjust or unfair,” she said. “That would be very much Alex.”

After news broke that top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will be leaving Minneapolis, the city’s police chief told CNN some of Bovino’s actions have “not been helpful.”

“He was riding around in the city with a caravan and stopping at places and kind of just shaking things up — that’s not been helpful,” Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara said.

The chief said he hopes Bovino’s departure signals deescalation of the tense situation in Minneapolis.

“Nobody in law enforcement is saying federal law enforcement should not be enforcing federal law. That’s ridiculous, right?” he said. “But I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think that federal law enforcement should operate by the same standards and professionalism that the rest of law enforcement in the state does.”

Chris Madel was rising quickly in the polls as a GOP candidate in Minnesota’s governor’s race. But now he’s no longer running because he said he cannot be part of the Republican “retribution” going on in his state.

“The president posted something on Truth Social saying that it was a time of reckoning and retribution on the citizens of my state, and I’ve seen that happen, and I cannot be a part of it — and I can’t be a part of a party that’s a part of that,” he told CNN’s Erin Burnett.

He initially supported the immigration crackdown and “the idea of getting rid of the worst of the worst,” he said, but several law enforcement officers told him they got pulled over by federal agents because of the color of their skin.

With tensions rising, Madel said, it has “just gotten to a point where it’s just so incredibly out of hand.” In the end, he said, he wants to lead by example for his daughters, and show them you have to stand up for things that aren’t right.

“We need to treat everybody with a measure of humanity, and that’s what it really means to be an American. That’s what we are. We are a nation of immigrants,” he said.

The idea of people walking around with their papers or photos of their passports because they are scared of being swept up by federal agents is “antithetical to everything our country is about,” Madel said.

The Department of Homeland Security has underscored that Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who became the face of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota, has not been removed from his duties.

“Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X today.

Bovino “is a key part of the President’s team and a great American,” she added.

Some background: Bovino and some of his agents are expected to leave Minneapolis tomorrow and return to their respective sectors, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. Trump is dispatching White House border czar Tom Homan to manage Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Minneapolis in the wake of Saturday’s fatal Border Patrol shooting of a US citizen. This change will not result in Bovino’s removal from his duties, the administration has clarified.

The Department of Homeland Security has suspended border patrol official Gregory Bovino’s access to his social media accounts effective immediately, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Bovino would use one X account, @CMDROpAtLargeCA, to post multiple times a day, trolling his critics, sharing mugshots of immigrants his officers arrested, and publicizing his own appearances at press conferences and on cable news.

Over the weekend, Bovino had scrapped with lawmakers and others online, responding to their posts on X about the shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti. In several recent posts to social media, Bovino had accused Pretti of assaulting federal law enforcement officers before he was killed — a claim that is not supported by video of the moments leading up to his death.

Bovino is expected to depart Minneapolis tomorrow, and President Donald Trump said he is sending border czar Tom Homan to lead the operation there.

The US Department of Education (DOE) and Health and Human Services (HHS) referred two Minnesota agencies to the Department of Justice for their “refusal to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) by allowing men to compete in women’s sports and occupy women’s intimate facilities.”

What the statement from DOE and HHS says: The state agencies — Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) and the Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) — were notified in September of their Title IX violations and asked to voluntarily resolve them or risk action. But Minnesota has indicated it won’t accept the proposed resolution or negotiate.

“As Minnesota reels from a massive fraud scandal exposing Governor Tim Walz’s dereliction of duty, today’s referral to DOJ underscores the state’s ongoing failure to safeguard its citizens and uphold the rule of law. The Trump Administration will not stop until accountability is delivered for Minnesota’s students,” said Linda McMahon, US Secretary of Education, in the statement.

“Minnesota is violating Title IX, and we will not look the other way,” said Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., US Secretary of Health and Human Services.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2026-01-25t173302z-520175463-rc2g8jayjvv3-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-minnesota.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-27 02:58:04.773502

'Out of control': Gov. Healey criticizes feds after latest deadly shooting by ICE agents in Minnesota

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey sharply criticized federal immigration enforcement practices and members of the Trump administration on Monday, following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minnesota.Healey, who was asked about the incident after she gave remarks about the winter storm affecting the Bay State, called the latest shooting ""unnecessary."" She said the incident is emblematic of what she described as an out-of-control agency operating without adequate training or accountability.Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, was fatally shot on Saturday. The Trump administration has sought to portray the 37-year-old as an armed threat who intended to harm federal agents during a Minneapolis protest, but video of the incident seems to contradict these statements. Pretti is seen holding a phone in the video and was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but was reportedly not brandishing one when he was shot by federal agents on Saturday. Border Patrol officials say Pretti resisted disarmament, leading to his shooting. On Monday, Healey rejected the administration's statements as ""lies"" and attempts to smear Pretti after his death. ""This just isn't right,"" Healey said on Monday. ""There was no need for all of that to go down in the way that it did.""The governor, a former prosecutor and attorney general, said the conduct of federal officers in Minnesota ran counter to basic law enforcement standards and posed a threat to public safety rather than enhancing it.She also raised concerns about ICE recruitment and training practices.""You would never run a law enforcement agency with online training,"" Healey said.

In a hearing, U.S. District Judge Mustafa Kasubhai said he would dismiss the suit and issue a final written opinion in the coming days. The updated docket for the case showed that Oregon's move to dismiss the case was granted.

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield welcomed the move.

“The court dismissed this case because the federal government never met the legal standard to get these records in the first place,” he said in an emailed statement. ""Oregonians deserve to know that voting laws can’t be used as a backdoor to grab their personal information.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.

Kasubhai scheduled the hearing after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dated Saturday, the same day federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, which has seen widespread protests over increased immigration enforcement and the previous killing of Renee Good by an immigration officer.

In her letter, Bondi asked the Democratic governor to support immigration officers and shared three “simple steps” to “help bring back law and order"" — including by giving the Justice Department the ability to “access voter rolls to confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

Bondi also asked for the state's records of its Medicaid and food assistance programs, and for the repeal of sanctuary policies that limit local officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

The Justice Department has been seeking detailed voter data that includes names, dates of birth, residential addresses, driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers. Officials in many states have said turning over such information would violate both state and federal privacy laws.

The Justice Department has filed lawsuits against at least 23 states and the District of Columbia as part of its effort to collect such data. Last week a federal judge in Georgia dismissed such a suit after ruling the federal government had sued in the wrong city, and earlier this month a federal judge in California dismissed a suit there after finding the government’s request was “unprecedented and illegal.”

The department has said it needs to access detailed voter data to ensure election officials are following federal election laws. Election officials have disputed that and raised concerns that federal officials are trying to use the sensitive data for other purposes, such as searching for potential noncitizens on the rolls.

In a July letter, the department asked Oregon for an electronic copy of its statewide registration list and details on the steps it has taken to remove ineligible voters, court filings show. It sent another letter in August saying it needed the voter list to assess compliance with federal law, and that the list must include information such as full names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers or partial Social Security numbers.

Oregon officials responded in August that the department lacked the authority to request the list and offered to provide the publicly available list, court filings show. The department argued it has the authority to request the data under multiple federal laws and is complying with privacy laws.

Kasubhai called for the Monday hearing in Oregon's lawsuit so that attorneys on both sides could provide additional arguments on how Bondi's letter was relevant in interpreting the “basis and purpose” of the department's request for voter data.

The department argued it had authority under the Civil Rights Act of 1960 to request voter records, as the law says such records are to be made available to the U.S. Attorney General upon a demand in writing that states the basis and purpose of the request. Yet Kasubhai said the department's August letter did not satisfy the law's requirement for stating a basis and purpose when requesting voter records. He added that he read the congressional record of the time when the law was passed, and found it was “unequivocal” on the release of records being associated with investigations involving discrimination in elections.

The Justice Department’s outreach has raised alarm among some election officials because the agency doesn’t have the constitutional authority to run elections. That power is granted to states and Congress. Federal law also protects the sharing of individual data with the federal government.",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1c8ec51d-b580-4bf2-9b4d-2e785a055ea9/wirestory_f0a3477a5fa061cc71e9ee6ce652ff7a_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2026-01-27 03:59:21.039158

Amy Walter: Yes.
At the beginning of President Trump's term, approval rating of handling immigration was higher than his overall handling of the job that he was doing.
Amy Walter: Right.
Geoff Bennett: Amy Walter and Tamara Keith, our thanks to you, as always.","Geoff Bennett:

It is shaping up to be a consequential week in the nation's capital, as cracks emerge inside the Republican Party over the Trump administration's handling of its immigration crackdown in Minnesota and beyond.

For analysis, we're joined tonight by our Politics Monday team. That's Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter and Tamara Keith of NPR.

It's good to see you both.

Amy Walter, The Cook Political Report:

Hello.

Geoff Bennett:

So, Amy, for all of the talk about this defiant Trump White House, the White House is not immune to sustained public pressure.

Amy Walter:

Yes.

Geoff Bennett:

What does the latest polling show about how the American public broadly views its immigration approach?

Amy Walter:

Yes, it's really interesting, Geoff. At the beginning of President Trump's term, approval rating of handling immigration was higher than his overall handling of the job that he was doing.

Now, as both of those have come down over the course of his presidency, still, for much of the year, immigration has been higher. But -- and it's not just because of what we have seen in Minnesota. We started to see this dip really going back earlier than this, where opinions about how Trump's handling immigration are now basically matching his overall approval rating.

What happened? I think a lot of it is that the conversation about immigration is no longer about immigration. It's no longer about the border. It's not even about this conversation about what we and how we should be handling the things that we normally talk about, like path to citizenship or DACA.

Instead, what we're talking about are very specifically the way that agents whose job it is to apprehend these folks, the ICE agents, are treating communities and, in the case of Minnesota, these two individuals who were shot by these agents.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Tam, you heard Senator Smith describe this as a coalition of the horrified, Democrats and Republicans who take issue with the way that the Trump administration is executing its immigration priorities here.

I mean, could this be one of the moments where voters who backed Trump on immigration begin to recoil from the methods, even if they still support the end goal?

Tamara Keith, National Public Radio:

I think that we are starting to see that.

NPR had a focus group that we sat in on conducted by Engagious. And there -- they were talking specifically to people who voted for President Biden and then voted for President Trump in 2024. And about a third of them raised their hands and said they thought that ICE was going too far. These were Trump voters who said that ICE was going too far.

And I think that the surest sign that the politics on this are not the best is President Trump himself.

The fact that he is trying to distance himself from what happened in Minnesota, the fact that he and his chief spokesperson are distancing him from the statements of Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, and Stephen Miller, his deputy chief of staff, the fact that they are putting some separation there is an indication of a real shift and an indication that President Trump realizes this may not be a political winner.

And I have previously said here that the Trump administration has one speed, and it is to fight. Well, they just suddenly discovered a different gear. They're in reverse. They are looking for an exit strategy from the really heightened rhetoric that -- and just really heightened situation on the ground in Minnesota.

Amy Walter:

Yes.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Amy, one of the Republican candidates for governor dropped out of the race this morning, Chris Madel.

He wrote an op-ed saying that ICE has gone too far. He accused national Republicans of pursuing retribution against the state's leaders. If even GOP candidates are worried about how the administration's enforcement strategy is landing, what does that say to you?

Amy Walter:

Yes.

I mean, the fact that you also had a lot of Republicans across the country take to social media over the weekend to say, again, the opposite of what the secretary of homeland security was saying, the opposite of what some of the folks of the administration were saying, they came out really and said, don't like what we're seeing here, this is a tragedy and that they're saying we need to have some more oversight here.

That, for Republicans, is a big push, to say we're going to have oversight over an executive branch, executive authority, executive branch. But how far this goes -- right, we always wonder how far will this go?

And that's why Lisa on here a few minutes ago made a really good -- helped us really understand what comes next, but trying to figure out what that line is between what Republicans are willing to do in terms of a funding bill, what kinds of oversight they're willing to provide and whether or not Democrats will believe that that is good enough.

When I was talking to a Democratic strategist earlier today, the frustration among Democrats is as telling as some of these rifts among Republicans. So making a deal isn't just about getting Republicans on board. It's getting Democrats to trust and to want to agree with a compromise on the Republican side.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Tam, what's the risk for Democrats here if there is one for confronting these tactics head on, given past political losses on crime and immigration?

Amy Walter:

Right.

Tamara Keith:

Yes.

So the issue that Democrats have had is that Republicans have been able to own immigration. They have won many a midterm with a Democratic president by campaigning on immigration, talking about the border. But as Amy mentioned before, this is different. This is Americans in American cities being killed by immigration agents.

So if Democrats are able to keep it focused on that and not talk about open borders or eliminate ICE, which had been something that they had campaigned on before and then that was thrown in their faces, there is a careful balance here. But the fact that these videos exist, the fact that people, like, everyone is seeing these videos really makes this a visceral issue for a lot of voters.

Geoff Bennett:

How do you see it, Amy?

Amy Walter:

Yes, I absolutely agree with that.

And that's why, again, you look at this New York Times poll that came out last week, this -- again, before what happened this weekend -- I'm sorry -- it came out last week. Do you support Trump's deportation of immigrants living here illegally? Fifty percent of Americans say, yes, they do.

But then you ask the question, do you think -- do you approve of how ICE is handling its job? Only 36 percent approve of it. So the issue isn't that people are saying, we should not be deporting people who are here illegally. What they are disagreeing with is the way that ICE is handling it.

And that, again, if we had a Congress that was working together, that is the sweet spot there. Fix the problem with the enforcement. That's where the crux of the matter sits.

Geoff Bennett:

Amy Walter and Tamara Keith, our thanks to you, as always.

A federal judge in Minnesota heard arguments today on whether to expel ICE agents from the state and put an end to the Trump administration's sweeping immigration enforcement.

The hearing comes as state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul officials warn that ICE's actions have pushed them into crisis.

We're joined now by Mary McCord, executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law.

Mary, thank you for being with us.

Mary McCord, Former Justice Department Official:

Sure. My pleasure.

Geoff Bennett:

At its heart, is this lawsuit, is this case really about immigration enforcement or is it fundamentally about the balance of power between states and the federal government?

Mary McCord:

Well, the way that it's been pled by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it does bring to issue this idea of federalism and principles of states' rights and the federal government's rights.

And they have a number of other claims, but two of the key claims in their complaint and the key claims that were in their motion for preliminary injunction that was heard by the court today is that what the government is doing here with this entire surge in the way it's been implemented has violated the Constitution, the Fourth Amendment when it comes to some of the searches and seizures, the First Amendment when it comes to retaliation against protesters, racial profiling, aggressive conduct, all those things.

They're saying that this infringes on their 10th Amendment rights because states are reserved the police power. And because of the surge and because of the pressure it's putting on the state and the cities and where it's occurring, that's impacting their ability to protect public safety, general health and welfare, all obligations of the state.

And they also argue it violates the notion of equal sovereignty between the states, because they argue that Minnesota is being targeted for political reasons, whereas other states that might even have more undocumented immigrants or the crisis of undocumented immigrants might be greater are not being targeted this way.

Geoff Bennett:

And if the judge were to grant Minnesota's request for a halt or some restriction on ICE's operations, what would that look like in a real way?

Mary McCord:

Well, that's a tough question to answer, because the complaint asks for a lot of relief.

At the heart, what Minnesota wants is for ICE to pull out of this surge, not necessarily every ICE agent to leave, but the surge to end. And that's an extraordinary relief, because, of course, the federal government argues that, under principles of supremacy of federal law, a state can't force them to stop enforcing federal law and that a judge would not be able to do that either.

So it really does pit these interests. And that relief would be pretty extraordinary. There are lesser forms of relief, though, that the judge might be considering, because she's taking this under advisement, which are things like enjoining violations of Fourth Amendment by not racially profiling when they engage in stops, enjoining them from going into sensitive locations like hospitals and schools and day cares, things like that.

So there's a whole sort of variety of relief that she could grant if she agrees with the legal arguments that have been made.

Geoff Bennett:

And on the flip side, if the court sides with the Justice Department and the Trump administration, what precedent might that set for states that challenge federal immigration enforcement and surges like the ones we've seen in Minneapolis?

Mary McCord:

Yes, this case has been different than so many of the other cases that have been brought in places like Portland and in Illinois, Chicago, when it comes to how ICE agents are actually performing their duties.

A lot of those cases, like another case actually that's in Minnesota right now, the Tincher case, those have been brought on behalf of protesters or on behalf of people who have been stopped as suspected being here undocumented. And those are making very specific other types of claims.

And this would have no impact on those lawsuits because the claims made by the state here are very different, these 10th Amendment claims. The other claims are much more personal to the individuals who have been subject to unconstitutional treatment.

So I think that you would still see those types of lawsuits in Minnesota, like there is one ongoing, the Tincher case, or in other states, if we see the type of excessive force and overreach and unconstitutional practices that we are seeing by ICE in Minnesota and that we saw in Portland and that we saw in Chicago and in L.A.

Geoff Bennett:

And, Mary, based on the arguments that you have heard and the legal issues at stake, are there any clues about how this judge might frame her decision?

Mary McCord:

Yes, I was not able to listen to it today because I was working on other things, but I understand that she did ask pointed questions along the nature of what we have been talking about, about how to balance the interest of the federal government and the Supremacy Clause and the interests of the states and the powers reserved to them under the 10th Amendment.

And so she's going to think long and hard about, I think, the legal arguments here before she answers her ruling. And I don't really want to speculate about that because that wouldn't be fair to the parties.

Geoff Bennett:

The Minneapolis shooting is also having direct consequences on Capitol Hill. Democratic leaders say they're ready to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security and potentially other agencies.

Our congressional correspondent, Lisa Desjardins, joins us now.

Lisa, it's good to see you.

So what are you hearing from members of Congress and is it in any way different from how they have responded in the past?

Lisa Desjardins:

Let's start with Republicans.

Notably, it was different in that very few of them actually responded initially, despite Stephen Miller and others at the White House signaling aggressive messaging.

Instead, we have something almost from another time, neutrality from some and even some concern from other Republicans, like this from Texas Republican Mike McCaul. He wrote: ""I am troubled by the events that have unfolded. I believe a thorough investigation is necessary, both to get to the bottom of these incidents, but also,"" he wrote, ""to maintain Americans' confidence in our justice system.""

Now, there are many Republicans who also criticize Democrats and say they're to blame for this kind of inciteful atmosphere and tension. Of course, Democrats deny that.

But one example is important to me, the House Oversight chairman, James Comer. He did say Democrats are to blame, but he also is not saying, ICE should double down. He's saying instead maybe ICE should pull back. Here's what he said on FOX Sunday.

Rep. James Comer (R-KY):

The situation's only going to get worse. And I really think that there are so many cities in the United States that have issues with criminal illegals, that I think they would be -- they would be better received in other cities. I hope that's something they're talking about doing right now, because Minneapolis isn't the only city.

Lisa Desjardins:

That reads to me as looking for a way out. Most notably, there are Republicans who are calling for hearings now.

One, look at this letter from Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. He's saying he wants a hearing in the next two weeks or so.

As for Democrats, I have spoken to so many. They're as incensed and also focused, as I have seen them, especially on ICE. They do not want any ICE funding to go through without changes. And indeed that funding is up for a vote potentially this week. Here's what Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, wrote on Twitter. He said that Democrats will not provide the votes needed for that.

What's that mean? Well, that funding is attached to a bunch of other agencies too. So we could be in for a shutdown.

Geoff Bennett:

And the shutdown would affect far more than DHS.

Lisa Desjardins:

Yes, let's take a look here.

These are the agencies that are part of this funding package. These are some of the biggest agencies in government, defense, HHS, transportation housing, in all, about 70 percent of the funding that Congress controls. Democrats want to pull out the HHS part of it and deal with that separately.

But my reporting is, Republicans so far are denying that. They say Trump can have executive actions to curb ICE. Well, you won't be surprised to hear that Democrats don't trust that. They want a legislative fix here, and we really are heading toward a potential shutdown.

Geoff Bennett:

And, separately, Lisa, amid all of this, there was a Democratic member of Congress who was assaulted this past weekend, and the assailant shouted racist remarks? Tell us about that.

Lisa Desjardins:

We're talking about Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost. He was at an event in Utah on Friday, and he announced he was punched in the face and that the assailant, he said, said: ""Trump will deport you.""

Someone has been arrested in this case.

Geoff Bennett:

Lisa Desjardins, our thanks to you, as always.

In December, a different federal judge in California ruled that limited data sharing, including addresses and immigration status, could go forward.
Bondi makes new demand for voter data Bondi also made a seemingly unrelated request: for Minnesota's voter data.
The DOJ has claimed it needs the data to enforce federal election law.
""The law does not give the federal government the authority to obtain this private data,"" Simon said.","Minnesota officials are rebuffing a series of demands from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, as the state continues its clash with the Trump administration over the surge of federal immigration enforcement in the North Star state.

In a letter to Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Bondi wrote: ""You and your office must restore the rule of law, support ICE officers, and bring an end to the chaos in Minnesota.""

The letter was dated Saturday, the same day Alex Pretti, a nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by immigration officers — the second fatal shooting by federal agents this month.

Bondi urged Walz to embrace what she called ""common sense solutions,"" including repealing what the Trump administration terms ""sanctuary policies"" and cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Minnesota state officials say the Trump administration is making false claims about its cooperation with ICE.

Walz, who's called on the Trump administration to end its operation in Minnesota, dismissed the letter in a news conference Sunday.

The letter also calls on the state to ""share all of Minnesota's records"" relating to Medicaid and food assistance programs, including SNAP, with the federal government.

The Trump administration has cited allegations of fraud, especially relating to immigrants of Somali descent, in its immigration crackdown.

Minnesota is one of more than 20 states that has so far refused to comply with a demand from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to turn over personal information about people who have applied for or received SNAP benefits over the last six years. The states have argued the demand is unlawful and a federal judge in California issued a preliminary ruling indicating they were likely to prevail in that claim.

Minnesota was also one of 22 states that sued to block the Department of Health and Human Services from sharing sensitive Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security to aid in immigration enforcement efforts. In December, a different federal judge in California ruled that limited data sharing, including addresses and immigration status, could go forward.

Bondi makes new demand for voter data

Bondi also made a seemingly unrelated request: for Minnesota's voter data.

It's not the first time the Department of Justice has sought the state's voter information — and it's an ask that's not isolated to Minnesota.

Instead, it's the latest escalation in the Trump administration's nationwide attempt to consolidate data and execute unprecedented oversight into the country's voting systems.

The DOJ is currently suing Minnesota and roughly two dozen other states — all states Trump lost in the 2020 election — trying to compel them to share unredacted versions of their voter lists with the federal government. The DOJ has claimed it needs the data to enforce federal election law.

Those suits have yet to be successful anywhere, though.

A federal judge in California recently dismissed a suit there, writing that the request was ""unprecedented and illegal,"" and another judge in Oregon signaled that he planned to do the same. A third judge in Georgia dismissed the suit in that state based on a jurisdictional issue.

Minnesota's chief voting official, Democrat Steve Simon, alluded to those outcomes in a statement declining Bondi's request.

""The law does not give the federal government the authority to obtain this private data,"" Simon said. ""It is deeply disturbing that the U.S. Attorney General would make this unlawful request a part of an apparent ransom to pay for our state's peace and security.""

Election law expert Rick Hasen, of UCLA School of Law, echoed those concerns in a strongly worded blog post over the weekend.

""This is outrageous and reprehensible,"" Hasen wrote. ""It shows ICE is not in Minneapolis for law enforcement or immigration purposes. They are there to stir up s*** in blue states and try to extort them …""

The federal government has not been clear on exactly how it plans to use or securely store the data, but it's become clear that part of their plans include running voting lists through a revamped system at the Department of Homeland Security meant to search for noncitizens.

NPR was the first news outlet to report on the details of the system, known as SAVE, but tens of millions of records have now been run through it, and no evidence of the sort of widespread voter fraud Trump has long talked about has come to light.

It's also unclear how accurate the system is. In one county in Texas, a state that voluntarily agreed to run its list through the system, at least 15 of the 84 voters the system flagged as noncitizens there were false positives.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4000x2250+0+0/resize/1400/quality/85/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff%2Ff1%2Fab62760245f2845331f046f62497%2Fap25164806200923.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 03:59:02.904731

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant requests by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul to temporarily halt the immigration operation. She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Menendez questioned the government's motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

""I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?"" Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued that the situation on the street is so dire as to require the court to halt the federal government's enforcement actions.

""If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,"" Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

Brantley Mayers, counsel to the Justice Department's assistant attorney general, said the government's goal is to enforce federal law. Mayers said one lawful action should not be used to discredit another lawful action.

""I don't see how the fact that we're also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge,"" Mayers said.

Menendez questioned where the line was between violating the Constitution and the executive's power to enforce the law. She also asked whether she was being asked to decide between state and federal policies.

""That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,"" she said.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

""I can't be the global keeper of all things here. Like, presumably that will be litigated,"" she said to the state's attorney.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday added urgency to the case.

Border czar to Minnesota

In other developments, President Donald Trump said he had a ""very good"" call with Walz about the latest shooting and that they are now on a ""similar wavelength."" It was an abrupt shift from Trump, who frequently derides Walz for his actions on immigration issues in Minnesota.

Trump also said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. The president's statement comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the public face of the crackdown, answered questions at news conferences over the weekend about Pretti's shooting. Trump posted on social media that Homan will report directly to him.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their request in an effort to restore the conditions that existed before the administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit ""legally frivolous"" and said Minnesota ""wants a veto over federal law enforcement."" They asked the judge to reject the request or to at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday that the lawsuit is needed because of ""the unprecedented nature of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we're looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we've seen something like this.""

Other state implications

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,"" the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday's shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing.

The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

""The fact that anyone would ever think that an agent of the federal government might even think about doing such a thing was completely unforeseeable only a few weeks ago,"" Ellison told reporters. ""But now, this is what we have to do.""

Our community joins with communities across the nation in expressing profound grief and outrage over the loss of these two U.S. citizens whose lives were cut short during federal immigration operations. These deaths are not isolated or accidental tragedies, they are part of a disturbing pattern of hostile federal actions that tear families apart, destabilize communities, erode public trust, and place immigrant communities, and those who stand alongside them, at grave risk. Such actions foster fear, escalate violence, and endanger civilians, including people who are peacefully assembling and documenting events.

What has unfolded in Minneapolis over the past several days is deeply alarming and stands in direct contradiction to our nation’s most fundamental values of justice, equality, due process, and respect for decency and human rights. The City of West Hollywood reaffirms, clearly and without hesitation, that immigrants are not threats. They are essential members of our communities and vital contributors to the social, cultural, and economic fabric of our nation.

Many people in our community have asked what the City of West Hollywood is doing in response. As a local government, the City is working to take consistent and meaningful action in several specific areas, including:

Direct Services –

Through its Human Services and Rent Stabilization Department, the City of West Hollywood provides direct services to members of immigrant communities, including connections to legal assistance, rental support, food resources, crisis intervention, and referrals. The City is promoting the availability of these services through its multilingual You Are Not Alone campaign in English, Spanish, and Russian, displayed throughout the West Hollywood community. Community members are encouraged to contact the City’s Human Services Division at (323) 848-6510 for support.

Education and Awareness –

The City of West Hollywood strongly encourages immigrant community members to stay informed. The City is distributing Know Your Rights information in English, Spanish, and Russian, and is directing residents and community members to the City’s regularly updated webpage at www.weho.org/knowyourrights. The City also shares up-to-date resources from the Los Angeles County Office of Immigrant Affairs at https://oia.lacounty.gov. Clear and accurate Know Your Rights information helps individuals and families understand legal protections and options, and empowers them to protect themselves, particularly during encounters with immigration enforcement. The City has also co-hosted workshops for workers and businesses to strengthen awareness of legal rights related to immigration actions.

Legal Action –

Since the beginning of 2025, the City of West Hollywood has actively exercised its legal voice by submitting amicus briefs and joining litigation to defend constitutional rights, protect vulnerable community members, and uphold principles of equity, public safety, and local autonomy. The City has supported legal challenges to attacks on birthright citizenship and the termination of humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrant communities from Central America, the Caribbean, and beyond. The City has also advocated to protect access to essential health and safety-net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP benefits, as well as to prevent discriminatory immigration enforcement practices rooted in racial profiling. The City has taken strong positions defending state and local authority against federal overreach, including opposition to efforts that would compel local participation in immigration enforcement, threats to immigrant access to courthouses, and rollbacks of law enforcement accountability and transparency. Notably, the City has intervened as a party in Vasquez Perdomo v. Noem, challenging the constitutionality of immigration raids conducted through profiling, and has supported efforts to halt large-scale federal deployments that undermine public safety and community trust. The City is continuously exploring all legal options to protect community members. An updated list of cases where the City has provided Amicus Support to the Court and/or joined in a case is provided at www.weho.org/knowyourrights.

Community Safety –

The City of West Hollywood works closely with its law enforcement partner, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, to maintain peace, uphold public safety, and protect the rights of all residents. Sheriff’s deputies do not enforce civil immigration laws and do not inquire about an individual’s immigration status when responding to calls for service. The Sheriff’s Department is not involved in federal immigration enforcement operations.

Advocacy and Lobbying –

At its last meeting, the West Hollywood City Council approved a Resolution reaffirming the City of West Hollywood’s commitment to upholding the Constitution of the United States and urging Congress to challenge unconstitutional actions taken by the Trump Administration. Through its Resist initiative, the City has established a proactive framework to oppose actions that threaten the rights and well-being of vulnerable community members, including immigrants. This initiative reaffirms the City’s core values of respect, inclusion, and social justice. It includes monitoring and responding to harmful federal policy proposals, empowering City leaders to advocate through public statements, letters, and legal action, and exploring additional programs and services to support residents if critical protections are weakened or eliminated. The City has taken support positions on critical legislation to require all immigration enforcement officers to display visible identification and ban non-medical facial coverings during immigration enforcement actions. The City has also sent letters to its federal representatives outlining the City’s responses to ICE actions and calling on leaders to advocate for the removal of ICE, military, and federal enforcement personnel from our streets. An overview of the City’s Resist initiative is provided on the City’s website at www.weho.org/resist.

Together, these efforts reflect the City of West Hollywood’s unwavering commitment to upholding human rights, advancing equity, and fostering an inclusive community. We will continue to take action, speak out, and demand accountability.",,N,,2026-01-27 02:58:09.827452

On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul called on the country’s top three immigration enforcement officials to testify before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which he chairs. He said Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of tax dollars and to protect the American people.

“As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,” Paul said in letters addressed to officials with Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Bystander videos and witness testimony show Pretti was holding a phone and helping a woman pushed by federal agents before he was sprayed with a chemical agent, pinned to the ground and fatally shot.

Trump administration officials immediately defended the agents’ actions as self-defense, calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and saying he intended to “massacre” officers. The Department of Homeland Security said Pretti was armed. However, Pretti had a permit to legally carry the gun in his holster and was at no point brandishing it in any of the bystander videos analyzed by major media organizations. One agent appeared to remove the gun moments before he was shot multiple times.

Paul’s letters don’t mention Pretti’s killing, but the hearing scheduled for Feb. 12 would be the first opportunity for senators to question Trump officials directly over the shooting.

U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie and state Rep. Savannah Maddox of Dry Ridge took issue with the Trump administration’s claims that Pretti was a threat to law enforcement because he was carrying a firearm.

“Your federal government is trying to convince you that the mere state of being armed—which is your God-given, constitutionally protected right—is a “threat to law enforcement,” Maddox said on the website X. “Subverting the 2nd Amendment was not ok under Biden, and it’s not ok now.”

Massie said carrying a firearm “is not a death sentence,” but a constitutionally protected right.

U.S. Rep. James Comer suggested in a Fox News segment on Sunday that Trump should consider sending ICE to a different U.S. city.

“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, okay, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals?

Learn more journalist tweeted out screenshots from a public, unvetted ICE Watch Signal group in Minneapolis, which quickly went viral on the online Right. As thousands took to the streets in Minneapolis and around the country to protest the ICE assault on communities and the brutal murders of Renée Good and Alex Pretti, reactionary keyboard warriors stared wide-eyed and aghast at images from chats showing neighbors organizing street-level mutual-aid networks and ICE-monitoring shifts.

Over and over, they issued breathless versions of the same refrain:

“The Left is infinitely times [sic] more organized than the Right.”

“This is highly organized and efficient.”

“They are more organized than you can possibly imagine.”

“This is an area of capabilities that the Right absolutely does not have.”

“The right wing has nothing like this. Anywhere in the country. for any purpose.”

Heads swirled and grasped for conspiracy theories to make sense of it. “Deep state operation here. This isn’t a bunch of randoms,” and: “Follow the money and it’ll eventually lead back to the CCP.” Clearly, the Right is unable to comprehend (or unwilling to admit to) the organic strength of grassroots movement-building—the reality that neighbors are committed to showing up for each other with dedication and fortitude, out of solidarity and love.

Short for Make America Great Again, the slogan of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Learn more influencers, of course, often find it useful to amplify the imagined threat of conspiratorial, all-powerful enemies lurking around every corner. From the ‘Q drops’ of QAnon to the pages of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Rightists chase like catnip anything that promises a forbidden glimpse into the hidden heart of Leftist power.

But the Minneapolis ICE Watch signal group was no fairytale—which is precisely what scared them. Beneath their fevered calls for federal prosecution was the grudging acknowledgment that their side could never pull this kind of thing off. They’re forced to admit that they don’t really have people power—the kind that makes neighbors stand side by side in the cold, again and again, over the long haul. And they never will, because the right-wing project is genuinely unpopular, which makes it precarious and fragile.

To be sure, the Right can organize too. From January 6 and Unite the Right to the legacy of the Klan, history is replete with examples of the successful mobilization of reactionary backlash. But they can’t dream of the level of grassroots mobilization on display from just a single unvetted ICE Watch Signal-chat in one city. The solidarity on display terrifies them—as it should. So they cling as tightly as they can to the levers of state and institutional power (along with their massive funding streams) yet they’re haunted by the realization that in the long run, this may not be enough.

It’s also hard to miss the note of envy. Indeed, there’s always been a not-so-subtle thread of envy running through the history of conservatism. Whether it’s the French Revolution, 1917, the 1960s New Left or Minneapolis today, the Right has been persistently jealous that the forces of human emancipation are not only more numerous and better organized than they are, but that they’re also having more fun and have a more compelling vision of the future than they can ever dream of.",https://religiondispatches.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_share_image/public/images/ICE.jpeg?itok=NqmfiR8e,N,,2026-01-27 00:58:17.070288

As Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino and some immigration agents depart, ""border tsar"" Tom Homan will begin leading on-the-ground efforts in the Minnesota city after the shooting of Alex Pretti on Saturday escalated tensions.

The decision by President Donald Trump may indicate the administration's interest in walking back more aggressive federal action in his nationwide immigration crackdown.

Despite the announcement, online tracking of immigration raids shows the administration's efforts have still continued.

Bovino was the face of the operation when Pretti - an observer seen filming agents - got into a confrontation that led to him being shot numerous times on a street in Minneapolis.

The border control commander inflamed the situation on the ground in the aftermath of the shooting, claiming that Pretti intended to ""massacre"" federal agents.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading ""sickening lies"" about what happened.

Before the shooting, Bovino was key to the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration enforcement in several cities, active on social media and regularly filming raids and posting promotional videos showing his agents' action.

Homan, who will report directly to the president, advocates for Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement. But he also has experience in the role - Homan worked with immigration and deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration.

In Minneapolis on Monday, tension and frustration over the presence of federal officials remained high, despite the news that Bovino and some agents would be leaving.

""A lot of people aren't able to work right now, they aren't able to leave their house, they're afraid,"" said George Cordero, a resident of St Paul, Minneapolis', sister city.

Pretti was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state; Renee Nicole Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January.

Some media reports on Monday suggested Bovino had been let go from his role, but Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin refuted that, saying the border patrol chief ""is a key part of the President's team and a great American"".

Much of the anger in the city and from politicians on both sides of the aisle was directed at Bovino and border patrol agents sent to Minneapolis along with ICE agents at Trump's directive. In total, there are more than 3,000 immigration agents in the city.

Carol Engelheart, a retired nurse from Minneapolis, said she has been deeply emotional about the events of the past few days.

""We need to care about this country, we need to care that we have a Constitution left, and if the people organize and the people stand up, we can do this,"" she said, as she chided immigration enforcement actions in the city.

Micayla Pretti, Alex Pretti's younger sister, released a statement on Monday, the Associated Press reported, calling her brother ""my hero"".

""When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?"" her statement said.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that it is the president's ""hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos"" in Minneapolis to end.

Trump ally Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, called Trump's decision to send Homan, to Minneapolis ""a very smart move"".

Also on Monday, Trump spoke will both Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - democratic leaders who have resisted the immigration efforts and demanded agents be removed from the state. Trump has criticised both in recent weeks.

Both Trump and the local leaders characterised the talks as positive and said they discussed a pathway forward - a sign that both sides were seeking a way to end their standoff over Trump's deportation drive.

Trump said he and Walz are ""on a similar wavelength"" and said his target is ""any and all criminals that they have in their possession"".

""The President agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and to talk to DHS about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,"" Walz said after the call.

Ensuring an independent investigation into Pretti's death, has been a central focus for Walz. In its immediate aftermath, local authorities obtained a judicial warrant to gain access to the crime scene to preserve evidence.

Local officials have condemned the federal government investigation and said they were not being allowed to access the crime scene and evidence following Pretti's death.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7253/live/7b78e7f0-fb1d-11f0-a47f-d352a7d9988a.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:57:59.224709

The House and Senate quickly gaveled in and out Monday due to the ongoing winter storm, and most members were absent as West Virginia is under a state of emergency.

In the GOP-controlled House, members had been expected to vote this week — as early as Tuesday — on a bill that would expand the state’s definitions of human trafficking, smuggling crimes, forced labor and more. The measure establishes specific felony penalties for the illegal transport of adults and minors.

House Bill 4433 defines human smuggling as transporting, isolating and harboring an illegal alien to avoid law enforcement.

“I believe that the federal government is attempting to enforce laws, but that doesn’t mean that the state cannot engage in activities to either facilitate what the federal government is doing or to ensure the protection of our citizens as well,” said bill sponsor Del. Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson.

Democratic House members are concerned that the bill could penalize church groups or nonprofit organizations helping undocumented immigrants, including giving them a ride to the grocery store.

“My concern is that these types of actions will subject people of faith to criminal penalties and time in jail,” said Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia.

As the House Judiciary Committee vetted the measure, Hansen asked, “Would they be involved in human smuggling based on this bill?”

Ridenour replied, “If they’re engaged in smuggling individuals into the state, then yes, they would be.”

On the House floor Friday, Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, attempted to amend the bill by editing the definition of human smuggling to include that it required an intent of financial or material benefit. Her amendment was in an effort to carve out protections for churches and individuals helping undocumented immigrants.

“I think we all want to go after people that are breaking the law,” Young said. “I want to make sure we’re targeting people that are profiting off of exploiting other people. This amendment clarifies that there would be a financial motive for people who are doing this for a capital gain.”

House Judiciary Chairman J.B. Akers, R-Kanawha, said the amendment wasn’t necessary because the bill already provided a safeguard for people working with immigrants without criminal intent.

“If you are someone who receives grant services — a church for example, who is transporting immigrants who may have illegal status — you could then be criminally liable and culpable if we adopt this amendment,” Akers said. “You do not have criminal liability under this bill if your purpose is simply to provide transportation services to someone [or] do a favor for somebody.”

Akers added that the bill is in line with federal law on human smuggling. He urged rejection of Young’s amendment, and it was voted down.

The bill also requires that perpetrators pay restitution to adult and child victims of human trafficking regardless of their immigration status after Akers amended it on the House floor last week. A judge would decide what the restitution would be.

The House passed similar measures in 2024 and last year, citing the border crisis. The bills stayed parked in the Senate.

Lawmakers are scheduled to return to committee meetings and floor sessions on Tuesday.

West Virginians are encouraged to call 211, the state’s 24/7 call center, if they need help during the winter storm.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey said West Virginia is dealing with a “a very dangerous cocktail” of ice, snow, sleet and cold temperatures. He has declared a State of Emergency for all 55 counties due to the winter storm that started over the weekend.

A lot has happened on the Supreme Court’s docket since my September preview, including six criminal law opinions on the merits (two by summary reversal – that is, without additional briefing and oral arguments), and 29 new grants of review (certiorari). Eight separate writings of individual justices in criminal cases have also appeared on the “Orders” docket. And of course last week saw oral arguments about Hawaii’s private-property-versus-gun-rights law. I should also mention two significant full court decisions on the interim docket that have “related to criminal law” implications: Trump v. Illinois (decided on Dec. 23, addressing Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Chicago) and Noem v. Vasquez-Perdomo (decided on Sept. 8, addressing immigration detentions in Los Angeles, about which I wrote critically at the time).

With over half the term gone by, about half of the 58 cases in which the court has now granted review for the 2025-26 term present (by my broad definition) either criminal law questions or questions related to criminal law. The criminal law cases already decided, or added to the docket, since my pre-term preview are briefly summarized below.

Today’s column is informational rather than opinionated (for the most part) and presents short descriptions rather than lengthy analysis. As the court issues more final decisions, I expect that more analysis will come. (Meanwhile, you have no idea how many clicks putting in all the hyperlinks in this column takes.)

Decided cases

The court has now issued six decisions in criminal cases. The initial 9-0 vote count in five of the six is not unusual for the start of the merits docket – the “easy” decisions usually come first. Four of the six opinions favored the criminal defendant. Most intriguing are a few concurring opinions.

Case v. Montana (Jan. 14), Fourth Amendment

The justices unanimously endorsed a standard for warrantless entries into a home for law enforcement to provide “emergency aid,” rather than to search for criminal evidence. According to the court, law-enforcement officials need an “‘objectively reasonable basis for believing that someone inside needs emergency assistance,” which is different from “probable cause” or “reasonable suspicion” to investigate possible crimes. (Precisely how it differs remains to be settled, I think, in a future case.)

Most interesting in Case is Justice Neil Gorsuch’s short concurrence, in which he attacks what he calls “the miasma” and “confusion” created by the “reasonable expectation of privacy” standard that originated in the 1967 case of Katz v. United States. Gorsuch took his seat after the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Gorsuch praised as a “towering” figure and a “lion of the law.” Gorsuch predicted that Scalia’s approach to “the judicial role … will endure.” Yet in 2001 in a case called Kyllo v. United States, it was Scalia writing for the court who faithfully applied the Katz privacy analysis to rule that using technology outside of a house to monitor heat emanating from inside the house (to detect a suspected drug lab) was a Fourth Amendment “search” subject to the warrant requirement. Does Gorsuch’s Case concurrence portend that he will part ways with his professed mentor?

Barrett v. United States (Jan. 14), Double jeopardy

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored this unanimous decision, in a somewhat complicated federal statutory context. Imposing two convictions – one for a violation of a statute prohibiting possession of a gun in connection with a federal crime of violence and one for a violation of that same statute that also “causes … death” – violates the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against being “twice put in jeopardy” for “the same offense.” Both provisions have “the same elements” under the court’s 1932 decision in Blockburger v. United States, so they meet the court’s “same offense” standard. Because the court determined that Congress has not “clearly manifested” an intention to impose two separate convictions here, however, the two-conviction judgment below was reversed. (The question “whether Congress could” constitutionally authorize two convictions was reserved in a footnote.)

As in Case, Gorsuch wrote separately to note doctrinal “confusion,” this time regarding concurrent versus successive prosecutions for lesser and greater offenses. He’s right about that, I think. But he also says that a concurrent prosecution “for greater offenses and their lesser included variants” are “no double jeopardy problem … so long as the court does not enter judgments of conviction on both.” Perhaps the difference is one trial versus two, giving dispositive power to the word “twice” in the Fifth Amendment (that is, no person shall “be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb”). But why doesn’t a single trial for two “same offense” crimes itself constitute being “twice put in jeopardy,” especially if one variation of the crime permits introduction of evidence that the other might not? Gorsuch is right that “courts often tolerate the practice,” but such toleration does not settle the constitutional question.

Ellingburg v. United States (Jan. 20), Ex post facto laws

An easy unanimous decision: “restitution is criminal punishment” when imposed as a mandatory part of a criminal sentence. For that reason, in line with the ex post facto clause of the Constitution, courts may not be able to impose restitution (the case is remanded with the court’s usual closing phrasing “for further proceedings”) as part of a federal sentence for a crime that occurred before the law at issue was passed by Congress in 1996.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s opinion was only five pages. Justice Clarence Thomas agreed with “the Court’s opinion in full,” but (joined by Gorsuch) he added 17 pages of historical analysis to suggest that the court has strayed far from the rationale of its first ex post facto opinion, 1798’s Calder v. Bull. Thomas “would restore Calder’s approach” and reconsider “what laws would have been subject to the ex post facto clause,” including “[m]any laws that are nominally civil today.”

Bowe v. United States (Jan. 9), Federal habeas corpus

A very complicated and technical 5-4 decision, ruling that federal prisoners are not barred from filing “successive” (that is, repeated) petitions for post-conviction relief even though state prisoners are, and that the court has jurisdiction to reach that question. Gorsuch’s dissent was joined by Thomas and Alito, as well as by Justice Amy Coney Barrett in part, making Chief Justice John Roberts and Kavanaugh the dispositive votes in addition to the court’s three regular “liberal” justices.

Clark v. Sweeney (Nov. 14), Habeas corpus

In Clark , the court summarily reversed, without any noted dissents, the grant of a new trial in a Maryland murder case, on the ground that “the Court of Appeals departed dramatically from the principle of party presentation” (a practice in which courts usually consider only arguments presented to them by the parties). Last month, I wrote critically about this decision, which seems to transform this “principle” into a dispositive rule. (Sidenote: court observers sometimes indicate that there were “no noted dissents,” to honor the idea that justices might silently “go along” with a decision even if they do not agree with it. How often such theoretical “dissent aversion” actually occurs, if at all, is unknown.)

Pitts v. Mississippi (Nov. 14), Confrontation clause

A five-page summary reversal of the Mississippi Supreme Court, which had affirmed a trial court’s ruling that screening a young child abuse victim from view when testifying at trial was “mandatory.” Again, no dissents were noted. Two prior Supreme Court decisions permit such screening “only if a court hears evidence and issues a case-specific finding of … necessity,” which did not happen here. Thus, the court held that the Sixth Amendment right of a criminal defendant “to be confronted with the witnesses against him” was violated.

Nine new criminal or criminal-law-related cases added to the docket since September

By my criteria, five of the new cases granted for review involve “pure” criminal law issues. Another four present questions which I think are “related” to criminal law.

Five new “pure” criminal law cases

Wolford v. Lopez (argued Jan. 20), Second Amendment

A Hawaii law makes it unlawful to carry a firearm on private property, even if that property is generally open to the public and the bearer is licensed to carry the firearm, unless the property owner has given express permission. Does that law violate the Second Amendment’s “right of the people to keep and bear Arms” because it effectively means that lawful gun carriers cannot engage in day-to-day activities like visiting gas stations or coffee shops without explicit consent? Or is it honoring the long-standing right of private property owners to exclude others from their property? Based on oral argument, the court appears poised to side with the challengers to Hawaii’s law. But as usual, the significant points will be in the nuances of separate justices’ opinions. Exactly how far will a majority go in describing the limits of gun laws within the meaning of the Second Amendment?

United States v. Hemani (scheduled for argument March 2), Second Amendment

Is the federal statute (18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(3)) that prohibits possession of a firearm by someone “who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance” unconstitutional? Ali Danial Hemani may, for purposes of argument, concede marijuana use, but he was not under the influence when arrested or when carrying his weapon, factors that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit has previously ruled are required. Last week’s oral argument in Wolford may shed some light on the arguments here, particularly regarding the use and limits of history (though a decision in Wolford before the oral argument seems unlikely).

Notably, the type of controlled substance in this particular case should be irrelevant to the Second Amendment question, even if the parties skirmish a bit on the point. The solicitor general’s petition for review said that “[t]his prosecution rests on respondent’s habitual use of marijuana” and presents the question presented as an “as applied to respondent” challenge. But the solicitor general also mentions use of cocaine and promethazine. Of potential interest: marijuana use is illegal in Texas (and under federal law), but has been decriminalized in over half of the states and the Trump administration has advocated changes to legalize “the medical use of marijuana.” We’ll see whether any of this comes up on March 2.

Hunter v. United States (scheduled for argument March 3), Appeal waivers in guilty pleas

This presents a longstanding and varied “split” among the federal courts of appeals. When criminal defendants have reached a “bargain” with the prosecution to plead guilty rather than go to trial (usually in exchange for some reduction in the charges), they are routinely asked, and regularly agree, to waive any appeal as part of the bargain (with an exception, perhaps, for an appeal argument that their lawyer has been ineffective or, sometimes, that the sentence imposed exceeds a statutory maximum). Moreover, some district judges later recite, when sentencing the defendant, that the defendant “has a right to appeal,” and some prosecutors fail to object to that line.

After entering such an agreement and pleading guilty, Munson Hunter filed an appeal challenging his sentence, but the 5th Circuit ruled that he had waived any such appeal and dismissed it.

Hunter’s petition for review says that that eight of the thirteen (or so) federal circuits have reached different conclusions regarding whether any implicit exceptions to such “appeal waivers” should be recognized (and whether a boilerplate statement that the defendant “has a right to appeal” renders a prior appeal waiver unenforceable). Both questions will be argued on March 3 (and you might especially enjoy hearing the feisty and experienced Supreme Court advocate Lisa Blatt arguing for Hunter).

Abouammo v. United States (argument likely in late March), Criminal venue

May a federal defendant be charged in a district where no conduct related to the offense occurred, if an effect of the conduct is contemplated in a different state? Here, California-based FBI agents visited Abouammo in Seattle, Washington; Abouammo then emailed them two false documents from Seattle, allegedly with intent to obstruct their California investigation.

Abouammo was charged, tried, and convicted in federal court in San Francisco for a false document crime “with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence [an] investigation” under 18 U.S.C. § 1519. Section 2 of Article III of the Constitution provides that “[t]he Trial of all Crimes … shall be held in the State where the said Crimes have been committed.” Does the intent to impede a California investigation, which Abouammo allegedly had when he emailed the documents from his home in Washington, satisfy this constitutional requirement? The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that the “contemplated effects” of Abouammo’s conduct made a California venue proper. We shall see if the Supreme Court agrees.

Chatrie v. United States (April argument likely), Fourth Amendment

Are “geofence” warrants constitutional? Since the use of cellphones became ubiquitous, law enforcement officers have developed a practice of asking cell providers for information regarding what users are reported as being located at the specific time and place of a crime. In this case, a detective in Virginia submitted a sworn affidavit and a magistrate issued a warrant to Google, finding “probable cause” to examine the data of its many millions of users and, in a number of steps, produce a list of the specific time that specific users were in a particular location during a credit union robbery. The evidence produced by that “geofence” warrant led to the identification and subsequent conviction of Okello Chatrie. State and federal courts are split as to whether such warrants are a “general search” prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.

Four new cases “related” to criminal law

FCC v. AT&T, consolidated with Verizon v. FCC (likely April argument), Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in civil cases

The solicitor general is the petitioner – that is, the litigant seeking Supreme Court review – in the first case; the court granted review and consolidated the case for briefing and oral argument with a similar private petition filed by Jeff Wall, an experienced Supreme Court advocate.

The Seventh Amendment provides that “[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved.” The federal Communications Act of 1934 authorizes the FCC to levy monetary penalties without a jury trial. If the target entity pays, it gets federal judicial review but no trial by jury. If the entity decides not to pay, it may then receive a jury trial in federal court if the government sues to collect the money. The 5th Circuit ruled against the government in AT&T, holding that the initial assessment of a penalty without the involvement of an Article III federal court violates the Seventh Amendment (and Article III), while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit ruled for the government in Verizon on the same issue.

Gorsuch has recently expressed concerns about the constitutional jury trial right in civil cases, concurring in 2024’s S.E.C. v. Jarkesy decision to ask the questions now granted review, and discussing it again in a statement regarding a denial of review earlier this term. My speculation is that his views have stimulated both the petitions and the grant of review in these cases.

Bondi v. Lau (April argument likely), Immigration law

The case appears to present a question about the timing of a finding of “inadmissibility” for a lawful permanent resident who has taken a trip abroad but has also committed a removable offense against the United States. The 2nd Circuit ruled that Lau was “improperly classified” by the government as “an applicant for admission” after he had been paroled into the United States two years earlier after a “brief trip” abroad while criminal charges were pending against him. The federal government’s petition for certiorari was granted on Jan. 9, but because the case was filed under federal secrecy rules, redacted filings have not yet been publicly linked on the court’s official docket (other than Lau’s opposition to that petition, publicly linked on Jan. 15).

Sripetch v. Securities Exchange Commission(April argument likely), Federal securities law

May the SEC seek equitable disgorgement without showing that individual investor-victims suffered pecuniary harm? The 9th Circuit ruled that it could, because disgorgement “is designed to deprive the wrongdoer of his ill-gotten gains,” so there is no need to show that the victim was harmed.

In this case, Sripetch pled guilty to criminal securities fraud and agreed to civil liability including disgorgement, but the “harm to victims” point was not addressed in that agreement. He later raised the issue, and the solicitor general agreed that a division among the federal courts of appeals on the question deserves review in this case. So here we are.

Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Doe I (April argument likely), Implied or private rights of action

Falun Gong practitioners filed suit seeking damages against Cisco under two federal laws: the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Torture Victim Protection Act. They alleged that Cisco had aided and abetted torture against them or their relatives in China by developing surveillance and other systems used to locate the plaintiffs. Cisco filed a petition for certiorari from the 9th Circuit’s ruling allowing the case to go forward, and (in response to a request from the court for the government’s views) the solicitor general agreed that the question whether either statute allows private lawsuits for aiding and abetting deserves review by the justices.

Trump v. Barbara (March or April?), Birthright citizenship and immigration law

Does the current president’s executive order, issued the day he was inaugurated, contravene the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, which states that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside”? The solicitor general argues that citizenship does not automatically descend upon “children of … illegal aliens.” Numerous federal courts have ruled that the court’s 1898 ruling in United States v. Wong Kim Ark says otherwise.

Opinions regarding dissents from denials of certiorari (review) by the court

In a separate section of its website entitled “Opinions Relating to Orders,” the court collects, among other things, separate opinions of justices issued when it as a body denies an application for a stay of a judgment (for example, an impending execution), or denies a petition for review of a case. (A shorthand term for such orders is “dissents from denials,” although sometimes a separate writing is designated a “statement” or “statement respecting” a denial, when a justice agrees with the decision to deny review but nonetheless writes an opinion outlining his or her views.) In fact, this part of the court’s website is a grab bag of different types of cases; some of the other rulings here comprise the “interim” (sometimes called “emergency” or “shadow”) docket that has received so much recent attention.

By my count, eight of the twelve separate cases listed in the court’s Orders section are “criminal law or related.” But this column is already too long to detail them; you’ll have to look for yourself or wait for my Annual Summary of Criminal Cases published by the ABA every August.

In particular, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been responsible for countless civil liberties and digital rights violations since that time. In the past year, however, ICE and CBP have descended into utter lawlessness, repeatedly refusing to exercise or submit to the democratic accountability required by the Constitution and our system of laws.

The Trump Administration has made indiscriminate immigration enforcement and mass deportation a key feature of its agenda, with little to no accountability for illegal actions by agents and agency officials. Over the past year, we’ve seen massive ICE raids in cities from Los Angeles to Chicago to Minneapolis. Supercharged by an unprecedented funding increase, immigration enforcement agents haven’t been limited to boots on the ground: they’ve been scanning faces, tracking neighborhood cell phone activity, and amassing surveillance tools to monitor immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.

The latest enforcement actions in Minnesota have led to federal immigration agents killing Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Both were engaged in their First Amendment right to observe and record law enforcement when they were killed. And it’s only because others similarly exercised their right to record that these killings were documented and widely exposed, countering false narratives the Trump Administration promoted in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable.

These constitutional violations are systemic, not one-offs. Just last week, the Associated Press reported a leaked ICE memo that authorizes agents to enter homes solely based on “administrative” warrants—lacking any judicial involvement. This government policy is contrary to the “very core” of the Fourth Amendment, which protects us against unreasonable search and seizure, especially in our own homes.

These violations must stop now. ICE and CBP have grown so disdainful of the rule of law that reforms or guardrails cannot suffice. We join with many others in saying that Congress must vote to reject any further funding of ICE and CBP this week. But that is not enough. It’s time for Congress to do the real work of rebuilding our immigration enforcement system from the ground up, so that it respects human rights (including digital rights) and human dignity, with real accountability for individual officers, their leadership, and the agency as a whole.",https://www.eff.org/files/banner_library/blm-phones-2c.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:58:04.242732

[MUSIC PLAYING] NINA MOINI: Our top story on Minnesota Now, all morning, a federal judge has been hearing arguments on whether to temporarily halt immigration enforcement activity in the state. MPR news reporter, Estelle Timar-Wilcox has been listening to the hearing. She joins me with the latest. Thanks for your time, Estelle.

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Hi, Nina.

NINA MOINI: There are several ongoing lawsuits related to this immigration enforcement operation. Tell us what the court is hearing this morning.

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Yeah, this hearing this morning is in a lawsuit brought by the state and Minneapolis and St. Paul against the federal government. They're asking for a blanket stop to this immigration operation, or at least a temporary one. And basically, they're saying the federal government is overstepping its bounds and violating the state's constitutional right to govern itself. Attorneys with the US Department of Justice have called this frivolous and said this operation is within the federal government's right to enforce immigration law.

And what the state wants to get out of this is a temporary restraining order stopping this current surge of agents, bringing levels of ICE enforcement back down to what they were before this particular operation started in December. And this hearing started this morning at 9:00. They just went into recess about 15 minutes ago after hearing from attorneys on both sides. Federal judge, Katherine Menendez, says she's not sure when she-- or she didn't say when she plans to issue a ruling. But she said she's juggling some constitutional questions here and wants to consider it really carefully. And attorneys for the state are urged her to issue an order soon, since the situation is so tense.

NINA MOINI: The federal government has the right to enforce immigration. But why does the state say this particular operation is overstepping?

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Well, first, they're arguing it's overwhelming state resources. They said police have seen an uptick in 911 calls as people call for help related to federal immigration operations. Schools have reported lower attendance rates. Some hospitals and clinics say federal agents inside are scaring people and interfering with care. And of course, now we've also seen three shootings of local residents by federal agents, two of those fatal. And in addition to that argument that it's overwhelming state resources, attorneys also say the federal government is essentially using this operation to coerce the state to change its immigration enforcement practices.

Lawyers for the state this morning pointed to a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Governor Tim Walz this weekend, in which she asks for access to state records on residents and also said the state needs to end what she calls sanctuary policies. That's those policies that limit local law enforcement from collaborating with immigration enforcement. The state says that's also unconstitutional and violates the state's rights to make its own laws.

NINA MOINI: And this is one of several lawsuits in progress, again, over this current immigration operation. There's another hearing in federal court this afternoon. What can we expect out of that?

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Yeah, that's a hearing scheduled at 2:00 in a separate case. The state and Hennepin County attorneys are asking the federal government to preserve evidence related to Saturday's shooting of Alex Pretti. Federal officials have started that investigation into the shooting. But state officials have not yet been able to see that evidence. A federal judge issued an order in this case on Saturday blocking the Trump administration from destroying or altering any of that evidence. And we'll hear more about this at the hearing this afternoon.

NINA MOINI: So while officials wait for those court rulings, what is next for the federal government's operation here? Do you have a sense for that?

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: Well, we've gotten a little bit of word on this this morning. President Trump announced that he's sending border czar, Tom Homan, to the state to oversee ICE operations and report directly back to the president. He's expected to get in tonight. Trump and Walz also said this morning that they had a phone call about the operation, which Trump categorized as quote, ""very good."" He said he's on the same page with the governor about toning down tension. Walz called the talk productive and said he pushed Trump to decrease the presence of federal law enforcement here and also to let federal let local law enforcement investigate the shootings in Minneapolis. And according to Walz, Trump agreed to take those requests to his administration. That's the first time they've talked to each other about this operation after a tense couple of weeks and the two trading insults back and forth.

NINA MOINI: All right, Estelle. Thanks for that update.

ESTELLE TIMAR-WILCOX: You're welcome, Nina.

NINA MOINI: That's MPR News reporter, Estelle Timar-Wilcox.

While ICE officials have been silent in confirming that such a plan exists, The Washington Post recently reported that ICE is considering converting a warehouse in Hutchins that would house 9,500 detainees.

The group on Friday expressed a call to action for residents and religious leaders in Dallas County to reach out to lawmakers, to urge them to not support ""the warehousing of thousands of migrants in inhumane conditions in our backyard.”

""We should not be housing human beings in warehouses meant for packages,"" said Eric Folkerth, lead pastor of the Kessler Park United Methodist Church, where the press conference was held.

Carl Sherman, a former Hutchins city manager and former state representative for Texas District 109, which includes Hutchins, spoke about the impact the facility would have on the community.

""I can tell you that Hutchins does not have the infrastructure, does not the water supply, or the sewage infrastructure to sustain and accommodate the more than doubling of its current population by 150%,” Sherman said.

He and other speakers asked community members to support Hutchins residents and leaders — including Mayor Mario Vasquez — who do not want the ICE detention facility in their city.

“Local leaders must be empowered to plan and approve projects in their communities,"" Sherman said. “If you just can't imagine that it would ever happen in your home, your small town like Hutchins could be the next city, the next community that faces this.""

Meanwhile, two local faith leaders — Mara Richards Bim, Justice and Advocacy Fellow at the Royal Lane Baptist Church, and T.J. Fitzgerald, reverend of the First Unitarian Church of Dallas — were in Minneapolis and St. Paul Friday as part of a larger gathering to oppose ICE activity in Minnesota. They were there to meet with hundreds of leaders from around the country.

Dallas Rabbi Nancy Kasten said it’s important to work past ideological differences to plan, collaborate and cooperate.

“We in Dallas must work together to meet the moment when, not if, it arrives in our streets and at our doorsteps,” she said.

However, repeated reports of excessive force, inhumane detention conditions, and aggressive tactics by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have raised serious concerns about civil rights and due process. For immigrant communities, ICE brutality is not a policy debate. It is a daily reality with lasting emotional and legal consequences.

What Is ICE Brutality?

ICE brutality refers to the use of excessive force, intimidation, or abusive practices by immigration enforcement officers during arrests, raids, transportation, or detention. This can include physical violence, verbal threats, unlawful arrests, and denial of basic rights while in custody. These actions often occur during high stress enforcement operations where individuals are already vulnerable.

Common Examples of ICE Abuse and Excessive Force

Reports and client experiences reveal recurring patterns of ICE misconduct, including:

Early morning home raids without valid judicial warrants

Arrests of individuals with pending immigration applications or legal relief

Use of force against nonviolent individuals

Detention of parents in front of minor children

Failure to provide translators or explain legal rights

Denial of medical care in detention facilities

These practices can escalate quickly and cause severe psychological and physical harm.

Immigrants’ Rights During ICE Encounters

Regardless of immigration status, individuals in the United States are protected by the U.S. Constitution. These rights apply during encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, including at home, in public spaces, and at the workplace. Understanding these protections can help prevent unlawful searches, arrests, and coercive questioning.

In most situations, immigrants have the right to remain silent and are not required to answer questions about their immigration status, country of origin, or how they entered the United States. Individuals also have the right to refuse to sign documents they do not understand or that have not been reviewed by an attorney. Silence cannot legally be used as evidence of wrongdoing.

ICE officers generally may not enter a home without a valid judicial warrant signed by a judge. Administrative warrants issued by the Department of Homeland Security do not authorize entry into a private residence without consent. Individuals have the right to ask officers to show a warrant and to review it before opening the door. They may also refuse entry if the warrant is not judicial or does not list the correct address or individual.

Immigrants also have the right to speak with an attorney. While the government does not provide free immigration attorneys, individuals may request time to contact legal counsel before answering questions or participating in proceedings. Access to an attorney is a critical safeguard, especially during detention or removal proceedings.

ICE officers are required to follow due process and constitutional limits when conducting arrests, searches, and detentions. This includes limits on the use of force, requirements for lawful probable cause, and obligations to respect basic civil rights. When these limits are ignored, enforcement actions may become unlawful.

If ICE violates an individual’s rights, it may be possible to challenge the legality of the arrest, detention, or evidence obtained as a result. In some cases, constitutional violations can support motions to suppress evidence or other legal remedies in immigration court. Documenting the encounter and seeking legal counsel as soon as possible is essential to protecting these rights.

Knowing and asserting one’s rights during an ICE encounter can make a meaningful difference in the outcome of a case and in safeguarding long term legal options.

ICE Detention Conditions and Human Rights Concerns

ICE detention is a civil process, not a criminal punishment. Yet many detainees are held in conditions that resemble incarceration. Common issues include overcrowding, prolonged detention without hearings, inadequate medical treatment, and the use of solitary confinement. For asylum seekers and individuals with no criminal history, these conditions can be especially harmful and retraumatizing.

Legal Consequences of ICE Misconduct

When ICE officers engage in brutality or unlawful conduct, it can impact immigration cases. Evidence obtained through coercion or abuse may be challenged. In some situations, constitutional violations can support motions to suppress evidence or terminate proceedings. Documenting misconduct and seeking legal counsel as early as possible is critical.

How an Immigration Attorney Can Help After ICE Abuse

When an individual experiences abuse, excessive force, or unlawful treatment by ICE, having an experienced immigration attorney involved as early as possible is critical. An attorney can carefully review the circumstances of the arrest, raid, or detention to determine whether ICE officers complied with constitutional protections, agency regulations, and due process requirements.

Legal counsel can assess whether the arrest was supported by a valid warrant, whether consent was unlawfully coerced, and whether any statements or evidence were obtained through intimidation or force. If violations occurred, an attorney may be able to challenge the legality of the arrest, file motions to suppress unlawfully obtained evidence, or seek termination of removal proceedings in appropriate cases.

In addition, an immigration attorney can assist with securing bond or parole from detention, advocating for release based on humanitarian factors, family ties, or lack of flight risk. Counsel can also identify and pursue available forms of relief from removal, including asylum, cancellation of removal, adjustment of status, or other protections depending on the individual’s circumstances.

Attorneys may also help document abuse or misconduct by filing formal complaints with oversight agencies and preserving evidence that may be relevant to both immigration and civil rights claims. Just as importantly, legal representation provides guidance and stability during a highly stressful and intimidating process, ensuring that individuals understand their rights and options at every stage.

Early legal intervention often makes a decisive difference. The sooner an attorney becomes involved, the more effectively they can protect an individual’s rights, prevent further harm, and build a strategic defense aimed at safeguarding their future and their family.

I also agree with the NRA and others -- we need a full investigation into the tragedy in Minneapolis. We need all the facts,"" McCormick said in a post on X.

Moderate Senate Republican Lisa Murkowski urging, in a post on X, that a ""comprehensive, independent investigation of the shooting must be conducted in order to rebuild trust and Congressional committees need to hold hearings and do their oversight work. ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.""

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy called for a joint state and federal investigation into the shooting -- warning ""the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

While he did not call for an investigation, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz criticized the administration's rhetoric on the shooting.

""What I think the administration could do better is the tone with which they're describing this -- that immediately when an incident like this happens, they come out guns blazing that we took out a violent terrorist, hooray,"" Cruz said on his podcast ""Verdict with Ted Cruz"" on Monday.

More than a dozen House GOP lawmakers echoed similar sentiments, including House Homeland Security Chairman Andrew Garbarino, who expects a ""full investigation"" into the shooting.

""CBP and ICE have already been invited, and I expect each to testify before the Committee in the coming weeks. It is critical that Congress conduct its due diligence to ensure the safety of law enforcement officers and the communities they protect. I take my oversight duties of the Department of Homeland Security seriously, and we expect recent events to be thoroughly discussed at our hearing,"" Garbarino said in a statement.

Moderate New York Rep. Mike Lawler called for an independent investigation into the shooting but said calls to ""abolish"" ICE are ""misguided.""

""Let this be a moment for Americans of common sense and good will to come together and work towards a solution,"" he said.

Despite this, several Republicans have also rushed to the Trump administration's defense.

""The governor and local leaders' rhetoric has empowered criminals and put federal law enforcement's lives at risk. It's dangerous and has made the situation in Minneapolis much worse. Unlike my Democrat colleagues, I'm going to let law enforcement conduct their investigation and not jump to asinine conclusions. We are grateful no Border Patrol officers were harmed,"" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said in a statement.

Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona urged Americans to ""stop interfering with federal enforcement officers.""

Responding to Trump's social media post that called for deporting ""criminal illegal aliens,"" Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee said, ""We cannot back down.

Earlier this month, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem secretly imposed a policy requiring that members of Congress provide seven days’ notice before being granted access to these facilities. Under federal law, however, all members of Congress have the right to conduct unannounced oversight of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities used for immigration detention, including facilities run by Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) and those operated by private companies.

In a statement, Congressman Crow and other lawsuit plaintiffs said:

“The Trump administration is using billions of taxpayer dollars to carry out a violent and lawless immigration agenda with virtually no transparency or accountability. This is not only deeply dangerous — it is an affront to the rule of law and to our constitutional duty as Members of Congress. 2025 marked the deadliest year for those in ICE custody in more than two decades, with record detentions and mounting reports of abuse and inhumane conditions. We can’t turn a blind eye. We are returning to court to restore congressional oversight and hold this administration accountable to the American people.”

In July 2025, Congressman Crow sued the Trump Administration to uphold his right to conduct oversight of these facilities following his unlawful denial from a detention facility in Aurora.

Additional Members of Congress who were denied access to federal immigration detention facilities joined Crow as plaintiffs in the lawsuit: Representatives Joe Neguse (D-CO-02), Jamie Raskin (D-MD-08), Bennie Thompson (D-MS-02), Veronica Escobar (D-TX-16), Dan Goldman (D-NY-10), Adriano Espaillat (D-NY-13), Jimmy Gomez (D-CA-34), Norma Torres (D-CA-35), Raul Ruiz (D-CA-36), Robert Garcia (D-CA-42), Lou Correa (D-CA-46), and Kelly Morrison (MN-03).

Since his election to Congress, Crow has fought to promote transparency, oversight, and accountability in federal immigration detention centers. He introduced bipartisan legislation guaranteeing Members of Congress the right to conduct unannounced, in-person oversight visits of ICE detention facilities, including to check on any concerns related to public health and the humane treatment of detained individuals.

Crow regularly conducts oversight of Aurora’s immigration detention facility. Since 2019, he has visited the facility to conduct oversight ten times. Crow’s staff have also visited the facility more than 80 times to conduct oversight. Public reports of such visits, along with conditions at the facility, are published on Crow’s website.",https://crow.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-26 20:58:31.324321

The organization claims people detained in the Adelanto facility lack drinkable water, healthy food, clean clothes, places to sleep and access to medical care. Failing to provide these basic necessities, CHIRLA says in court documents, amounts to punishment — violating detainees rights to due process.

“ We are really at a moment where we are seeing a human rights crisis right before our eyes,” CHIRLA policy director Jeanette Zanipatin said at a news conference Monday. “And the detention centers, especially the one at Adelanto, is where we are seeing it unfold in real time.”

Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Public Counsel are assisting in the case against Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.

”We're asking both that the judge force Adelanto, the detention facility, to ensure that basic medical care is being provided, that basic hygiene and sanitary conditions, food and water are provided, and that oversight is conducted over the facility,” said Alvaro Huerta, director of litigation and advocacy at Immigrant Defenders Law Center.

ICE and Homeland Security have not responded to LAist about the case or claims in this article.

A question of constitutional rights

When CHIRLA announced the lawsuit on Monday, Zanipatin said there has been “a long history of unsafe and abusive conditions” at the Adelanto facility. She referenced a July 2025 report from the nonprofit Disability Rights California that found conditions at the facility were “dangerous and inadequate for all people, especially for those with disabilities.”

Court documents filed by CHIRLA also reference previous reports that found issues at the facility, including a 2018 report from the DHS Office of Inspector General that found “a number of serious issues that violate ICE’s 2011 Performance-Based National Detention Standards and pose significant health and safety risks at the facility.”

Those issues included findings of nooses in detainees’ cells, improper use of disciplinary segregation and inadequate medical care.

“Based on interviews with detainees and medical staff and a review of independent reports,” the report states, “we concluded that detainees do not have timely access to proper medical care.”

CHIRLA claims in their lawsuit that Adelanto leadership rejected the findings of the inspector general report and took no corrective action.

The concerns raised by CHIRLA as they announced the lawsuit closely resemble the findings of Disability Rights California, which also claimed detainees were not provided adequate medical care, food, water or clean clothing. The organization also reported that some people had limited access to communication with their loved ones.

Huerta claimed that the conditions in the Adelanto facility are poor by design.

“ Adelanto, like most ICE prisons, is engineered to be so punishing, so relentlessly soul crushing, that people abandon their rights and accept deportation even when they have strong asylum claims or a clear pathway to legal status,” Huerta said.

He said 32 people died while detained by ICE nationwide in 2025, and at least 6 more have died in January. Two people died at Adelanto last fall, Huerta said.

Family members speak out

Mariel Garcia told LAist she would call her father, Gabriel Garcia-Aviles, nearly every day. That ended when he was detained by immigration agents in Costa Mesa on Oct. 14.

Garcia-Aviles had a work permit, his daughter said, but he was detained and taken to Adelanto. She said she tried many times to ask the facility staff to allow her to call her father, or even to get an update on his condition, but she was never able to talk to him again.

Worried, she said she got a call from the staff at Adelanto.

“ They called me the day he was passing away,” Garcia told LAist, “They're like, go tell your family and friends to come and say their last goodbyes because your father's in critical condition.”

Her brother, Gabriel Garcia, said that when they arrived at the hospital their father was intubated and “lifeless."" Still, he said, there were law enforcement officers standing outside the hospital room.

Garcia-Aviles died Oct. 23 at age 56.

Jose Ayala also talked about the loss of his brother, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, while he was detained in the Adelanto facility.

“ He was there for about a month and we knew nothing of his condition,” Ayala said at Monday’s press conference, “just that he was sick and that he wasn't getting any help when he asked.”

Ayala said his family learned of his brother’s death when the police came and knocked at their door. He said staff at Adelanto did not tell them Ayala-Uribe had been hospitalized or that he needed a surgery, which ICE said in a news release was for an abscess.

Ayala told LAist that he was able to talk with his brother over the phone a couple of times when he was detained, and Ayala-Uribe was joking with him about the poor conditions of the facility causing him to lose weight.

“ One of the last things he told me,” Ayala recalled, “was, ‘We'll see who comes out skinnier.’”

He said his brother was 39 when he died on Sept. 22, 2025.

CHIRLA alleges in court documents that staff at Adelanto were aware Ayala-Uribe was having a potentially life-threatening medical emergency three days before his death, but he was taken back to his cell after being seen by the facility’s medical team.

An ICE news release said Ayala-Uribe “was evaluated by an on-call medical provider Sept. 18, provided medication, and returned to his dormitory,” but did not mention the severity of his condition.

The cause of both deaths remain under investigation, CHIRLA said in an accompanying news release.

Big Bear’s famous bald eagle couple, Jackie and Shadow, now have a pair of eggs to look after.

Jackie welcomed the second egg of the season around 5:10 p.m. Monday, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley, the nonprofit that runs a popular YouTube livestream centered on the nest overlooking Big Bear Lake.

More than 22,000 people were watching the livestream when Jackie welcomed the new addition, up from more than 14,000 viewers when the first egg arrived Friday afternoon.

The season so far

Jackie laid the first egg around 4:30 p.m. Friday, with Shadow stopping by to see it for the first time about 10 minutes later, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley records.

It was almost exactly a year after the feathered duo welcomed the first egg of the 2025 season.

Jackie tends to lay eggs three days apart, and the second egg arrived right on schedule.

Jackie could be seen rousing and puffing up her feathers about a half-hour before laying the second egg. She made a high-pitched whistling tea kettle noise a little before 5 p.m. Monday.

Officials from Friends of Big Bear Valley have told LAist those behaviors are signs an egg is imminent.

“She looks almost royal, because all of her feathers are out and it's just — I cry,” Jenny Voisard, the organization’s media and website manager, said with a laugh last week. “It's usually pretty amazing.”

The eagle pair typically takes turns caring for their eggs. Shadow visited the nest for nearly three hours across nine incubation “daddy duty” sessions on Sunday, according to organization records.

What’s ahead for the nest

Jackie has laid up to three eggs in a clutch, including in each of the past two seasons, so fans could see another egg arrive this week.

A clutch refers to the group of eggs laid in each nesting attempt. Bald eagles generally have one clutch per season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. A second clutch is possible if the eggs don’t make it through the early incubation process.

For example, Jackie laid a second clutch in February 2021 after the first round of eggs was broken or destroyed by ravens the month before.

The Big Bear eagles also practice delayed incubation, which is when Jackie and Shadow don’t apply their full body heat to the eggs until the whole clutch is laid.

Waiting to incubate full time helps the eggs hatch closer together, making the chicks more similar in size and age, which the organization says gives them a better chance of survival.

Jackie and Shadow successfully delayed incubation for their trio of eggs last season, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley. Sunny and Gizmo hatched and later went on to fledge, or fly away from the nest for the first time, last summer.

Chicks? Chicks soon??

Once egg-laying is over, the chick countdown is on.

Jackie and Shadow's usual incubation time is around 35 to 39 days, starting when the eagles begin to fully incubate their clutch, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley.

Last season, the first egg hatched at around 40 days old, the second egg hatched around 38 days old and the third egg around 39 days old.

“Pip Watch” — short for pipping, which is the first hole an eaglet makes as it emerges from its egg — is typically announced by Friends of Big Bear Valley before chicks break through each season.

Last year’s Pip Watch kicked off in March, a few days before the first chick hatched in the nest.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

The killing of another protester by immigration agents in Minneapolis and President Trump's ongoing threats against Greenland have fueled calls to boycott World Cup matches held in the U.S. this summer — including in Los Angeles.

The suggestion from a former FIFA president and others led some in City Hall to worry that the coming 2028 Olympics could also get the cold shoulder.

""We have a national government who is setting the stage for an environment where we could have a serious boycott,"" Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson said during a committee meeting on the Olympic Games Monday.

John Harper, an executive with private Olympics organizing committee LA28, said that the organization had not discussed the possibility with the International Olympic Committee and that he was not concerned a boycott would take place in 2028.

City Council members did not seem convinced.

""This conversation around FIFA, that's just a forewarning,"" said Councilmember Monica Rodriguez. ""We need to have a Plan B.""

The city of Los Angeles stands to lose if spectators or countries opt out of the 2028 Olympics. L.A. is the financial guarantor of the Games, along with the state of California, and a significant boycott could affect the financial success of the massive sporting event.

""We could be talking about a lot more irreparable harm, financially,"" Rodriguez said.

Fresh concerns about a boycott also come as anxiety in City Hall has been growing about the role the federal government will play at the Games.

The City Council recently passed a motion requesting that LA28 provide more details on the federal Olympics task force on security that Trump announced last year, citing the ICE agents who have descended on the streets of Los Angeles and other U.S. cities

The Olympics have been a frequent arena of political protest over the decades, including in Los Angeles in 1984 when the Soviet Union led a boycott of the Games.

""We never talk about the boycott of '84, but there was a significant boycott,"" Harris-Dawson said Monday. ""It doesn't mean that you can't figure it out, but it also means we have to face it and face it directly.""",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c3bd056/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9504x4990+0+755/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2Ffe%2Fc0d1a9f64bf6b96e1f980dbb7062%2Fa7r09021.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:02.883234

INK LINK ESSAYS

By Arnold Mikolo

I have always believed from the moment I was first exposed to the idea of America that no matter your race, country of origin, religion, or nationality, this nation is a place where you can write your own destiny. That belief is more than an aspiration. It sits at the very core of how the United States was founded on the bedrock principle that we are all created equal.

My journey from the Congo to the United States could only be possible here. Only in this country could someone arrive with little more than hope, determination, and faith in opportunity and begin to build a life. America made my story possible not because it is perfect, but because its promise insists that opportunity belongs to everyone.

That promise aligns deeply with the vision of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Dr. King understood that democracy could not endure if dignity was reserved for only some. That is why he supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which dismantled race-based immigration quotas that favored Northern Europeans while excluding people from Africa, Asia, and much of the Global South. He viewed those quotas as incompatible with American democracy and civil rights. For Dr. King, human dignity did not depend on nationality, accent, or place of birth.

As I reflected on this Martin Luther King Jr. Day, I am struck by how far we have come and how fragile that progress remains. Each year, we gather to recite Dr. King’s words. His speeches are quoted. His dreams are celebrated. His legacy is honored.

Yet too often, those words feel disconnected from our actions.

When I arrived in the United States in 2012, I came through what many now dismiss as ancient history, a green card process that once represented a clear pathway for people seeking opportunity. Today, immigrants are often portrayed as burdens, as takers, or as threats to the very nation they help sustain.

That narrative is not only inaccurate. It is dangerous.

The immigrants I know are hard workers. They come seeking opportunity, not charity. They come because they believe in this country. This nation was built on the backs of enslaved Africans, and it continues to be sustained by farmworkers, caregivers, laborers, service workers, and essential employees, many of whom are immigrants. Our food is grown by immigrant hands. Our economy is strengthened by immigrant labor. Our communities are enriched by immigrant families.

Dr. King understood this truth. He stood in solidarity with migrant workers, supported César Chávez and the United Farm Workers, and rejected fear driven politics that scapegoated the most vulnerable. He believed civil rights and immigrant rights were morally connected, and that justice requires solidarity across race, nationality, and class.

Today, I have the honor of leading one of the largest and oldest civil rights organizations in the United States, the Greater Manchester NAACP. Ten years ago, this was not something I could have imagined. As a young immigrant with an accent, I might have believed I was not qualified or expected to one day help lead such an institution. Yet here I am. In many ways, this is my own I Have a Dream moment.

The NAACP predates Dr. King’s time. With more than 117 years of history, it is an institution built by leaders I admire and consider heroes. It is the same organization Dr. King was a part of and worked through to secure and expand our civil rights. To now stand in that lineage is both humbling and grounding. It forces me to reflect on how far we have come and on the responsibility that comes with progress. I say this with certainty. Only in the United States of America could my story be possible. My story is the American story.

But progress is never permanent.

There is a poem that has stayed with me over the years. First they came for the communists, and I did not speak out because I was not a communist. Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. And when they came for me, there was no one left to speak out for me.

That poem is not simply a warning from history. It is a mirror held up to our present moment.

Today, immigrants are targeted. Asylum seekers are vilified. Communities are divided by language, legal status, and fear. Too often, silence follows because the people being targeted do not look like us, do not speak like us, or do not share our background.

But Dr. King warned us plainly that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.

If we do not stand up when our immigrant neighbors are targeted, when their rights are stripped away, and when families are separated, we weaken the very foundation of civil rights for everyone. Today, it may be your neighbor. Tomorrow it may be you, and there may be no one left to stand up or speak out on your behalf.

Still, I hold on to hope.

When I was young in Congo, during a time of unrest and violence, rebel groups advanced, and communities lived in fear. I do not remember every detail, but I remember this. Neighbors protected one another. When rumors spread that foreigners were being targeted, people stood together. They refused to let anyone be taken. They chose community over fear.

That memory shapes my hope today.

It reminds me that even in moments of uncertainty, we can choose solidarity. We can choose courage. We can choose to protect one another.

As we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day and prepare to enter Black History Month, we must ask ourselves what we will say about this moment five years from now. Will we say we remained silent, or that we stood together? Will we say we allowed fear to divide us, or that we honored Dr. King’s legacy through action?

This is the unfinished work of Dr. King. This is the fight he waged not only for those born here, but for people like me, someone who came to this country with one hundred dollars in his pocket and an unshakable belief in what America could be.

The sun still rises. And with it comes another chance to live up to the promise we so often quote, but must now work together to keep.",https://media-manchester.inklink.news/app/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26075400/mikolo2.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:58:18.113936

The surge of agents to Minneapolis has resulted in waves of protest, legal action, and political backlash against the Trump administration, especially after the shooting deaths of two American citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, at the hands of federal immigration agents.

In an interview with Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters on Monday, Gov. Walz described a ""more collaborative tone"" from Trump, and said the president agreed to consider reducing the number of federal immigration agents in the Twin Cities. He further confirmed that Gregory Bovino, the bombastic and controversial Border Patrol chief leading the surge, will soon leave the state.

Bovino's exit may help to turn down the temperature of protests in Minneapolis, which have been peaceful but fraught in the days since Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, was shot by CBP officers. Bovino repeatedly defended the actions of his officers, saying without evidence that Pretti intended to ""massacre"" federal agents, and that he ""assaulted"" them.

The video evidence and eyewitness accounts that have surfaced so far contradict that assertion. The Trump administration has not provided evidence to support Bovino's claims.

Representatives for the Trump administration told the judge that the letter simply acknowledges the fact that, without sanctuary policies, the federal government would not have to send as many officers into the state.

Maher Tarabishi has been in ICE custody since late October and remains at the Blubonnet Detention Facility in Anson, about 200 miles west of Dallas.

HIs son, 30-year-old Wael Tarabishi, died over the weekend after a month in the ICU at Mansfield Medical Center from complications related to Pompe disease, a rare genetic condition. He had been hospitalized in December for a stomach infection.

According to a news release sent to KERA from the Tarabishi family, Wael became unconscious after his second surgery.

“He passed without his beloved father, primary caregiver and constant life companion, Maher by his side,” read a statement by Tarabishi family on social media.

Maher Tarabishi was detained after his annual check-in at the Dallas ICE Field office on Oct 28. He came to the U.S. from Jordan in1994.

His family is now asking for Maher’s humanitarian release so he can attend his son’s funeral.

Tarabishi’s daughter-in-law, Shahd Arnaout has asked via social media for a call to action for people to reach out to elected officials, to help Maher attend his son’s funeral.

“I feel like this is all on ICE, because if my father-in-law was next to him right now, none of that would happen,” Arnaout told KERA last month.

A statement from the Tarabishi family on social media said they recently found out Maher’s asylum case had been denied because the attorney that filed his original asylum case had been fraudulently practicing law without a license.

It was uncovered during a thorough review of the case following the start of Tarabishi’s current ICE detention, read the statement. The family’s attorney Ali Elhorr filed a motion with the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen the case.

“Like the other victims of this fraudulent attorney, Maher’s immigration case was denied and he was ordered removed based on the asylum application that was filed on his behalf,” the statement read.

In a statement last month, an ICE representative alleged Tarabishi was a “self-admitted member of the Palestine Liberation Organization,” the internationally recognized representative of Palestinians.

The family has called ICE’s allegations “untrue, defamatory claims” to keep Maher from his son during the last moments of his life.

The options include potentially having the House return at the end of the week to approve a modified package of bills to avoid a partial government shutdown should it come to that. The House left Washington last week, expecting the Senate to pass the package of bills this week. Then, a Border Patrol agent shot and killed ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend — significantly changing postures on Capitol Hill.

Aides emphasized that the dynamics fundamentally shifted over the last 72 hours. On Friday, no one was anticipating a government shutdown. By Saturday night, it became clear that there may be little way to avoid one.

The White House and GOP senators have begun initial outreach to Democrats to find a way out of shuttering the major federal agencies by week’s end, according to senior aides, but so far there’s no indication a shutdown crisis will be averted by the January 30 deadline.

Democrats want major changes to how US Immigration and Customs Enforcement is operating as a condition for voting on a funding package that would provide money to major federal agencies, such as the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services.

“Republicans and the White House have reached out but have not yet raised any realistic solutions,” one Senate Democratic leadership aide said.

There are several potential options to avoid a shutdown, including stripping out funding for the Department of Homeland Security and separately moving the rest of the bills. But that would require the consent of all 100 senators after they return to Capitol Hill Tuesday — and would hinge on an agreement being reached by Senate Democrats and the White House, which has said it opposes separating the bills in the package.

Maine Republican Susan Collins, the Senate’s top appropriator, said that removing the DHS bill from the broader package “certainly would not be [her] first choice.”

“I think there might be a way to add some further reforms or procedural protections, but those discussions are ongoing,” she told reporters in the Capitol Monday, adding they would involve Senate Majority Leader John Thune.

Still, Republicans say they are exploring all options as it relates to Democratic demands to strip the DHS bill out of the six-bill appropriations package already passed by the House. A top goal, they say, is to prevent a shutdown of what amounts to 75% of the government’s spending.

For their part, Democrats are trying to coalesce around a single set of demands, but a source familiar with those talks said conversations about what kinds of reforms Democrats will seek as it pertains to DHS are still ongoing. Democratic leaders are still soliciting suggestions and ideas from their members.

A quick compromise between the parties on changes to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be difficult, however. Many Republicans would likely oppose the types of changes to ICE that Democrats are demanding.

Nothing is at all finalized and discussions on next steps are preliminary.

The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Hoagland also notes that Congress is nearly a quarter of the way into the fiscal year, so once lawmakers greenlight the remaining funding, it will not be too long before the appropriations process begins again.

Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown are condemning President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota and say they’re preparing legal options to fight back if a similar operation ramps up in Washington.

At a news conference Monday morning, Ferguson said state officials cannot stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement from operating here.

But he denounced ICE’s tactics — including masked agents snatching people off the streets and breaking into homes without judicial warrants — as “deeply un-American” and “most certainly unconstitutional.”

Ferguson and Brown warned that they’ll be ready to file lawsuits and take other actions to hold the Trump administration — and individual ICE agents — accountable if they violate the rights of people in Washington state.

The news conference at the state Capitol had been scheduled before the weekend killing in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old man who was shot to death by federal immigration agents.

Ferguson and Brown said Pretti’s death, and the dishonest response to it by Trump and his allies, reinforces how dire a spot the country is in.

“The recent events in Minnesota have taken this un-American activity to an entirely different level,” Ferguson said. “Now, they are killing Americans for holding a camera. ICE is, to be blunt, completely and totally out of control.”

Brown said Trump’s deportation actions in Minnesota have only made that state less safe.

“America is weaker because of the operations in Minnesota, and real people all across this country are now traumatized, injured and dead because of this president’s fascist tendencies,” Brown said.

“What we’re seeing right now coming from Washington, D.C., is motivated by hate and bias, and it’s guided by the whims of the president, not the facts, not the courts, and certainly not the United States Constitution,” he said.

King County and the City of Seattle on Monday signed on in support of Minnesota’s lawsuit seeking to halt the massive deployment of immigration agents to the state. Minnesota, in a court hearing Monday morning, argued that the enforcement was a campaign of “retribution” and asked a judge to stop the federal operation.

In an amicus brief joined by dozens of cities and local governments, Seattle and King County wrote that ICE’s surge in Minnesota amounted to “a military occupation of the Twin Cities.”

They argued ICE’s actions exceed the authority granted by the Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

“The presence of militarized, unidentifiable agents is not making our communities safer,” King County Executive Girmay Zahilay said, “and is instead creating chaos and distrust.”

While Ferguson said he had no new information about any Minnesota-like ICE escalation in Washington, he outlined several steps, some that had already been announced, that his office is pursuing to hold ICE accountable.

He urged state lawmakers to quickly pass a bill that would prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks. He said he’s adding the head of the state’s office of immigration assistance to his cabinet meetings and has hired a senior immigration policy adviser.

Ferguson also said he met with Maj. Gen. Gent Welsh, the head of the Washington National Guard, about options for deploying the guard as a “buffer” between federal agents and protesters in the event of a federal ICE escalation here.

He and Brown also rebuked Trump and top administration officials for lying about the Pretti shooting.

Ferguson said he supports people who are tracking ICE activities, pointing to videos that have contradicted the administration’s claims about the Minnesota shooting. He said footage shot by observers is “deeply helpful” in the face of “the lies that came from federal officials.”

Pretti was armed with a pistol, for which he had a legal permit, but video shows he was holding a phone when confronted by agents, who wrestled him to the ground, removed the gun from his hip, and then shot him several times.

His death spurred renewed national protests, including in Seattle, where hundreds took to the streets on Saturday.

Pretti was the second person to be killed by a federal agent in Minneapolis in recent weeks amid major protests over an aggressive immigration crackdown carried out by masked agents.

Renee Good, an unarmed 37-year-old woman, was killed on Jan. 7 as she attempted to drive away from agents in her Honda Pilot.

Trump administration officials have defended the shootings and reportedly moved to block independent investigations into the deaths, asserting that federal agents have broad legal immunity. They’ve also blamed the killings on protesters and on Democratic leaders in Minnesota and nationally.

On Sunday, Trump doubled down on his deportation tactics, demanding that Democratic-led states cooperate with the federal government to “enforce our nation’s laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of division, chaos and violence.”

Ferguson and Brown had initially scheduled Monday’s news conference to respond in large part to a leaked ICE memo that claims its agents do not have to wait for a signed judicial warrant before busting into people’s houses.

Federal immigration officers have asserted they have the power to forcibly enter homes without a judge’s warrant, The Associated Press reported last week, citing an internal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement memo.

The stance is a sharp reversal from longstanding guidance meant to respect the constitutional rights of people during government searches.

The memo says ICE officers can use force, such as breaking down doors, to enter a residence based solely on narrower administrative warrants to arrest someone with a final order of removal.

Bob Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown have issued a strong condemnation of recent federal immigration enforcement actions following the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens in Minnesota.

During a news conference held Monday morning in the Governor’s Conference Room at the Capitol in Olympia, Ferguson described the events as “un-American” and “outrageous in the extreme.”

""ICE is, to be blunt, completely and totally out of control,"" Ferguson said.

The controversy stems from the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, and Renee Good, also 37, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis in January.

These incidents have sparked national outrage and protests, including in Washington.

""We are focused on preparing, to the fullest extent possible, for a similar escalation by ICE, against our will, here in Washington state,"" the governor stated during the conference.

Ferguson further emphasized the need for political and community preparedness against potential escalations by ICE in Washington state.

""I cannot stop ICE from being in our state,"" he said. ""But we are not passive bystanders. We are prepared to use every tool at our disposal to mitigate against the harm inflicted by ICE,"" said Ferguson, ""And if ICE escalates their presence in our state, we will need even more Washingtonians to step up and help.""

Attorney General Nick Brown said public reporting is essential and pointed to the counter-narrative after the fatal shooting death of Pretti. The Department of Homeland Security said border agents acted in self-defense, but conflicting accounts from eyewitnesses, video evidence, and local politicians have called that narrative into question.

""My concern is an individual might hear this rhetoric from the governor and decide to physically confront a federal law enforcement agent in the midst of executing an immigration warrant, and that's when people get shot,"" said Republican State Rep. and WAGOP Chair Jim Walsh.

He called the Monday news conference 'troubling' concerning the governor's comments on immigration. ""And some of these tracks back to his social media posts of the last few days, where he was encouraging people to get active and not sit there, and calling authoritarian drift in our public policy. This is inflammatory language,"" Walsh said.

He also challenged the Governor and Attorney General, calling out what they describe as an unconstitutional memo from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that directs ICE agents to use force to enter homes without judicial warrants.

""They've always been able to operate with an admit what's called an administrative warrant. Now you can argue on the fine points of law here, but that is not a new thing,"" said the GOP Chair.

In the joint news conference, Ferguson went on to outline five steps the government is taking to counter federal immigration enforcement:

Criticizing the internal memo instruction ICE agents to enter homes without a warrant, Ferguson said he and AG Brown sent a letter to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem outlining how that memo is unconstitutional. The letter states that if ICE attempts any such unconstitutional actions in Washington, the state government would use every legal option available to fight the federal government.

The Chief of the Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will begin attending Ferguson's cabinet meetings to optimize responding to threats against immigrants. And the recent hiring of a senior advisor to work specifically on immigrant and refugee policy issues.

Mentioning Minnesota Gov. Walz's deployment of the National Guard in response to the killing of Pretti, Ferguson said he will take ""whatever steps are necessary"" to keep Washingtonians safe.

State and local partners are having ongoing conversations to coordinate tools and response plans.

Ferguson has asked that Senate Bill 5855, which would restrict when law enforcement officers can cover their faces while interacting with the public, be expedited in the legislature.

Ferguson also said he, Brown, and the state government would also legally push to hold individual ICE agents accountable.

Senate Bill 5855 would prohibit local, state, and federal officers — including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — from wearing masks that obscure their identities, with limited exceptions for undercover work and certain tactical operations. Supporters argue the measure is needed to ensure accountability and public trust, particularly following reports of masked immigration enforcement actions, while opponents argue it would endanger law enforcement officers.

“This weekend in Minneapolis, the United States government shot and killed Alex Pretti—an ICU nurse with no prior criminal history who was observing and documenting an interaction between federal officers and local residents. His last act was taking care of a woman who had been pushed to the ground by federal agents. Alarmingly, the agents who shot Mr. Pretti have not been put on leave, and it is unclear whether a thorough and transparent investigation will take place—signaling that federal officers would be acting with impunity, and denying Mr. Pretti’s family access to justice or appropriate reparations.

“To be clear, Mr. Pretti was legally and peacefully exercising both his First and Second Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. He was working to promote and protect human rights while taking actions that are specifically protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights—the latter of which is the Supreme Law of the Land under Article VI, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution.

“As Co-Chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, named in honor of the only Holocaust survivor to ever serve in Congress, I call on governments and human rights leaders around the world to continue speaking out and sounding the alarm about what is going on in the United States. I call upon all relevant UN bodies, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and global human rights organizations and defenders to forcefully condemn Mr. Pretti's death and demand an immediate and impartial investigation.

“The United States should welcome such scrutiny—any government that claims legitimacy must be willing to be judged by the same standards it invokes against others.

Here are some takeaways from the hearing: Minnesota officials pushed for immediate action.
The state has not sought an end to all immigration enforcement in Minnesota, only a return to the levels seen before the surge.
Mr. Mayers, the federal government’s lawyer, argued that immigration agents were “here enforcing federal law” and were acting within their authority.
Judge Menendez noted that the state of Minnesota “has one set of values” around immigration enforcement, and the Trump administration has another.","A federal judge in Minnesota asked a lawyer for the Trump administration on Monday whether the surge of federal officers to the state was really just about immigration enforcement, or whether it might also be motivated by political retribution and coercion.

But the judge, Kate M. Menendez of the Federal District Court, also had pointed questions about the state government’s request that she issue a sweeping order blocking the surge of agents.

Minnesota, along with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, filed a lawsuit two weeks ago claiming that the Trump administration’s campaign, called Operation Metro Surge, violates state sovereignty under the 10th Amendment and should be blocked. The surge has brought some 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, resulting in thousands of arrests, three shootings and tense protests.

Judge Menendez, who was nominated to the bench by former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., did not rule from the bench on Monday and did not provide a timeline for issuing a written decision. She indicated that she would move quickly.

“If I had a burner in front of the front burner, this would be on it,” the judge said as the hearing ended.

Here are some takeaways from the hearing:

Minnesota officials pushed for immediate action.

For two weeks, lawyers for the state and the cities have pressed Judge Menendez to immediately issue a temporary restraining order blocking the surge. But the judge has moved more slowly, giving the Trump administration time to reply to the lawsuit in writing, and then scheduling oral arguments.

Since her first hearing on the case, federal agents have shot two people in Minneapolis, including the nonfatal shooting of a Venezuelan man accused of resisting arrest and the killing on Saturday of Alex Pretti, a U.S. citizen and nurse. An earlier fatal shooting, of Renee Good, also a U.S. citizen, took place days before the suit was filed.

Lindsey Middlecamp, a lawyer for the state, reiterated the call for swift action on Monday, asking the judge to stop what she called an “invasion” of federal agents. She called on the judge to “issue a temporary restraining order today. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Today.”

Sara Lathrop, a lawyer for the city of Minneapolis, said on Monday that the events over the weekend showed that the “situation is absolutely untenable.”

But Brantley Mayers, a lawyer for the Trump administration, described the request for an order blocking the surge as “a pretty staggering remedy.”

Judge Menendez asked where the line should be.

Judge Menendez said in court that “I think it goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times.” But she pressed lawyers for the state to explain when, in its view, the federal government deploying federal agents to enforce federal law could become a constitutional affront.

“How do I decide when a law enforcement response crosses the line from a legitimate law enforcement response to a response that violates the 10th Amendment?” the judge asked.

The state has not sought an end to all immigration enforcement in Minnesota, only a return to the levels seen before the surge. But its lawyers were reluctant to provide a specific number of agents or amount of enforcement that they believed tipped the scales into unconstitutional behavior.

“This is so far beyond the pale of legality,” said one of the state’s lawyers, Brian Carter.

The judge also expressed some concern about the sweeping nature of the lawsuit, and asked whether some of the claims of unconstitutional behavior might be better addressed through separate, more focused lawsuits, like one she is hearing on agents’ actions toward protesters.

“It seems that part of the solution for this set of wrongs that you describe is to bring cases about those wrongs,” Judge Menendez said, “rather than to say all of these things together means the federal government has to leave the state of Minnesota.”

The Trump administration defended the surge.

Mr. Mayers, the federal government’s lawyer, argued that immigration agents were “here enforcing federal law” and were acting within their authority.

He noted that Congress had passed immigration laws and that President Trump had campaigned on a promise to crack down on illegal immigration. Judge Menendez said that might be true broadly, but that the surge of thousands of “troops to the state of Minnesota has not been vetted in any democratic forge, so to speak.”

Mr. Mayers said the administration had found that Minnesota officials were not doing enough to help with immigration enforcement, and that more federal enforcement was needed “to address the law enforcement vacuum.”

Mr. Mayers argued that was not allowable for a state “to use the 10th Amendment as both a sword and a shield.” His point was that Minnesota officials were choosing not to cooperate with aspects of federal immigration enforcement, and then also objecting when the federal government decided to devote more resources to that issue in the state.

Judge Menendez noted that the state of Minnesota “has one set of values” around immigration enforcement, and the Trump administration has another. She told a lawyer for the state that “we’re at risk of asking me to decide who’s right there.”

The judge asked about possible ulterior motives.

State and city officials claimed that the motives for Operation Metro Surge reached beyond immigration enforcement and were part of a broader campaign of payback against the president’s perceived political enemies.

Mr. Carter said that “it is personal animosity, it is retribution” that was motivating the Trump administration’s campaign in Minnesota. He also accused the administration of trying to strong-arm the state into changing its policies on immigration.

“The federal government is attempting to bend the state’s will to its own,” Mr. Carter said, “and that is not allowed under the Constitution.”

Judge Menendez referred to a social media post by President Trump that mentioned Minnesota and said “THE DAY OF RECKONING & RETRIBUTION IS COMING!” She also asked repeatedly about a letter sent over the weekend by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Gov. Tim Walz that outlined several policy demands for the state related to immigration enforcement, welfare programs and a request to hand over voter rolls.

Ms. Middlecamp, a lawyer for the state, had referred to Ms. Bondi’s letter as “a ransom note.”

Pressed on those issues, Mr. Mayers, the federal government’s lawyer, insisted the operation was about enforcing immigration laws.

“There is nothing to back up this claim that we’re here for another reason,” he said.

There is limited precedent.

While other states have brought 10th Amendment lawsuits against the federal government over the years, lawyers for both sides struggled to find direct parallels for the claims being made in this case.

Mr. Carter said that “this situation is unprecedented in the 250-year history of our country.” He claimed the deployment of immigration agents — which he called “essentially an army” — was intended to “basically stir the pot with conduct that is pervasive and includes widespread illegal violent conduct.”

Mr. Mayers countered that it was well within the president’s rights to deploy federal law enforcement agents within the country as he saw fit.

Fred Smith Jr., a Stanford law professor, said in an interview that Minnesota’s lawsuit “makes novel claims,” but that the “central government is doing novel things, and so there’s not a lot of precedent.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26minneapolis-ice-gun-fplk/26minneapolis-ice-gun-fplk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 19:57:51.296906

On that note, when does a federal law enforcement response cross the line and violate the 10th Amendment?
This is essentially asking a federal judge to sift into different buckets that which is federal power and that which is state power.
And I can say there’s not a lot of case law on this issue.
In the 10th Amendment argument, one of the arguments that Minnesota has made is the equal sovereignty principle.","A federal judge heard arguments on Jan. 26, 2026, as the state of Minnesota sought a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operation in the state. The administration has sent some 3,000 immigration agents to Minnesota, and attorneys for the state have argued, in part, that it amounts to an unconstitutional occupation, on 10th Amendment grounds. Alfonso Serrano, a politics editor at The Conversation U.S., spoke with Andrea Katz, a law scholar at Washington University in St. Louis, about the Minnesota lawsuit and its possible legal implications.

What’s the legal issue at stake in this court case?

In Minnesota v. Noem, attorneys for the state are arguing that the federal government is acting illegally by intruding on a sphere of state power (the police power). They’re claiming violations of the 10th Amendment, which is this idea that under the U.S. Constitution, states are reserved powers that existed before the Constitution was drafted, powers that are not delegated to the federal government.

They’re also making this rather new claim under what’s called the equal sovereignty principle, which is that states all have to be treated equally by the federal government. There’s also a First Amendment claim, and an Administrative Procedure Act claim, which is that the government is acting illegally in an arbitrary and capricious way. I think the 10th Amendment arguments are ones that I would say are kind of unprecedented, rather untested waters.

On that note, when does a federal law enforcement response cross the line and violate the 10th Amendment? Is there precedent for this?

The question you just posed is one that the district judge, Kate M. Menendez, seems to be nervous about having to hear. This is essentially asking a federal judge to sift into different buckets that which is federal power and that which is state power. And I can say there’s not a lot of case law on this issue.

The most filled-out doctrine under the 10th Amendment is the anti-commandeering doctrine. It holds that the federal government cannot use the state government as a sort of puppet. The federal government can’t use state officers forcibly against the state’s will to enforce the law. Now that is not, strictly speaking, what’s going on here, because Minnesota is complaining about the presence of federal agents enforcing the laws in ways that it thinks are illegal.

And so it seems to me that the 10th Amendment has been most developed in this area that Minnesota is not touching on, and so for that reason, I think their invocation of it is pretty unusual. They’re essentially claiming that the 10th Amendment protects their police powers and that the federal government is intruding on that. I think that’s a novel argument in court, and my suspicion is that it is not likely to be a winning argument in court.

The Trump administration has dismissed the state’s legal theory, saying the president is acting within his authority, correct?

Yeah, I think that’s correct. Again, I want to make clear that Minnesota has made many arguments against the Trump administration, and I’m just focusing on the merits of this 10th Amendment argument.

There was a sort of undeveloped strand of cases in the mid-20th century where the Supreme Court tried to develop this idea of core state powers. And so it said the federal government couldn’t act in a way that violated a state’s core powers, like where to put your state capital, or control over natural resources, or defining salaries for state government employees. The court said these are core state powers.

But then in a famous case called Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, in 1985, the court overruled itself and said – and this is still where we are – federal courts cannot be in the business of defining what constitutes a core state power. It’s too open-ended, undefined. It’s a political inquiry. It’s not something that’s appropriate for a judge.

And so I think on this 10th Amendment argument, Minnesota is essentially asking the courts to revive this core state powers doctrine, which I think the court is unlikely to do.

What repercussions could the judge’s ruling have?

Minnesota has already filed, in a case called Tincher v. Noem, a more conventional set of claims, which is that ICE agents broke the law, are violating rights, acting in excess of their authority. They have already gotten preliminary relief on this first set of claims, although Judge Menendez’s order is now on hold, pending appeal before the 8th Circuit court.

That is different from this 10th Amendment claim. In the 10th Amendment argument, one of the arguments that Minnesota has made is the equal sovereignty principle. The equal sovereignty principle was articulated in the 2013 case, Shelby County v. Holder. This is the famous case where the Supreme Court struck down an important part of the Voting Rights Act that prevented Southern states from restricting the vote, apparently on the basis of race. In Shelby County, the court said that the Voting Rights Act, which subjected certain states with a pattern of racial discrimination on the vote to a preclearance process where the federal government had to approve their laws before they passed them, treated different states differently.

Of course, in that case, the federal government said those are states that have a history of discrimination, so the federal government was justified in treating them differently.

But Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the Shelby County opinion, said the 10th Amendment means that the government can’t treat different states differently.

Now it’s not a well-regarded doctrine, so it’s kind of shocking that Minnesota is invoking it here. For one reason, the equal sovereignty principle has not been well developed since Shelby County. The second reason it would be a big deal – quite shocking to me, if the judge enforced it – is that Shelby County was talking about legislation that treated different states differently.

If we pass a rule where the executive branch can’t treat different states differently, you’re essentially denying the existence of discretion in enforcement, which is very quintessentially an executive power, right?

It could, for example, lead to states saying that federal agents can’t come in to help people in a natural disaster. So again, I think this argument, like the rest of the 10th Amendment arguments, suffers from being undeveloped in the case law and potentially carrying a risk of kneecapping the federal government’s ability to enforce the law, which sometimes does, for totally good-faith reasons, require treating different states differently.

Any final thoughts?

The first Trump administration was highly disorganized and didn’t take concerted action for a while. The second Trump administration was the precise opposite of that. They acted quickly and in a very organized fashion, pushing power as far as it can go in a number of agencies.

And I think the question this gets back to is how the federal courts have reacted to this barrage of executive orders, of new applications of old laws, of new forms of government power exercised in a way that threatens federalism.

The federal courts usually grant deference to the president when the government issues statements in the context of litigation. Court doctrine is to defer to those statements as being entitled. It’s a presumption of regularity, of accuracy. And I think we’re already seeing in the district courts some suspicion by the judges of the government’s version of things.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/714482/original/file-20260126-56-x6kals.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C250%2C3000%2C1500&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-26 18:58:30.753466

Frey said he asked Trump in a phone call to end the immigration enforcement surge and that Trump agreed the present situation cannot continue.

Frey said while some agents will begin leaving Tuesday, he will keep pushing for others involved in Operation Metro Surge to go.

Trump posted on social media that he had a good conversation with Frey. ""Lots of progress is being made!"" he wrote.

Among the agents who are expected to depart was senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.

Bovino has been at the centre of the administration's aggressive enforcement surge in cities nationwide. His departure marks a significant public shift in federal law enforcement posture amid mounting outrage over the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents.

Earlier in the day, Trump said he ordered his border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to oversee the immigration crackdown there.

Bovino's leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.

Criticism has increased around Bovino in the last few days after his public defence of the Pretti shooting and disputed claims about the confrontation that led to his death.

Trump speaks to the governor

Trump and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz also spoke by phone earlier Monday and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they have exchanged in the past, with Trump declaring in a social media post that he is now on a ""similar wavelength"" as the governor.

Walz, in a statement, said the call was ""productive"" and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for ""any and all"" criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honours federal requests for people in its custody.

The two conversations came the same day a federal judge heard arguments in a lawsuit aimed at halting the federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

Attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul appeared Monday before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant requests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.

She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Judge Menendez questioned the government's motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

""I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?"" Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Video contradicts Trump administration accounts of shooting

The president's decision to send Tom Homan to Minneapolis came after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Bovino led contentious news conferences over the weekend about the fatal shooting on Saturday of Alex Pretti.

Both officials defended the actions of Border Patrol agents almost immediately, instead of waiting for an investigation to play out.

Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired ""defensively"" against Pretti as he ""approached"" them with a gun. While Pretti was armed, he was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, and may have been properly following state laws on carrying weapons.

Pretti appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos of the moments before his killing.

3 investigations underway

Asked during a briefing Monday if Noem had made a mistake that led Trump to send Homan to Minnesota, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said no.

She said that Homan ""is in a unique position to drop everything and go to Minnesota to continue having these productive conversations with state and local officials."" Homan would be ""catching a plane in just a few hours to do just that, at the at the request of the president,"" Leavitt said.

The Press Secretary said the shooting and killing of Pretti ""occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota.""

The White House continues to say that resistance to Trump's agenda is what led to the shootings and killings of Pretti and Renee Good after ICE agents have engaged in aggressive operations in Minnesota.

Both Pretti and Renee Good, fatally shot on Jan. 7, were bystanders who were not targets of federal operations.

Leavitt said that a trio of ""active investigations"" and internal probes of the shooting were underway by federal agencies. Leavitt said that the Department of Homeland Security and FBI were investigating the shooting and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was ""conducting their own internal review.""

State, cities update suit against DHS

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Good was shot and killed by an ICE officer.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request in an effort to restore the order that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota on Dec. 1.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to the Pretti shooting.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul, Minn.

The unrest, largely in Minneapolis-St. Paul, could have political ramifications that affect Americans outside of the state. Democratic anger over the tactics of the immigration blitz have led many of the party's senators to oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, a stand that increases the prospect of a partial government shutdown by the end of the week.

Six of the 12 annual spending bills for the current budget year have been signed into law by the president. Six more are awaiting action in the Senate, and if senators fail to act by midnight Friday, funding for Homeland Security and the other agencies covered under the six bills will lapse.

Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada accused Noem of attempting to ""mislead the American public"" and said she ""must be impeached and removed from office immediately.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/5c558f2b-6956-455d-b173-5deab04364bd,1769442166620/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C5675%2C3192%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2026-01-26 19:57:54.870604

Trump and Democratic

Gov. Tim Walz spoke in a phone call and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they have exchanged in the past. Their conversation happened on the same day a federal judge heard arguments in a lawsuit aimed at halting the federal immigration enforcement surge in the state.

“We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president wrote in a social media post.

Walz, in a statement, said the call was “productive” and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for “any and all” criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honors federal requests for people in its custody.

It was unclear whether the new tone would lead to changes. Attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul appeared Monday before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant requests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.

She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued the situation on the street is so dire it requires the court to halt the federal government’s enforcement actions.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

The judge questioned the government’s motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

“I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?” Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Brantley Mayers, a Justice Department attorney, said the government’s goal is to enforce federal law. Mayers said one lawful action should not be used to discredit another lawful action.

“I don’t see how the fact that we’re also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge,” Mayers said.

Menendez questioned where the line was between violating the Constitution and the executive’s power to enforce the law. She also asked whether she was being asked to decide between state and federal policies.

“That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,” she said.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

“I can’t be the global keeper of all things here. Like, presumably that will be litigated,” she said to the state’s attorney.

Menendez made it clear that she was struggling with how to rule because the case is so unusual, and there are few precedents.

“It’s because this is important that I’m doing everything I can to get it right,” she said.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday added urgency to the case.

Border czar to Minnesota

In other developments, Trump said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. The president’s statement came after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the public face of the crackdown, answered questions at news conferences over the weekend about Pretti’s shooting. Trump posted on social media that Homan will report directly to him.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan would be “the main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis” during continued operations by federal immigration officers.

In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Other state implications

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

“If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,” the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday’s shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti’s killing.

The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday’s shooting. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

Hotel where federal agents believed to be was targeted

On Sunday night, protesters targeted a Minneapolis hotel where federal agents were believed to be staying, blocking a major avenue on the edge of the University of Minnesota campus.

A freelance photographer working for The Associated Press saw smashed glass in the hotel lobby, as well as graffiti with obscenities and threats directed at ICE.

A Minneapolis police officer was inside the hotel and tried to provide aid to a federal agent who was injured. More officers from local and state agencies planned to move in to “deescalate the situation, and make arrests,” Minneapolis police said Monday in a statement.

But as they began to reach the scene and arrested two people, federal agents arrived and “deployed chemical munitions,” the police statement said. A DHS spokesperson said a statement on the situation would be provided later Monday.

At a Minneapolis hearing on their request to temporarily suspend the deployment of several thousand additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents to the state, Minnesota attorneys called the federal escalation “unprecedented” and destructive.

They called for an immediate ruling from U.S. District Judge Katherine M. Menendez to prevent any further harm to the state.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” said Assistant Minnesota Attorney General Brian Carter.

“What we have is a federal operation that is designed to cause havoc, that is designed to cause the local governments to experience pain, that is designed to cause the state of Minnesota to have to expend its resources,” he later argued, calling use of force in Minneapolis “jaw-dropping.”

Monday’s hearing comes after the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents of an anti-ICE protester in Minnesota since the beginning of “Operation Metro Surge” last month. On Saturday, immigration agents shot to death 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. On Jan. 7, an agent fatally shot Renee Good, 37.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and city attorneys have argued the crackdown is not just leading to deaths and civil rights violations, but harm to public safety, health and education in the state, as well as its businesses. They noted reports of random detainments based on racial profiling.

Administration lawyers cite lack of local cooperation

Attorneys representing the Trump administration argued the purpose of the operation, which has brought roughly 4,000 immigration enforcement agents to the state, is a response to a lack of cooperation from local officials.

They claim that the state and counties have failed to turn over people in custody for crimes who are in the U.S. illegally — something the state Department of Corrections denies. ICE has claimed there are more than 1,300 people with immigration arrest detainers in Minnesota custody. The DOC counted just 94 in the state’s county jails.

“We are here because of this law enforcement vacuum,” Justice Department attorney Brantley Mayers told Menendez when questioned about the purpose of the crackdown. Attorneys representing the federal government have characterized the state and local challenges as an attempt to thwart law enforcement and impede their federal duties.

Letter from Pam Bondi

Lawyers for the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office said a Saturday letter from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi demanding the state comply with immigration enforcement and turn over welfare and immigration data shows that a central purpose of “Operation Metro Surge” is coercion.

“Attorney General Pam Bondi sent what can only be described as a ransom note setting out the terms on which the federal government is holding Minnesota’s public safety, public health and public education hostage,” said Lindsey Middlecamp, an attorney with Ellison’s office.

Federal access to voter and welfare data are both subject to ongoing litigation, and attorneys with the state argued the Trump administration was using its power to gain concessions from the state when it had failed to do so through legal channels.

Menendez said that although the country is in “shockingly unusual times,” she was wary of wading into what could be seen as an immigration policy disagreement between state and federal authorities, noting that the unprecedented nature of the situation did not necessarily mean she could “craft a remedy.”

She also questioned whether it was her role to control all aspects of the dispute over federal immigration action in Minneapolis with numerous lawsuits seeking to challenge various aspects of the enforcement surge.

Judge did not say when she would rule

Earlier this month, Menendez ruled that federal agents couldn’t detain peaceful protesters or use tear gas on them, though that ruling was later suspended by an appeals court.

The matter before the court on Monday was not the lawsuit itself, but a decision on whether immigration operations should be suspended pending a final decision on the case.

Menendez, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2021, did not say when she would rule, but said the matter was a high priority.

Even users in r/massivecock, where most of the posts are images of erect penises, railed against ICE in their captions.
“I think it’s just like this awareness of the level of injustice taking place,” said the r/Minneapolis moderator, adding that people outside the state are increasingly worried about being targeted by ICE.
The popular backlash against ICE over killing Pretti extends well beyond Reddit and other social media platforms.
But the horror of what is happening makes it harder to compartmentalize elsewhere on the platform, this r/Minneapolis moderator thinks, leading to more people in other subreddits posting about ICE.","On Saturday morning, a Reddit user who has posted about living in Minneapolis for years shared a video on the city’s subreddit, r/Minneapolis, with the title “Another ICE murder in front of Glam Doll Donuts.”

The 40-second clip showed a group of federal agents tackling 37-year-old Alex Pretti to the ground and beating him. About 20 seconds in, one of them begins shooting Pretti. At least 10 gunshots go off, from multiple agents, and a person can be heard yelling “Did they fucking kill that guy? Are you fucking kidding me dude? Not again.” (The agents who fired on Pretti have not been charged, nor has ICE agent Jonathan Ross, who shot and killed Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good on January 7. They have been moved to “other locations,” according to CBP official Greg Bovino.)

The video was upvoted more than 60,000 times, reaching the top of Reddit’s homepage.

Over the past month, as the Department of Homeland Security has deployed thousands of armed, masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Minnesota’s Twin Cities, the r/Minneapolis subreddit has become a vital news and information hub for both residents and outsiders.

Previously, the user who shared the shooting footage posted about a missing dog poster and about trees being cut down near a local lake. “I just wanted a local subreddit to know what was happening in my city, and now all of a sudden, we’ve turned into this de facto hub of information for basically how to fight fascism,” says one r/Minneapolis moderator, who has been in the volunteer position for close to a decade and spoke on the condition of anonymity due to safety concerns.

For many of the longtime r/Minneapolis users, ICE agents have occupied their backyards. But even outside of the local Minnesota subreddits, rage against ICE has reached a boiling point. A majority of posts in r/all, where top posts across all subreddits are ranked, was devoted Saturday and Sunday to mocking and criticizing ICE for killing Pretti.

In the Reddit community for cross stitching, the top post this weekend was a “Fuck Ice” embroidery, and there were multiple variations of the same slogan in the stained glass subreddit, too. “FUCK ICE” was painted on an acrylic set in a nail polish subreddit, where other users offered dupes to get the look of a woman’s bright pink nails in a picture where her hand was pressed against a prominent right-wing influencer’s face during a downtown Minneapolis clash.

When the moderator of camera subreddit r/Leica prohibited “partisan comments” on photos of ICE officers in Minneapolis, a user wrote “HATE the censorship of this sub.” (Photojournalist John Abernathy—who went viral after tossing his camera to another photographer while being tackled by ICE agents.) Even users in r/massivecock, where most of the posts are images of erect penises, railed against ICE in their captions.

“I think it’s just like this awareness of the level of injustice taking place,” said the r/Minneapolis moderator, adding that people outside the state are increasingly worried about being targeted by ICE. “They’re testing things here. They’re coming for you next.”

Americans have become significantly more in favor of abolishing ICE since Donald Trump’s second administration began unprecedented raids of blue cities.

Before the 2024 election, polling showed only around 1 in 4 people surveyed supported abolishing ICE—now, the same polls show 43 percent support it. Anger has peaked over ICE’s brutal occupation of Minneapolis, especially after officer Ross killed 37-year-old Good. After agents killed Pretti, even people who rarely share positive sentiments about Minneapolis, like fans of competing football teams in Minnesota, Chicago, Detroit, and Green Bay, are increasingly protesting ICE in their shared subreddit. “The ruling on the field is that this is a meme football sub,” said one of the top posts this weekend in r/NFCNorthMemeWar. “HOWEVER … FUCK ICE and fuck any bootlicker who supports them.”

Even the moderator of r/catbongos, a subreddit for playfully patting your cat like you’re playing the bongos, posted an anti-ICE screed—and it quickly became the subreddit’s most-upvoted post ever. “The nice thing about owning a subreddit is I can use it as my personal soapbox, so after the blatant murder by ICE today in Minnesota, I wanted to say something,” the post, titled “If you still support Trump/ICE even slightly, you're not welcome in this sub,” began. “We are reaching a point where we can no longer tolerate the people who are supporting or making excuses for this, or have them be a part of our lives.” Many of the top replies to the post said they were joining r/catbongos because of it.

The popular backlash against ICE over killing Pretti extends well beyond Reddit and other social media platforms. Even Republican House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer suggested that Trump should pull ICE out of Minneapolis, while Fox News host Maria Bartiromo said there was no evidence Pretti was threatening law enforcement, and a guest on the channel said that the White House misrepresented the facts of the shooting. Plus, since Pretti was carrying a concealed gun, the National Rifle Association and other gun advocacy groups that are usually pro-Trump have called for a full investigation—while the subreddit for concealed-carry weapons lambasted Trump’s posts about Pretti’s setup.

The longtime r/Minneapolis moderator is reminded of what happened after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd roughly 17 blocks away from where Pretti was shot, inspiring the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement. Both times, the subreddit became a front line for news, on-the-ground footage, community resources, and supporters from around the world. She and her fellow moderators work “easily 20 hours a week,” unpaid, to keep up at peak times. They respond to reports and messages, weed out duplicate posts of the same videos, and guard the subreddit from agitators and trolls.

“We’re filtering the comments, we’re banning problematic users before they can really spread out and go into multiple threads and harass multiple people,” the moderator says. “You are literally dealing with the worst types of people ... They’re trying to misrepresent what happened or just straight up make fun of them. They find it funny.”

Another r/Minneapolis moderator who spoke to WIRED on the condition of anonymity started volunteering around a month ago, as activity on the subreddit was ramping up. He has had to force himself to take a break after spending hours staring at screenshots of the moment when Pretti was shot. To prevent users from seeing something graphic they may not want to, the moderators require these posts to have a NSFW (not safe for work) or “spoiler” filter. But the horror of what is happening makes it harder to compartmentalize elsewhere on the platform, this r/Minneapolis moderator thinks, leading to more people in other subreddits posting about ICE.

“Logically you’re like ‘Yeah, of course, people wouldn’t post political stuff there,’ but the people who are moderating and using these communities are people and they’re still seeing that content in other places and they’re still wrestling with the moral questions of this time,” he says. “And if that means they’re going to do it in ‘catbongos’ or some ‘not safe for work’ sub, that’s where they’re going to do it.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/6977407f4869b26615030c5f/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/012626_Reddit_ICE.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 18:58:22.095643

Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill last fall, demanding that the GOP include an extension to expiring Obamacare tax credits.","WASHINGTON — Most of the federal government could shut down at the end of the week. But that likely wouldn’t halt aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol operations in Minneapolis and other parts of the country.

Democrats are up in arms after a Border Patrol agent fatally shot Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis over the weekend. That came after an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, another Minneapolis resident and citizen, in her car earlier this month.

Under enormous pressure from the base, Senate Democrats have vowed to block a sweeping government funding bill unless significant restrictions are imposed on the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

With Republicans plowing ahead with a vote on the House-passed $1.2 trillion funding package later this week, a partial shutdown beginning Saturday now seems increasingly likely. Money is set to run out for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, and many other critical agencies late Friday night.

Yet, even if Democrats shut down the government, ICE operations aren't likely to be hindered in any meaningful way. Under DHS' shutdown plan, a GOP leadership source said, ICE employees would be considered ""excepted"" workers and required to continue showing up to work, though they, like other workers, would not get paid.

On top of that, even in a shutdown, ICE would continue to have ample funding since the agency received $75 billion of additional money for detention and enforcement from President Donald Trump’s ""big, beautiful bill"" last year, the GOP source noted.

The source also argued that if DHS is funded through yet another stopgap measure, known as a continuing resolution or ""CR,"" it would have more flexibility to move money around within the agency to support ICE operations than it would under the massive funding bill at issue.

Even though she voted against the DHS funding bill in the House, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, which wrote the funding bill, made many of those same arguments upon unveiling the bipartisan legislation last week.

""ICE received $75 billion in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In the event of a lapse in funding, ICE would be able to sustain regular operations for multiple years, while the other agencies under this bill would likely be forced to furlough workers and reduce operations,"" DeLauro's office explained.

""A continuing resolution would extend funding for ICE enforcement and removal operations at their current level, instead of reducing it by $115 million, and would exclude new guardrails contained in this full-year funding measure,"" her office said.

While DeLauro noted the negotiated funding deal did not include broad reforms to ICE, it would keep ICE funding flat for the remainder of the fiscal year, which runs until Oct. 1. It also would reduce the number of ICE detention beds by 5,500 and include $20 million for body cameras for ICE agents. (DHS is reviewing footage from multiple body-worn cameras in Pretti's killing, sources told NBC News on Monday.)

Congress has already passed, and Trump has signed into law, six out of the 12 full-year appropriations bills, meaning that some agencies are funded through Sept. 30. That includes funding for the departments of Justice, Commerce, Agriculture, Interior and Veterans Affairs, as well as the legislative branch. The Smithsonian museums and national parks would remain open since they get their funding through Interior appropriations. SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, also would not be affected by a shutdown.

But the other six appropriations bills not yet passed by Congress account for $1.2 trillion in federal spending, or nearly 80% of the total amount Congress plans to appropriate for the 2026 fiscal year. The majority of that funding is for the Defense Department ($831 billion).

Because the House packaged those six remaining funding bills together and sent them to the Senate, a shutdown would affect many important agencies.

In addition to the Pentagon and DHS, they include the departments of State, Treasury, Transportation, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development.

Shutting down DHS — one of the most sprawling agencies in the government — would mean that Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration and Coast Guard employees would not be paid, even as they'd be required to work.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Monday that Democrats are willing to pass the five other appropriations bills if they are separated from the DHS funding bill. But Republicans see no incentive to go that route, believing Democrats will be blamed for voting down a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that was already agreed to by Democratic negotiators.

If the government funding lapses at the end of the week, it would mark the second federal shutdown in four months during Trump's second term in office. Senate Democrats blocked a funding bill last fall, demanding that the GOP include an extension to expiring Obamacare tax credits.

That shut the government down for 43 days — the longest shutdown in U.S. history.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260126-federal-agents-minneapolis-ew-1229p-d21bd0.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 18:57:58.706563

Texas Democrats condemn the shooting

In his first public comments on ICE since Saturday's shooting, Houston Mayor John Whitmire said his administration is ""handling that immigration issue as responsible as humanly possible [sic],"" saying other major American cities are ""in turmoil.""

""Start naming the major cities in America, they're all in turmoil, they're out on the street,"" Whitmire said on Hello Houston. ""And there's a tragedy in Minneapolis, I understand that. But for Houston to start throwing things and words at them would just draw attention to us that we don't want.""

State Rep. Gina Hinojosa, D-Austin, who is running for governor, condemned the shooting and ICE's operation in Minneapolis entirely in a statement on X on Saturday.

""Another American has been shot and killed in the street by ICE in MN,"" she wrote in a statement. ""Children are being torn from their homes and sent to taxpayer-funded private prisons in TX run by Abbott's donors. They use cruelty to mask the corruption and no one is safe. This inhumanity has to stop.""

U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett and State Rep. James Talarico, who are both seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, spoke about the ICE operations in a debate on Saturday, hours after the shooting.

Crockett highlighted her vote against funding the federal agency and her support for impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

""There was no way I was going to continue to pump a historic amount of money into this rogue organization,"" Crockett said, referring to ICE, ""that is going out and is violating people's rights every single day on American cities. I was just not going to do it at the end of the day. Right now, I think that we need to clean house from top to bottom.""

Talarico likewise said he supported impeaching Noem as well as holding individual ICE agents responsible for any violations of the law. When pressed, he came closer to saying that he would vote to defund ICE.

""We need to prosecute agents who have abused their power. We have to haul these masked men before Congress so the world can see their faces,"" Talarico said. ""We have seen this historic increase in funding for ICE. That money has come out of our health care. So, what I would say is that we should take that money back and put it in our communities where it belongs.""

Thus far, eight members of Texas' House Democratic Caucus are backing a resolution calling for the impeachment of Noem, largely as a result of ICE's operations. Including Crockett, those members of Congress are Julie Johnson of Farmers Branch, Lloyd Doggett of Austin, Veronica Escobar of El Paso, Greg Casar of Austin, Al Green of Houston, Sylvia Garcia of Houston and Joaquin Castro of San Antonio.

Republicans blame Minnesota leadership

Early Monday morning, President Donald Trump announced he would send Tom Homan, the White House's Border Czar, to Minneapolis, who will report back to the president.

U.S. Sen. John Cornyn called that a ""great move,"" adding that, ""State & local officials in Minneapolis have failed to contain the chaos organized & funded by the radical left & I'm glad the Trump admin is committed to ending the lawlessness.""

Cornyn, who is facing a heated GOP primary to keep his seat in the Senate, criticized Crockett and Talarico's comments during the Senate debate as ""unhinged,"" specifically noting their criticisms of ICE. Cornyn also shared a post from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which said that Pretti had a firearm when he was killed. Cornyn added, ""Just a thought: Maybe the critics ought to wait for the facts before jumping to a conclusion. Reflexive anti-police rhetoric is dangerous.""

Analysts, including from the Washington Post, noted that agents had taken Pretti's gun away from him before shooting and killing him.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, one of Cornyn's primary challengers, also criticized Crockett and Talarico. He shared a post from Dan Scavino, White House Deputy Chief of Staff, that said, ""I stand with ICE.""

During a recording of his podcast, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he would largely hold off on weighing in on the shooting until the results of an investigation are shared. Though he called the shooting “tragic,” he blamed Minnesota's Democratic leaders for instigating demonstrators.

""The individual who was shot, he could have avoided that risk altogether,"" Cruz said. ""Number one, he could have chosen not to go to the protest, that's one choice. You might say, ‘Well, he feels passionately that he disagrees with what ICE is doing and he wants to exercise his First Amendment rights.' OK, those are protected; he has that right. Secondly, he could have chosen to go there and not bring a firearm.""

Other prominent Republican members of Congress from Texas, including Reps. Dan Crenshaw and Troy Nehls, have largely kept away from weighing in.

January 26, 2026, Washington, D.C. – Over the weekend, immigration enforcement agents killed another U.S. citizen, 37-year-old Alex Pretti. This is just weeks after the murder of Renee Good, and dozens of other violent actions that have harmed immigrants and U.S. citizens alike. The Senate will consider a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget this week that increases funding for immigration enforcement and will lead to more children and families being needlessly victimized. Members of Congress must reject any legislation that further empowers the administration to continue its attacks against families across the country.

Trump Administration officials have made clear since day one of their second term that they intended to go after children, families, and workers. Children are bearing the brunt of this hateful agenda. In just the first few weeks of this year, a five-year-old was used as bait after immigration enforcement agents followed him and his father home from school and arrested his father near their home; several children, including a six-month-old, were hospitalized after their car was tear-gassed on their way home; a 17-year-old was violently assaulted at work, abducted, and then thrown out in a parking lot miles away; and a seven-year-old and her parents were abducted in front of a hospital where they went to seek emergency care for her.

CLASP, along with other children’s advocates from the Children Thrive Action Network, have called on Congress to reject any increased funding for immigration enforcement that kidnaps entire families and traumatizes children. The devastating harms already inflicted on children and families across the country aren’t reversible, but additional harms are absolutely preventable. It is up to Congress to stand with communities and stop this administration’s crusade of violence.

Let us be clear. There is no acceptable amount of funding in this legislation for body cameras or oversight language that justifies increased or level funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP). The historic funding increases for these agencies included in H.R.1 have allowed the administration to rapidly onboard agents and turbocharge deportation efforts. The video recordings of these agents violently attacking and killing people and breaking the law make it abundantly clear that body cameras are doing little to deter agents from using violence, nor are they leading to meaningful consequences or changes to unlawful protocols. We have enacted laws, policies, and guidance that are supposed to prevent these abuses; yet the Trump Administration is actively disregarding them. Therefore, the Senate must not pass a budget that increases funding for ICE and CBP. Doing so would empower this administration to continue to terrorize our communities.

As an organization that’s been working for more than 50 years to advance policies that allow all children and families to thrive, we call on Congress and state and local officials to hold this administration accountable and protect our communities from further harm.",https://www.clasp.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Minneapolis-protest-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 18:58:02.966291

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress.","The second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis is raising the prospect of a partial government shutdown at the end of the week.

Senate Democrats say they will not vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security without new guardrails for immigration enforcement.

But that opposition may also torpedo the larger $1.3 trillion dollar spending package needed to keep large swaths of the federal government operational past Friday night.

""The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote on Sunday. ""People should be safe from abuse by their own government.""

Democrats were already raising alarms about the conduct of immigration officers before the latest killing in Minneapolis on Saturday.

Last week, all but seven House Democrats voted against the funding bill covering homeland security, which includes money for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

At the time, a few Senate Democrats also pledged to vote against the funding when it reached them this week, though the response across the Capitol was far from the near-unified opposition in the House.

That is because the House sent the DHS funding over to the Senate tied together with billions in spending for defense, health, transportation and other federal agencies, in part to expedite the process as Congress races to meet a Friday deadline to keep the government fully open.

""The hard truth is that Democrats must win political power to enact the kind of accountability we need,"" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate appropriations committee, wrote in a statement last week saying she would vote for the total package.

After Pretti's shooting on Saturday by a Border Patrol agent, Murray said she would join her Democratic colleagues in opposing the funding.

Congress faces Friday deadline to avert a partial shutdown

The timeline was already tight once a winter storm delayed the first Senate votes of the week until Tuesday night. But the renewed debate over immigration enforcement is complicating the task more.

Schumer wants to cleave the DHS measure from everything else. The other remaining spending measures have overwhelming bipartisan support. Democrats want to continue negotiating the DHS funding bill without shutting down large parts of the government.

The funding measure needs to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass, meaning some Democratic support is needed for it to clear the Senate. But disentangling different parts of the legislation requires buy-in from Republicans, and so far, GOP leadership has not indicated that they are willing to separate the funding bills.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune's communications director, Ryan Wrasse, wrote on X on Monday that the Senate will proceed as planned to consider all the funding bills together.

""A government shutdown, even a partial one, does not serve the American people well,"" he wrote. ""Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to join us before this week's funding deadline hits.""

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the appropriations committee chair, told The New York Times over the weekend, ""I'm exploring all options. We have five other bills that are really vital, and I'm relatively confident they would pass.""

Collins, who is up for reelection and whose state is also a target of immigration raids by the Trump administration, is among the Republicans who have expressed fresh concerns about the tactics, calling for an investigation.

A handful of Republicans have called for congressional hearings or offered sharper criticism.

""My support for funding ICE remains the same,"" Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., wrote in a statement. ""But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble.""

Even if Democrats could convince Republicans to agree to separate DHS funding from the rest, that would mean the legislation needs approval again in the House, which is on recess until Feb. 2. It is unlikely that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., would call members back to Washington early, increasing the risk of a partial shutdown.

Why Democrats are willing to risk another shutdown

Before this weekend, few lawmakers expressed appetite for another shutdown after a record 43-day one this fall. For weeks, Democrats withheld their votes from a short-term funding measure to reopen the government without a deal to extend expiring health insurance subsidies.

Eventually, a handful of Democrats joined with Republicans to reopen the government, with the promise of a vote on the subsidies. That vote failed in December. The deal included the passage of three bipartisan spending packages for veterans, agriculture and other areas through the end of September 2026 and a short-term extension for everything else through Jan. 30.

Congress has already passed several more full-year funding bills through September, but the measures still awaiting final passage in the Senate account for 75% of annual federal discretionary spending.

But even Democrats who ultimately voted with Republicans to end the last funding stalemate now say they will vote against the DHS funding despite the risk of another shutdown.

""We have bipartisan agreement on 96% of the budget,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., wrote in a statement. ""We've already passed six funding bills. Let's pass the remaining five bipartisan bills and fund essential agencies while we continue to fight for a Department of Homeland Security that respects Americans' constitutional rights and preserves federal law enforcement's essential role to keep us safe.""

Holding up the DHS funding bill would not halt the administration's immigration crackdown. Last summer, Congressional Republicans allocated $75 billion for ICE over four years in President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Democrats say they do not want to give ICE the roughly $10 billion base funding that is on the line now. But more so, Democrats see this as rare leverage in the minority to extract policy changes.

Democrats already negotiated to include $20 million in funding for officer-worn body cameras, plus more funding for oversight and a reduction in funding for enforcement and removal operations and detention bed capacity. But most Democrats said this did not go far enough.

Democrats want more sweeping reforms to reign in the tactics, such as prohibiting ICE from deploying excessive force and explicitly preventing them from raiding places of worship, hospitals and schools. Republicans previously rejected these demands.

The DHS funding bill also includes funding for the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

But Democrats are betting that the American public is on their side. A recent New York Times poll found that a majority of respondents said the federal immigration tactics have gone too far.

Nearly $1.3 trillion in federal funding is at stake

The funding fight over DHS is the latest dispute over funding in Congress. Last year, the Trump administration moved to rescind billions in federal funding appropriated by Congress for foreign aid and public broadcasting — and proposed a budget slashing nondiscretionary funding by some 20%.

Instead, the final legislation keeps federal nondiscretionary spending essentially flat. For example, the administration called for cutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget by 50%. Under the bipartisan health spending bill, the agency's funding would remain roughly unchanged.

Bill Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former longtime appropriations committee staffer, said this is striking considering Congress has mostly followed Trump's lead.

""Congress is starting to show a little bit of backbone,"" Hoagland said. ""I think there is increasing recognition of the need to have Congress exert its power of the purse.""

Until now, Republicans have backed Trump as he deploys federal agents and National Guard to US cities.
“We’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.","Congressional Republicans showed signs of wavering on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown in the wake of another shooting of a US citizen in Minnesota.

While the weakening resolve was far from a full break with Trump, it signals growing unease with the administration’s aggressive actions as Democrats threaten another government shutdown and November’s midterm elections come into view. Until now, Republicans have backed Trump as he deploys federal agents and National Guard to US cities.

Hundreds of videos have shown the agents using pepper spray, shoving, punching and kicking protesters who have stayed largely peaceful and are recording the agents’ actions. On Saturday, agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a nurse at a VA hospital, while he was subdued and on his knees after they discovered a gun he had a permit to carry.

“We’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.

“I don’t like any shooting,” the president added. “But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun.”

House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, suggested on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures that Trump should consider going “to another city and then maybe let the people of Minneapolis decide” how to proceed on immigration. He also defended immigration agents.

New York Republican Andrew Garbarino, the chairman of the House Homeland Security panel, has requested public testimony from top immigration officials, telling them in a letter Saturday that Congress “has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect.”

Other Republicans who have previously broken with Trump on other matters - including retiring Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Thomas Massie - were more frank.

“There must be a thorough and impartial investigation into yesterday’s Minneapolis shooting, which is the basic standard that law enforcement and the American people expect following any officer-involved shooting,” Tillis said on X.

Representative Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, also called in a post on X for an investigation “both to get to the bottom of these incidents and to maintain Americans’ confidence in our justice system.”

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said on CNN’s State of the Union that the agents involved in Pretti’s killing were “most likely” being placed on administrative leave and sent from Minneapolis.

Another Senate Republican, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, also broke sharply from the White House’s messaging and demanded “a full joint federal and state investigation.” Cassidy called the events in Minneapolis “incredibly disturbing” and said the credibility of ICE and Homeland Security are at stake.

“We can trust the American people with the truth,” Cassidy said.

But silence from other leaders, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, suggest that many in the party are still weighing how to respond to Pretti’s killing.

Shutdown Threat

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer vowed late Saturday to block a massive spending package next week unless Republicans strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security, dramatically increasing the risk for a partial US government shutdown.

Democratic opposition to the funding package potentially affects not just Homeland Security but also the departments of Defense, Labor, Education, State, Treasury and Health and Human Services.

None of the Republicans speaking on Sunday mentioned the looming shutdown fight.

The effects of another shutdown would be widespread, including possibly delaying the next Bureau of Labor Statistics report.

In the event of a shutdown, many essential workers - including the military and Transportation Security Administration agents - may have to work without pay. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol employees would likely be paid through additional funding in Trump’s tax bill signed last year.

The House passed the spending bill Thursday and left Washington until after the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline. Any changes to that legislation, including stripping Homeland funding, would require the House to return and vote on the new bill.

With the White House calling Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and accusing him of impeding the work of Border Patrol, despite video evidence to the contrary, Senate Republican leaders will be under enormous pressure to protect DHS funding.

The spending legislation needs votes from at least seven Democrats to pass the Senate.

Several moderates in the party quickly announced Saturday they’d oppose the bill.

At least one other American, Renee Good, was killed by an ICE agent when he stopped her for partly blocking a street with her car, claiming she tried to run him over.

“What’s happening in Minnesota is appalling -and unacceptable in any American city,” Schumer said. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans’ refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE.”

Forcing a shutdown risks hard-fought Democratic victories in the spending deal, including reversing many Trump cuts to medical research, foreign aid, education grants and mass transit.

The situation in Minnesota, however, has alienated key Democratic senators.

Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada, each of whom voted to end the last shutdown, said in statements Saturday they would oppose funding for Homeland Security without changes. Rosen insisted she will oppose funding “until we have guardrails in place to curtail these abuses of power and ensure more accountability and transparency.”

Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said the resistance isn’t about his party or politics.

“It’s about our country and our Congress, and what we need to do to impose some safeguards on an out-of-control agency which is imbued with a culture of lawlessness and seems to be committing murder in Minneapolis,” Blumenthal said.

Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, called Pretti’s killing a “heartbreaking tragedy.”

“It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault,” they said in a statement.

Delays Ahead

The Senate, a slow-moving legislative body, already faces potential delays from an expected snowstorm. The House’s planned absence next week complicates matters further ahead of the Jan. 30 funding deadline.

All but seven House Democrats voted against the DHS bill in the House, with many in the party seeking body camera requirements and other restraints on raids by ICE and Border Patrol agents.

Top Senate Democrat spending panel member Patty Murray said she won’t support the DHS bill as it stands, and it “needs to be split off from the larger funding package.”

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray said in a post on X. “I will continue fighting to rein in DHS and ICE.”

ICE Needs a Top-to-Bottom Overhaul Beyond the immediate and urgent need to halt dangerous operations and restore order, this moment demands something deeper: serious reform of ICE and the broader immigration enforcement system.","A second US citizen is dead at the hands of Donald Trump’s ICE. For a second time, the Administration has been quick to vilify the victim and defend the officer. For a second time this month, Americans can see with their own eyes ICE killing with impunity.

This is a public safety crisis instigated by an American president. If Republicans are afraid to take the lead and stand up to Trump’s abuse of power, Democrats will.

Trump’s ICE has demonstrated itself to be reckless, dangerous, and lawless towards Americans and immigrants alike. Democrats must condemn these abuses and advocate for immediate reforms, while also remembering who is to blame first: this is Donald Trump and Kristi Noem’s ICE. Most Americans want immigration laws enforced reasonably, responsibly, and humanely. But they do not want this.

To help Democrats to meet the gravity of this ever-evolving moment, this memo highlights: 1) the current public safety crisis, 2) key steps to immediately rein in its abuses, and 3) the major elements of what a humane interior enforcement strategy should look like. In short:

This is a public safety crisis.

ICE abuses must end.

ICE and CBP should be immediately withdrawn from Minnesota and pause at-large operations in urban areas until they prove they can conduct them safely.

Masks on federal law enforcement should be a rare exception, not the rule.

Trump must rein in his out-of-control ICE everywhere, end the chaos, restore professionalism, and hold bad actors accountable.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must be removed.

The weaponization of ICE by Trump to settle political scores and vendettas must stop.

ICE enforcement and deportations must be targeted at dangerous undocumented immigrants based on previous violent criminal activity.

A top-to-bottom reform of Trump’s ICE must commence at once.

ICE Has Caused a Public Safety Crisis

Trump’s ICE is off the rails. What Americans have seen since Donald Trump took office for a second time a year ago is not “targeted” immigration enforcement to get the “worst of the worst.” It is a national dragnet that is intentionally making our communities less safe.

Masked agents are roaming neighborhoods, refusing to identify themselves, and arresting people without explanation. They are smashing windows, dragging people from their cars, and detaining them without saying who they are or why they are doing it.

Local law enforcement is now regularly speaking out against ICE’s endangerment of local communities, including Hennepin County, Minnesota, Sheriff DaWanna Witt, who said, “We demand more from our federal government, more professionalism, more accountability, more humanity. We demand lawful policing that respects human dignity.”

The President and Republicans are floundering, scrambling to blame the recent chaos on so-called “sanctuary” policies that allow local law enforcement to make careful decisions about how and when they aid federal immigration enforcement. Overriding them would do nothing to restore order—it would simply be another example of Washington overreach into local law enforcement decisions on how best to maintain public safety.

What’s worse, the danger posed by this force has only grown more severe. The recent deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were carried out by experienced federal agents, not by the thousands of new ICE officers this Administration has rushed through recruitment and training in the last few months. With 12,000 of these new recruits now being pushed out into the field, the risk that even more unprepared officers will make deadly mistakes can’t be dismissed. If seasoned agents are already lethal in Minneapolis, imagine how much more dangerous this blanket enforcement will become as these rookies hit the streets.

Talking Points on ICE Abuses

Trump’s ICE is off the rails. This is not targeted enforcement against serious threats—it is a nationwide dragnet that is intentionally making American communities less safe.

We must immediately end the use of ICE as a political weapon and the abuse of federal law enforcement to settle Trump’s political and personal vendettas.

Masked federal agents operating without identification, explanation, or transparency are not restoring order—they are creating chaos.

Local law enforcement is sounding the alarm—and Washington should listen. Sheriffs and police chiefs across the country are warning ICE’s tactics are endangering their communities and undermining legitimate policing.

Blaming sanctuary policies for this chaos is a joke. What’s new isn’t sanctuary policies; it’s an Administration that has lost control and is now trying to scapegoat the people actually responsible for public safety.

This Administration didn’t inherit chaos—it created it, and now it’s trying to undermine local authorities to avoid accountability.

The danger is escalating—not receding. The killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti were carried out by experienced federal agents—not new, untrained recruits.

Yet the Administration has rushed 12,000 newly hired officers through shortened training and lowered standards and is now deploying them into communities.

If seasoned agents are already using deadly force, it is reckless to pretend that flooding neighborhoods with less-prepared officers will make anyone safer.

People are being stopped, questioned, and taken away with no probable cause, no warrants, and—in too many cases—no explanation at all.

Some victims are released hours later with bruises and trauma. Others disappear into detention with no explanation.

Americans should not have to fear being stopped, grabbed, or harmed by their own government.

This is what it looks like when a government stops respecting the rule of law.

Steps to Immediately Rein in ICE Abuses

Democrats must call this what it is: a crisis of the Administration’s own making. That starts with calling for an immediate halt to dangerous operations and a restoration of basic law and order—steps Minnesota Democrats have already demanded. It also means refusing to write a blank check for ICE. Senate Democrats are right to oppose DHS funding that lacks real guardrails against abuse, and Senator Cortez Masto has put forward a smart alternative: redirecting the extraordinary funding windfall Republicans handed to ICE to instead fund local law enforcement.

Accountability must follow. The leadership of DHS, ICE, and CBP should be compelled to testify before Congress, as Democrats in both chambers are demanding. If Republicans refuse to exercise meaningful oversight, Democrats should do it themselves—through hearings and aggressive fact-finding, as the Minnesota delegation has already demonstrated. That includes demanding records and evidence related to serious abuses, as Representative Pressley recently did for all records related to the killing of Renee Good. And it also means pursuing impeachment where warranted, as many Democrats are now urging with respect to Secretary Noem.

Finally, Democrats, and all who truly value public safety in this country, should insist on independent scrutiny. ICE and CBP cannot be allowed to investigate themselves. Congress should demand the creation of an independent investigative body—or the appointment of a special prosecutor—to examine cases of serious abuse. And until ICE can demonstrate that it can operate lawfully and safely, at-large enforcement in dense urban areas should be paused. Public safety must come first.

Talking Points on Reining in ICE Abuses

This is a crisis of the Administration’s own making—and it demands immediate action.

Trump must rein in ICE and CBP, halt dangerous at-large operations, restore professionalism, and end enforcement tactics that are clearly spiraling out of control.

We must refuse blank-check funding for DHS without real guardrails, accountability, and enforceable standards.

Pouring billions into ICE without real guidance or oversight has weakened public safety and left communities more vulnerable, not more secure.

No one is above oversight and accountability.

Secretary Noem is incompetent and must go. Where misconduct rises to the level of abuse of power, impeachment is not radical—it is a constitutional responsibility.

DHS is asserting powers that no democratic society should tolerate: warrantless home entries, detention of US citizens, denial of counsel, and routine violations of constitutional rights.

ICE’s refusal to cooperate with local law enforcement has heightened danger for communities and officers alike.

ICE Needs a Top-to-Bottom Overhaul

Beyond the immediate and urgent need to halt dangerous operations and restore order, this moment demands something deeper: serious reform of ICE and the broader immigration enforcement system. The last few months have stripped away any remaining illusions about the risks of granting an agency extraordinary autonomy while holding it to lower standards than the rest of American law enforcement. Immigration enforcement is necessary—but it must be safe, disciplined, and professional. Show Americans that accountability and professionalism are not optional in federal law enforcement.

ICE and CBP have long operated with a degree of independence that would be unacceptable anywhere else in American policing. That lack of guardrails—combined with vague mandates, shifting political directives, and weak oversight—has produced an enforcement culture untethered from public safety norms. The result is not precision or control, but chaos: masked agents, unclear authority, dangerous tactics, and a growing conflict with the local police departments who are primarily responsible for keeping communities safe.

First, Democrats must set firm, non-negotiable standards for how immigration enforcement is conducted. If ICE and CBP are going to operate in American communities, they must do so visibly, lawfully, and with restraint. That means no masks, no anonymous operations, no intimidation tactics, and no enforcement that undercuts or conflicts with local police. Officers should clearly identify themselves, state their authority, and explain the reason for an interaction—just as any other law enforcement officer is required to do. Federal immigration authorities should also be held to the same liability standards as state and local law enforcement. These are not activist demands; they are policing fundamentals.

Democrats are already showing how this could be done. The Stop Excessive Force in Immigration Act, introduced by Representatives Peters, Goldman, and Krishnamoorthi, and Senators Kelly and Gallego, sets clear limits on dangerous tactics and weapons. It restricts the use of chokeholds and reinforces basic standards of transparency and accountability. The Bivens Act in the House and the Constitutional Accountability Act similarly bring the standards already placed upon state and local law enforcement to federal officers—making federal officers civilly liable for certain egregious abuses, consistent with standards applied to state and local law enforcement. These reforms would send an important signal: immigration enforcement is not exempt from the rules that govern every other law enforcement officer in our country.

Second, Democrats must insist that ICE and CBP meet modern law enforcement training and professionalism standards. No officer should be interacting with the public—much less using force—without rigorous, standardized federal law enforcement training. The current approach of rushing thousands of recruits through shortened training pipelines is reckless. It endangers civilians, officers, and the integrity and legitimacy of law enforcement itself.

Here again, Democratic leadership is pointing the way forward. Proposals to strengthen training requirements, limit who can conduct at-large interior operations, and ensure officers are properly prepared before deployment reflect a commitment to public safety—not ideology. And they must be heeded.

Third, Democrats must force real oversight and independent accountability. An agency with the power to detain, arrest, and use force cannot be allowed to police itself. Democrats should continue demanding independent oversight, regular audits, and meaningful consequences for abuses—up and down the chain of command. That means, among other things, restoring the oversight bodies that the Trump Administration shut down.

Fourth, Democrats must reset enforcement priorities around real public safety. Immigration enforcement should focus on individuals who pose genuine safety threats, recent immigration violators, and those with final orders whose removal is imminent. Dragnet tactics that sweep up families, long-time residents, and bystanders do not make communities safer—they erode trust and divert resources from real crime.

Senator Gallego and 29 other Senate Democrats have made this point powerfully by calling out the diversion of thousands of law enforcement officers away from violent crime, human trafficking, and child exploitation and into mass immigration enforcement. That diversion has consequences. Democrats should keep drawing that line clearly: every hour spent chasing indiscriminate deportation quotas is an hour not spent keeping Americans safe.

Fifth, Democrats must reject the use of wartime authorities in immigration enforcement. Immigration enforcement does not justify the abuse of extraordinary wartime or foreign policy authorities like the Alien Enemies Act or the Insurrection Act. Democrats are, and should be, unequivocal in opposing the use of these tools against civilian communities and in routine law enforcement situations.

Finally, Democrats must lead with reform—not retreat—because the cost of inaction is already measured in lives. This is no longer an abstract policy debate; it is a public safety emergency unfolding in real time. Restoring order means reasserting control over an agency that has been allowed to operate without sufficient standards, oversight, or accountability. By advancing serious, enforceable reforms—rigorous training requirements, independent oversight, clear limits on force, and a public safety-first enforcement strategy—Democrats can demonstrate that the rule of law is strengthened, not weakened, when federal law enforcement is disciplined, professional, and answerable to the public it serves.

Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday that the lawsuit is needed because of ""the unprecedented nature of this surge.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge heard arguments Monday over Minnesota's challenge to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement crackdown, posing skeptical questions to both sides about the effort that has led to two fatal shootings by federal officers.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant requests by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul to temporarily halt the immigration operation. She said the case was a priority, though she issued no immediate ruling.

Menendez questioned the government's motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. The letter asked the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

""I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?"" Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued that the situation on the street is so dire as to require the court to halt the federal government's enforcement actions.

""If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,"" Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

Brantley Mayers, a Justice Department attorney, said the government's goal is to enforce federal law. Mayers said one lawful action should not be used to discredit another lawful action.

""I don't see how the fact that we're also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge,"" Mayers said.

Menendez questioned where the line was between violating the Constitution and the executive's power to enforce the law. She also asked whether she was being asked to decide between state and federal policies.

""That begins to feel very much like I am deciding which policy approach is best,"" she said.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

""I can't be the global keeper of all things here. Like, presumably that will be litigated,"" she said to the state's attorney.

Menendez made it clear that she was struggling with how to rule because the case is so unusual, and there are few precedents in case law to guide her.

""It's because this is important that I'm doing everything I can to get it right,"" she said.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday added urgency to the case.

Border czar to Minnesota

In other developments, President Donald Trump said he had a ""very good"" call with Walz about the latest shooting and that they are now on a ""similar wavelength."" It was an abrupt shift from Trump, who frequently derides Walz for his actions on immigration issues in Minnesota.

Trump also said he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota. The president's statement comes after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has become the public face of the crackdown, answered questions at news conferences over the weekend about Pretti's shooting. Trump posted on social media that Homan will report directly to him.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan would be ""the main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis"" during continued operations by federal immigration officers.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their request in an effort to restore the conditions that existed before the administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit ""legally frivolous"" and said Minnesota ""wants a veto over federal law enforcement."" They asked the judge to reject the request or to at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said Sunday that the lawsuit is needed because of ""the unprecedented nature of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we're looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we've seen something like this.""

Other state implications

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,"" the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota cannot detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including people who follow and observe agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday's shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing.

The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, issued an order late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering evidence"" related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

Hotel where federal agents believed to be was targeted

On Sunday night, protesters targeted a Minneapolis hotel where federal agents were believed to be staying, blocking a major avenue on the edge of the University of Minnesota campus.

A freelance photographer working for The Associated Press saw smashed glass in the hotel lobby, as well as graffiti with obscenities and threats directed at ICE.

A Minneapolis police officer was inside the hotel and tried to provide aid to a federal agent who was injured. More officers from local and state agencies planned to move in to ""deescalate the situation, and make arrests,"" Minneapolis police said Monday in a statement.

But as they began to reach the scene and arrested two people, federal agents arrived and ""deployed chemical munitions,"" the police statement said. A DHS spokesperson said a statement on the situation would be provided later Monday.

Associated Press writers Jack Brook in Minneapolis and Mike Catlaini in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

This story has been corrected to show the judge's name is Katherine Menendez, not Kathleen.

In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights.
In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents.
The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law.
“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney.","Connecticut state lawmakers said Monday that they will propose a bill allowing CT residents to sue federal law enforcement agents for violations of their constitutional rights.

The bill’s proposal is in response to the shooting of Alex Pretti by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday. Pretti is the second protester killed by federal immigration authorities in Minnesota this month, after Renee Good was shot and killed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7.

“I’ve heard from many of my constituents who are concerned that this could happen here and who are looking to the state and our state leaders and to provide some assurance that Connecticut is doing what we can to protect our residents,” said Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, during a press conference on Monday.

Connecticut would join several other states that have enacted similar laws, including California, Massachusetts, Maine and, most recently, Illinois.

“This is a well-established thing that we can do to make sure that if constitutional rights are violated, that the residents of the state can do something about it and can bring a lawsuit and can achieve justice,” said Lesser.

In 1983, a federal law was passed allowing for lawsuits against local and state officials in the case of a violation of constitutional rights. But there is no equivalent law allowing people to sue federal officials. In response, states began to create what are called “converse 1983 laws,” allowing for lawsuits against federal agents.

The 1971 Supreme Court case Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics found that individuals do have a right to sue federal officials for damages relating to violations of people’s constitutional rights. But the court has not allowed a lawsuit under Bivens to proceed in more than 30 years, and a 2017 Supreme Court decision tightened its use even further.

Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, noted that the Westfall Act, a 1988 law that protects federal employees from personal lawsuits for their conduct while carrying out their professional duties, further limits individuals’ recourse.

“I think it’s important for folks to be able to rest assured that the Constitution of the United States means something. If that doesn’t mean something, I don’t know who we are, what this country is,” said Winfield.

Sen. President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, said it was possible the law could be challenged by the federal government. The federal government sued the state of Illinois last month, claiming that a law allowing people to sue federal immigration agents went against the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, which says that federal law overrides state law.

But Looney disagreed that the proposed Connecticut law was at odds with the U.S. Constitution.

“These actions actually further the ultimate supremacy of the federal constitution by helping people vindicate their fundamental federal constitutional rights,” said Looney.

Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, welcomed debate on the proposed law in a statement he issued Monday.

“Anyone who breaks state or federal laws should be held accountable for their actions. In the meantime, the amped up rhetoric and the violence must end. Anyone who doesn’t like how the law is enforced is free to advocate for different laws, and to protest peacefully,” said Harding.

Democratic lawmakers said they had been working with the Connecticut chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union to draft the legislation.

There have been constitutional violations in Connecticut as ICE increased its presence here, said Chelsea Infinity-Gonzalez, ACLU-CT’s director of public policy and advocacy.

“ There’s operations ramping up all around us, in New York and Massachusetts, most recently in Maine. And so it truly is only a matter of time,” said Gonzalez.

Gonzalez said the ACLU was also working on legislation that would regulate the use of license plate readers so that the data collected was not used to assist federal law enforcement.

At the federal level, Connecticut politicians have widely criticized the shootings in Minnesota, and several have called for an independent investigation into the shooting. State investigators were not allowed access to evidence in the shooting of Good, and Drew Evans, superintendent of Minnesota’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which investigates police shootings, told reporters Saturday that federal officers had blocked his agency from the scene of Pretti’s shooting even after it obtained a signed judicial warrant.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday, calling on him to share records on the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to repeal “sanctuary policies” and allow detention centers to cooperate with ICE, and to provide the federal government with access to the state’s voter rolls.

Connecticut, along with 22 other states, has been sued in federal court by the Trump Administration for its voting records. The state in July joined 20 other states in a lawsuit pushing back against a directive from the federal government to provide data on people enrolled in SNAP.

In response to a question from CT Mirror, spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office Elizabeth Benton said the state “has not received such a letter” from Bondi and referred to earlier comments in which she said that any statements about hypothetical requests for data from the federal government would be “premature” and depend on the exact data requested.

Duff said during the press conference that the federal government was targeting Democratic-led states, and that Connecticut would “resist feverishly.”

“The federal government does not run elections, and we’re not going to give them data in order to try to make a mockery of our residents, our voters, and anyone else for their cruel and dangerous policies,” he said.

Connecticut’s congressional delegation last week voted against a bill that would fund the federal Department of Homeland Security. The bill passed the House of Representatives and is now headed to the Senate.

Hundreds of demonstrators braved freezing weather to take to the streets over the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, during a confrontation on Saturday.

Videos from the scene show the scuffle between federal officers and Pretti. Federal and state authorities have offered conflicting versions of what happened in the moments leading to the shooting.

Trump ordered federal agents to the Democrat-held state in December, pledging a massive deportation of undocumented migrants.

The Trump administration has described Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist"".

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said he was there ""to perpetuate violence"", saying he approached federal agents with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun.

Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and the man just before the shooting.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti resisted their attempts to disarm him.

Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading ""sickening lies"" about what happened.

BBC Verify analysed multiple videos showing the moments just before the shooting. They show Pretti filming agents with his mobile phone. One of the agents pushes another person over, and Pretti then stands between that person and the agent.

The agent pepper-sprays him in the face and, as he tries to help the woman on the ground, more agents join and he is wrestled to the ground. None of the available videos shows Pretti holding a gun.

An agent in a grey jacket can be seen empty-handed as he reaches to remove something from Pretti's waist. He then turns away from Pretti, now holding what appears to be a pistol in his right hand.

Less than a second after this, an agent shoots Pretti. Ten shots are heard.

In filed testimony, two witnesses challenged the DHS account of what happened, both saying they did not see Pretti brandish a weapon.

But Deputy Attorney-General Todd Blanche told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the videos were unclear and ""there is a lot we don't see"" in them so it was important to have an investigation.

President Donald Trump said local and state officials were ""inciting Insurrection"", suggesting they had called off local police from protecting federal immigration officers at the shooting scene.

Governor Walz strongly disputed the federal government's account of the incident. ""I've seen the video from several angles and it's sickening,"" he told reporters.

""Thank God we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something. It is nonsense, and it's lies,"" he said

Walz reiterated his call for trump to end ICE operations in Minnesota and urged protests to remain peaceful.

(COLORADO SPRINGS) — Thousands gathered in front of the Colorado Springs City Hall on Sunday, Jan. 25, in a protest against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following the fatal shooting of VA Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

Protesters waved signs and yelled chants with sentiments such as telling ICE to “get out of everywhere” and repeating the names of Pretti and Renée Good, who died in a shooting involving ICE on January 7.

“What’s happening in America is not ok; I’m a mother of two small kids, and I don’t feel safe every day,” said protester Shannon Groom. “Alex Pretti is my exact same age.

Trump agrees to 'look into' pulling some ICE agents out of Minnesota, says Walz's office

We have more on the phone call that took place today between Donald Trump and Minnesota governor Tim Walz, which we covered per Trump’s perspective earlier.

According to a statement from Walz’s office, the two held a “productive” call where the president “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”.

Trump also agreed to talk to the Department of Homeland Security “about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case”, the statement says.

Per my colleague Hugo Lowell, Trump’s call with Walz comes amid widening public backlash to the aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota, which could be compounded with further bad news if a federal judge finds as early as today that Operation Metro Surge was broadly illegal.

The day so far

Good afternoon and thank you for reading our live coverage today.

Most of Monday’s political news stems from the aftermath of Alex Pretti’s death at the hands of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis this weekend. State officials are trying to stop Donald Trump’s deployment of 3000 immigration agents to Minneapolis. Some local law enforcement are claiming that the feds are already blocking investigation of Pretti’s killing.

Here is a quick recap of where things stand.

Two federal judges are weighing cases that involve the legality of federal agents’ activity in Minneapolis. One case, which was argued this morning, challenged the legality of this surge. Another case, which will be argued at 2 pm local time, involves local officials’ claims that federal agents are getting in the way of their investigation of Pretti’s death.

Donald Trump is sending border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota on Monday night. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” the president said in a Truth Social post.

Chris Madel, an up-and-coming Republican gubernatorial candidate in Minnesota, dropped out of the race because of the GOP’s “stated retribution on the citizens of our state.” In what the Minnesota Star Tribune described as a “stunning exit,” Madel also said: “United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That’s wrong.” That Madel said this is, in fact, stunning: He provided legal counsel to Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who earlier this month shot and killed Renee Good.

Chuck Schumer, Senate Democratic leader, ramped up his request to separate Department of Homeland Security funding from a six-bill package. “Senate Democrats have made clear we are ready to quickly advance the five appropriations bills separately from the DHS funding bill before the January 30th deadline,” Schumer said in a statement. “The responsibility to prevent a partial government shutdown is on Leader Thune and Senate Republicans… If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s office said in a statement that he and Trump had a “productive” phone call where the president “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”. In the statement, Walz’s team said Trump agreed to talk with the Department of Homeland Security about making sure the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to investigate.

In Maine, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has arrested “more than 200 illegal aliens” in the past five days, assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the Guardian in a statement.

Once again, DHS said that it was targeting the “worst of the worst” but highlighted the same four arrests of immigrants with criminal convictions that it shared when the immigration enforcement operation started last week in the Pine Tree state.

Department of justice fights court order requiring federal agents to preserve evidence in Alex Pretti's death

Trump administration officials are fighting a court order issued late Saturday that requires federal agents to preserve evidence in Alex Pretti’s death.

The temporary restraining order stemmed from a request from the Minnesota bureau of criminal apprehension (MBCA) and Hennepin county attorney’s office. They alleged that feds had stymied their investigative efforts of Pretti’s death at the hands of federal agents.

Trump’s justice department claimed in court papers that they “fail to establish that they will be irreparably harmed absent a temporary restraining order”.

They claim that federal agents “are already obligated to preserve the evidence at issue here under their own policies”.

They contend that the FBI gathered evidence from the scene of Pretti’s death “using appropriate collection and handling procedures, and that evidence is currently preserved and stored in a secure evidence room at the Minneapolis field office”.

“The evidence is being preserved; nothing has been destroyed or altered. [Customs and Border Protection] has preserved all relevant body-worn camera footage from the incident and will do so for 75 years.” They also said that ICE was in possession of “limited evidence and follows stringent requirements for the documentation, retention, and accountability of its investigative records and evidence”.

The justice department insists that Minnesota and Minneapolis officials don’t have a right to steer the feds’ evidence-handling procedures, “particularly procedures involving an immigration-enforcement incident”.

A court hearing on the TRO is scheduled for 2pm local time.

White House insists that Trump supports second amendment rights

Leavitt says, “The president supports the second amendment rights of law abiding American citizens. Absolutely.”

She goes on to caveat this by repeating the administration’s suggestions that Alex Pretti, who was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, was at fault. [A reminder that Pretti had a gun on his person but video footage shows he was holding his phone, not a weapon, when he was confronted by law enforcement.]

Leavitt says:

There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J Trump. So while Americans have a constitutional right to bear arms, Americans do not have a constitutional right to impede lawful immigration enforcement operations. And as any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk, and the risk of a force being used against you. And again, that’s unfortunately what took place on Saturday.

Updated at 14.04 EST

Leavitt is asked how many shots were fired, how many guns were discharged, and whether Alex Pretti’s gun went off or only the federal agents’ guns.

She says the investigation is ongoing and includes interviews with the agents involved.

Noem still has Trump's 'utmost confidence and trust' and continues to oversee DHS, says White House

Leavitt is asked if Tom Homan’s deployment to Minnesota should be taken as a sign that Trump is “dissatisfied” with the officials on the ground who handled the incident.

Leavitt says, “No,” adding that Kristi Noem “still has the [president’s] utmost confidence and trust” and says Noem is continuing to oversee the Department of Homeland Security and immigration enforcement across the country.

White House says CBP 'won't be needed' in Minnesota if Walz and Grey comply with anti-immigration measures

“That’s why President Trump spoke with Governor Walz directly this morning, and he has outlined a clear and simple path to restoring law and order in Minnesota,” Leavitt says.

Number one, governor Wallace, Mayor Frey and all Democrat leaders should turn over all criminal illegal aliens currently incarcerated in their prisons and jails to federal authorities along with any illegal aliens with active warrants or known criminal histories for immediate deportation.

Number two, state and local law enforcement must agree to turn over all illegal aliens who are arrested by local police.

And then thirdly, local police must assist federal law enforcement in apprehending and detaining illegal aliens who are wanted for crimes, especially violent crimes.

If Governor Walz and Mayor Frey implement these common sense, cooperative measures, that I will add, have already been implemented in nearly every single other state across the country, Customs and Border Protection will not be needed to support Ice on the ground in Minnesota.

Updated at 13.35 EST

Leavitt goes on to accuse Walz and Frey of “using their platforms to encourage leftwing agitators to stalk, record, confront and obstruct federal officers who are just trying to lawfully perform their duties”.

This, she claims, “has created dangerous situations, threatening both these officers and the general public and Minnesotans alike”.

“This is precisely what unfolded in Minneapolis on Saturday morning,” she adds.

Updated at 13.35 EST

“But let’s be clear about the circumstances which led to that moment on Saturday,” Leavitt goes on.

This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota for weeks. Governor Walz and the mayor, Jacob Frey, and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal, illegal aliens from our streets.

Leavitt says Saturday’s [fatal] shooting [of Alex Pretti] remains under active investigation by the FBI, homeland security and customs border officials.

“The administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” she says.

Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that state violence must be judged by the conditions that make it normal, not merely by the individuals who carry it out.
Sending armed agents into neighborhoods without adequate training is not an accident—it is policy.
King did not respond to state violence by asking for better public relations or gentler rhetoric.
If he were alive today, he would not ask ICE to behave more humanely while carrying out inhumane policies.","I was thirteen when I watched the Rodney King beating on the evening news with my father. The grainy footage was relentless and impossible. I credit that evening as my political awakening. I asked countless questions and received hours of patient answers. What has stayed with me is not only the horror of what was shown, but the collective astonishment that accompanies recurring episodes of graphic violence. The lesson in outrage is familiar: society confronts violence only when the public bears witness to its spectacular and undeniable reality.

In 1944, at age 15, returning by bus from an oratorical contest in Dublin, Georgia. King and his teacher, Mrs. Bradley, were seated when white passengers boarded. The bus driver enforced the cruelty of Jim Crow laws and ordered Black passengers—including King—to give up their seats. He stood up and obeyed the unjust law. He later described this moment as one of the angriest of his life, saying he was “the angriest I have ever been in my life,” and that the humiliation stayed with him for years. We all have memories that imprint into our souls.

Seeing ICE terrorize neighborhoods and detain innocent people—citizens and noncitizens alike—should be as morally jarring as “whites only” counters, hospitals, and water fountains once were. It is the kind of injustice that, when explained plainly, still shocks the conscience—especially of children, who have not yet learned to treat cruelty as normal. It will not be forgotten anytime soon.

Recent events make clear that this is not an aberration. In the past week alone, federal officials have doubled down on an enforcement strategy that prioritizes speed, visibility, and volume over preparation or restraint. The resulting violence is treated as unfortunate fallout rather than foreseeable consequence. That framing is not just misleading—it is false. What we are witnessing is not a failure of execution, but the execution of a plan.

I feel the cycle repeating. Shock, grief, and calls for accountability emerge immediately. One case involves police officers beating a limp body: another, a federal agent firing “defensive” shots through a driver’s-side window. King’s experience of racist America and our observations of 5-year-olds abducted in their driveways are the same; the state makes excuses, talks about the law, and blames victims. Coverage fixates on physical details, evidence, and personal histories.

Public violence demands resistance—it is part of our moral economy—but the selectivity of that attention is troubling. We are fluent in responding to abrupt emergencies and far less equipped to confront the slow boil of cultural and structural violence. King would praise the whistles in Minnesota while condemning the dog whistles from MAGA republicanism.

We should trust our eyes. There is nothing “self-defense” about the ICE shootings, and the administration’s claims that the victims are domestic terrorists (or anything else) are false. But the fatal shots were delivered months earlier, when the administration intentionally produced predictable suffering. Who did this? Why?

The answer is not found at the moment a trigger is pulled. It begins earlier, in offices where executive orders are drafted, training timelines shortened, and numerical targets elevated over human judgment. When preparation is compressed, oversight weakened, and escalation rewarded, violence is no longer accidental—it is structural. The question is not whether harm will occur, but who will be blamed when it does. When “defensive shots” were fired, again, in the morning hours of Jan. 24th Governor Walz responded: “Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”

Focus will be rightly placed on questions like, he was on the ground, how is that defensive? But how did thousands of agents of the state end up there? How is it that 85% of MAGA Republican and 64% of non-MAGA Republicans say ICE is “Just Right” or “Not Aggressive Enough?” Will there be another clear cover up?

Martin Luther King Jr. insisted that state violence must be judged by the conditions that make it normal, not merely by the individuals who carry it out. He resisted narrowing moral judgment to individual perpetrators because doing so allowed institutions to deflect responsibility onto “bad apples.” Decades of promises about body cameras and training have served as distractions from administrative recklessness and policy design. In what society, King would ask, is this behavior considered normal?

In Beyond Vietnam, King warned that a society reveals its moral commitments not through slogans, but through budgets and policy. A nation that “continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift,” he argued, “is approaching spiritual death.” The same logic applies here: priorities hardened into legislation produce predictable harm. As King put it, “We as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values.”

This outcome was produced by an administration that turned neighborhoods into war zones for political purposes. Choosing escalation at every opportunity yields predictable results. Bureaucracy and executive orders kill far more effectively than individuals animated by avarice or malice. Valuing order over justice and privileging loyalty over morality is no longer an inflection point; it is openly rewarded.

This violence is bureaucratic before it is physical. Sending armed agents into neighborhoods without adequate training is not an accident—it is policy. Calling resulting deaths “failures” or “oversights” sanitizes decisions made in advance, for political gain, at the expense of human life. ICE in 2026 resembles the Birmingham Police Department in 1963. Kristi Noem and Bull Connor share the same playbook of state power suppressing dissent through intimidation and force. When 5,000 children walked out of school to protest segregation, Connor unleashed snarling dogs and fire hoses. Many children carried toothbrushes, knowing arrest was likely.

In the margins of a newspaper, King penned Letter from Birmingham Jail. Denied proper writing implements while held in solitary confinement, he wrote on scraps of paper—napkins and toilet paper among them. His message on the urgency of nonviolent direct action could not wait. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” he wrote, calling on people to break unjust laws and accept the consequences.

Donald Trump has not pulled the trigger, but his immigration policies cause needless pain, suffering, and death. They are grossly unpopular: a 2025 PRRI survey reports that only three in ten Americans support his immigration agenda. That unpopularity helps explain the strong reactions from neighbors, friends, and community members. Training adds another layer of risk. What once took roughly five months has been reduced to forty-seven days. Increased operational complexity paired with reduced preparation is a recipe for disaster. If a parent gives a four-year-old a gun, they are blamed. When an administration sends undertrained agents into the streets, it should be blamed as well.

All elected officials must be held to account. Softened language—“accidents happen” or “nothing we could do”—lets everyone off the hook. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did not mince words, telling ICE, “Get the F___ out!” Leaders can defund reckless operations, demand proper training, and insist on accountability. Citizens deserve competence, not excuses. Split-second decisions about detention and lethal force unfold in real time; adequate preparation is essential to protect both civilians and agents.

Cutting corners to staff the streets was a bureaucratic choice driven by headlines and numbers. Policies and procedures are violent in themselves, and they can be reversed—but that reality is missing from much of the coverage. Armed agents terrorizing neighborhoods is a serious problem, but focusing only on those who pull the trigger will not prevent future harm. Real change requires confronting the policies that put those agents and their weapons in neighborhoods in the first place.

King was a moral authority and a tactician, but above all, he was a man of action. In 2026, he would make clear that ICE is not part of the promise of any American Dream. The promise of opportunity revoked by a society that blocks justice while demanding law and order, King repeatedly warned, creates the conditions under which violence becomes more likely—not because people are impatient, but because justice has been systematically denied.

King did not respond to state violence by asking for better public relations or gentler rhetoric. He demanded disruption. He organized boycotts, marches, and mass refusal. He forced institutions to confront the cost of maintaining unjust systems. If he were alive today, he would not ask ICE to behave more humanely while carrying out inhumane policies. He would demand that those policies be stopped—and he would insist that elected officials choose between order and justice, knowing they cannot have both.

Structural violence is slow, often invisible, and lethal. Spectacle cannot be our measure of accountability. To prevent harm, we must confront not just bullets, but bureaucracy—the policies and political calculations that set violence in motion. Only then can outrage become action: defunding reckless operations, restoring meaningful training, and rejecting policies that treat communities as testing grounds for political theater.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bradley-andrews-18BAb3kNsGY-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:06:46.932277

They plead with Trump and his advisers in private to calm tensions, as a handful did this weekend.
However, most officials hope one of their colleagues can do that work so they don’t have to play the heavy.
In another television interview, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky) deployed the “I’m-only-thinking-out-loud-here” approach of trying to get through to Trump and his aides.
“As I have often said, I support the Border Patrol, ICE and the critical work they do to enforce our laws,” Sen. David McCormick (R-PA) began.","Before we get to the private and public messages being transmitted, however, a word on what top Republicans actually believe about what has become a deepening crisis for the White House, based on my conversations over the last two days.

They are concerned more protests to the bloodshed may beget additional incidents, have little faith in DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and, from a raw political standpoint, worry the party has squandered the best issues it had when voters were otherwise frustrated with the cost of living: the border and public order.

Immigration, broadly, as one veteran senator granted anonymity to speak candidly told me over the weekend, is for the GOP what health care is for Democrats — a “home game.” Yet with viral images of Americans being shot in broad daylight replacing migrants stampeding across the country’s border, that advantage is quickly dissipating.

So what are Republican elected officials doing to address what could prove calamitous, for the country and their political fortunes?

To date, it’s the usual approach.

They plead with Trump and his advisers in private to calm tensions, as a handful did this weekend. However, most officials hope one of their colleagues can do that work so they don’t have to play the heavy. “You can talk to them” or “Can you talk to them?” are phrases I don’t need access to text chains to know are being relayed between top Republicans.

When lawmakers do reach Trump, the dialogue is similar to those private messages he posted last week from European leaders eager to get him off his Greenland fetish: Start with praise and flattery before moving to the heart of the matter.

And while hope may not be a strategy, as the saying goes, there’s a whole lot of hope among Republican officials — mostly that they don’t have to go public with their true feelings, because if they wait for a few days the president will consume so much media coverage he’ll recognize the depth of the crisis.

The first signs of that shift emerged Sunday night. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s Josh Dawsey, Trump declined to say the officer who killed Alex Pretti had done the right thing and pronounced that “we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.” That came, it barely requires noting, all of one day after Trump justified the killing and his lieutenants did as well, in even starker terms.

Monday morning, Trump took concrete steps to marginalize Noem and Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, who have become the face of the feds in Minnesota, appointing a new point person in the state and new chain of command.

“I am sending Tom Homan to Minnesota tonight,” the president announced about his border czar. “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there. Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”

The sound you hear is the president, once again, sawing off the limb after his loyalists climbed out on it with what credibility they have in tow.

This all begs the question of why, if the president is so responsive to the press narrative, more in his party don’t speak out in ways that will shape the story.

They are, but you have to know how to decipher their language.

First, there’s the method of: “The president can’t fail, he can only be failed.”

Which means, Republicans blame Trump’s advisers rather than risk angering the president by assigning the most powerful leader in the world agency of his own.

“He is a dealmaker, and he’s getting bad advice right now,” Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt said on CNN Sunday.

Stretching even further was Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a master student of the blame-advisers-not-Trump school: “Any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump’s legacy.”

Tillis is only looking to help the president and secure his legacy, you see.

In another television interview, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky) deployed the “I’m-only-thinking-out-loud-here” approach of trying to get through to Trump and his aides.

Rather than say: Hell yes, we should yank federal immigration officials from Minnesota and end this fiasco, Comer tried to say it this way on Fox:

“If I were President Trump, I would almost think about, OK, if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harm’s way and there’s a chance of losing more, you know, innocent lives or whatever, then maybe go to another city and let the people of Minneapolis decide, ‘Do we want to continue to have all of these illegals?’”

Just asking questions, you know.

Then there’s the Senate sandwich.

Deliver the meat of the message, or at least a palatable version of it, but between to-be-sure paragraphs.

“As I have often said, I support the Border Patrol, ICE and the critical work they do to enforce our laws,” Sen. David McCormick (R-PA) began. “Irresponsible rhetoric and a lack of cooperation from Minnesota’s politicians are fueling a dangerous situation.”

Then came the news, delivered with the perfuming cover of a right-coded affinity group: “I also agree with the NRA and others — we need a full investigation into the tragedy in Minneapolis. We need all the facts.”

The conclusion: “We must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust. This gives our law enforcement officers the best chance to succeed in their difficult mission.”

Lastly, there’s that old reliable for politicians of all stripes: calls for hearings and an independent investigation.

Not coincidentally, one of the first Republicans to take this tack was Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who’s been somewhat liberated thanks to Trump’s decision to exact revenge on Cassidy for his 2021 impeachment vote by backing a primary challenger to the senator this year.

To Cassidy’s credit, he went further than most of his colleagues by saying what’s manifestly obvious: “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.”

Beating Cassidy to the punch, and in a sign of how the politics of immigration have shifted because of the killings, the House Homeland Security Committee Chair Andrew Garbarino requested ICE officials testify before his panel.

“Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect,” said Garbarino, by way of announcing his turn toward oversight.

Federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse for the Veterans Administration, on Jan. 24.","Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein has joined 80 other cities in supporting a federal lawsuit filed by Minneapolis.

The lawsuit seeks to have the deployment of federal immigration agents in Minneapolis declared unconstitutional.

The action follows the fatal shooting of two U.S. citizens by federal agents in the Minneapolis area.

Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, along with dozens of other cities around the country, has sided with Minneapolis in a federal lawsuit seeking to have immigration officials removed from that city in the wake of the fatal shootings of a Minnesota mother and an ICU nurse.

The brief, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, was authored by attorneys for the city of Boston and co-signed by attorneys from 80 other cities and local governments across the country.

Minneapolis is asking a federal judge to rule that the deployment of federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection is unconstitutional.

Klein's announcement comes on the same day a hearing was held in a federal court in Minnesota about the state's lawsuit. As of 1 p.m. EST, no ruling had been issued in the case.

The Trump administration has sent about 3,000 federal immigration officers to Minnesota as part of ""Operation Metro Surge."" The officers were mainly deployed to the Minneapolis and St. Paul areas. Since their deployment, two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot by agents, and there have been increasing protests in the city related to their continued presence.

""What we're seeing in the Twin Cities is horrific, heartbreaking and more of the same illegal and unconstitutional tactics from the Trump-Vance administration that seemingly cares more about retribution than the rule of law,"" Klein said in a release. ""Two people have now been shot and killed in the streets, local governments are under threat, and residents continue to have to worry about federal agents upending their daily lives.""

Federal agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse for the Veterans Administration, on Jan. 24. Pretti's death came after the Jan. 7 fatal shooting of Renee Good, also 37, by an ICE agent.

Klein has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration and its decisions, filing or joining a number of federal lawsuits, including those challenging cuts to local funding that had already been appropriated by Congress and access to healthcare.

Mayor Andrew Ginther said in a statement he supports Klein's actions in co-signing the supportive brief in Minnesota, saying federal agents ""lack the training and standards that we hold our own police to.""

""Without proper measures to ensure public safety, as well as transparency and accountability, these agents are not making us safe - they are violating the Constitution and stoking chaos, pain and fear,"" Ginther said.

Klein's joining of the amicus brief comes about a month after ICE sent agents to Columbus and other parts of Ohio during ""Operation Buckeye."" Klein did not file any federal legal action regarding ICE's activities in Columbus, but he and other city leaders decried the tactics ICE was using, including operating without clear identification or uniforms showing they were federal agents.","https://www.dispatch.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/09/NCOD/88092103007-protest-01072026-skm-11.JPG?crop=5474,3079,x0,y285&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 15:07:03.351616

January 26, 2026

Happy snow day, State House Watchers.

We hope you’re warm, and that you have power, and that you shovel with care. And of course, that you have some time to enjoy today’s special beauty.

One thing you don’t have to do today is attend state legislative hearings. The NH House canceled today’s hearings and moved them to other days this week and early next week. The calendar of hearings below reflects the updated schedule.

We hope you’ll find some time today to take the many online actions described below. From rental housing, to public education, access to food, immigration and the death penalty, it will be another busy week for issues that matter a great deal to us all.

We’ll keep the commentary brief so that we can get this newsletter to you at last. We’ll simply say that the lives of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti mattered, as did the lives of Geraldo Lunas Campos, Luis Gustavo Nunez Caceres, Luis Beltran Yanez–Cruz, Parady La, Victor Manuel Diaz, and Heber Sanchez Dominguez who also died this year (2026) while in the custody if ICE. The cost of state violence is horror and heartache, and the loss of their unique Light. For these siblings, and for all who have died because of racism and cruelty, may we find ways to stay in the struggle for a just, peaceful, and more compassionate world.

ACTION ALERTS!

Many thanks for all of the actions you are taking to support good policies and oppose harmful ones. In addition to giving testimony in person, we have an opportunity to register our positions and share testimony online. You’ll need the date of the hearing, the committee name and the bill number. You’ll enter your name and contact information as well whether you represent an organization and/or are a lobbyist. You can sign-in on a bill until midnight the day of the hearing. Sign in for House bills here. Sign in for Senate bills here. You can also email the committee members: House committees here. Senate committees here.

Remember that if you’re planning to attend House committee hearings in person, they are located at Granite Place this year while renovations are being made at the LOB. Senate committee hearings continue to be held at the State House and in nearby state buildings, including the state library.

Here are the action alerts we’ve received from partners for this coming week.

Today - Protect transgender rights.

OPPOSE SB 268, permitting classification of individuals based on biological sex under certain limited circumstances. This bill was a retained bill from 2025. The House passed it on January 8, and now it heads to Governor Ayotte. This bill is nearly identical to the so-called “bathroom bill” she vetoed last spring. Please call the governor and urge her to VETO it (603-271-2121).

Tuesday, January 27 - PRIORITY BILL - Protect worker rights.

OPPOSE HB 1704, permitting public employees to bargain individually with public employers without any intervention. The NH AFL-CIO shares that this bill “undermines exclusive representation – the core of collective bargaining; it creates administrative chaos because employers would have to negotiate hundreds or thousands of individual contracts while trying to manage the legal risk from inconsistent agreements; exposes cities and towns to lawsuits and turns normal labor activity into criminal conduct; and will increase property taxes that you pay because of the increased costs to cities and towns, because of more HR staff, more lawyers, more lawsuits, and more turnover.” NEA-NH has additional information here. This anti-worker, anti-union bill has a public hearing in the House Labor Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 3:15 PM at Granite Place, room 159. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, contact the committee, and show up at the hearing.

Tuesday, January 27 – PRIORITY BILLS - Protect tenant rights and immigrant families.

OPPOSE HB 1336, allowing exceptions to the cap on residential security deposits for applicants not meeting standard approval criteria. From NH Legal Assistance: “By allowing landlords to double the security deposit charged, we are making housing less affordable. Not only do renters have to come up with twice the money up front, but it leaves them with fewer resources for continuing to pay the rent, moving costs, regular expenses like childcare and utilities…not to mention emergencies.” It has a hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 10:30 AM in Room 231 at Granite Place. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, contact the committee, and show up for the hearing.

OPPOSE HB 1709, relative to prohibiting the rental of residential property to individuals unlawfully present in the United States. From the NH Immigrant Rights Network: “Enacting such a law would place housing providers in the legally precarious position of screening people based on nationality and immigration status – practices that are definitively prohibited under federal and state housing discrimination laws. Landlords cannot and should not screen tenants to establish citizenship or immigration status. They may not treat tenants differently based on citizenship, nationality or ethnicity. They are certainly not in the position to determine whether a prospective tenant is lawfully present, whether they had an obligation to report their status, and whether they reported their status accurately.” This reckless and discriminatory bill has a public hearing in the House Housing Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 2 PM in Room 231 at Granite Place. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, contact the committee, and show up for the hearing.

SUPPORTSB 623, relative to requirements for law enforcement officers assisting in immigration enforcement. This bill is called the ""Granite State No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act,” and would require that each officer shall clearly display either their name or their badge number; no officer shall wear any facial covering or mask; and no officer shall disable or disengage their body-worn camera.” This positive bill has a public hearing in Senate Judiciary on Tuesday, January 27 at 1:40 PM in SH, Room 100. Please sign in to support this bill and contact the committee.

Tuesday, January 27 – Ensure that hungry children are fed.

SUPPORT SB 517, relative to the responsibility of local school districts to provide meals to students during school hours, reimbursing schools for meals provided to students at no cost, and making an appropriation therefor. This bill would increase the income eligibility for free school meals to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level, giving more kids access to the food they need to learn and helping working families succeed. It has a public hearing in the Senate Education Committee on Tuesday, January 27 at 10 AM in the Map Room at the State Library. Please sign in to support and contact the committee.

Wednesday, January 28 – Oppose the death penalty.

OPPOSE HB 1047, relative to the offense of capital murder. This bill makes it a capital murder offense to knowingly cause the death of the governor or governor-elect of New Hampshire, a member or member-elect of the executive council, or any member or member-elect of the New Hampshire senate or New Hampshire house of representatives, or any candidate for any such offices after such candidate has been nominated at his or her party's primary, when such killing is motivated by knowledge of the foregoing capacity of the victim. It has a public hearing in the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, January 28 at 11 AM in Room 159, Granite Place. Please sign in to oppose and share testimony, and contact the committee.

Wednesday, January 28 – No masks for law enforcement cooperating with ICE.

SUPPORTHB 1142, relative to requirements for law enforcement officers assisting in immigration enforcement. This bill mandates that these officers must identify themselves by name, badge number, and agency while stating that they are operating under the authority of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Additionally, the bill requires that these officers remain unmasked during their operations under the 287(g) agreement. It has a public hearing in the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, January 28 at 3:30 PM in Room 159, Granite Place. Please sign in to support and share testimony, and contact the committee.

Thursday, January 29 – Protect public education.

OPPOSE SB 101, authorizing parents to enroll their children in any public school in the state. From NEA-NH: “This bill, with some amendments, will go to the Senate on Thursday, January 29 for a floor vote. Passage of this bill would upend the current open enrollment law that many school districts are currently trying to grapple with at their annual meetings. As amended, SB 101 would require all school districts to adopt an application and transfer process to allow non-resident students from other New Hampshire school districts to enroll in their schools. The bill only gives a limited number of exceptions as reason for denial of such a transfer and spells out more specifically what the resident district would owe the receiving district in tuition. This all will need to be in place by July 1st of this year! This is too much, too fast, and the fiscal, logistical and educational impacts of such a law have not been thought through thoroughly. Before the New Hampshire Senate votes on mandatory open enrollment, contact your state senator and urge them to hit the pause button on SB 101!

Friday, January 30 – Require transparency for immigration enforcement.

SUPPORTHB 1364, requiring quarterly reports from counties, municipalities, or any other political subdivisions of the state that enter into certain agreements with the federal government concerning assistance with federal immigration enforcement. This positive bill has a public hearing in the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee on Friday, January 30 at 11:30 AM in Room 159, Granite Place. Please sign in to support and share testimony, and contact the committee.

Monday, February 2 – Protect food assistance.

SUPPORT HB 1750, making a supplemental appropriation to the department of health and human services for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). This positive bill would make sure that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has the dollars to keep SNAP running. Without this bill, over 76,000 New Hampshire residents will lose access to SNAP - and to food. We must make the necessary state investment to ensure that SNAP remains fully operational. This bill has a public hearing on Monday, February 2 at 11 AM in Granite Place, room 230. Please sign in to support and contact the committee.

Monday, January 26, 2026

Peace & Justice Conversations: State-Sponsored Violence In and By the US – 7 PM, on Zoom. NH Peace Action focuses on questioning and ending our country's violent foreign policy. We have always noted the ways in which this treatment of those outside our country is reflected in violence at home as well. We are currently seeing an upsurge in the use of militarized force against people within our borders through an increase in the purview, funding, and impunity given to ICE. There is also a strong and inspiring wave of resistance. Come learn more about the work in NH to disrupt ICE activities and how you can help. Presenters are Maggie Fogarty, AFSC-NH, and Megan Chapman, World Fellowship Center.

“A House of Dynamite” film discussion – 7 PM, on Zoom. Hosted by NH Peace Action and Back from the Brink. The current administration's plans to renew nuclear weapons testing is one alarming reminder that the threat of nuclear war is still a very real concern. “A House of Dynamite” is an apocalyptic political thriller that gives us a view of the devastating anticipation of a nuclear attack. Get drawn into the nerve-wracking decision rooms as this unsettling picture shows us what could become our future if the right choices are not made today. Watch the film (on Netflix) and then join us on zoom for a discussion about this film and what actions we can take now. Jeremy Love of Back from the Brink will lead the discussion to help us find a sense of purpose instead of hopelessness. Before watching the movie, we recommend you take a look at Back from the Brink's Beginner's Guide to Nuclear Weapons. Accessing the film: If you are not able to access this movie on your own, but would like to be a part of this discussion, let us know (info@nhpeaceaction.org). If there are enough people who need access to the movie, we will attempt to connect people to watch the movie together. As you watch the movie, think about how you feel about the threat of nuclear war, what you think is realistic considering the actions of current world leaders, and how you feel life would change after a nuclear attack.

Federal immigration agents have fired weapons at civilians in at least 19 documented incidents as part of the administration’s enforcement crackdown.
Let us be clear: the violence federal immigration agents are bringing into Minneapolis sits within a long American tradition of state power used to surveil, control, and punish Black and Brown communities.
These egregious acts by federal agents are in defiance of the rule of law and require Congress’ immediate action.
This Congress has abdicated its oversight role, allowing immigration enforcement to grow into the largest law enforcement force in the country, with devastating human costs.","January 26, 2026 – We condemn the killing of Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis as the latest in a mounting toll of deaths tied to immigration enforcement operations, including the killing of Minnesota resident Renee Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) agent earlier this month, the killing of Keith Porter by an off-duty federal agent, and other fatal encounters involving federal law enforcement across the country. Since the start of President Trump’s second term, Alex Pretti is the fifth person to be shot and killed be federal immigration officers. Federal immigration agents have fired weapons at civilians in at least 19 documented incidents as part of the administration’s enforcement crackdown. We demand accountability and an end to this cycle of sanctioned violence.

These deaths demonstrate a broader pattern of lawlessness, lack of accountability, and erosion of civil rights under the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). What we are witnessing is not isolated misconduct but the normalization of a federalized, unaccountable police force operating with impunity in American cities. This is the infrastructure of authoritarianism taking root in real time.

Let us be clear: the violence federal immigration agents are bringing into Minneapolis sits within a long American tradition of state power used to surveil, control, and punish Black and Brown communities. But the scale and brazenness of this moment mark a dangerous escalation. This is a humanitarian crisis. This is a civil rights crisis. This is a constitutional crisis.

Federal obstruction of independent investigations has made matters worse. State officials and local law enforcement agencies have faced repeated resistance and continue to be denied meaningful access to evidence and crime scenes necessary to conduct full and transparent reviews and investigations. When governors and attorneys general cannot investigate deaths in their own states, accountability has collapsed.

These egregious acts by federal agents are in defiance of the rule of law and require Congress’ immediate action. Instead of empowering ICE and DHS with billions of additional dollars in new funding, we call on every U.S. Senator to vote NO on any legislation that funds ICE or DHS surveillance, intelligence, and enforcement operations, and we formally request immediate meetings within 48 hours with both the Senate Democratic Caucus and Senate Republican Caucus regarding the unfolding situation in Minnesota and the urgent need for congressional intervention.

This Congress has abdicated its oversight role, allowing immigration enforcement to grow into the largest law enforcement force in the country, with devastating human costs. The Senate must act now. Further funding without accountability is further abdication of your responsibility.

,Agencies,2026-01-26 18:47:13+00:00,USA TODAY,ICE arrested me without cause. What I saw will haunt me forever. | Opinion - USA Today,Patty O'Keefe,,,,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2026/01/26/ice-detained-us-citizens-minnesota-arrests/88304880007/,"Imagine if you heard that heavily armed, masked agents were going door-to-door where you live, violently grabbing people from gardeners to grandparents – no questions asked, no warrants offered.
Especially if you knew that having more community members as observers decreases the likelihood those masked agents will use violence.
When we drove to the scene, Brandon and I saw several ICE agents getting back into two unmarked vehicles.

These women said they enlisted for the same reason they felt compelled to act as ICE observers – to protect their fellow Americans.","I live smack dab in the middle of an ordinary block in Minneapolis. I borrow occasional eggs or vanilla from the neighbor on my right when I get caught short baking. My partner shovels our elderly neighbor’s sidewalk; she knit him a hat in gratitude. The folks down the street watch our cats when we’re away. In other words, a pretty typical American neighborhood, perhaps not unlike your own.

Imagine if you heard that heavily armed, masked agents were going door-to-door where you live, violently grabbing people from gardeners to grandparents – no questions asked, no warrants offered. What would you do? Especially if you knew that having more community members as observers decreases the likelihood those masked agents will use violence.

That’s what my friend Brandon and I were doing on Jan. 11. We heard reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents pepper spraying the car of an observer blocks from my house and went to warn others. I am a U.S. citizen and resident of Minneapolis for more than 14 years; this is a place where treating others as you wish to be treated is more than a saying.

When we drove to the scene, Brandon and I saw several ICE agents getting back into two unmarked vehicles. They turned down a side street and we followed for about 40 seconds, blowing our whistles and honking our horns – to warn our neighbors that ICE had come.

We did so knowing that monitoring and sounding the alarm about actions undertaken by government agents is our legally protected right. And any government that claims to be of, by and for the people must protect this right, not attack people of good conscience who exercise it.

But attack us is what ICE did. The agents got out of their vehicle, surrounded our car and yelled at us to stop following. On their way back to their vehicles, one of the agents suddenly turned around, as if deciding, “Hey, why not,” and walked back to my car and pepper sprayed into the vents near the front windshield.

'You guys gotta stop obstructing us – that's why that lesbian b---- is dead'

Brandon and I were paralyzed with shock, as our eyes and throats started to burn. When we did not immediately turn the car around, the ICE agents returned and, without warning or asking us to exit the vehicle, smashed the front windows of my car, dragged us out and arrested us.

They separated us. I was put in a car alone with three agents. When they got in and shut the doors, the taunting began.

One agent took a photo of me and showed it to the others, laughing. Another called me ugly. His colleague, apparently referring to Renee Good, said, “You guys gotta stop obstructing us – that’s why that lesbian b---- is dead.” In the presence of these masked men with weapons strapped to their bodies – men who claim to be safeguarding our cities – I felt only terrorized and vulnerable.

When we got to the Whipple Federal Building, they shackled my ankles. I asked four times to make a phone call but was denied that legal right. I had to beg for water and to be allowed to relieve myself in another crowded cell with a toilet behind a short wall.

On my way to that cell, I passed holding cells filled with people who appeared to be of Latino and East African descent. The despondent faces and the screaming, wailing and pleading from these men, women and children – reportedly as young as 5 years old – will forever haunt me. But perhaps more haunting still was the sound of agents nearby laughing. Are our lives all just a joke to them?

Eight hours later, I was released without charges because even these agents had no credible claim I had done anything wrong.

ICE is arresting people without cause. We can stand up to tyranny.

President Donald Trump and his administration spread lies about our neighbors based on what they look like or how they speak, all while making us less safe.

In the Twin Cities alone, we’ve seen people arrested without cause while doing their jobs and a grandfather pulled out of the shower and taken into the freezing cold in nothing but his underwear and a blanket. Local schools were forced to cancel classes after ICE tackled staff and tear gassed students, according to the teachers union, while raiding Roosevelt High School.

These actions endanger us. They are designed to terrorize our community with unchecked, unaccountable brutality.

When ICE detained me, the two other people in my cell said they were Marine Corps veterans. These women said they enlisted for the same reason they felt compelled to act as ICE observers – to protect their fellow Americans.

One of those veterans – scraped up and bruised at both wrist and ankle from the ICE agents’ aggression – talked about how ironic and shocking it was that the first time she had a gun pointed at her it was by the very government she swore an oath to serve.

I’m lucky to be back at home; I can return to my job, the people I love and my community. The hundred or so people I saw in that ICE facility may never again see the homes that they’ve built and the families they’ve nurtured. After being killed by Border Patrol and ICE in the past 12 months, Alex Pretti, Renee Good, Keith Porter and dozens of others who died in custody are only memories to their families. And our Twin Cities remain under siege by masked militia answering to a regime that spreads lies and sows fear in order to divide us and distract us while its leaders gut our health care, drive up prices and hand more money to their billionaire backers.

Bondi’s letter marked the first time that the Trump administration implicitly tied its immigration enforcement actions to its quest for voters’ data.
Over the past month and a half, the Trump administration has sent over 3,000 federal agents to the state.
The department also said the state had no right to challenge the enforcement of federal immigration law.
Menendez is also overseeing a class-action lawsuit by Minneapolis residents challenging the aggressive tactics federal immigration agents have used against protesters, legal observers and members of the media.","Minnesota state attorneys alleged in a court hearing Monday that President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are attempting to force the state to surrender its sovereignty — in particular, its control over elections — through the massive federal immigration operation in the Twin Cities region.

In the hearing, the state attorneys presented the letter Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to Gov. Tim Walz (D) over the weekend as evidence of the Trump administration’s extortion campaign against Minnesota.

In that letter, Bondi demanded that the state make multiple concessions, including forfeiting its voter registration records, to the federal government in order to “restore the rule of law.” Bondi sent the letter on the same day that federal Border Patrol agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis while he was acting as a legal observer of immigration operations.

While the attorney general didn’t explicitly claim that the Trump administration would end its aggressive immigration raids if the state complied with her demands, Minnesota officials have interpreted the letter as Bondi leveraging the chaos unleashed by federal agents to extract concessions from the state.

“It’s a shakedown letter,” Brian Scott Carter of the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office argued in court Monday in a hearing over the state’s lawsuit to end the Trump administration’s ongoing aggressive immigration raids there. “That’s what you expect from someone who is extorting you.”

Among her demands, Bondi ordered the state to give the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division access to Minnesota’s unredacted voter rolls, part of the department’s broader campaign to access American voters’ confidential personal data under the false pretext of rooting out widespread election fraud. For weeks, the department has sought Minnesota’s voter data — and data from several other states — but has largely done so through legal threats.

Bondi’s letter marked the first time that the Trump administration implicitly tied its immigration enforcement actions to its quest for voters’ data.

The attorney general also demanded that the state give the Trump administration’s data on its Medicaid and supplementary food assistance programs, end “sanctuary policies” and actively devote its own law enforcement resources to supporting the immigration raids.

In its totality, the letter amounted to an assault on Minnesota’s sovereignty, demanding that it forfeit its ability to make and enforce its own laws and maintain its voter rolls without oversight from the executive branch, which does not have authority over elections.

Lindsey Middlecamp, another attorney arguing on behalf of the state Monday, described Bondi’s note as “a ransom note.”

“Their message is clear,” Middlecamp said. “Minnesota can change its laws and policies or suffer invasion of mass armed forces.”

The state has asked a federal judge to temporarily pause the immigration enforcement operation, arguing that it violates its Tenth Amendment rights by serving as the Trump administration’s primary tool to coerce the state politically.

Over the past month and a half, the Trump administration has sent over 3,000 federal agents to the state.

Alongside Bondi’s letter, Minnesota attorneys highlighted other statements and actions that they believe signal an ongoing extortion campaign against the state, including a recent social media post from Trump promising “a day of retribution” for Minnesota.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is presiding over the state’s lawsuit, largely agreed with the state attorneys that recent actions by the Trump administration, including the weekend’s fatal shooting, were deeply alarming. However, the judge also repeatedly warned that she was very limited in how she could grant the state immediate relief.

In its defense of the surge, the DOJ claimed that the operation wasn’t meant to force Minnesota to change its policies but to “make up for harms caused” by its policies. The department also said the state had no right to challenge the enforcement of federal immigration law.

Menendez appeared skeptical of the department’s defense, saying that Bondi’s letter suggested a “quid pro quo.” She also noted that the state was challenging a single law enforcement operation and not the enforcement of immigration law in general.

The judge said a ruling on the state’s request “might take time” before adjourning Monday’s hearing.

Menendez is also overseeing a class-action lawsuit by Minneapolis residents challenging the aggressive tactics federal immigration agents have used against protesters, legal observers and members of the media.

Earlier this month, she ruled that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol could not detain or use tear gas against people who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Menendez’s order in that lawsuit last week.

The killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by Border Patrol over the weekend unleashed another wave of unrest across the state. Pretti’s death came just over two weeks after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37-year-old mother-of-three Renee Good.

Both Pretti and Good were U.S. citizens who were observing the actions of federal agents before their deaths.

Hours after Pretti’s death, Bondi promoted her letter to Walz on Fox News Sunday. She said she sent the letter Sunday in order to demand that the governor “better support President Trump.”

“He better support the men and women in law enforcement because if he doesn’t, we are, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” Bondi claimed.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257959135-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 15:07:08.285756

With the second murder of a Minneapolis citizen at the hands of untrained, immunity-drunk, and predatory federal agents, Democrats must fundamentally shift their approach to immigration policy. It’s long past time for the party to move past its learned helplessness in the face of MAGA bloodlust fantasies about an invading horde of undocumented immigrants—and to vindicate the human rights of workers and neighbors confronting Gestapo-style seizures, renditions, and executions of a lawless invading force. Alex Pretti, the 37-year-old VA nurse shot 11 times in the back after being thrown to the ground by federal goons, was documenting their abuses in the hopes of halting them and returning our federal government to some semblance of moral responsibility. The bare minimum that national Democrats can do in his memory is to dismantle the ICE bureaucracy of terror once and for all.

After Pretti’s execution on Saturday, a key swing bloc of Senate Democrats had signaled that they would vote no on the House-passed appropriations bill that would deliver $10 billion in additional funding for ICE. This is on top of the tripling of the agency’s budget secured in last summer’s tax-and-spending bill. House GOP leaders had already carved out the ICE appropriation into a separate bill funding the Department of Homeland Security, so that another swing bloc of right-leaning Democrats would support it after a number of their pet spending priorities were attached to the legislation. That tactic was also garnering support from Democratic senators, with Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray of Washington all but assuring that Republicans would land the seven Democratic votes required to avoid a filibuster. Yet now that the feds have murdered another Minneapolis resident, Democratic support for the measure has collapsed, leaving GOP majority leader John Thune with the option of either blowing up the filibuster or stripping out DHS funding as a standalone bill that wouldn’t clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold, and thereby potentially touching off a partial government shutdown.

In material terms, the Senate vote wouldn’t do much to slow down the rampaging ICE invasions, given the agency’s vast $85 billion annual budget; ICE continued its marauding national tour during last year’s record-long government shutdown after all. But in political terms, the Democrats must not sidestep this battle. Democrats had previously relied on strong polling support for Trump’s immigration views to rationalize their passivity on the issue—yet public opinion is turning against ICE. A YouGov poll released on Saturday, hours before Pretti’s execution, showed 46 percent of all respondents backing the agency’s abolition, compared to 41 percent opposing it. The gap widens to 12 percent among independent voters—now the largest segment of the electorate—with 47 percent backing ICE’s abolition, and 35 percent opposing. Fifty-percent of respondents said they strongly disapprove of ICE, and just 24 percent of independents registered support for the agency. There’s every reason to believe that these negative numbers will continue to grow in the wake of Pretti’s horrific murder.

As political scientist David Faris recently argued in The Nation—again, prior to Pretti’s killing—Democrats cannot continue their dilatory enabling role in backing the rise of an immigration police state:

If the party can’t take a stand here for their own voters in the Twin Cities and elsewhere who are effectively living under an open-ended, vengeful military occupation, it may fritter away what looks like a decisive advantage in the upcoming midterm elections. Many Democratic voters now keen to have the party begin the long fight to reclaim basic constitutional protections and democratic traditions shredded by the Trump regime would be discouraged from turning out this November if the party refuses to meet this latest crisis with anything other than polite consultant-massaged demands to institute improved training protocols for ICE goons poised to terrorize our cities.

Unfortunately, the political exigency here stands athwart a dismal Democratic record of preserving status-quo state predation in immigration policy. Over the past decade of xenophobic immigrant-baiting on the right, the leaders of the Democratic Party have adopted their standard difference-trimming playbook to an issue that was always a stark question of basic human rights and basic human decency. The MAGA claim that the United States was in the grip of a violent immigrant crime wave was a blatant lie, as were scores of related dehumanizing slurs, from the nonsensical assertion that immigrants were bankrupting Social Security and health coverage to the urban legend that Haitian immigrants were eating the pets belonging to their neighbors in Springfield, Ohio. (Indeed, the ICE mobilization in Minneapolis is in response to another discredited battery of MAGA lies about a massive scheme of welfare fraud allegedly perpetrated by Somali-run daycare centers in Minnesota—though just how an armed Freikorps mobilization is expected to combat the accounting-based conduct of welfare fraud has never been explained.)

Occasionally, Democratic lawmakers would try to swat down some of the right’s most lurid and baseless claims, but they also took great care to grant the basic premise of this hate campaign: that border enforcement in this country was broken and that some vast unspecified cohort of undocumented immigrants were, in some vague and implausible way, preying on the birthright safety and prosperity of native-born Americans. That’s why President Barack Obama oversaw a greater volume of deportations than Donald Trump had, prior to the present Trump administration’s mass deportation policy; it’s also why, once you combine interior removals of immigrants with administrative returns at or near the border, the Biden White House clocked a higher number of immigrants exiting the country in the first eight months of its final year than the second Trump administration has during the same time frame in 2025. It’s why Biden and his Democratic allies on the Hill continued increasing ICE’s budget lines. And it’s why the same Democratic Senate caucus now belatedly trying to stake out a dissenting position on state-sanctioned murder meekly rolled over to ensure the passage of the Laken Riley Act, which laid the groundwork for ICE’s rolling siege on Democratic-led cities.

The reasoning behind the House appropriations bid to continue spiking ICE funding is very much of a piece with this long train of Democratic capitulations on right-wing immigration crackdowns: If the party once again submits to the right-wing consensus on immigration, it won’t suffer a defection of highly coveted (if increasingly mythical) moderate voters in the next election cycle.

But the flagrantly fascist actions of the Trump White House have upended even the milquetoast logic of traditional Democratic acquiescence. There’s no middle ground to be staked out in a murderous authoritarian siege. In addition to the dramatic shift against Trump’s immigration program in opinion surveys, there’s now a mass revulsion against ICE in unlikely forums like NFL Reddit boards. For a political establishment that’s spent the past decade bending over backward to accommodate the smallest errant grievance from Trump-voting diner patrons, that should be a five-alarm wake-up call.

And aside from self-interested electoral calculations, the moral case against allowing ICE to survive is now unanswerable. In a powerful YouTube video posted shortly after Pretti’s execution, New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie made the straightforward case that the administration’s concerted release of ideological death squads in US cities renders Trump’s presidency illegitimate. Bouie doesn’t cite manifestos from the margins of political life, but rather section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which forbids insurrectionists against the United States from holding federal office, and the language of the Declaration of Independence. That strikes me as a sound fundamental basis for the Democrats to finally act with genuine moral authority on a genuine moral issue.

The present crisis also calls to mind the counsel of Martin Luther King Jr. in “A Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” as he surveys the callow lecturing of his self-appointed Job’s consolers in the white moderate wing of liberalism. King wrote:

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s greatest stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler or Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to “order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: “I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man’s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a “more convenient season.” Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jeffries-schumer-spine.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:58:34.109352

Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz has blamed “untrained” federal officers for the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.","Protests are continuing in Minnesota after federal immigration agents fatally shot 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti in Minneapolis Saturday. He was an intensive care unit nurse in the Minneapolis Veterans Health Care System who was filming officers on his phone during a protest against President Trump’s immigration crackdown in the city. His killing comes just weeks after ICE agents fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three in Minneapolis, and after Friday’s demonstrations, where over 50,000 people took to the streets of downtown Minneapolis protesting against ICE as thousands of residents held a general economic strike.

Federal agents claimed that Pretti was a violent “gunman” who threatened to “massacre” law enforcement, but video evidence and witness statements directly contradict their account. Video footage shows Pretti being wrestled to the ground by several law enforcement officers before being shot 10 times in less than five seconds. The videos show Pretti coming to the defense of a woman who was shoved to the ground by a federal officer. The officer then sprays Pretti with a chemical agent, before tackling him to the street. Six agents surround Pretti on the ground, and at least one appears to fire at him at close range. They then step away from Pretti’s body, and one officer appears to fire six shots at Pretti’s motionless body. Pretti had no criminal record and had a legal permit to carry a firearm, which he never took out.

Pretti’s parents released a statement after his killing, saying, “We are heartbroken but also very angry. The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting. Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs. He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down all while being pepper sprayed.”

The Department of Homeland Security has blocked local investigators from probing the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Protests erupted in Minnesota in the wake of Pretti’s killing.

Protester: “What we’ve seen is that the community has been talking to each other as real people, and these people have come in and been hurting us. They’ve been attacking us when we’ve been doing nothing but following the law, peacefully observing, and then they decide to gang up and kill one of us.”

NBC News is reporting that President Trump is considering invoking the Insurrection Act to quell protests against ICE in Minneapolis. Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Tim Walz has blamed “untrained” federal officers for the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. Here’s Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday.

Mayor Jacob Frey: “How many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end? How many more lives need to be lost before this administration realizes that a political and partisan narrative is not as important as American values? How many times must local and national leaders must plead with you, Donald Trump, to end this operation?”

Meanwhile, the NRA issued a statement condemning the Trump administration’s claims that justified Pretti’s killing because he was carrying a weapon, saying, “This sentiment … is dangerous and wrong. Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”

The NBA postponed Saturday’s game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Golden State Warriors after federal agents shot and killed Pretti. The Timberwolves’ head coach Chris Finch denounced ICE’s killing of Pretti ahead of the game.

Chris Finch: “For the second time in less than three weeks, we’ve lost another beloved member of our community in the most unimaginable way. As an organization, we are heartbroken for what we are having to witness and endure and watch. And we just want to extend our thoughts, prayers and concern for Mr. Pretti.”

The NBA Players Association also released a statement saying, “Following the news of yet another fatal shooting in Minneapolis, a city that has been on the forefront of the fight against injustices, NBA players can no longer remain silent. Now more than ever, we must defend the right to freedom of speech and stand in solidarity with the people in Minnesota protesting and risking their lives to demand justice.”",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/01/80701/full_hd/hd1-AlexPretti.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:58:39.562526

One such complication: The federal officer charged by state prosecutors for a crime committed while on duty could move any such case to a federal court.
If federal officers understood that they could and might well be held liable for outrageous conduct, they might think twice before engaging in it.","In the wake of another fatal shooting by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis, many people are wondering what can be done. The answer has been right in front of us all along.

Despite the incredulity with which some legal observers meet the idea, state and local prosecutors can prosecute federal officials for violating state criminal laws. Prosecutors should be gathering and securing evidence and seriously considering filing charges — sooner rather than later.

Not every prosecution will succeed, and all will face obstacles that are built into our legal system. But critically, bringing these state and local prosecutions could produce deterrent effects that are so desperately needed now.

U.S. law, at least theoretically, provides a range of options for holding government officers accountable; the problem is that many of those options are unavailable in practice where federal officers are concerned.

Consider, for instance, federal criminal prosecution — which should be an option for federal officers who commit murder. As recently as 2019, the first Trump administration told the Supreme Court that federal criminal prosecution would be the appropriate remedy in cases in which an officer used lethal force without justification.

But the current administration didn’t investigate the Jan. 7 killing of Renee Good, and it has already stated that the Department of Homeland Security (which has no experience investigating law enforcement shootings) will run the investigation into the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti. A future president could potentially pursue charges for an offense — like the recent shootings of Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti — that has no statute of limitations. But that assumes President Trump won’t first pardon the responsible officer(s).

What’s more, a series of decisions by the Supreme Court has made it all but impossible to hold federal officers liable for damages in federal lawsuits for violating our constitutional rights — such as in a February 2020 decision involving a Border Patrol agent who shot and killed an unarmed teenager without provocation.

Instead, the historical backstop for a lack of federal accountability, going all the way back to the founding, has been state law. States prosecuting federal officers for crimes committed in the course of their federal duties would certainly face complications, but those hurdles would not be insurmountable.

One such complication: The federal officer charged by state prosecutors for a crime committed while on duty could move any such case to a federal court. But that would simply change the courthouse (and the judge and the jury pool). State prosecutors would still be seeking to enforce state law — which, among other things, means that any conviction would not be subject to the president’s pardon power.

A second potential hurdle to clear: A federal officer defendant could argue that he’s entitled to what’s known as “Supremacy Clause immunity.” Vice President JD Vance, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, have all claimed that this immunity is absolute, but they’re all wrong. As highly regarded (and conservative) former Judge Michael McConnell wrote on behalf of the Denver-based federal appeals court in 2006, “a federal officer is not entitled to Supremacy Clause immunity unless, in the course of performing an act which he is authorized to do under federal law, the agent had an objectively reasonable and well-founded basis to believe that his actions were necessary to fulfill his duties.”

In other words, the ability to prosecute federal law enforcement officers who commit state crimes in the course of their duties would turn on whether a reasonable officer in their position would have believed that their actions were necessary to fulfill their duties. That standard may be appropriately strict, to maintain federal authority when it is needed (think of federal protection for civil rights protesters in the 1960s), but at least based on the videos so many of us have seen, it should not be impossible.

Nor should state and local prosecutors think this power to bring charges under state law exists — or should exist — only when the offense results in a death. Every day, Americans are seeing an unending stream of videos showing federal officers destroying property, pepper-spraying individuals on a whim and using what at least appear to be excessive degrees of force. Many, if not most, of these acts are potential violations of state criminal laws. If those crimes are not “reasonable and well-founded” in light of federal duties, the officers can be convicted and penalized, even jailed.

What prosecutors should be doing now is what Minnesota prosecutors did after the murder of Renee Good: establishing online portals to which individuals can upload their videos and other evidence. Will there be a flood of evidence? Yes. Will it all justify prosecution? No. Will some offenders be charged? We can’t say for sure, but it looks to us like the answer ought to be yes, and that’s true even if the final result is not a conviction. (That, after all, is why we have trials and juries.)

If federal officers understood that they could and might well be held liable for outrageous conduct, they might think twice before engaging in it. The ultimate goal is bringing to justice those who have engaged in blatantly unlawful and unconstitutional conduct. But what is needed immediately — urgently — is deterring such conduct from happening going forward. Federal officers who are wearing masks to obscure their faces (and those who aren’t) must understand that they will be held accountable if and when they break the law.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/multimedia/26friedman-vladeck-lptc/26friedman-vladeck-lptc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:05.409662

“Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump wrote in a social media post. “Separately, a major investigation is going on with respect to the massive 20 Billion Dollar, Plus, Welfare Fraud that has taken place in Minnesota, and is at least partially responsible for the violent organised protests going on in the streets.”

“Additionally, the DOJ and Congress are looking at ‘Congresswoman’ Illhan Omar, who left Somalia with NOTHING, and is now reportedly worth more than 44 Million Dollars. Time will tell all.”

Omar’s net worth has increased into the millions of dollars in recent years due to her husband’s wealth. Omar serves in the US House of Representatives, representing Minnesota.

Omar responds

The congresswoman hit back at Trump, accusing him of invoking her to distract from his dwindling popularity.

“Sorry, Trump, your support is collapsing, and you’re panicking,” Omar wrote on X.

“Right on cue, you’re deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me. Years of ‘investigations’ have found nothing. Get your goons out of Minnesota.”

Previously, Trump had publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to open investigations into his political opponents.

Last week, Trump said Omar “should be investigated for Financial and Political Crimes, and that investigation should start, NOW”.

Omar, who is of Somali descent, is one of Trump’s favourite targets, and he often deploys Islamophobic language to attack her.

The Muslim American congresswoman has been a vocal critic of Trump’s policies and rhetoric, including his attacks against the Somali community.

After Trump attacked Omar and called the Somali community “garbage” last month, Omar accused him of having a “creepy” obsession with her.

“I hope he gets the help he desperately needs,” she said at the time.

In recent months, Trump has been incessantly bringing up Omar and the Somali community, seizing on a COVID-19-era welfare embezzlement scandal in Minnesota in which dozens of people, including some Somali immigrants, have been charged.

Late last year, Trump mocked Omar’s headscarf in one of his rants over Minnesota and its Democratic Governor Tim Walz, saying she is “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab”.

At the same time, the Trump administration launched an immigration crackdown in Minnesota that appeared to be targeting the state’s sizeable Somali community.

But immigration officers’ aggressive tactics in the state have generated nationwide condemnation. Early this month, a federal officer fatally shot Renee Good, a US citizen and a mother of three, as she tried to flee immigration agents who had surrounded her car.

The Trump administration accused her of trying to ram the officer, but video footage cast doubt over that claim.

Then came the killing of Pretti, who was shot multiple times after a tussle with immigration agents. The White House described the victim as a “domestic terrorist” and said he was carrying a gun.

But videos shot from multiple angles showed Pretti had a phone in one hand while their other hand was raised and empty before the shooting.

Trump speaks to Walz

The killings of both Good and Pretti took place in Minneapolis, part of which is represented by Omar.

“I am absolutely horrified that federal agents are targeting and executing our residents instead of protecting them,” the congresswoman said in a statement on Saturday.

She called on federal immigration officers to leave the city and for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to be impeached.

Later on Monday, Trump said he spoke to Minnesota Governor Walz and the two “seemed to be on a similar wavelength”.

“I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future.”

Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post on Sunday night comes as tensions escalate between anti-ICE protesters and federal immigration enforcement agents in the wake of over the weekend. Pretti is the second United States citizen to be killed by an ICE agent in Minnesota in just the past few weeks.

Trump blamed Democrat leadership, particularly Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, for failing to “stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence,” which he said ultimately lead to the deaths of Pretti and Renee Good.

“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations to arrest the Worst of the Worst People!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

“By doing this, Democrats are putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved.”

In a subsequent post, Trump made a list of demands on Democratic leadership including demanding Walz and Frey turn over all illegal aliens currently incarcerated, with an active warrant, or arrested by state and local law enforcement. He also requested that local police work with federal law enforcement “in apprehending and detaining Illegal Aliens who are wanted for Crimes.”

“Democrat Politicians must partner with the Federal Government to protect American Citizens in the rapid removal of all Criminal Illegal Aliens in our Country. Some Democrats, in places like Memphis, Tennessee, or Washington, D.C., have done so, resulting in safer streets for ALL,” Trump wrote.

Trump said all of his “requests are rooted in COMMON SENSE” and will ensure that Americans stay safe.

“The Trump Administration is standing by, and waiting for ANY Democrat to do the right thing, and work with us on these important matters of MAKING AMERICA SAFE like it is in all sections of our Country where we are, together with Local Leadership, participating and involved,” Trump wrote.

However, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CBS’ “Face The Nation” that “it’s not on the Minneapolis Police Department or local law enforcement to hand folks over that are in jails.”

“The city police do not operate a jail that’s at the county level and the prisons are at the state level, so we are complying with the law as we have been for many years,” O’Hara host Margaret Brennan on Sunday. “And I don’t know what else could possibly be asked of this very, very, you know, understaffed and overstretched police department.”",https://thenationaldesk.com/resources/media2/16x9/5590/986/0x292/90/67e70a87-f015-428b-8d15-6f922e0be3b6-GettyImages2257687936.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:59:05.690743

Walz and other Democratic leaders have fiercely opposed the immigration surge, which they characterize as a lawless invasion that puts public safety at risk. Trump, for his part, has spent the past month accusing Walz of incompetence for failing to stop a welfare-fraud scandal in the state.

Walz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Trump earlier said he would dispatch the White House border czar, Tom Homan, to work with local officials following Saturday's shooting of a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, by immigration agents during a confrontation with protesters in Minneapolis. While other top Trump officials have characterized Pretti as a ""domestic terrorist,"" Homan has not publicly spoken about the incident.

In a statement, Trump said Homan ""has not been involved"" in the Minnesota crackdown ""but knows and likes many of the people there.""

Trump's statements came as state officials pressed a U.S. judge to temporarily stop the surge of 3,000 immigration agents.

""This administration, your honor, is not content with the rule of law. They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. Instead, they put violence into the streets of Minnesota to get what they want,"" Brian Carter, a lawyer with the state attorney general's office, told U.S. Judge Katherine Menendez.

JUDGE QUESTIONS WHETHER SHE HAS AUTHORITY TO STOP OPERATION

Menendez, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, appeared skeptical of the state's argument that she had the power to shut down the operation on the grounds that it violates the state's sovereignty.

“I don't know how you are asking me to identify when the federal government has crossed the line,"" she told Carter.

Menendez asked a Trump administration lawyer if the federal government was seeking to coerce the state into changing its immigration policies by sending thousands of agents to Minneapolis.

“Is the executive trying to achieve a goal through force that it cannot achieve through the courts?” Menendez asked Trump administration lawyer Brantley Mayers. Mayers answered with a no, saying the administration was there to enforce federal immigration law.

Menendez concluded the hearing after nearly three hours of argument. She did not say when she would rule.

The surge of agents has spurred massive street protests in below-freezing temperatures, and fierce condemnations by the state's Democratic leaders. Sixty of the state's largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and U.S. Bancorp, called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration on Sunday.

REPUBLICAN BREAKS WITH PARTY, DROPS GOVERNOR BID

A leading Republican candidate for governor, Chris Madel, dropped his bid on Monday, saying the crackdown had gone too far and had made the race unwinnable for a Republican.

""I cannot support the national Republicans’ stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so,"" he said in a video statement.

Homeland Security Department officials have described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun.

But video from the scene, verified by Reuters, contradicts that account. The footage shows Pretti holding a phone -- not a gun -- as agents wrestle him to the ground. It also shows officers removing a firearm stored near his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will remain in her job ""with the full trust and confidence of the President,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday that his administration is ""reviewing everything"" about the incident and said immigration officials would eventually withdraw.

Recent Reuters polling indicates that a significant slice of Trump's Republican backers - 39% - , saying harm should be minimized even if this means fewer immigration-related arrests.

In Washington, Democrats in the Senate have said they will oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, raising the likelihood of a partial government shutdown starting on Sunday. Republicans approved a massive budget increase for immigration enforcement last year, but some of them now are demanding answers from the Trump administration.

Love adopted American children My wife and I adopted our Latino children after the death of our son, Jimmy.
Our children are American citizens.","A U.S. Navy veteran and father expresses fear for his adopted Latino children due to the current climate surrounding immigration.

The author argues that current immigration enforcement actions threaten constitutional protections and have led to documented deaths.

He contends that recent visa bans and suspensions have negatively impacted international adoptions, leaving families in limbo.

Citing his Christian faith, the author calls for compassion for immigrants, contrasting current policies with the teachings of Jesus.

I love this country. I served in the U.S. Navy because I believed in what America stood for.

Today, as a father of American children, I can no longer stay silent.

This is personal.

This is about the Constitution.

This is about faith.

I never imagined I would feel this afraid for my children in the United States of America.

Love adopted American children

My wife and I adopted our Latino children after the death of our son, Jimmy. Our children are American citizens. They are American kids. They are loved. They are innocent. And today, they are scared because of what they see, what they hear, and what they feel happening in this country.

If I am being honest, I am scared for them, too.

I love this country.

In my younger years, I was a Ronald Reagan Republican. President Reagan inspired me to serve in the Navy because I believed in what our country stood for.

Reagan understood that America could be both a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. In 1986, he signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which legalized nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants who had lived and worked here for years.

Reagan believed in accountability, but he also believed in legalization and eventual citizenship for families who had put down roots. He was not for mass deportation of neighbors who came here to work and raise families.

We are supposed to be the good guys.

What we are witnessing today is different.

Deaths, constitutional issues arise

There have been documented deaths during immigration enforcement actions, including cases involving U.S. citizens, serious enough that international human rights officials have urged the United States to investigate and uphold the rule of law. That alone should alarm every American, regardless of political affiliation.

We are also seeing increasing threats to Fourth Amendment protections. Immigration agents are relying more frequently on administrative warrants that are not signed by judges to enter homes. Legal experts have raised serious concerns that this practice undermines constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. When constitutional safeguards are weakened for one group, they are weakened for all.

This issue is deeply personal for my family.

Recent visa bans and suspensions affecting certain countries have had real consequences for international adoption. When immigrant visas are barred or paused for nationals of specific countries, children adopted by U.S. citizens from those countries are often unable to receive the visas required to enter this country.

While these policies may not explicitly ban adoption, the practical effect is the same. Families are left in limbo. Children remain institutionalized. Loving homes are denied.

I believe violent criminals who are not citizens should be deported.

I do not believe in terrorizing families, targeting neighbors who were recruited here for labor or punishing children for circumstances beyond their control. For generations, our economy has depended on immigrant labor. To invite people in one era and discard them in another is not justice.

I am a follower of Christ, and my faith compels me to speak.

Jesus consistently aligned Himself with the vulnerable, the marginalized and the unpopular. Scripture is clear. We are commanded to love our neighbor as ourselves. We are commanded to welcome the foreigner and treat them as native born. Jesus taught that when we welcome the stranger, we welcome Him.

Christ did not fear foreigners. He protected the vulnerable. And when He saw exploitation masked as righteousness, He responded with righteous anger.

God, Constitution must guide actions

We are all God's children. Every one of us.

Citizen and non-citizen. Immigrant and native born. Adopted and biological. Black, brown and white.

We have a problem.

And the only way forward is together.

My children deserve to grow up in a country that honors the Constitution, protects families and lives up to its moral and spiritual commitments. Not one where fear replaces compassion and silence replaces courage.

We need to come together.

We need to stand up.

I can no longer stand by quietly.

Not as a father.

Not as an American.

Not as a Christian.","https://www.floridatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/PPHX/88355593007-202601251626021000-arizona-faith-network-prayer-vigil-outside-ice.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y0&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 15:06:38.376658

Believe what we tell you, not your own eyes.

Once again, that is what the Trump administration is saying after another protester was shot and killed by federal immigration agents during an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis.

It’s the second time in less than three weeks that federal agents killed a protester in Minneapolis. And for the second time, cellphone videos from bystanders on the scene appear to contradict the federal account of the killing.

On Jan. 7, Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother and poet, was shot three times in the face and died as she drove past an ICE agent. The government claimed Good tried to use her car to ram the agent, and that the agent was reacting in self-defense. But videos of that shooting showed Good trying to turn away from the agent and flee the scene.

Then came more horrific events on Saturday.

Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was shot at least 10 times and died while being pinned to the ground by Border Patrol agents. The Department of Homeland Security said Pretti approached agents with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun” and was killed after they attempted to disarm him.

But just like Good’s killing, cellphone videos of the events were analyzed by news organizations, and the analysis did not line up with the government’s assessment.

The New York Times’ Devon Lum and Haley Willis wrote, “Footage shows Mr. Pretti was clearly holding a phone, not a gun, before the agents took him to the ground and shot him.”

The Times later added in that same analysis, “Several agents tussle with Mr. Pretti before bringing him to his knees. He appears to resist as the agents grab his legs, push down on his back and strike him repeatedly. The footage shows an agent approaching with empty hands and grabbing at Mr. Pretti as the others hold him down. About eight seconds after he is pinned, agents yell that he has a gun, indicating that they may not have known he was armed until he was on the ground.

The Times continues, “The same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a gun from among the group that appears to match the profile of a firearm DHS said belonged to Mr. Pretti. The agents appear to have him under their control, with his arms pinned near his head. As the gun emerges from the melee, another agent aims his own firearm at Mr. Pretti’s back and appears to fire one shot at close range. He then appears to continue firing at Mr. Pretti, who collapses. A third agent unholsters a weapon. Both agents appear to fire additional shots into Mr. Pretti as he lies motionless.”

The Associated Press’ Hannah Fingerhut wrote, “In the videos, Pretti is seen with only a phone in his hand. During the scuffle, ‘gun, gun’ is heard, and an officer appears to pull a handgun from Pretti’s waist area and begins moving away. As that happens, a first shot is fired by a Border Patrol officer. There’s a slight pause, and then the same officer fires several more times into Pretti’s back.”

Still, despite all the video evidence, many in the Trump administration placed the blame on Pretti.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and said he “brandished” a gun and intended to “kill law enforcement.” Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said, “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” FBI director Kash Patel said, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want. It’s that simple. You don’t have that right to break the law and incite violence.”

The Wall Street Journal, in its detailed video analysis, wrote, “Federal agents claimed Alex Pretti, 37, forced their hand, alleging he ‘violently resisted’ disarmament until the officers fired ‘defensive shots.’ Bystander footage appears to tell a different story. A frame-by-frame review by The Wall Street Journal shows a federal officer pulling a handgun away from Pretti. Less than a second later, an agent fires several rounds.”

Sunday morning fireworks

The Sunday morning shows featured some testy exchanges as many in the Trump administration seemed to justify the shooting of Pretti.

On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” moderator Kristen Welker pressed Department of Justice official Todd Blanche, who said, “This is not a peaceful protest. … He was not protesting peacefully.”

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino tangled with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Bovino has previously said Pretti was on the scene to “​​inflict maximum damage on individuals and kill law enforcement.”

Bash told Bovino, “There’s no evidence that he was perpetrating violence! And there’s no evidence, unless you have it, and we’d love to see it if there is, that he was intending to massacre law enforcement, other than the fact that he was there and he had a gun lawfully.”

That led to a heated exchange with Bovino consistently insisting that Pretti was assaulting federal law enforcement.

At another point, while talking about video of the events, Bovino told Bash, “We’re not going to adjudicate that here on TV in one freeze frame.”

Bash responded by saying, “It’s not a freeze frame. We’re showing a video of one of your agents taking the gun away. And that happened before Pretti was shot.

Then there was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent going at it with ABC’s Jonathan Karl on “This Week.” Bressent said at one point that Pretti’s mistake was bringing a gun instead of a billboard to a protest. To which Karl reminded Bessent of the Second Amendment.

Strong words

The editorial boards of The New York Times and The Washington Post both came out strongly against the Trump administration following the latest shooting in Minneapolis.

The Times board wrote, “The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.”

The Times board continued, “The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears.” And then later added, “Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.”

Meanwhile, the Post’s editorial board called Pretti’s killing “unjust” and added, “It’s essential that federal immigration officers don’t think they can act with impunity, because that will only encourage more fatal encounters. An independent probe of this shooting is an important step.”

The Post also wrote, “Most Americans want a secure border, and they think violent criminals should be deported. That’s a large part of why Trump returned to the White House. The overreach of the past year, however, could consume his presidency and lead to more tragedy. If Trump won’t change course on his own, can Republicans in Congress save him from himself?”

The Journal’s take

Meanwhile, the usually conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote, “Time for ICE to Pause in Minneapolis.”

It wrote, “Pretti made a tragic mistake by interfering with ICE agents, but that warranted arrest, not a death sentence. The agents may say they felt threatened, but it’s worth noting the comments over the weekend by police around the country who say that this isn’t how they conduct law enforcement. Either many ICE agents aren’t properly trained, or they are so on edge as they face opposition in the streets that they are on a hair trigger. Either way, this calls for rethinking how ICE conducts itself, especially in Minneapolis as tensions build.”

The latest from Trump

Wall Street Journal reporter Josh Dawsey spoke with Trump on the phone for about five minutes on Sunday. Trump told Dawsey that his administration will review “everything” about the shooting.

Trump told Dawsey, “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”

Trump also indicated that ICE agents will leave Minnesota at some point. He told Dawsey, “At some point we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done a phenomenal job.”

Trump didn’t specify when that time might come.

Kentucky Republican Rep. James Comer told Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” that Trump should consider removing ICE from Minnesota if there’s a “chance of losing more … innocent lives.”

Comer later said, “I’m like you and every other American. I’ve watched that video dozens of times in slow motion. I’ve tried to determine whether he actually pulled a gun out or not. Yeah, I don’t know. I just know that the situation’s bad there.”

Video tells the story

The one question that keeps cropping up in my mind is: What if no one had been filming what has happened in Minneapolis the past month? Yes, it can be infuriating to listen to those in the administration insist that what we are seeing with our own eyes isn’t what happened. But the videos — and the expert analysis performed by news organizations of those videos — do give us a clear picture of what our government is doing.

CNN media reporter Brian Stelter wrote, “Minnesota officials, sensing that residents feel relatively powerless amid the ICE surge in the state, have urged residents to bear witness, suggesting that the phones in their pockets are a form of power.”

Just last week, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in an address. “Carry your phone with you at all times. And if you see ICE in your neighborhood, take out that phone and hit record. Help us create a database of the atrocities against Minnesotans — not just to establish a record for posterity, but to bank evidence for future prosecution.”

Following Saturday’s shooting, Walz said, “Thank God, thank God we have video.”

More notable Minneapolis coverage

The New York Times’ Peter Baker with “For Trump, the Truth in Minneapolis Is What He Says It Is.” Baker notes, “Mr. Trump has found that putting out a story line early and repeating it often can, with the help of an ideological media and online surround-sound machine, convince a sizable share of the public that does not credit contrary evidence. Even after investigations, recounts and his own advisers and attorney general refuted Mr. Trump’s claim that he won the 2020 election, polls show that most Republicans still believe the election was stolen. And so Mr. Trump and his team have taken the same reality-bending approach to the violence in Minneapolis in evident hopes of persuading the president’s political base, at least, that the protesters were responsible for their own deaths …”

The Minnesota Star Tribune has had superb coverage. Here’s Reid Forgrave and Sarah Ritter with “After latest Minneapolis shooting: Exhaustion, resilience and deepening fear.”

Post problems

Stunning and grim reporting is out about the state of affairs at The Washington Post.

First, The New York Times reported that the Post will not cover the upcoming Winter Olympics in Italy — something that seems unfathomable for one of the most respected and legendary sports sections. Then, Puck’s Dylan Byers reported that massive layoffs are coming to the Post and tweeted, “rumor inside Post is that sports desk could be shuttered entirely… foreign desk will be hit hard too.” Byers added that the expectations are that “hundreds” will be affected.

First, the Olympics news.

In the past, the Post has sent 10 to 20 journalists to the Olympics. And this year, it asked for 14 credentials for the Winter Games, according to the Times. The Times’ Benjamin Mullin and Erik Wemple reported that Post managing editor Kimi Yoshino sent an email to more than a dozen of the Post’s journalists that said, “As we assess our priorities for 2026, we have decided not to send a contingent to the Winter Olympics. We realize this decision and its timing will be disappointing to many of you, so please reach out to me if you want to talk further.”

What makes this note so shocking is that it comes less than two weeks before the Feb. 6 start of the Olympics. As the Times noted, “Many had already paid for their travel arrangements, according to two people familiar with their plans.”

The Times wrote, “According to the Post employee, the newspaper has already paid the vast majority of its expenses to cover the competition. Those include flights for the journalists, housing and office space at the Olympics site. Housing alone tallies at least $80,000, the employee said. Post management approved the outlays at each step along the way, according to the employee.”

USA Today columnist Christine Brennan, who was once the Olympics writer for the Post, tweeted, “This is just a stunning and awful development.”

Then there’s the Byers tweet talking about shutting down the Post sports section entirely, as well as cutting a major chunk from the foreign coverage. Sports and foreign coverage are two of the Post’s longtime staples. The Post sports section has been home to some of the most legendary sportswriters in the business: Shirley Povich, Tony Kornheiser, Michael Wilbon, Sally Jenkins, Thomas Boswell and the aforementioned Brennan, just to name a few.

The Post isn’t commenting, but it should be noted that Byers wrote that closing the sports desk is just a “rumor.” I still find it hard to believe the Post would take that step, but reports are that the layoffs will be substantial.

Meanwhile, Mullin and Wemple at the Times report that foreign correspondents at the Post have sent a letter — a “collective plea” — to Post owner Jeff Bezos about the rumors. Among the points made in the letter: “Robust, powerful foreign coverage is essential to the Washington Post’s brand and its future success in whatever form the paper takes moving forward.”

The letter also said, “Cutting this deeply sourced, battle-hardened and tireless staff would hinder The Post’s ability to respond to the biggest news developments on the horizon.”

The letter concludes by saying, “Jeff, we are endlessly grateful for your investment in our newspaper and longtime belief in our shared mission. At your first town hall in 2013, you told our newsroom, ‘You can be profitable and shrinking. And that’s a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best. And at worst, it leads to extinction.’ We urge you to consider how the proposed layoffs will certainly lead us first to irrelevance and later extinction — not the shared success that remains attainable.”

And Mullin tweeted Sunday afternoon, “I have been told that employees on The Washington Post foreign staff have been told explicitly that their jobs are at risk. There was also a directive barring reporters from going to high-risk zones as of Feb. 1, which some have taken as a precursor to cuts.”

And check out this tweet from longtime New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, “In my decades as a @nytimes foreign correspondent and then columnist, I’ve been regularly scooped and outshone by the brilliance of @washpost rivals. The WashPost foreign correspondents are a public good, and the world benefits from their work. I hope Jeff Bezos keeps them.”

Too far away

We now know which teams (New England and Seattle) will be in this year’s Super Bowl, but we also know who will not be at the big game: President Donald Trump. The president told the New York Post that he will not attend the Feb. 8 game in Santa Clara, California, because, “It’s just too far away.”

Now, it should be noted that U.S. presidents rarely attend the Super Bowl. In fact, a year ago, Trump became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. But to use the excuse that it’s “too far away” seems odd. I mean, isn’t the game being played in a country where Trump is president? The game is being played in California, not on Mars.

Trump also took the opportunity to slam the halftime show selections of Bad Bunny and Green Day, saying, “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible.”

The judges, representing appointees of nearly every president since Ronald Reagan, have grown increasingly alarmed by what they see as a pattern of defiance by the administration, shocking behavior by ICE and rampant targeting of people with no criminal history, despite Trump’s claim to be targeting “the worst of the worst.”

“Since November 2025, the courts of this District have thought of little else,” Judge Michael Davis said in a Sunday ruling criticizing the Trump administration’s “disingenuous” claim that one of his colleagues had given only a cursory review of its arguments. “It is a grave error to confuse efficiency with lack of rigor.”

The judges’ alarm has formed the backdrop to a broader clash between the Trump administration and Minnesota’s elected leaders, who have decried the operation that has led to the shooting deaths of two U.S. citizens by federal agents. Those deaths, followed by unproven claims and factually disputed accusations about the circumstances by Trump administration officials, have inflamed tensions across the nation and become the flashpoint in a larger battle for the identity of America.

Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Judges who are now weighing those larger cases have already seen their dockets swamped by individual immigration cases arising from Operation Metro Surge.

They include Kate Menendez, who recently ordered ICE to refrain from using retaliatory force against protesters. Her order was later blocked by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Biden-appointed judge is holding an even more significant hearing Monday, in the state’s effort to end Operation Metro Surge altogether.

“I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” Menendez said at the start of Monday’s hearing.

Menendez’s comment came just three days after she ordered the release of a Kenyan woman arrested while picking up seizure medication at a CVS, saying the administration lacked a legal basis to lock her up.

Another judge, Trump appointee Eric Tostrud, issued a restraining order on Saturday requiring the Trump administration to preserve evidence gathered from the scene of Alex Pretti’s shooting death. He is also weighing a class action lawsuit against racial profiling during the surge. Tostrud’s docket has been deluged with individual immigration cases for weeks, and he has ruled in every one of them that the administration had been illegally detaining people targeted for deportation without the opportunity for bond hearings.

The massive workload facing Minnesota judges may actually understate the impact of Operation Metro Surge: Department of Homeland Security officials have been quickly transferring some detainees out of state — often to deportation staging areas in Texas — which prevents them from filing for relief in Minnesota courts.

That was the case in another petition handled by Davis, who expressed shock at the administration’s treatment of a Burmese woman with three children, including a five-month-old baby, and a heart condition. The woman, who was admitted as a refugee in 2024, was abruptly moved to Texas after her Jan. 10 arrest. Davis ordered her return on Friday.

“There is simply no legal reason for keeping this mother 1800 miles away from her children,” the Clinton appointee said. “While the Court recognizes that many families are suffering due to … ICE actions in the District of Minnesota, there is something particularly craven about transferring a nursing refugee mother out-of-state.”

In a Saturday ruling, U.S. District Judge John Gerrard — a Nebraska-based judge helping Minnesota work through its crowded docket — ordered the release of a pregnant woman apprehended on her way to work, as well as her husband and two minor sons. The Trump administration signaled it was “attempting to locate” the family, and Gerrard gave them until Monday night to comply.

A second visiting judge, Missouri-based Stephen Bough, threatened contempt sanctions against the administration for sending a woman out of state despite his order to keep her in Minnesota.

The most common challenge raised by ICE’s targets is that they have been detained without due process — often arrested without a warrant and without the opportunity for bond hearings to remain released while deportation proceedings are pending. Judges across the country have overwhelmingly rejected the Trump administration’s bid to lock up nearly everyone it is targeting for deportation — a sharp break from every administration of the last 30 years, which prioritized detention only for those deemed dangerous or likely to flee.

A POLITICO analysis has identified 347 judges across the country who have rejected the administration’s detention policy — in more than 2,400 cases — while just 20 judges have sided with the administration, a small minority that has nevertheless grown in recent weeks. The emergency nature of the cases has so far stymied efforts to get appeals courts or the Supreme Court to weigh in on the policy, which has resulted in district courts’ dockets being clogged across the country. Hundreds of new emergency petitions for release are filed every day.

The judges in Minnesota are now bearing the brunt of the deluge. All but one — the Reagan-appointed Judge Paul Magnuson — have rejected the administration’s mass detention policy. And their frustrations are beginning to spill into the open more frequently.

Davis, in a third recently decided case, vented that the administration appeared not to be affording bond hearings to its targets — even after federal judges had ordered them.

“There has been an undeniable move by the Government in the past month to defy court orders or at least to stretch the legal process to the breaking point in an attempt to deny noncitizens their due process rights,” Davis wrote in a Sunday ruling. “With the evidence currently before the Court, it can only conclude that Respondents are attempting to ‘undermin[e] the regulatory and statutory authority of the immigration courts to coerce perpetual, infinite detention.’”

But it was the direct confrontation between the Trump administration and Minnesota’s chief federal judge, Patrick Schiltz, that laid bare the most obvious tensions. The George W. Bush appointee, in two Friday letters to the 8th Circuit, accused the administration of a “frivolous” bid to force the arrest of former CNN anchor Don Lemon and others linked to an anti-ICE demonstration at a St. Paul church.

“I am also dealing with a number of emergencies, including a lockdown at the Minneapolis courthouse because of protest activity, the defiance of several court orders by ICE, and the illegal detention of many detainees by ICE,” Schiltz wrote.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa7%2F6f%2Fcbb6ec2a4ebaa6e018c7e0c828a0%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2255793430,N,,2026-01-26 11:59:26.054865

Demonstrators brought signs and chanted against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Trump administration a day after 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday morning.

“It's good to see,” said Kathleen Devarenne, a protester. “I wish it were a lot more,” she said, referring to the turnout.

“I'm still worried,” she said.

The protest was organized by Kent County Indivisible. It’s the city’s latest anti-ICE demonstration, less than three weeks after the killing of Minneapolis resident Renee Good by an ICE agent, which spurred rallies across West Michigan.

Another protester, Jaylyn Gough, said she felt a need to make her voice heard.

“My thoughts and my prayers are with [Gough’s] family, and it's absolute murder,” said Gough. “As a Native woman, I often feel alone in this walk, and today, looking at all of this, I finally feel that I'm not alone.

“I think we're out here just to share and to show that people do not agree with what is happening right now,” she said. “We hope that this message gets to Minnesota, not only Minnesota, but everywhere across the country who is dealing with ICE.”

Devarenne hopes that the nationwide protests send a message to President Donald Trump.

“He needs to see that a good amount of the population does not support these terrible actions that don't follow due process and harm and kill innocent people,” she said. “I believe that our government has turned away from the Constitution.”

Some held signs expressing solidarity with Minnesota. Others reminded people of ICE’s presence in West Michigan.

“It's not just Minnesota,” said Devarenne. “We have a giant detention facility in Baldwin, I believe the largest in the Midwest.”

She referred to the North Lake Processing Center in Baldwin.

With the marshals under attack, Kennedy deployed first the Mississippi National Guard and then thousands of federal troops as well.","America has never seen a moment in modern history like the federal occupation of Minneapolis. Thousands of masked federal officers with uncertain authority are rampaging through the region, assaulting protesters and innocent people, abusing constitutional safeguards, staking out daycares and schools, snatching people off the streets in unmarked vans based on the color of their skin or their accent, and recklessly, relentlessly provoking violent confrontations with civilians—all against the loud, repeatedly expressed wishes of local and state officials.

Saturday morning, federal agents—apparently from the Border Patrol—shot and killed a 37-year-old nurse, Alex Pretti, amid a chaotic scuffle in front of a well-known Minneapolis donut store after agents began hassling and shoving him in the street. It was the second time this month that federal agents resorted to deadly force within mere seconds after initiating an encounter with a Minneapolis civilian who never posed a threat to agents.

All of this unnecessary violence raises the question: Why can’t elected officials do more to stop this? Apart from the courts, doesn’t Minnesota’s government have cards it can play in the battle against the Trump-led occupation, like calling out the National Guard for a showdown with federal agents?

The answer, in its shortest form, is mostly no, due to the basic foundations of American federalism. Over and over, Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota governor Tim Walz have asked President Donald Trump to call back his operation. On Saturday, they again told the public that they had pleaded with the federal government to reconsider and withdraw the upwards of 3,000 immigration officers, who together nearly outnumber the region’s 10 largest state and local police departments combined.

But Walz and Frey haven’t taken overt actions to use state and local governments to actively resist because a key part of federalism in the United States is that a state can’t really resist federal authority or kick out federal law enforcement officials. That principle primarily exists because the federal government is meant to be the “protector” of last resort if local and state officials fail to uphold the rights of ordinary citizens. What’s remarkable, and worrisome, is that Trump today is using that arrangement to punish political opponents based on his own whims, as un-American an action as any president has ever undertaken and one that threatens the very union of the United States.

Tension in Minnesota between national officials and state and local elected officials is already sky high—and there’s rising animus between the federal forces and local law enforcement as well.

Minneapolis police were quick to condemn the shootings of both Pretti and Renee Nicole Good, who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent on January 7. They have also been vocal in recent days about how their own officers have been harassed and even assaulted by immigration agents while off-duty. (“Every one of [the off-duty officers stopped by immigration agents] is a person of color,” one police chief complained.) DHS agents tried to bar local police from the shooting scene on Saturday, forcing them to return with a court order, and this time FBI agents again apparently resisted allowing access. “We’re in uncharted territory here,” the head of the state’s investigation bureau said.

A governor also has the state's National Guard at their disposal, which could hypothetically be deployed to counter ICE's actions. Yesterday, Minnesota governor Tim Walz announced that he activated them following the shooting, amid a tense series of hours that saw the NBA postpone its evening game in Minneapolis for safety reasons. In a statement whose banality and simplicity underplayed just how stunning it was, the governor’s office said the guard was needed because “local law enforcement resources are stretched thin because of the disruption to public safety caused by thousands of federal immigration agents in our neighborhoods.” So far it seems like Walz’s intent is to use the National Guard and local and state police as more of a buffer between federal forces and Minnesota residents, rather than as a supplement to the street resistance efforts.

For now, state and local officials—like those who also suffered from heavy-handed immigration deployments last year, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and elsewhere—are primarily focused on using federal courts for relief. Overnight, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to ensure that federal officials didn’t destroy or alter evidence related to Saturday’s shooting. More broadly, Minnesota has a pending lawsuit aimed at blocking the immigration deployments altogether.

This restraint is almost certainly intended to prevent even further escalation, driven by President Trump’s apparent eagerness to declare Minnesota in a state of “insurrection” that would allow him to activate and deploy federal troops against its residents. Trump has already launched unprecedented criminal investigations against Walz and Frey, and others, in an apparent bid to create pretexts that could aid the use of the Insurrection Act.

The situation is so unprecedented—and the Trump administration’s political incentives so skewed by social media and the president’s own manias—that it’s impossible to understand or predict how the coming days and weeks might unfold. It’s especially unclear how state or local elected leaders might make the situation better for their constituents and neighbors—and, because of the Trump administration’s lawlessness, there are many paths where the situation worsens.

President Trump and his Department of Homeland Security in many ways appear to be attempting to provoke an actual showdown between federal forces and local or state authorities. DHS and White House officials have repeatedly labeled protesters exercising their First Amendment rights in Minnesota “domestic terrorists,” and they were quick to smear the victim of Saturday’s shooting; they shut down an investigation of the ICE officer who killed Renee Nicole Good earlier this month and ordered a federal investigation of Good and her spouse instead, leading to the resignation of the FBI agent assigned to the case; at least six federal prosecutors also resigned, refusing to participate in the attempt to scapegoat a victim.

In a deeply troubling development, ICE agents have started declaring that people who so much as record them are being entered into a national database as “domestic terrorists.” “Have fun with that,” an ICE officer in Maine was captured joking to a civilian filming him. (That the assault on Minneapolis has little to do with violent crime or immigration issues was underscored Saturday when attorney general Pam Bondi sent state officials a letter saying they’d withdraw the federal forces if Minnesota complied with a Trump request to turn over its voter rolls.)

While Walz and Frey’s seeming passivity in the face of an all-out federal attack on their constituents is provoking anger among activists, it may be a case where caution and restraint is the better part of valor. Citizens are already generating massive resistance to the federal presence in Minnesota, and any additional “official” resistance by local or state officials may tip the scales for Trump and bring federal troops into the picture, an escalation that would be surely worse for residents, the state, and the nation at large. Trump has already put some 1,500 federal troops in Alaska on standby to deploy to Minnesota, and all indications are that he’s eager for an excuse to do so.

Any such declaration of “insurrection” or deployment of federal troops to further subdue local and state authorities would bring the country the closest it’s been to civil war since, well, the Civil War.

Under normal circumstances, the use of federal military forces in domestic situations is highly proscribed and limited by two sets of law, the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878—which prohibits the use of the military in civilian law enforcement—and the Insurrection Act, a series of statutes that date to 1792 and outline when a president can call out troops to suppress rebellions and domestic violence.

Considering how critical a principle it guards, the Insurrection Act is badly antiquated, as recent reform efforts have shown. As national security legal scholar Scott Anderson wrote in 2024, “Few principles of American government are more foundational than the idea that the US military should not be used against Americans, except in the most dire of circumstances. But even fewer foundational principles are so loosely grounded in the law … The fact that past presidents have done so relatively rarely is more a product of long-standing political norms than hard legal limits.”

While state National Guard units and federal troops are routinely used to help respond to natural disasters at the request of and in coordination with local and state officials, since Reconstruction presidents have only reluctantly ever sent in federal agents or troops against the wishes of state governments. Even then, it’s in highly limited circumstances, such as defending civil rights and freedoms in moments when state officials refused to do so. (National Guard units usually report to state governors, although they can be federalized by presidential order to report to the commander-in-chief instead—meaning that Trump could always circumvent Walz activating them by putting them under direct Pentagon control anyway.)

In fact, while National Guard troops were used repeatedly in the 20th century by governors and presidents to break labor strikes—often brutally—it wasn’t until the Civil Rights movement and the 1960s that federal troops began to play a more routine role in responding to civil disturbances.

In 1957, when Arkansas governor Orval Faubus used the state’s National Guard to block the integration of Little Rock Central High School, President Dwight Eisenhower responded by federalizing all 10,000 Arkansas National Guardsmen and deploying troops from the 101st Airborne Division to force the school’s integration and protect the nine Black students attempting to enroll there. The mission was a key learning opportunity for the military, and when the Army manual on “Civil Disturbances” was republished in 1958, it had doubled in size and now contained a new section on riot control.

In every year of his short presidency, President John F. Kennedy deployed federal marshals or troops against the wishes of state officials as the civil rights movement gained momentum. In 1961, some 400 federal marshals were sent to Alabama to protect the Freedom Riders, and when James Meredith attempted to enroll as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962, Kennedy sent federal marshals who then faced incredibly violent white protesters.

With the marshals under attack, Kennedy deployed first the Mississippi National Guard and then thousands of federal troops as well. (That military operation, codenamed RAPID ROAD, was actually the first and only time during the Cold War that the military activated and used plans it had developed to quell civil disturbances in the wake of a nuclear attack.)

Then, in 1963, Kennedy again relied on the National Guard to help with the integration of the University of Alabama, and his successor, Lyndon Johnson, used marshals and the National Guard to protect civil rights marchers in Selma after Alabama state troopers infamously attacked them at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in an incident that came to be known as “Bloody Sunday.”

Presidents began using military troops, including the National Guard, more routinely in America’s cities in the 1960s. During summer riots following police brutality in Detroit in 1967, President Johnson ordered elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions into the city, and Michigan governor George Romney called up the Michigan National Guard; more than 40 people were killed, more than half by Detroit police. National Guard troops killed 11, including a 4-year-old girl, Tanya Blanding, who died when a Michigan guardsman opened fire with a tank-mounted .50-caliber machine gun on her apartment after wrongly believing a sniper was inside.

While troops were used again amid the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., the downside and risk of such deployments was vividly captured two years later at Kent State University when National Guard troops opened fire on students protesting the Vietnam War, killing four and wounding nine.

Over the years since, there has been incredibly limited domestic use of federal troops—the Los Angeles riots of 1992 being one exception—and presidents and attorneys general until the Trump administration usually go out of their way to coordinate surges of federal law enforcement to cities or states.

Even during the peak of the marshals and troop deployments to the South amid the Civil Rights movement, presidents only acted after state officials either refused to quell violence targeting Americans practicing their constitutional rights or, in the case of the Alabama state troopers, were the cause of the violence against peaceful citizens themselves. Often, a president acted only after there was defiance on the ground of a lawful court order—ensuring that there was a second branch of government acting as a check-and-balance and trigger for such federal action.

While Trump has said that the immigration enforcement effort in Minneapolis—as with previous efforts in Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Charlotte, Portland and, most recently, Maine—is meant to enforce “law and order,” there’s no apparent rhyme, reason, or necessity to the deployments beyond political terror.

Trump today is attempting something unprecedented that stands in contravention of all historical tradition in the United States: the brutal application of federal forces against a state and region with no apparent reason beyond its being led by members of the political opposition.

In deploying immigration officers and border security agents from the DHS, rather than deputy US marshals from the Department of Justice—as presidents in the past have done—Trump is also changing the nature and tenor of his federal force. Marshals, whose work and training involves constitutional rights and protections, have always been used to protect civil rights and valid court orders and come with strong federal policing powers and authorities. The agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE are different. They are not trained to normal federal law enforcement standards of dealing with the public and are meant to operate with severely limited authority to enforce immigration matters, not general federal laws. CBP agents in particular are less a regular law enforcement agency, grounded in due process, and more a paramilitary force meant to operate on the border regions. They were never intended to have regular contact with US citizens and civilians.

Trump has also attempted to use troops in similar crackdowns over the last year and been stymied by federal courts, who, among other instances, preliminarily blocked his federalization of the California National Guard.","https://media.wired.com/photos/69763dfa2963322ff178d7bc/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/WIRED_ICE_GettyImages-2257462492.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 12:59:20.755676

PROTESTERS: ICE out! ICE out! ICE out! ICE out!

JOHN HAMILTON: It was 10 degrees below zero Fahrenheit when a crowd numbering in the tens of thousands marched through downtown Minneapolis Friday afternoon calling on ICE to get out of Minnesota. It was the largest single day of action so far in the ongoing standoff between local community and the Trump administration since ICE, Border Patrol and other federal agents, now numbering around 3,000, descended on Minnesota for Operation Metro Surge several weeks ago, bringing chaos, fear and violence.

JENNA SHERRICK: My name is Jenna Sherrick. I’m a local Minnesotan who grew up here my whole life. What’s going around is not OK, and we all need to be here to make a difference and say it’s not OK. When cruelty becomes reality, compassion becomes radical.

SARAH SHEA: Sarah Shea. I’m a Minnesotan. And I’m here to support our immigrant neighbors and our friends and families and people who are not deserving what’s going on right now. It’s outrageous. We’re frustrated. We’re angry. We’re everything. And we should all be out here supporting our neighbors and getting ICE out of our city. ICE out. And we protect us, because right now that is all us. It’s all community. We are the only ones out here doing it for each other.

PROTESTER: Standing back and not doing anything doesn’t help with, you know, the situation. Everybody’s scared. Everybody. So we need to speak out.

JOHN HAMILTON: The day of action was organized by clergy and labor leaders under the banner ”ICE Out: A Day of Truth and Freedom.” The Minnesota AFL-CIO, representing over a thousand unions across the state, endorsed the march, as well as many others. John Reuss is an English teacher with the Minnesota Federation of Educators.

JOHN REUSS: And we are here to shut it all down. All of us teachers, from Minneapolis to St. Paul, from all the way up from Duluth down to Rochester, we are all here in the middle of Minneapolis to shut it all down for our students and their families, and ICE out of our communities. Every teacher has so many stories right now.

But, you know, one, last week, I had a student who joined online during class, and in the middle of my lesson — I teach English — the student messaged me and said, ”ICE is outside of my house right now. What do I do?” And, you know, I stopped class right away. All the students heard what happened. And, you know, thank God his neighbors were out there outside of his house, and they chased ICE out of their neighborhood. Those agents had been circling his house all morning. And, you know, I think it’s really telling of our community, of our neighborhoods, how we’ve organized and how we are out there defending one another, including my student, who, thank God, he’s safe.

You know, the fear is so tangible. The fear is so tangible. This is our last option. We need to shut it all down. And so I am calling on every educator in this state, in this country, to shut it down, with Minneapolis, with St. Paul. You need to shut it all down with us, because if we do not shut it down right now, your city is next. And I do not — we do not want that to happen. We want to protect our students. We want our students back in schools. And the way we are going to get it is by shutting it down, to get ICE the hell out of here.

JOHN HAMILTON: Among those protesting were members of the Hmong American community, like Julie, whose family came to the United States decades ago as refugees after working alongside the U.S. in its secret war in Laos during the Vietnam War. She held a sign that read “Hmong Against ICE.”

JULIE: It’s scary, because they don’t — regardless of if you’re a citizen or not, they don’t ask. No question asked. They just assume that you’re illegal, that you’re a criminal. And it’s not fair for those of us people of color. My parents, they’re citizens. But we all live in fear. I’m a citizen, and I still live in fear every single day. And then, now my kids are in fear of, you know, going to school, because they have heard of stories of kids getting detained. And then, my kids, they’re scared of going to school. And we was promised safety. We was promised that, you know, we’ll get the freedom. But yet, today’s world, we are seeing that, you know, it’s getting revoked. Like, the United States are taking back the words. And the question is: Why? Why is it getting revoked? Why are we now being targeted as, you know, aliens, criminals? Some of us took off work, no school, no shopping, so we’re all out here against ICE.

JOHN HAMILTON: As demonstrators in the streets shut down parts of the Twin Cities, more than 700 businesses across the state closed their doors for what some called an economic blackout or general strike. Insight Brewing in Minneapolis was closed for business but stayed open for neighbors participating in the day of action. This is marketing manager Joey Steinbach.

JOEY STEINBACH: We are a space for our community, and our community is hurting right now. And the best way that we can help out is just direct-to-family donations. We’ve got a bunch of volunteers that are absolutely stellar. Outside of that, we’re just making some signs. We’re providing snacks, hand warmers, you know, just being a temporary third space while we’re not open for official business.

JOHN HAMILTON: Corporations that support or work with ICE were also targeted by demonstrators, like at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport —

PROTESTERS: Whose airport? Our airport! Whose airport? Our airport!

JOHN HAMILTON: — where demonstrators gathered to protest deportation flights.

PROTESTERS: Delta, Delta, you can’t hide! We can see your ICE-y side!

JOHN HAMILTON: The crowd of several hundred held signs that said “Business as usual doesn’t fly” and “Renee Good was good.” Among those who gathered were dozens of faith leaders. They shared stories of airport workers who had been arrested.

CLERGY MEMBER: We lift up Pedro, a janitor who helped his sister, who is unable to work, and was detained. He decided to self-deport because he could not take the conditions at the detention center in Texas.

JOHN HAMILTON: The union that represents airport workers reports at least 12 members have been arrested by ICE. Clergy then joined arms and sang, while others knelt and prayed, before police surrounded them, and at least a hundred were arrested.

PROTESTERS: For every one that you arrest, a thousand more will show up next!

JOHN HAMILTON: According to organizers, more than 70,000 people marched in Minneapolis Friday, and several thousand were in attendance at the Target Center for a rally. This is comedian and native Minnesotan, Lizz Winstead.

LIZZ WINSTEAD: And the untold thousands that are in this sport bowl facility, I am proud to call you neighbors. I do have to point out that we are in the Target Center, which may seem ironic, but remember, the Target Center is something our tax dollars pay for. So, chant it with me: Whose stadium?

CROWD: Our stadium!

LIZZ WINSTEAD: Whose stadium?

CROWD: Our stadium!

PROTESTERS: We are many! We are many! We are one! We are one!

JOHN HAMILTON: The venue is named after the retail giant based in Minnesota that activists have criticized for permitting ICE to operate on their property and to arrest employees without warrants.

LIZZ WINSTEAD: And when today is over, let’s commit to shopping at the businesses that stood with us, and make sure they can make it through these tough times, because the silence from the corporations in this state is deafening.

JOHN HAMILTON: Speaking at the rally, faith and labor leaders urged Minnesotans to continue to stand together. This is CWA President Claude Cummings.

CLAUDE CUMMINGS JR.: We stand in defiance of a wannabe dictator, and we will rise against the corporations and Trump’s billionaire buddies quietly funding his campaign to shred the Constitution. Political scientists and historians tell us, when countries have successfully prevented or reversed authoritarian control, unions have played an important role in stopping it. How do we do that? We stand shoulder to shoulder with our union siblings and with allies across the country. We do that when we join together and focus our attention directly on the corporations that enable fascism. Our unity across communities, organizations and unions is our power. And whatever we do, we must do it together.

JOHN HAMILTON: And they spoke of neighbors who had been lost to ICE violence. This is Rabbi Arielle Lekach-Rosenberg.

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: I want to lift up the names of two neighbors: Victor Manuel Díaz, abducted from his workplace in Minnesota on January 6th, who died in ICE custody in Texas on January 14th.

CROWD: Shame!

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: I want to lift up the name of Renee Macklin Good, queer poet, wife, parent, murdered in south Minneapolis by ICE on January 7th while observing an abduction in her neighborhood.

CROWD: Shame!

RABBI ARIELLE LEKACH-ROSENBERG: May their memories be for blessing. May their families be comforted and surrounded in love.

Videos of confrontations between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and Minneapolis residents have flooded social media, showing some of the 3,000 officers who are deployed in the city stopping, questioning and detaining residents.

In one case, immigration agents escorted a U.S. citizen who is a grandfather of Hmong ancestry out of his house in his underwear in freezing weather. In another case, a father of a 5-year-old girl was briefly detained and zip-tied after he said a federal agent falsely accused him of not being a U.S. citizen because of his accent. The agency is also under scrutiny for reportedly dispatching a 5-year-old boy to knock on the front door of his home to lure relatives outside before agents then took the child into custody.

The events have sparked protests and prompted confusion over what ICE is legally allowed to do in public and private locations. Are there limits on when and how ICE can approach or detain you? Does the law differentiate between encounters in public versus a private space, such as a home? And is the Supreme Court becoming more tolerant of aggressive ICE actions?

Legal experts weighed in on the public’s constitutional protections from immigration stops and detentions.

What rights do people have when approached by ICE?

Federal law gives immigration agents the authority to arrest and detain people believed to have violated immigration law. But everyone — including immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — is protected against unreasonable searches and seizures under the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.

“All law enforcement officers, including ICE, are bound by the Constitution,” said Alexandra Lopez, managing partner of a Chicago-based law firm specializing in immigration cases.

The Fourth Amendment doesn’t stop ICE from trying to deport people who have broken immigration law, but it has traditionally constrained the agency. The more extensive an enforcement action is, the higher the bar for immigration officers to justify their actions.

For example, officers can question someone in a public place, but more extensive interactions — such as a brief detention that’s not a formal arrest — require a “reasonable suspicion” that someone has committed a crime or is in the U.S. illegally, the Supreme Court has ruled.

Reasonable suspicion “has to be more than a guess or a presumption,” said Michele Goodwin, a Georgetown University law professor. To meet this standard, a reasonable person would need to suspect that a crime was being committed, had been committed or would be committed.

Agents must meet an even higher bar to arrest someone. They need “probable cause,” which generally requires enough evidence or information to suggest a person has committed a crime.

What is a ‘Kavanaugh stop’?

Historically, the Supreme Court has ruled that racial or ethnic profiling is unconstitutional. But a recent opinion by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave ICE increased discretion to use race as a factor for stopping and questioning people.

In the 2025 case Noem v. Perdomo, Kavanaugh was one of six justices who voted to stay a lower court ruling in favor of plaintiffs challenging federal immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. Kavanaugh wrote that “apparent ethnicity” could be used as a “relevant factor” in determining reasonable suspicion, as long as it was combined with other factors and not used on its own.

Before Kavanaugh wrote this, courts had “often ruled that agents could not stop someone just because they ‘looked like an immigrant’ or were in a high-crime area,” Lopez said. But if immigration officers follow Kavanaugh’s guidance, “it gives ICE a lot more discretion and justification to profile.”

Critics of Kavanaugh’s opinion “argue that the ‘relevant factor’ language invites abuse, opening the door to ethnic profiling,” said Rodney Smolla, a Vermont Law and Graduate School professor.

But Kavanaugh’s opinion was not co-signed by other justices, and it came from a procedural ruling rather than a substantive one, so its legal impact might be limited. The Supreme Court “has not made a definitive ruling on ‘Kavanaugh stops’ and their permissibility,” said Ilya Somin, a George Mason University law professor.

Somin and other legal analysts have said Kavanaugh appeared to dial back his support for race or ethnicity as a factor when he wrote a different opinion several months later, in Trump v. Illinois, which stopped the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Illinois.

Do people’s rights differ inside their homes versus in a public space?

The Supreme Court has generally ruled that, unless a resident grants consent, law enforcement cannot enter a private home without a warrant signed by a judge, which requires the government to provide evidence showing probable cause.

“This means a person inside the house generally need not open the door, need not converse with the agent, and may require the agent to slip the warrant under the door or hold it to a window,” Smolla said. There are some exceptions, such as if an officer encounters a violent crime in progress, or someone needing medical care.

Securing a judicial warrant is time consuming and is typically reserved for high-priority cases in which people are suspected of crimes beyond immigration violations, Lopez said. “It’s much easier for ICE to arrest individuals in public,” she said.

In the past, federal immigration officers typically would not forcibly enter homes if they only had an administrative warrant issued by ICE itself, without a judge’s approval. Some lower courts have ruled in the past that entering homes without a judicial warrant violates the Fourth Amendment.

Specific ICE officials have authority to issue administrative warrants. The warrants require “probable cause to believe” that the person named in the warrant is subject to removal. But they are not reviewed by anyone in the judicial branch.

A leaked ICE memo approved entering homes without consent using an administrative warrant alone, as long as a final order of removal has been issued, The Associated Press reported Jan. 22.

The AP, citing a whistleblower disclosure, said the memo has been used to train new ICE officers, and “those still in training are being told to follow the memo’s guidance instead of written training materials that actually contradict the memo.”

The May 12, 2025, memo, signed by ICE acting director Todd Lyons, said the Department of Homeland Security “has not historically relied on administrative warrants alone to arrest aliens subject to final orders of removal in their place of residence” but added that “the DHS Office of the General Counsel has recently determined that the U.S. Constitution, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the immigration regulations do not prohibit relying on administrative warrants for this purpose.”

If this policy were to be challenged in court, it’s unclear whether it would be ruled constitutional.

What can people do if they think ICE has infringed on their Fourth Amendment rights?

If you believe that your rights were violated, perhaps causing an injury or property loss, your options for suing for compensation are limited.

Unlike many state laws, federal law generally prohibits civil lawsuits against federal officials for violating people’s rights. A 1971 Supreme Court decision briefly loosened these prohibitions, before tightening them again.

Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley’s law school, and Burt Neuborne, a New York University emeritus law professor, wrote, “In one case, the Supreme Court held that people who had been illegally thrown off the Social Security disability rolls and were left without income could not sue, even though they had been given no due process. In another, the court declared that a man dying of cancer after the prison repeatedly denied him any medical care could not sue.”

David Rudovsky, a University of Pennsylvania law professor, said there might be an opportunity to sue under a different law, the Federal Tort Claims Act.

Still, he said, plaintiffs would face a steep challenge: “It’s not an easy path, and most people can’t afford to retain a lawyer.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ICE_rights.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:00:00.887493

The big picture: Federal immigration agents have shot and killed two Minnesota citizens in recent weeks, inflaming local protests and a nationwide backlash against Trump's immigration enforcement tactics that have turned Minneapolis into a powder keg.

Driving the news: One federal judge will weigh whether the Trump administration's immigration surge is constitutional, and could ultimately halt it as state and local officials are requesting.

Another judge will hold a hearing in a case over state access to evidence surrounding the death of Pretti, the 37-year-old nurse whom a federal immigration agent shot and killed Saturday.

Catch up quick: Pretti's killing came after a federal agent fatally shot Renee Good weeks earlier.

The Trump administration demonized the victims in the aftermath, labeling them ""domestic terrorists."" They also allegedly restricted local and state agencies from investigating each incident, leading Minnesota officials to sue for access.

Here's what to know about the cases with hearings on Monday:

Twin Cities and state sue Trump administration

The state of Minnesota and lawyers for St. Paul and Minneapolis asked a judge to deem the federal immigration surge unconstitutional, according to a complaint filed earlier this month.

The lawsuit argues that the federal crackdown is infringing on state authority and amounts to coercion, which the state and cities argue is a violation of the Tenth Amendment.

""Defendants' actions force such an impermissible 'choice': use state and local law enforcement resources to carry out the federal government's civil immigration priorities or accept occupation by federal troops,"" the complaint reads.

As noted by The New York Times, the suit does not seek to end all immigration enforcement in the state but rather targets the ""unprecedented surge.""

The other side: The federal government slammed the state argument as ""absurdity"" and ""legally frivolous.""

They say the government's ""Operation Metro Surge"" has ""succeeded"" in seeing thousands arrested and is an exclusively federal mission to enforce federal law.

Expelling federal officers from the state, the administration argued, would be ""an unprecedented act of judicial overreach.""

What we're watching: U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, a Biden appointee, will hear arguments in the case Monday morning.

She is also overseeing a separate case filed by Minnesota demonstrators who accused agents of violating their rights. She imposed restrictions, but an appeals court blocked her injunction.

Worth noting: Those cases both predate the fatal shooting of Renee Good, but the legal fights have drawn more attention since then.

Feds barred from ""destroying"" evidence

Over the weekend, U.S. District Court Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from ""destroying or altering"" evidence related to the fatal shooting of Pretti.

At a Monday afternoon hearing, the government will have a chance to raise objections to that order.

What they're saying: Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Axios Sunday that any claim the government would destroy evidence is ""a ridiculous attempt to divide the American people and distract from the fact that our law enforcement officers were attacked.""

Yes, but: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has already pledged a state investigation, blasting the federal government's accounts of Alex Pretti's final moments as false.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office asked in a complaint filed Saturday for the court to declare the feds' restriction of state access to evidence unconstitutional.

The White House reached out to Senate Democrats late Sunday, as have Republicans, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.

But they have not yet raised any realistic solutions, the aide said.

Republicans will need some Democratic support to pass the remaining spending bills in time to avoid a partial shutdown. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand.

On Sunday, House and Senate Democrats convened separate conference calls as they privately assess next steps and press to restrain the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

A deal begins to unravel

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee and key negotiator on the funding package, had been pushing her colleagues to vote for the homeland security bill, arguing that Democrats had successfully fought off major increases to the ICE budget.

But in the wake of the shooting, Murray said Sunday on X that ""I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.""

""Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,"" Murray wrote.

Federal officials have defended the actions of the agents involved in the Good and Pretti shootings as justified. Democrats said video released of both shootings showed otherwise. Republicans are increasingly challenged, with some calling for thorough investigations while others stand with federal officials.

""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., posted on X. ""The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.""

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., wants a ""thorough and impartial investigation"" into the shooting and said ""any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said Democrats should reconsider their threat to not support DHS funding and work with him to ""end the mess created by sanctuary city policies.""

""Now is not the time to defund one of our major national security priorities: border protection,"" Graham said on X.

Funding puzzle will be hard to solve

The growing backlash from Democrats puts Republican leaders in the Senate in a difficult position.

Much of the government, including the Department of Defense, continues to operate on a short-term bill that provides funding only through Friday.

Republican leaders had hoped to avoid another shutdown after last fall's 43-day closure that revolved around Democrats' insistence on extending federal subsidies that make health coverage more affordable for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Before Pretti's death, many Democrats felt the same way about a potential shutdown, lending support in the House to most of the remaining appropriations bills — with DHS the exception.

House Democrats largely rejected the homeland security portion last week with just a handful joining Republicans to ensure its passage. More than 100 House Democrats called for Noem's impeachment.

The House sent the six funding bills to the Senate as a package, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to strip out the homeland security portion which Democrats are demanding.

Despite the procedural hurdles, Schumer said Sunday that Republicans should work with Democrats to advance the other five bills and rewrite the DHS bill. ""This is the best course of action, and the American people are on our side,"" Schumer said.

The path ahead is uncertain. The Senate is not scheduled to return to session until Tuesday, due to the snowstorm. The House plans to be out of session this week and would have to pass the funding package again if it is changed.

Democrats are pushing for policy changes to be added to the homeland security spending bill that would force ICE agents to use warrants for immigration arrests, mandate strengthened training, require agents to identify themselves and have Border Patrol agents stay on the border rather than assisting ICE with immigration raids in the interior of the country.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees homeland security funding, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that Congress cannot fund a department ""that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls across the country in violation of the law.""

One by one, Democrats stake out opposition

Democratic senators discussed the options on Sunday evening's call but without changes from Republicans, they appeared headed toward a shutdown. On the morning call with House Democrats, they heard from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison, both former congressmen.

Several other Democratic senators announced they would vote ""no"" on homeland security money, including some who had helped Republicans end the record shutdown last year.

WATCH: House approves final spending bills for the year

""The abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,"" Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said in a post on X. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., also said she opposes that portion of the package.

Minnesota's Democratic senators also indicated they will oppose the DHS funding bill.

""For those asking where we go from here: Not voting to fund ICE is a great place for us to start,"" Sen. Tina Smith wrote on X.

""We oppose the ICE funding bill. We call for a full and transparent investigation with state officials,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. ""And we call on our Republican colleagues to stand up. They know this is wrong.""

Why the entire government wouldn't shut down

The progress that Congress has made so far on spending bills means that much of the federal government's work would continue even if lawmakers are unable to complete the job.

A bill that Trump signed Friday funds the departments of Justice, Commerce and the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers through the end of the budget year in September.

The Department of Agriculture was funded from a previous measure, which means a shutdown shouldn't stop food assistance this time.

But other critical operations of the government would be disrupted.

But we have a role in local law enforcement,” she said.","If Arlington residents see immigration enforcement operating in the county, some local elected officials are advising them to call 911.

County Board Chair Matt de Ferranti and Board member Takis Karantonis encouraged calling the emergency number. De Ferranti noted at a meeting on Saturday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents “have no legal requirement to tell us when they come into our community.”

“It helps us know when ICE is in Arlington, so we can better pursue Arlington County’s law enforcement mission — preventing violence in our community,” he said.

De Ferranti argued that a lack of coordination with local law enforcement is part of a broader effort to sideline localities. He said he planned to bring forward, in coming weeks, “targeted and thoughtful” county resources for family members of those taken into custody or deported by the Trump administration.

“ICE’s approach is designed to provoke right now, and to seek out conflict,” he said.

At least 19 people have been removed from Arlington as part of ICE enforcement efforts, de Ferranti said. He opened the County Board meeting with discussion on this topic around 9:30 a.m., shortly before a federal immigration officer shot and killed a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis on Saturday morning.

There to speak on another matter during the public-comment period, retired Arlington County Police Department officer Gregg Kurasz said it would be better for residents to call the police non-emergency number — 703-558-2222 — rather than the emergency line.

“That would be more efficient” without losing time in getting a response, he said.

Karantonis disagreed.

“I would always call 911 when I see an ICE officer in my neighborhood — 911 is the best solution,” he said.

County Board member Susan Cunningham, meanwhile, suggested callers should use their best judgment when deciding which line to call.

“It goes to the same people. You just get queued a little differently,” she said.

Karantonis said the Trump administration seems intent on “converting law enforcement into a military intervention with all the trappings and appearance and posture of some sort of regime change.”

“This makes me very fearful,” Karantonis said, calling for “new innovative ways” to address the matter.

“I am not only fearful — I am afraid,” he said. “In a democracy, nobody should be afraid.”

Cunningham said it was important for the community to learn what role the county government can, and cannot, play in matters related to ICE efforts in Arlington.

Immigration law creates a clear hierarchy of access to the United States. Most people who are not U.S. citizens do not have any right to set foot in the country. By contrast, U.S. citizens can come and go as they please. One rung below U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents – also known as green card holders – can come and go unless they’ve committed certain crimes.

This month, the Supreme Court agreed to weigh in on the evidence that immigration officials need to treat permanent residents as if they are removable. In Bondi v. Lau, the justices are likely to consider whether border officials can rely on criminal charges alone to decide that permanent residents have committed an offense that can allow the government to remove them from the country.

Muk Choi Lau, a Chinese citizen, became a permanent resident of the United States in 2007. Almost five years later, New Jersey prosecutors charged him with trademark counterfeiting. While the criminal case against him was pending, Lau left the United States.

On his return, immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York decided that Lau should not be admitted into the United States – that is, authorized to enter and remain in the country indefinitely. Instead, the officer allowed Lau to proceed into the country under “parole,” a legal permission to enter the country for humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.

More than one year later, in 2013, Lau pleaded guilty to the criminal charges. The following year, immigration officials began legal proceedings to strip Lau of his green card and forcibly remove him from the United States.

Lau’s legal right to continue living in the United States hinges on the decision by the immigration officer at JFK Airport to deny Lau admission and instead parole him into the United States. Migrants who have been admitted into the United States can be deported if they are convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of their admission as a permanent resident. (Courts have described crimes of moral turpitude as “a nebulous concept,” but they have remained part of immigration law since 1891.)

The government claims that Lau’s conviction is a crime involving moral turpitude, but the passage of time – five years and 10 months – between his crime and his admission as a permanent resident means he would likely avoid deportation had he been admitted at JFK. By contrast, migrants who were paroled, rather than admitted, into the United States can be forcibly removed if they commit a crime involving moral turpitude at any time. Simply put, Lau’s conviction would not have affected his immigration status had he been admitted at JFK, but it spelled the beginning of his removal from the United States because he was paroled.

Challenging the government’s efforts to remove him, Lau argued that the immigration officer wrongly denied him admission. An immigration judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals, the administrative unit within the Justice Department that hears appeals of decisions by immigration judges, disagreed with Lau. According to the BIA, federal immigration law permits an officer to deny admission and instead parole a permanent resident into the United States when a criminal prosecution is pending that, if it leads to a conviction, would permit immigration officials to bar a migrant’s entry.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit disagreed with the BIA. In a unanimous opinion for a three-judge panel, Judge Richard J. Sullivan concluded that Lau should have been admitted to the United States, rather than paroled. According to the court, the Immigration and Nationality Act clearly explains that permanent residents who are returning from abroad generally “shall not be regarded as seeking an admission into the United States.” The presumption gives way only in the limited circumstances that Congress identified in the statute, including when a migrant “has committed” a crime involving moral turpitude.

The tricky part is agreeing on when immigration officials have enough evidence to know that someone has “committed” a crime that could lead to their exclusion from the United States. Assuming that trademark counterfeiting is a crime involving moral turpitude – a legal question that the 2nd Circuit did not decide – there is no question today, 12 years after Lau was convicted, that he would lose the presumption of reentry that Congress wrote into immigration law.

But when the immigration agent stationed at JFK denied Lau admission, Lau had not been convicted. Back then, federal officials could not be sure that he had committed the counterfeiting crime. At most, the immigration officer knew that prosecutors had accused Lau of committing the offense. Congress could have enacted a law allowing agents to exclude people based on nothing more than accusations of criminal activity, but that is not what Congress did. Instead, the law that Congress did enact requires more than the possibility that a migrant has committed a crime.

Building on an earlier BIA decision, the 2nd Circuit explained that immigration law requires “clear and convincing evidence” that the migrant committed the crime. Accusations alone fall short. As Judge Sullivan explained, “it will generally be difficult for DHS to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien has committed a qualifying crime at the time of admission if the admission precedes the LPR’s criminal trial or admission of guilt.”

Unlike the 2nd Circuit, the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 5th and 9th Circuits have previously adopted positions that align with the government’s view. One traditional basis for the Supreme Court to add a case to its docket is to resolve a dispute among lower courts. Though the justices have not publicly explained their reason for intervening, it is likely that the division among the courts of appeals created by the 2nd Circuit’s opinion affected their decision.

When it comes, the court’s opinion will determine how much flexibility immigration officers have to impose consequences on migrants for committing crimes even before it is clear that they in fact committed a crime. The difference between a criminal prosecution and a conviction is important because many people are prosecuted but ultimately not convicted. Allowing immigration officials to act on nothing more than criminal charges that are pending means that migrants can more easily be barred from the United States based on criminal activity that criminal courts later find they did not commit. In a political climate in which immigration agents are adopting increasingly aggressive enforcement tactics, such broader latitude will certainly sweep more people into the immigration detention and deportation pipeline.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2238889106.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:00:10.082477

In response to a request for comment, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities”.

The DHS says there are about 22,000 ICE officers, but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.
A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do – and left no way to address abuses.","Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into US cities, including Minneapolis, where agents have fatally shot two American citizen protesters in January.

Footage from bystanders of the two fatal shootings, including one by the border patrol that killed the ICU nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.

Cameras worn by officers have long been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend of cameras for law enforcement. Officials in 2025 also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.

Darius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body-camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under the presidency of Joe Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.

In response to a request for comment, the White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities”.

At least three of the eight or more border patrol agents at the scene of Saturday’s shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.

When federal officers have engaged in acts of violence, including the fatal shootings of Pretti and Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent on 7 January, top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations. Trump started ramping up immigration enforcement after Republicans in Congress passed a bill in the first year of his second presidency that provides $170bn for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and border patrol operate.

Pretti’s shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless it reins in immigration enforcement. US Customs and Border Protection – the border patrol’s parent agency – had 13,400 cameras for about 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.

ICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia and Washington DC.

While the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.

The proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.

The DHS says there are about 22,000 ICE officers, but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.

A homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives recently rejected that proposal, instead providing $20m for ICE and border patrol cameras.

Still, the bill – which now faces a challenging route to passage in the US Senate – did not require either agency to use the devices.

A top ICE official under Biden, Scott Shuchart, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations outside their normal operating area – an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.

The DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration placed about 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.

A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do – and left no way to address abuses.

In May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.

As of December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared with more than a hundred in March.

In 2023, the OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0e2b8d4c140022d932f1df48413c0822dd93b26/188_0_1279_1023/master/1279.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=395254143212f7e6c9b1ba4ce80f48c8",N,,2026-01-26 09:58:09.160271

Lydia Polgreen: I have never been a fan of the conceit of American journalists covering the United States as if it were a backwater foreign nation, but in Minneapolis last week I could not shake the impulse to compare my experiences in a city I know so well (I spent a chunk of my childhood in the Twin Cities, and my father is from Minneapolis) with my experiences covering civil wars in places like Congo, Sudan, Sri Lanka and more. Watching the video of Pretti’s killing, I thought: If this was happening on the streets of any of those places, I would not hesitate to call it an extrajudicial execution by security forces. This is where we are: armed agents of the state killing civilians with an apparent belief in their total impunity.

I left before Pretti was gunned down, apparently in the back while he was on his knees. What I saw was so reminiscent of other conflicts — civilians doing their very best to protect themselves and their neighbors from seemingly random violence meted out by state agents. Those agents, masked and heavily armed, are roaming the streets and picking up and assaulting people for having the wrong skin color or accent, or being engaged in the constitutionally protected acts of filming, observing or protesting their presence. Anyone who knows me knows that I am allergic to hyperbole, but sometimes you need to simply call a spade a spade. This is a lawless operation.

David French: We are witnessing the total breakdown of any meaningful system of accountability for federal officials. The combination of Trump’s Jan. 6 pardons, his ongoing campaign of pardoning friends and allies, his politicized prosecutions and now his administration’s assurances that federal officers have immunity are creating a new legal reality in the United States. The national government is becoming functionally lawless, and the legal system is struggling to contain his corruption.

We’re tasting the bitter fruit of Trump’s dreadful policies, to be sure, but it’s worse than that. He’s exploiting years of legal developments that have helped insulate federal officials from both criminal and civil accountability. It’s as if we engineered a legal system premised on the idea that federal officials are almost always honest, and the citizens who critique them are almost always wrong. We’ve tilted the legal playing field against citizens and in favor of the government.

The Trump administration breaks the law, and also ruthlessly exploits all the immunities it’s granted by law. The situation is unsustainable for a constitutional republic.

Michelle Goldberg: The administration is very consciously reinforcing that sense of impunity. First there was Stephen Miller addressing the security forces after one of them killed Renee Good: “To all ICE officers: You have federal immunity in the conduct of your duties.” On Sunday, Greg Bovino, the self-consciously villainous Border Patrol commander, praised the agents who executed Alex Pretti.

I wish people weren’t allowed to carry guns in public. But they are, and after watching Republicans bring semiautomatic weapons to protest Covid closures and make a hero of Kyle Rittenhouse. So it’s wild to hear Federal Bureau of Investigation head Kash Patel say, on Fox News, “You cannot bring a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines, to any sort of protest that you want.” The point here isn’t hypocrisy; it’s them nakedly asserting that constitutional rights are for us, not you.

Rose: David, I wanted to pick up on your description of the federal government as lawless. As you’ve written, we seem to be in the world described by Nazi-era Jewish labor lawyer Ernst Fraenkel and what he called “the dual state.” There is one we live in, where we pay taxes and go to work, and life seems to work according to common rules, and the other where the rules no longer apply. Is this what we’re experiencing?

French: We’re living in a version of the dual state. Not to the same extent as the Nazis, of course, but Fraenkel’s framing is still relevant. The Nazis didn’t create their totalitarian state immediately. Instead, they were able to lull much of the population to sleep just by keeping their lives relatively normal. As you say, they went to work, paid their taxes, entered into contracts and did all the things you normally do in a functioning nation. But if you crossed the government, then you passed into a different state entirely, where you would feel the full weight of fascist power — regardless of the rule of law.

One of the saddest things about the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti is that you could tell that neither of them seemed to know the danger until it was too late. They believed they were operating in some version of the normal state (what Fraenkel called the “normative state”) where the police usually respond with discipline and restraint.

Good and Pretti both had calm demeanors. They may have been annoying federal officers, but nothing about their posture indicated the slightest threat. Good even said, “I’m not mad” to the man who would gun her down seconds later. Pretti was filming with his phone in one hand and he had the other hand in the air as he was pepper-sprayed and tackled.

The officers, however, were in that different state, what Fraenkel called the “prerogative state,” where the government is a law unto itself. The officers acted violently, with impunity, and the government immediately acted to defend them and slander their victims. As the prerogative state expands, the normative state shrinks, and our lives often change before we can grasp what happened.

Polgreen: For me, this is what makes the community response in Minnesota so heartening. We’ve seen an astonishing outpouring of action and support from ordinary citizens who have decided not to accept this dual state. They refuse to be lulled, and insist on their continued citizenship in the constitutionally governed United States.

One thing that has irked me is how so many call the people out on the streets in Minnesota protesters. Yes, they are motivated by an urge to protest what is happening in their communities, and yes, protesting is an important act of citizenship. But what I saw in Minneapolis is better described as organizing and concerted action. It is an important distinction because so much of what is happening is invisible — people engaging in a form of neighborhood watch, walking vulnerable kids to school to shield them from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Church groups organizing food parcels for families too afraid to leave home. Community groups using encrypted messaging to compile spreadsheets of suspected ICE vehicles and activity. Others are logging and archiving endless amounts of evidence of ICE atrocities. This is the product of deep community organizing, not merely spontaneous actions driven by immediate anger.

Goldberg: I agree with Lydia and it’s the one thing that saves me from despair. Jews were less than 1 percent of the population in Hitler’s Germany. Trump is at war with a plurality of his country.

I’d love to know what you both think about the possibility of civil war or some kind of crackup. David, you wrote a whole book about the danger of the United States splitting up. I have to say, if I could vote in a referendum tomorrow for a national divorce from MAGA strongholds, I’d do it in a heartbeat. This is one of those ideas that I’ve flirted with in the past but always discounted because it means betraying a lot of people who’d be stuck in Trumpistan, and because it’s hard to see how you’d draw lines when the split is urban vs. rural as much as red state vs. blue. But it feels untenable to be ruled perpetually by people who’d murder us in the street and then slander us for it.

I was struck by the secretary of defense posting “ICE > MN” on social media. These are not people who think they share any bonds of citizenship with Democrats. Obviously, the answer is to win elections. But we’ve seen how Trump’s movement responds to losing elections, and that was before Trump had repurposed ICE as a personal militia.

Polgreen: We may yet come to an actual civil war, with armed people on different sides. Already, you have the local police in an uneasy middle ground between civilians and federal agents. Things could get worse if we end up with a National Guard, deployed by Gov. Tim Walz, and federal troops, deployed by Trump, at odds over who has the authority to exercise the state’s monopoly on violence.

In a way, the Trump administration has already started a civil war in which a set of leaders and citizens are behaving in a manner loyal to the historical traditions of our Constitution, and a president who believes his word is law and has surrounded himself with loyalists ready to dispense with their constitutional duty and execute his dark vision.

Michelle’s suggestion of a kind of national divorce is seductive at moments like this, but Minnesota is in many ways an illustration of why union is the only solution. Yes, it is a resolutely blue state in presidential elections, but it is quite closely contested in state and congressional elections, with all the urban-rural, blue-and-white-collar divisions you suggest. I am struck at how we’ve seen almost no counteraction from the right in Minnesota, which suggests to me that even some of the MAGA factions within the state are taken aback by the federal incursion’s indiscriminate violence, and sense the great cost to their state should it continue for much longer.

French: I think I wrote my book too soon! It came out in September of 2020 — this was after the racial reckoning and many of the Covid protests, but before Jan. 6 and the chaos of Trump’s second term. My thesis was pretty simple — that every single significant cultural, political or religious trend was pulling us apart more than it was pushing us together. And if we can’t find a way to reverse these seismic forces we would risk our national union.

Lots of readers thought I might have been too alarmist, but everything is unfolding as I have feared. We don’t have to debate whether some kind of national divorce is imminent (I don’t think it is) to understand that enmity between red and blue is still growing, and that the more hatred permeates our society, the more unstable it becomes. We are creating the conditions for a catastrophe.

I desperately want to preserve this union, but even more than that I want to preserve the idea that this nation is and can be an instrument of liberty, justice and virtue. And that means vanquishing the forces of hate and division, not separating from them.

Rose: With immigration enforcement in Trump’s second term, we have a quasi-military force, backed by more funding than most countries give their actual militaries, deployed for the most part to enforce civil, not criminal law. Should we instead think about this as spectacle? Caitlin Dickerson of The Atlantic, interviewed by our colleague Ezra Klein, argued that immigration enforcement under Trump is being implemented for maximum visual impact.

Goldberg: That’s increasingly the critique of conservatives who don’t want to break with Trump, but also are having a hard time rationalizing ICE’s violence in Minneapolis. Erick Erickson blames what’s happening in Minnesota on the D.H.S. secretary, Kristi Noem, marginalizing Tom Homan, the border czar, in favor of Greg Bovino from Customs and Border Protection, who clearly relishes street-level confrontation.

And the administration obviously wants to make a spectacle. We don’t know why the guy who shot Renee Good was filming, but it could well have been to feed their insatiable demand for content, which in turn is feeding their recruiting efforts. Did any of you see the clip where one of agents shooting tear gas at protesters can be heard saying, “It’s like ‘Call of Duty.’ So cool, huh?”

I’m glad that some people on the right have at least concluded that this looks bad for their side, since it could create political pressure on Trump to pull back. At the same time, I don’t think you can divorce the policy from the spectacle. Both are meant to terrorize their enemies.

Polgreen: There is no question that spectacle is the goal here. Michelle just mentioned Bovino — he has been swanning about Minnesota in a long, green wool coat that lends him a distinctly fascist look. The way these officers are kitted out is nuts. Keith Ellison, Minnesota’s attorney general, described it to me as “full battle rattle.” There is also a cartoonish aspect to the whole thing — social media is replete with videos of agents slipping on ice and falling, ass-over-teakettle, onto the frozen ground. You look at the videos of the shootings and there is an air of incompetence to the whole thing, even amid the horror. It is almost as if you can’t believe how amateurish and unprofessional these guys are.

Elliott Payne, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, told me about one encounter with an agent armed with a Taser. The guy held it sideways, like some kind of gangbanger, menacing Payne and other city officials as they tried to ask questions about why a man at a bus stop was being detained. Payne told me it was something out of a bad movie. No trained law enforcement officer would ever hold a weapon that way. It would be comical if it weren’t so utterly terrifying.

French: I think the administration has done a very effective job at convincing its supporters that enforcement might be messy, but the Democrats left them with no choice. This is what we have to do to protect our nation’s borders, deport criminal aliens, and preserve economic opportunity for Americans. It’s this, they argue, or you have open borders and complete chaos. I hear that sentiment all the time.

That’s a false choice. We can protect our border and enforce immigration laws without a violent, masked paramilitary force taking over our city streets. Presidents of both parties have deported millions of undocumented immigrants without resort to brutality and violence.

There are multiple purposes behind Trump’s aggression. He’s certainly trying to impress his supporters and intimidate his opponents. But he’s also trying to bait his opponents into extremism and violence in response. I’m afraid that he wants riots and a rerun of rhetoric like “defund the police.”

It is vitally important to respond to Trump’s extremism not with an opposing extreme, but rather with reason, good sense and peaceful, courageous conviction. Call his bluff. Show America that it’s not a binary choice between brutal enforcement or unrestrained immigration.

Rose: Recent polling suggests Americans don’t like ICE’s tactics, nor do they approve of Trump’s handling of immigration, but they still trust Republicans more than Democrats, generally, on the topic. Do any of you see an elected official of either party expressing anything akin to the French Theory of Immigration: Protect the border without the masked paramilitaries?

Goldberg: Isn’t this what basically every Democrat is saying? Even the people who are saying “abolish ICE” aren’t calling for an end to immigration enforcement. They’re arguing that this is a rogue agency beyond repair, and they’re right.

I understand why the “abolish ICE” debate has immediately become about polling and midterm politics. Democrats need to win, and they’re still stung by the backlash to “defund the police.” But before we debate messaging, I think we should talk about the substantive issue, which is that ICE, an organization that’s only 23 years old, has become a vehicle of state terror that must be disbanded.

One thing I learned from Ezra’s interview with Caitlin Dickerson is that most ICE agents have been hired in the past year. Many of them are people who responded to a recruitment drive that targeted gun shows, far-right influencers and overt white nationalists. They are showing every day that they are thuggish and unprofessional and regard many of their fellow citizens as their enemies. No politician should be so abject as to fund their own occupiers.

French: I like the idea of getting aggressive and specific in response. Take off their masks. End their immunities. Limit their jurisdiction. Restrain their tactics. All of this can be done through legislation without inhibiting humane immigration enforcement. And if it’s done correctly, legislative reform can lead to greater accountability across the whole of government.

Goldberg: David, do you really think the people who currently make up ICE are capable of humane immigration enforcement?

French: Some, yes and some, no. But you will make ICE infinitely less attractive to thugs and goons if they know they can be held immediately accountable, if they will never get to run around in their ridiculous military-style uniforms (cosplaying like they’re SEALs), and if they can’t break down doors or rappel from helicopters to check a person’s immigration status.

Goldberg: There’s a proposal in Maryland, the ICE Breaker Act, which would bar people hired by ICE under Trump from working in state law enforcement. I’d like to see similar efforts everywhere to increase the stigma of this work, even though the downside is redoubling their commitment to keeping Republicans in office.

French: Hmm. I’m not a fan. I think it’s a mistake to conclude that everyone who joins is nefarious. There are people who join, object to what they’re asked to do, and leave. Or blow the whistle and leave. I don’t want that person inhibited by a scarlet “I” for the rest of their professional life.

Also, Michelle, the downside you identify is pretty big. We don’t want even more people to believe that everything depends on the G.O.P. clinging to power.

Polgreen: David makes a really good point here — this is an emergency, but we do need to think about the future, and how we knit ourselves back together again. As someone who served in our Forever Wars, I am sure he knows many people who signed up for one mission out of patriotism and ended up with deep misgivings and regrets.

French: I absolutely do.

Polgreen: A lot of people in politics and punditry are overthinking this. It has been clear for a very long time that the general voting public wants a secure border and immigration reform. Anyone claiming that Americans voted for today’s insane policies is lying to themselves. I get frustrated with people who say stuff like, “This is not who we are,” because the United States has a long history of doing terrible things to its citizens and those who seek to make a home here. But I also get frustrated with people who argue that, “This is what America has always been,” because that, too, is fantasy.

The truth is that Americans are proud that their country is the destination of choice for the most ambitious and talented people in the world, and for anyone yearning for freedom under law. And I believe that fundamental to the American psyche is a belief that we are a nation built on a set of ideals, however imperfect our loyalty to those ideals.

Rose: You’ve touched on this already, but it’s worth pausing to consider what’s coming this week. Democrats in the Senate are vowing to oppose a bill that would fund immigration enforcement, which could shut down the government. What should they be asking for?

Goldberg: First and foremost, the withdrawal of ICE from Minneapolis.

Polgreen: I think this is the moment for Democrats to be quite ambitious. Michelle, I agree — ICE needs to leave Minnesota. There is simply no justification for this kind of deployment in a state with so few undocumented immigrants — as a proportion of its population it is less than half the national average.

At an absolute minimum, Democrats should demand an end to masking, a ban on military-style uniforms and a requirement that officers wear badges with identification. The feds must agree to independent investigations of uses of deadly force, and dispense with the fiction of immunity. I think Kristi Noem needs to go, but then whoever replaces her could be even worse.

I think it is quite disgusting that seven moderate Democrats in the House voted for this funding, including media darlings like Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Jared Golden of Maine. Democrats need to wake up and realize what time it is. This simply cannot stand.

French: I very much like the Lydia plan. No masks. No immunities. No military-style tactics or uniforms. You don’t need any of those things to protect the border and enforce immigration laws. And yes, end the Minneapolis operation. Now. Don’t make MAGA defend border enforcement. Make them defend the indefensible.

Rose: Two quick questions to finish. First, when people ask you what they can do, what’s your advice?

French: This is a crucial moment in American history. I think about it like this — when we learn about our family histories, we often ask what our ancestors were doing. Did they serve in World War II? Did they serve in Vietnam? Where did they stand during the civil rights movement?

This is a moment important enough that our grandchildren and even great-grandchildren might ask: “What did you know? What did you do?” Think hard about what you want your answer to be. Think hard about what you can do that will stand the test of time — whether it be peacefully protesting (including peaceful civil disobedience), volunteering for a political campaign, providing meals and clothing for immigrant families, or anything else that protects the vulnerable and defends human dignity.

One of the worst answers, however, would be to look a curious grandchild in the face, and say, “Well, I posted a lot on social media.”

Polgreen: I read so much about how we live in an atomized society, glued to our phones and social media but untethered from our communities and neighbors. Minnesota is demonstrating how quickly and fearlessly communities can come together in spite of the political and technological forces seeking to keep us divided. They also built on their past experience — many of these networks of support began during the George Floyd protests. Some were groups that wanted to march against the Minneapolis cops, and others wanted to protect neighborhoods from property damage. Now they have been reactivated to work together to help each other. A lot of us formed these kinds of networks during Covid. This would be a great time to reconnect with them. Be prepared to protect the people around you.

French: I love this emphasis on connection, Lydia.

Goldberg: Yeah, Lydia, I agree. There are a couple of women on my block — and I hope they won’t mind me referring to them — who are just phenomenal organizers, both politically and socially. One of them is the planner of the block party and the keeper of the free library; this morning I saw her out shoveling snow, not just in front of her own house but in front of those on either side of her. They’re also the ones who are handing out ICE whistles and holding weekly neighborhood meetings and protests.

I wrote in one of my columns that these anti-ICE actions are signs of local civic health. They come, ironically, out of the sort of deep local ties and resulting social trust that conservatives constantly say they want to recreate. So one thing you can do — depending on where you live, of course — is to meet your neighbors, and start talking to them about what you’re going to do if ICE descends.

Rose: And what have you seen that’s been heartening?

French: I’ll be completely honest. It’s a little harder for me to have hope when I know that the core political support for Trump’s aggression is coming from my own community. Without the lock step (and seemingly unconditional) support of so many millions of Evangelicals, Trump’s administration would crumble overnight. So I keep looking for signs of softening hearts and opening minds in Trump’s base — among the people who helped raise me, who taught me about faith, and who told me in no uncertain terms that politicians must demonstrate high character before they can earn your support. I feel a pervasive sadness about this moment.

That’s what is so grievous about civil strife. You often find yourself in opposition not to some hated, distant foe, but rather in opposition to people you’ve loved your whole life — whom you still love.

But there is hope. It’s a mistake to believe that the G.O.P. and its Christian supporters have crossed a Rubicon, never to return. And it’s a mistake to believe — even for the most hardhearted — that their aggression is a sign of their strength. They are masking weakness, and courage is their kryptonite.

Polgreen: I share David’s wariness of hope, which is very much warranted. Still, seeing the huge turnout in subzero temperatures on Friday in Minneapolis was incredibly moving. When I was in Minnesota, high school students in St. Paul staged a walkout and marched to the State Capitol. It was so very cold, but they came in their hundreds, an incredibly diverse group of kids.

I met a group of white teenage boys, the demographic supposedly lured in my Trump’s embrace of masculine cruelty. And they just weren’t having it. They talked about a kind of masculinity that involved sticking up for the vulnerable, being of service to your community, being a leader in your church and school. When I heard about Alex Pretti’s background — a boy scout, athlete, I.C.U. nurse caring for veterans — I instantly thought of those warm, kind Midwestern boys as his spiritual kin. That spirit lives on.

Goldberg: Watching ordinary people in Minneapolis stand up to ICE has filled me with an almost hokey degree of patriotism. It turns out there are still a lot of Americans with that deep instinct for associational life that Tocqueville wrote about. There is still, in much of this country, an instinctive hatred of tyrants, and a belief that people have the duty and agency to stand up to them. The past year has revealed that many of our elites, especially those in business and technology, are far more craven than I’d ever realized. But it also revealed a lot of everyday heroism.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/26/opinion/26minn-roundtable/26minn-roundtable-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:00:14.420674

On January 7, 2026, an ICE agent killed an American citizen. Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother living in Minneapolis, was shot to death in her vehicle by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. Good’s death is now ruled a homicide by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. Since an ICE agent committed the killing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office claimed exclusive federal jurisdiction and blocked Minnesota state officials from obtaining evidence.

On January 24, 2026, another American citizen was killed during an ICE operation. Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse also from Minneapolis, was shot to death in the street by a yet-unnamed agent. Federal authorities have described the shooting as an act of self-defense, but multiple videos of the encounter appear to conflict with that account, showing Pretti unarmed and being subdued at the time he was shot. This analysis is being published in the aftermath of the incident, while much about it is under investigation and still unknown.

Some people may call it ironic that the city where George Floyd was murdered is the same one where two white citizens were killed during protests against what others refer to as a hostile military government takeover. We call it, unfortunately, predictable. Many cities have seen ICE surges, including Washington, DC, Memphis, Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte, New Orleans, Brownsville, TX, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Newark, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Minneapolis.

In several of these places, there are reports of ICE using excessive force, such as in the case of Julio Sosa-Celis, and of U.S. citizens being arrested or detained based on their accent or appearance, including Native Americans. This is also unfortunately predictable, as work from Brookings has identified how racial profiling by ICE would impact US citizens who are perceived to be immigrants from particular countries. The arrests of Ramon Menera and Chong Ly Thao are emblematic of this pattern.

On January 20, a 5-year-old with a pending asylum case was apprehended by ICE as he arrived home from preschool. School officials say he was used “as bait” to attempt to arrest other family members and members of his community.

Despite the Trump administration claiming they are targeting criminals, one-third of people arrested do not have a criminal record. In over 50 cases, ICE has allegedly busted out car windows to justify arrests. Overall, 32 people died while in ICE custody in 2025.

In response to ICE operations, Minneapolis and other cities have seen tens of thousands of protesters descend into the streets.

Absolute immunity, federal power, and echoes of the Civil Rights era

The Trump administration has argued for “absolute immunity” for ICE officers, which would lead to lawsuits being dismissed without the investigative discovery phase. The public feels differently: 60% of Americans believe ICE uses excessive force. Absolute immunity, compared to qualified immunity, protects agents regardless of whether they knowingly violate “clearly established” laws regarding excessive force or probable cause.

Sociologists and political scientists situate ICE’s actions as representing a crisis of legitimacy and a structural violence regime infiltrating the criminal justice system. What that means is that American streets have felt dystopian in ways that mirror less politically-stable countries. Police have taken a back seat in the headlines, though incidents of excessive force from law enforcement continue to occur (police killed over 1,300 people in 2025, despite local reforms to counter police violence and bias—a number that is higher than any year over the past decade, except for 2024).

We are also seeing Trump “federalize” the National Guard to support federal law enforcement operations as logistical support. This approach has been critiqued by some who view the Trump administration as being in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the military as domestic law enforcement. In December 2025, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot use the National Guard for normal enforcement. Violence against National Guard members involved in domestic operations has also occurred, as in the case of Sarah Beckstrom, a member of the West Virginia National Guard, who was killed the day before Thanksgiving by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who also shot Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe in the head. Sgt. Wolfe recently started breathing on his own and standing with assistance.

Collectively, today’s images of law enforcement interactions with people living in the U.S. are reminiscent of an unstable Civil Rights movement period. But at that time, the National Guard and local police were doing the enforcement, not ICE. This is an important distinction that makes the current phase feel much different than prior eras of civil unrest. Sanchez, an author of this piece who has studied immigration and politics for decades, argues that the actions of ICE officers and statements from the Trump administration have radically shifted societal norms in ways that will have lasting consequences.

How ICE agents are being recruited today

ICE was formed in 2003 as part of a reorganization following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ICE is housed in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Different from local police, who report to mayors and county executives (or governors, in the case of state agencies), and the National Guard, who mostly report to governors as a military force, ICE is part of a federal agency where the president has more influence. While previous presidents have primarily deployed Border Patrol to enforce immigration violations at the border and used Homeland Security to investigate more severe criminal cases related to drug and human trafficking, President Trump has been much more likely to deploy the Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) Division within ICE to actively seek out people whom agents suspect of being illegal.

What makes this wave of ICE action different is how agents are being recruited and trained. With about $170 billion going to immigration enforcement and border security from Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” ICE has significantly expanded hiring. The agency is giving $50,000 signing bonuses and providing student loan forgiveness with the goal of doubling its workforce and meeting the president’s benchmark of deporting one million people annually. In doing so, ICE has lowered the age limit of its recruits from 21 to 18 and waived the 37-year-old hiring cap; these age boundaries apply to most federal law enforcement agencies to ensure the agents’ physical fitness. Since Trump retook office, ICE has hired over 12,000 new agents and expanded its headcount to over 22,000. However, there are reports of a decrease in rigor for selection: Investigative journalist Laura Jadeed reported attending an ICE career expo and being hired after six minutes without completing any background paperwork.

In her forthcoming book Cutting the Government: The Right Way and the Wrong Way, Brookings Senior Fellow Elaine Kamarck argues that ICE’s hiring and personnel protocols are further complicated by its heavy reliance on other agencies to carry out immigration enforcement. She notes a Cato Institute study finding that ICE receives assistance from nearly 17,000 non-ERO personnel (including roughly 14,500 federal criminal-law-enforcement officers), highlighting how immigration enforcement is diffused across multiple agencies. FBI agents are moved to assist ICE, which means that other functions, such as counterterrorism, have to be carried out with fewer people and resources. Agents in the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have also been transferred to assist with deportations. The Trump administration has also shifted roughly 600 Department of Defense lawyers (with only two weeks of training) to address the massive immigration backlog from DHS.

Lower training standards

In addition to questionable hiring practices and leaving potential gaps in the nation’s other law enforcement needs, shortened training is problematic. The ICE Academy has been reduced from 22 weeks to 8 weeks or 47 days (a number supposedly chosen because Trump is the 47th president). The previously required 5 weeks of Spanish language training were removed, and agents are being told to rely on mobile apps for translation. Instead of a focus on understanding the Immigration and Nationality Act, trainees are engaging in more tactical and operational drills. Instead of a 4-week in-person training, police officers being deputized to work with ICE are now only required to do a 40-hour online course.

This watering down of hiring and training standards is concerning. Ray, the co-author of this article, has served on Peace Officers Standards and Training (POST) commissions to help psychologists better evaluate police applicants for bias. One common trend over the past few years was that short-staffed police departments increasingly accepted applicants who would have been rejected in years prior. These hiring challenges raise, then, an urgent question: who are the new ICE recruits, and are their qualifications sufficient if they are receiving less training than before and yet being quickly deployed into U.S. communities? Ray has researched law enforcement for over 15 years, trained police officers, helped develop a virtual reality training program for law enforcement, and testified before Congress on policing. Simply put, training cannot be rushed and often should be increased.

The lack of training leads to mistakes. In law enforcement, mistakes get people killed.

Steps to reduce violence immediately

Accordingly, there are a series of measures that can be implemented immediately to reduce the use of force and improve decision-making.

First, hiring standards should be improved. ICE agents’ files should be cross-checked with state-level misconduct files. This aligns with Texas’s Wandering Officer Law to prevent people who were fired or resigned due to misconduct from working in law enforcement.

Second, training should be enhanced. De-escalation training, such as Jigsaw’s virtual reality training, can improve communication and decision-making in high-stakes situations. This training is mobile and can be easily deployed in various settings.

Third, Duty to Intervene should be mandated. Law enforcement agents, regardless of agency, should prevent a fellow officer or agent from using excessive force. This recommendation aligns with the Minneapolis Police Department’s cross-agency intervention policy.

Fourth, transparency must improve. Agents should use body-worn cameras and official vehicles with insignia, and masks that cover the faces of agents should not be allowed. This recommendation aligns with laws requiring that agents “unmask” or “de-mask,” with the assumption that more transparency will lead to reduced use of force.

Fifth, absolute immunity should be removed, and investigations into instances of wrongdoing by federal agents should be pursued.

There are other proposals and decisions of note that are aiming to address actions by ICE:

Lawmakers are already discussing reforms that include some of the recommendations mentioned above, such as requiring agents to provide first aid (when Good was killed, ICE agents did not allow a physician at the scene to render aid) or prohibiting provisional hiring without a complete background check.

A Minnesota federal judge restricted ICE’s use of retaliation against peaceful protesters. Some readers may be thinking: Isn’t this already the law? Well, this is the point. The legal and cultural norms that most Americans assumed were cemented into our democratic culture have been so upended that judges have to restate the basics of constitutional protest rights.

Maryland is discussing measures to prohibit people who join ICE from obtaining law enforcement jobs in the state. Critics argue that employees working for the federal government cannot be discriminated against when pursuing employment.

Finally, the DHS appropriation bill that Congress aims to pass by the end of January would require DHS to spend $20 million on body cameras for immigration enforcement agents and direct the department to expand training on conflict de-escalation during public interactions. In the aftermath of Pretti’s killing, a growing number of Democratic senators have announced that they will not support the bill,

Altogether, as ICE continues to face allegations over its methods, fostering a system built on fairness and respect for human rights becomes paramount. By addressing these concerns, the U.S. can strive toward a more just approach to immigration enforcement.

Ultimately, the goal should be to safeguard two things at the same time: national security, and the dignity and rights of every individual within our borders.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256086780-2.jpg?quality=75,N,,2026-01-26 09:58:17.907868

The lawlessness of ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies has been increasing – and been increasingly blatant – for the last year.","What we are seeing in Minneapolis right now is horrendous, frightening, and heartbreaking. But it is not a surprise. Over the past year, the Trump administration has deliberately escalated immigration enforcement - expanding funding and capacity for ICE, normalising violent and racist rhetoric, and expanding legal support for immigration enforcement while stripping back oversight. On the ground, federal immigration agents have grown bolder and more aggressive.

Where we are now traces directly back to the very beginning of Trump’s second term. In this post I trace out the actions since January 2025, highlighting the key events that tell the story of how we ended up here.

Below is a chart of actions over the last year – I’ve logged almost 200 and so have only been able to label the most significant on the chart below (high resolution version). The full list, along with links to relevant news stories, can be accessed here.

The first nine months: removing guardrails, increasing funding, desensitising the population

On his first day in office, Trump signed a Proclamation titled “Guaranteeing The States Protection Against Invasion”. This classified southern border crossings as an “invasion” and authorised the Department for Homeland Security (DHS), under which ICE sits, to take “all appropriate action” to “repel, repatriate, or remove” people deemed part of that invasion. Two days later, DHS signed an additional memo authorising ICE agents to expel 1.4 million immigrants who had been allowed to remain under Biden-era policies. The scene was set for the mass deportation efforts to follow.

In March 2025, three watchdogs agencies within DHS were shut down removing important oversight of ICE activities. DHS started deporting Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador’s notorious prison CECOT without due process. By Spring, ICE is arresting people as they turn up for their immigration hearings, wrongly arrests US citizens, all while reports of human rights abuses in detention facilities increase. In May 2025, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrongly asserts that the president has “a constitutional right” to deport people without due process.

In terms of building capacity, Trump increased ICE’s budget by $70 billion over four years, a six-fold increase. The American Immigration Council called this “a fundamental reshaping of American society” and said that ICE “would become more powerful than every other federal law enforcement agency”. ICE also started to ramp up its surveillance technologies, with facial recognition apps, spyware, and sharing of sensitive federal data, while some paperwork requirements for arrests were scrapped and funding for bodycams cut. Meanwhile, ICE started a recruitment drive, offering signing-on bonuses and lowering entry requirements.

June saw the National Guard and marines deployed to Los Angeles, followed by DC. Concentrated ICE and Border Patrol deployments targeted LA, Portland, DC, Memphis, New York and Chicago over the summer and early autumn. The National Guard in DC go from being unarmed, to being “maybe armed”, to all being armed. The Department for Homeland Security (DHS) refuses to comply with state rules on identification, and agents continue to detain people while wearing face masks and plain clothes and using unmarked cars.

Dissent is legislated against and punished. In late August, Trump signs an Executive Order to establish specialised National Guard units to address “public order issues”. The next day, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, calls the Democrat Party “a domestic extremist organization” for opposing deployment of the National Guard in DC. US politicians are arrested for demanding access to ICE facilities in New York and DHS threatens federal assault charges against anyone ‘attacking’ ICE agents. In mid September, ICE agents kill a man in a Chicago while trying to arrest him – and are later shown to have lied about what happened.

I believe that the summer gave the administration the reassurance it needed so that it could escalate ICE tactics. While there had been many civilian protests against ICE and National Guard deployment, and many successful legal challenges, Congress did not step in, Fox News and the MAGA base stayed onside. It was safe to continue.

An autumn of increasing brutality, lawlessness and violent rhetoric

By early October, Trump had called Portland, Oregon “war-ravaged” and authorised “full force” against anyone ‘threatening’ ICE facilities. A few days later, Trump suggested that the military could use “dangerous cities” as “training grounds”. ICE had spent more than $70m on new weapons in 2025 and at least 16 deaths of detainees held in ICE facilities had been recorded since January.

In late October, Stephen Miller said anyone interfering in ICE operations could be arrested for engaging in “criminal conspiracy” against the US. Trump said he’s prepared to send “more than the National Guard” into American cities and the Pentagon ordered states’ National Guard units to form “quick reaction forces” for “crowd control”. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) increasingly painted opponents to ICE activity as “domestic terrorists” and as “lawless”.

In early November, a US citizen is shot (but not killed) from behind by ICE agents. The only consequence is that ICE is trying to prosecute him for “assault”, alleging he tried to run them over. The latest ICE operation – this time targeting Minnesota – is announced on 2 December.

Recruitment drives for ICE continue into winter, the Southern border is increasingly militarised, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is providing passenger lists to immigration enforcement. By Christmas, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserts (wrongly) that recording or following ICE agents is “obstruction of justice”, despite it being protected free speech. This argument will be repeatedly used to justify violence against – and the killing of – observers and protesters in January.

Share

January – Minnesota becomes the test case for military takeover of a US city by ICE and other federal immigration agents.

The first few weeks of 2026 have seen Minneapolis at the centre of the deportation effort – and of lawful protest and observation. ICE agents have been testing the limits of what they can get away with. So far, the administration has protected and even celebrated their violence.

On 7 January 2026, US citizen Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agents, while trying to get out of their way. The administration immediately characterised her as a “domestic terrorist” who was trying to run over and kill the agents. Video directly contradicted this account. An autopsy released by her family showed that the first two bullets were not life-threatening, but the third killed her – when an ICE agent leaned into the driver’s side window and shot her in the head at close range. JD Vance said afterwards that ICE agents had “absolute immunity” (a claim he has later walked back). The investigation was taken over by the central FBI, with local law enforcement excluded. A civil rights case opened to investigate her shooting was altered to be an investigation of Renee Good for “criminal activity” (and later thrown out by a judge). Good’s widowed wife is being investigated as a potential terrorist. The Department of Justice has now confirmed it sees no need to investigate Good’s death.

Since then, DHS promised to send another 1,000 agents to Minnesota. Federal immigration agents in Minnesota have been filmed breaking into a US citizen’s house and dragging him out in his underwear in subzero temperatures; arresting a 5-year old boy on his way home from school and then his dad (both are still in custody); pepper spraying an observer directly in the face while restraining them on the ground; pepper spraying the Minnesota Attorney General at close range; and deploying tear gas against a family of six in their car, resulting in their baby needing hospital. And those are just a fraction of the stories.

The administration has leaned into white supremacist imagery and defence of ICE. Trump threatened to invoke the insurrection act in Minnesota, with 1,500 troops reported to be on standby in Alaska. Civil rights and the rule of law were further weakened. Kristi Noem said ICE was allowed to ask citizens for their citizenship papers. Minnesota’s governor, attorney general, and Minneapolis’ mayor have all been targeted for judicial investigation into ‘obstruction’ of ICE activities.

Elsewhere, a Cuban immigrant was killed in detention while being held in a chokehold by staff. A new ICE operation began in Maine, explicitly targeting Somali immigrants.

And then, on Saturday, federal immigration agents restrained, then killed, US citizen Alex Pretti, who was helping a fellow protester in Minneapolis after she was pushed to the ground by agents. They sprayed him in the face with pepper spray, wrestled him to the ground, and then fatally shot him multiple times. It was witnessed and multiple videos exist showing the shooting from different angles.

The administration has repeatedly lied about what happened, falsely asserting that Pretti was threatening agents and attempting to shoot them, while local police say that the Department of Homeland Security is taking control of the investigation and blocking their access to evidence. Trump, Hegseth, Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller have all backed ICE and Border Patrol.

On thin ICE?

The lawlessness of ICE and other immigration enforcement agencies has been increasing – and been increasingly blatant – for the last year. So far, the administration has covered for them, celebrated them, enabled them, and funded them. Minnesotans have shown how concerted and coordinated local action can make a difference and the crucial importance of witnessing, and recording, what is happening.

Calls are growing, including from former President Obama, for proper investigations and an end to ICE’s deliberate brutality in Democrat cities. Some Republicans are also now speaking up, calling for investigations and questioning the immigration crackdown.

Will Trump and his team listen? If they don’t, will a Republican-led Congress finally assert its authority through legislation, hearings, appropriations powers and even impeachment? Because if there are no consequences to the violence we are witnessing, then it will keep spreading. That is what unchecked power does.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!INO9!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55cc5709-8454-4ee0-83b9-7d0ad30a07f6_6042x3692.png",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:18.342515

Based on what you know, was the shooting of the man in Minneapolis justified or not justified?","After federal immigration agents on Saturday shot and killed a Minneapolis resident for the second time this month, more Americans now say they would support abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) than say they would oppose eliminating the agency. A majority of Americans say ICE's tactics are too forceful and about half say they strongly disapprove of the way the agency is handling its job, according to a YouGov Poll conducted hours after the shooting. More Americans approve than disapprove of protests against ICE. Because the poll was conducted so soon after the shooting in Minneapolis, some respondents who were not aware of the news when they answered the questions might hear about it in subsequent days.

Another poll conducted the day after the shooting found that about half of Americans say the shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti was not justified, while only 20% said it was justified. The gap is even larger among Americans who have seen video of the shooting, nearly two-thirds of whom say it was not justified. While ICE has been the subject of protests since the first killing in Minneapolis — of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross — the shooter in this case worked for the Border Patrol, another agency in the Department of Homeland Security that was supporting ICE's operations in the city. Americans' opinions toward the Border Patrol are not as negative as views of ICE, though Americans who have seen video of the killing are more likely to have an unfavorable than a favorable opinion of the Border Patrol.

These latest results show an increase in opposition to ICE compared to two YouGov polls fielded earlier in January after the killing of Good. At that point, support for abolishing ICE was already at the highest level ever observed in YouGov polls.

Opposition to ICE has grown in January

More Americans support than oppose abolishing ICE (46% vs. 41%). This marks a slight increase from earlier this month, when three YouGov polls found that the share of Americans who supported eliminating ICE as a federal agency was roughly equal to the share who opposed it: 46% to 43% in one poll, 42% vs. 45% in another, and 45% vs. 45% in a third.

Democrats overwhelmingly support eliminating ICE (76% vs. 15%), as do nearly half of Independents (47% vs. 35%). Most Republicans (73%) continue to oppose abolishing ICE. Only 19% of Republicans support eliminating the agency, but that's a higher level than in any of the polls from earlier this month.

A majority (57%) of Americans somewhat or strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. Only 37% approve. Among Americans who have strong opinions about ICE, the divide is even starker. About half (48%) of Americans strongly disapprove, twice as many as the share who strongly approve: about one-quarter (23%).

Majorities of Democrats (83%) and Independents (54%) strongly disapprove of the way ICE is handling its job. In contrast, about half (51%) of Republicans strongly approve of ICE's job handling and only 7% strongly disapprove.

Views of ICE's tactics may contribute to the growing disapproval of the agency. A majority (58%) of Americans say that ICE's tactics are too forceful. That's a 5-percentage-point increase from earlier this month, when 53% said ICE was too forceful. Today, only 23% of Americans say that ICE's tactics are about right and 10% say they are not forceful enough.

Most Democrats (90%) and Independents (62%) say that ICE is too forceful. Republicans are much more likely to say that ICE's tactics are about right (49%). The remaining Republicans are about evenly split between saying ICE is too forceful and saying that it is not forceful enough (22% vs. 21%). Very few Democrats or Independents say that ICE is not forceful enough.

About half (49%) of Americans somewhat or strongly approve of protests against ICE actions, compared to 41% who disapprove. Most Democrats (79%) approve of such protests. Independents are more likely to approve than disapprove of them (49% vs. 35%). In contrast, only 20% of Republicans approve of protests against ICE, while 71% disapprove. Support for protests against ICE is essentially unchanged from earlier in January.

Few Americans think the shooting of Alex Pretti was justified

About half (48%) of Americans say the shooting of Pretti on Saturday in Minneapolis was not justified, while only 20% say it was justified. The gap is even larger among the majority (58%) of Americans who have seen video of the shooting. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of those who have seen video of the shooting say it was not justified, compared to just one-quarter (25%) who say it was not justified. This is similar to the results of an experiment conducted by YouGov with the Economist after the first shooting in Minneapolis: People who were shown a video of the shooting were more likely to say it was not justified. It also may reflect that more Democrats than Republicans have seen video of the shooting.

Democrats overwhelmingly say the shooting was not justified (83%), as do half of Independents (50%, compared to 13% who say it was justified). Republicans are much more likely to say the shooting was justified. The share of Republicans who say the shooting was justified (44%) is about the same as the share who say they're not sure if it was justified (43%). Few Republicans (13%) say the shooting was not justified.

Americans are slightly more likely to express favorable than unfavorable opinions of the Border Patrol (45% vs. 42%), the agency whose officer killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday. This can largely be attributed to Republicans' extremely positive evaluations of the agency: 83% of Republicans view the agency favorably, while only 7% have unfavorable opinions. In contrast, Independents are more likely to view the Border Patrol unfavorably than to view it favorably (48% vs. 34%) and most Democrats (73%) have unfavorable opinions of the agency while only 17% view it favorably.

Americans who have seen video of Saturday's shooting are much more likely to express negative views of the Border Patrol: A majority (53%) of Americans who have seen video of the shooting have an unfavorable opinion of the Border Patrol, compared to 41% who view the agency favorably. On the other hand, 52% of Americans who have not seen video of the shooting have a favorable opinion of the Border Patrol, while only 31% express an unfavorable opinion of the agency.

A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A federal judge will hear arguments Monday on whether she should at least temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that has led to the fatal shootings of two people by government officers.

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Saturday's shooting by a Border Patrol officer of Alex Pretti has only added urgency to the case.

Since the original filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request. They're trying to restore the state of affairs that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.

The hearing is set for Monday morning in federal court in Minneapolis. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he plans to personally attend.

They're asking that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Menendez order federal law enforcement agencies to reduce the numbers of officers and agents in Minnesota to levels before the surge, while allowing them to continue to enforce immigration laws within a long list of proposed limits.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit “legally frivolous” and said ""Minnesota wants a veto over federal law enforcement.” They asked the judge to reject the request or or at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Ellison said at a news conference Sunday that he and the cities filed their lawsuit because of “the unprecedented nature of this of this surge. It is a novel abuse of the Constitution that we’re looking at right now. No one can remember a time when we’ve seen something like this.”

It wasn't clear ahead of the hearing when the judge might rule.

The case also has implications for other states that have been or could be targets of intensive federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

""If left unchecked, the federal government will no doubt be emboldened to continue its unlawful conduct in Minnesota and to repeat it elsewhere,” the attorneys general wrote.

Menendez is the same judge who ruled in a separate case on Jan. 16 that federal officers in Minnesota can’t detain or tear gas peaceful protesters who aren’t obstructing authorities, including people who are following and observing agents.

An appeals court temporarily suspended that ruling three days before Saturday’s shooting. But the plaintiffs in that case, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota, asked the appeals court late Saturday for an emergency order lifting the stay in light of Pretti's killing. The Justice Department argued in a reply filed Sunday that the stay should remain in place, calling the injunction unworkable and overly broad.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, late Saturday issued an order blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday's shooting. Ellison and Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty asked for the order to try to preserve evidence collected by federal officials that state authorities have not yet been able to inspect. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Monday afternoon in federal court in St. Paul.

“The fact that anyone would ever think that an agent of the federal government might even think about doing such a thing was completely unforeseeable only a few weeks ago,"" Ellison told reporters. “But now, this is what we have to do.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c2/6c26a007-9a4e-5ff6-a33a-1b713f153292/69775b28ee301.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-26 08:57:47.225111

The organisation warned that the United States risked becoming a “model for strongmen” and “a warning rather than an inspiration”, while stressing that its protest was in solidarity with the American people.

The gathering will take place at 6:30pm.

In an open letter to Farkas, who recently took up her post, Repubblika said it had “followed with horror the growing number of deaths associated with immigration enforcement and detention” in the United States, referring to what it described as “murders and cruel atrocities currently being committed in America under the guise of enforcing immigration laws”.

The organisation said there were “credible reports of systemic abuse, medical neglect and excessive use of force”, stressing that these were “not isolated incidents”, and highlighted what it called the “distressing” treatment of minors by immigration authorities.

The NGO’s intervention follows the fatal shooting of 37-year-old intensive care nurse Alex Pretti by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis over the weekend, the second recent ICE-related fatal shooting in the city, as well as reports that a five-year-old boy was detained while returning home from school. Repubblika said US human rights and civil society organisations had described the incidents as “cruel, disproportionate and incompatible with the rule of law”, warning that federal methods were beginning to resemble those of authoritarian regimes.

Repubblika also referred to recent public comments by Farkas, who in a video posted on the US embassy’s social media channels last week said she would not hesitate to promote President Donald Trump’s political agenda in Malta. While the ambassador said the US and Malta were bound by shared democratic values and a commitment to peace and prosperity, Repubblika said it was “profoundly disturbed” by the agenda being pursued by the US administration, arguing that current policies could not be reconciled with democratic principles traditionally associated with American leadership.

“Most people would look at that video (of Good being shot) and say, ‘File that lawsuit, go get justice,’” attorney Antonio Romanucci told me. But suing the federal government is a complex undertaking, he said, involving knotty questions of legal immunity and constitutional law – even as he described the legal path the family might take.

Jumpstart your morning with the latest legal news delivered straight to your inbox from The Daily Docket newsletter. Sign up here.

Good, 37, was shot dead in her car on Jan. 7 by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. U.S. officials allege she attempted to run him over; her defenders say video shows she steered away. Her death preceded the fatal shooting of a Minnesota man, Alex Pretti, on Saturday by U.S. immigration agents.

The U.S. Justice Department and ICE did not respond to requests for comment on Good's shooting. The Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis shot Pretti in self-defense after he approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, but video reviewed by Reuters contradicted that account.

As my colleague Jan Wolfe has reported, suing individual government agents is exceedingly difficult. An alternative is the Federal Tort Claims Act, a 1946 law that establishes government liability for injuries or deaths caused by federal employees acting within the scope of their jobs.

Punitive damages, which can dramatically increase awards, are barred, as are jury trials. In addition to injury and death claims, plaintiffs can seek compensation for emotional distress or pain and suffering, said Romanucci, a co-founder of Chicago-based Romanucci & Blandin who also represented the family of George Floyd.

For a case to succeed, however, plaintiffs often must overcome a major hurdle: the discretionary function exception.

If the government invokes the defense, a court will determine whether a federal employee's conduct involved making a judgment or choice rather than simply following rules, and whether that choice was grounded in considerations of public policy. If the answer to both is yes, the government can avoid liability.

According to a 2024 Harvard Law Review article, opens new tab, when the United States invokes the exception in moving to dismiss a claim, it succeeds in terminating nearly 75% of claims.

Romanucci said he expects the government would argue that Ross’s use of deadly force falls under the provision.

But that may not be the end of the story. Romanucci said he also anticipates that if Good’s family opts to bring a lawsuit, they'll allege Ross violated the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by using deadly force.

That raises a pivotal question: Does the discretionary function exception shield conduct that is allegedly unconstitutional?

The federal appellate courts are split on the answer. Most – but not all – have held government officials “do not possess discretion to violate constitutional rights or federal statutes,” as the 4th Circuit put it in 2001, opens new tab. Notably, the 8th Circuit, which includes Minnesota, reached a similar conclusion in 2003, ruling, opens new tab that government activities that violate constitutional rights fall outside the discretionary-function exception.

But the 7th and 11th Circuits have rejected that view. The 11th Circuit wrote in 2021, opens new tab that it doesn’t matter “how poorly, abusively, or unconstitutionally” an employee acted — only whether the underlying decision was discretionary.

Should Good's case proceed, this circuit split could position it for U.S. Supreme Court review.

In the meantime, recent ICE settlements show how plaintiffs alleging constitutional violations have prevailed.

For example, in 2024 a federal judge in Manhattan allowed a suit to move forward by a woman from Ecuador, identified only as MQ, who allegedly fell while shackled by ICE in 2021, broke her ankle, and waited three months in detention before receiving treatment.

After an immigration judge granted her release on bail, she spoke critically to New York lawmakers and others about her experience. She claimed ICE retaliated by placing her back in detention, in violation of her First Amendment rights.

U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter Jr. ruled, opens new tab that the government cannot claim immunity from suit “when its officers engage in tortious conduct that violates the Constitution.” The government settled the case last year for $70,000, according to records in the Judgment Fund, opens new tab, which pays settlements and judgments against the United States.

ICE in court papers denied wrongdoing. MQ’s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

Judgment Fund records show other ICE-related settlements. For example, a Pennsylvania family claimed, opens new tab their Fourth Amendment rights were violated during a 2020 predawn raid in which officers allegedly injured a man and caused emotional distress to his wife and children. ICE again denied wrongdoing; the case settled for $72,500.

In total, the United States paid $5.25 million to settle 138 lawsuits involving ICE in 2025, according to Judgment Fund records, though most of the claims stemmed from traffic accidents.

Whether Good’s family can overcome the government’s defenses remains to be seen. If they sue, the case may ultimately test not just one agent’s judgment but the limits of federal accountability.

Video footage shot by bystanders shows Pretti filming a group of US Border Patrol agents on Saturday before stepping in to defend a woman who was shoved to the ground by one agent.

In footage shared by US-based Drop Site news, Pretti can be seen trying to help the woman before at least five agents tackle him to the ground and shoot him multiple times after a scuffle on the icy road.

Analysis of footage by US media and Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, shows that Pretti’s gun had already been confiscated by an agent before he was shot dead.

Minneapolis police chief Brian O’Hara later told reporters that Pretti was a “lawful gun owner” with a permit, and that his only criminal history was a few traffic tickets.

Despite the video evidence, Border Patrol Commander at Large Greg Bovino told a news conference that Pretti’s gun showed that he “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement”.

Stephen Miller, deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security, claimed without evidence that Pretti was an “assassin” who tried to “murder federal agents”, while DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said he had “violently” resisted arrest.

Popular right-wing influencers amplified the Trump administration’s claims on X.

The MAGA-allied account “Libs of TikTok” labelled Pretti a “lunatic” and an “assassin”.

Right-wing influencer Alexander Muse told his 681,000 followers that Pretti was “expecting a firefight at a distance” with federal agents despite there being no evidence that he ever took out or brandished his gun.

Some right-wing influencers went even further than echoing the Trump administration’s narrative, piling blatant misinformation on top of officials’ baseless accusations.

Trump ally Nick Sorter, who has 1.4 million followers on X, falsely claimed that Pretti, a US citizen, was an “illegal alien” who was “armed with a gun and attempted to PULL IT on agents as he was being apprehended”.

Conservative podcaster Jesse Kelly smeared Pretti as a “soldier for the communist revolution” who had “died fighting in a war” in an X post that included a photo of Pretti on a hike.

MAGA-affiliated accounts also shared digitally altered images purporting to be pictures of Pretti dressed in female clothing.

In a statement, Pretti’s parents said their son was a “kindhearted soul” and that the administration’s “sickening lies” about him were “reprehensible and disgusting”.

Claims that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” and scrutiny of his political beliefs mirror similar accusations levelled at Renee Good, a 37-year-old woman who was also fatally shot by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis earlier this month.

Trump administration officials also described Good as a “terrorist” and claimed that she was trying to run over an immigration officer with her vehicle despite video evidence casting doubt on those claims.

Officials have also spread misleading information seemingly aimed at discrediting protests against Trump’s anti-immigration crackdown more generally.

The White House last week shared an image of an arrested activist, Nekima Levy Armstrong, that had been altered with artificial intelligence to make her look emotionally distressed.

Some Republicans have pushed back on the narrative pushed around Pretti’s death, including Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, who said on X that “carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it’s a Constitutionally protected God-given right”.

The National Rifle Association, a pro-gun lobby group, also rejected a suggestion by a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor that approaching a law enforcement officer with a gun could be grounds for being shot.

Minnesota law enforcement officials have also contested statements by Trump administration officials, including a claim by Vice President JD Vance that local authorities refused to assist their federal counterparts in the investigation into Pretti’s killing.

Several constitutional law professors struggled to find a historic example of local officials being investigated over allegations of interfering with federal law enforcement.","Several legal experts say they haven’t seen any evidence to support the allegation that several Minnesota officials obstructed recent federal immigration enforcement as members of the Trump administration have suggested.

Federal prosecutors last week delivered subpoenas to the offices of Gov. Tim Walz, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and other officials, as the Justice Department seeks records for violations of unspecified federal laws during the intense immigration enforcement crackdown in the state.

The subpoenas are related to whether the state and local officials hindered the federal enforcement through public statements they’ve made, according to the Associated Press, which reported the investigation is focused on the potential violation of a conspiracy statute.

Minnesota officials have characterized the subpoenas as “political theater,” intimidation tactics and an attack on their First Amendment rights.

“Going on TV and saying ICE is violating constitutional rights of citizens and noncitizens, that is not impeding federal immigration,” said Jill Hasday, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Law School. “That is exercising First Amendment freedoms.

“I haven’t seen any evidence where they are actually impeding federal immigration enforcement.”

Hasday called the Justice Department’s probe of local officials “highly unusual,” a sentiment echoed by several constitutional law experts who spoke with the Minnesota Star Tribune.

The experts said comments made publicly by Democrats Walz and Frey, including fierce condemnations of the ICE crackdown and calls for residents to record activity and peacefully demonstrate, are constitutionally protected. (This story was reported before remarks made Saturday, Jan. 24, when Alex Pretti was fatally shot by an agent or agents with U.S. Border Patrol.)

Many Republicans have criticized the Minnesota officials for those statements, although after Pretti’s killing, President Donald Trump went further, accusing Walz and Frey of “inciting Insurrection” in a social media post that cited “their pompous, dangerous, and arrogant rhetoric.”

The Justice Department has not elaborated on its investigation to the Star Tribune. But the content of the subpoenas — legal orders to testify or produce documents related to a potential investigation — offer clearer insight into what federal prosecutors are seeking.

The subpoena issued to Frey’s office, which it shared, requires testimony before a grand jury on Feb. 3. It also requires the office to produce records, including documents related to the city’s cooperation with or refusal to aid immigration enforcement, refusal to comply with detainers and hindering, doxing, or surveilling immigration officers.

“Issuing subpoenas is an aggressive move,” Hasday said.

In 2018, she said, the Trump administration threatened to subpoena local officials over sanctuary city policies, making similar arguments about interfering with federal authorities. It ultimately did not carry through with the threat.

The Justice Department has filed civil lawsuits against several states and cities with sanctuary policies, alleging an obstruction of federal immigration law enforcement. In July, a federal judge dismissed such a lawsuit in Illinois. But the latest action shows an escalated approach as the department pursues a criminal investigation.

Peter Larsen, an assistant professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said such subpoenas “tend to be pretty exploratory in nature.”

“Grand jury processes themselves are very deferential, so to get a subpoena for this, you don’t have to prove that a crime occurred,” he said. “You don’t even have to really show good cause that a crime occurred.

“You only really need to show that you’re seeking materials that are relevant to a possible investigation.”

Ultimately, grand juries can decide to recommend charges or not.

The subpoena issued to Frey’s office also asks for emails, text messages, voice recordings and other communication related to federal immigration enforcement.

Federal prosecutors are likely casting a “wide net,” said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush.

“They’re looking for the needle in the haystack,” said Painter, an outspoken critic of Trump. “They’re probably trying to look for some hothead who said something really stupid.

“They’re going to go through thousands of emails to find something. I’d be extremely surprised if they found anything that would be grounds for any type of serious criminal investigation.”

However, he said, “Could they find something potentially embarrassing? Yes.”

Mary McCord, a Georgetown University law professor and former federal prosecutor and Justice Department official, said the subpoena of Frey’s office suggests the government is “criminally investigating state and local officials for doing what they’re entitled do to, which is not voluntarily cooperate with ICE or DHS, and instead do just what is required by law.”

Not cooperating with ICE beyond what is required by law would not amount to impeding federal immigration enforcement, she said.

McCord is also the executive director of the nonpartisan Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown, which has brought litigation against the Trump administration.

“Impeding would have to be something more than that. Impeding would require some sort of force,” she said. “I have not seen even a suggestion that these officials have engaged in force or even incited others to engage in force. They’ve been telling people to be peaceful.”

Federal subpoenas of local officials or their offices usually stem from corruption scandals, misappropriated federal funds or criminal activities, University of Minnesota Law School professor Myron Orfield said — not policy disagreement.

Several constitutional law professors struggled to find a historic example of local officials being investigated over allegations of interfering with federal law enforcement.

Orfield said the closest example he can think of is the massive resistance by several Southern governors to federal court-ordered integration during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ’60s.

“Many governors opposed federal court orders on integration and used very strong language, called the federal government communists and everything you can think of,” Orfield said. “And they were never investigated” for their political views or statements.

Another example, Larsen said, is when the government brought charges against several members of the Ku Klux Klan and local law enforcement in the killings of three civil rights workers in Mississippi in 1964.

The suspects were charged with conspiring to deprive the three men of their civil rights (loosely, the basis of the movie “Mississippi Burning.”) At the time, the state declined to press murder charges.

“That’s the comparator we have, really. We really don’t see this happening in other times and places,” Larsen said.

At the same time, he said, this is different.

“We’re talking about criminal obstruction,” he said. “With criminal obstruction, typically that’s a much higher bar and we don’t see that in modern history.”

Ultimately, Larsen said, a grand jury could recommend issuing charges, or it could reject the prosecutors’ argument and decline charges. Such was the case in December when a grand jury declined to federally indict New York Attorney General Leticia James.

“A lot of investigations that do come before grand juries tend to end quietly and tend to end without charges,” Larsen said. “Also if the (Justice Department) did ultimately bring charges, this would be a pretty novel application, it’s a break from historical practice, and it’s a major escalation in this federal-state conflict.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/RB5KHq6eaUSaCX2wtltfMQqKy5k=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2026/01/25/69769a1e0158c.hires.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 08:57:58.968441

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security earlier this month, accusing the feds of usurping the state’s right to police itself and putting an undue burden on local officials.

RELATED: Minnesota AG, Twin Cities mayors sue DHS to end ‘federal invasion’

Local officials are hoping the lawsuit will get a judge to put an immediate stop to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations across the state.

Ellison over the weekend called ICE’s surge a “novel abuse of the Constitution.”

Federal officials dispute that, claiming the state’s lawsuit is “legally frivolous” and based only on political motivations rather than legal basis.

A federal judge could issue a preliminary ruling as early as Monday morning.

Then, on Monday afternoon, a hearing is set for a joint lawsuit from the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension that seeks to force federal agents to maintain any evidence related to the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.

A judge granted a temporary restraining order Saturday night, telling federal officials to preserve all evidence.

This challenge comes after Homeland Security officials again prevented state investigators from inspecting the scene where Pretti was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday. The BCA was out Sunday inspecting the scene and is trying to conduct its own investigation. However, state leaders say there still isn’t cooperation from their federal counterparts.

The officers were in Minneapolis as part of a large-scale crackdown by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Pretti’s death was the latest in a string of horrific, violent, and fatal incidents by federal officers participating in ICE’s Minneapolis operation.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts the database, known as Investigative Case Management (ICM), that ICE uses to target and deport immigrants.
When Amazon employees urged then-CEO Jeff Bezos to terminate its relationship with ICE in 2018, Bezos defended the practice.","On Saturday morning, federal officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, in Minneapolis. While administration officials claimed that Pretti “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun,” video of the incident showed Pretti was holding a phone. The officers were in Minneapolis as part of a large-scale crackdown by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

As Pretti was attempting to assist another person who had been pepper-sprayed in the face, a group of federal officers pushed him to the ground, beat him, and shot him multiple times at close range. Pretti was licensed to carry a gun, but there is no indication that he was ever holding a weapon, much less threatening the officers.

Pretti’s death was the latest in a string of horrific, violent, and fatal incidents by federal officers participating in ICE’s Minneapolis operation.

Hours after Pretti was killed, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy was in Washington, DC, visiting the White House for a screening of Melania, a documentary produced by First Lady Melania Trump. As Jassy and other guests entered, a military band played “Melania’s Waltz,” a song composed for the film. Guests received “glossy, commemorative black and white popcorn boxes for guests, served by gloved waiters.”

Amazon paid $59 million for the rights to the vanity project, most of which went to Melania Trump herself. According to Matt Belloni, Amazon is paying another $35 million to promote the film. Despite the massive budget, Amazon “has not shared the film with critics, and won’t before its release.”

Although Melania will almost certainly lose tens of millions of dollars for Amazon, it is a small price to pay to stay in the good graces of President Donald Trump and his administration. Amazon has billions in government contracts and provides much of the technological backbone for ICE’s surveillance and deportation activities.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts the database, known as Investigative Case Management (ICM), that ICE uses to target and deport immigrants. ICM, which was created by Palantir, “integrates a vast ecosystem of public and private data to track down immigrants and, in many cases, deport them.” The data includes “a person’s immigration history, family relationships, personal connections, addresses, phone records, biometric traits, and other information.” Through Palantir, AWS receives millions of dollars annually from the federal government to host ICM.

Last April, the Trump administration awarded Palantir a new $30 million contract to create “ImmigrationOS,” which is “a new tool to provide [ICE] with enhanced capabilities to support deportation efforts.” ImmigrationOS is likely hosted on AWS, which has a strategic partnership with Palantir.

AWS also hosts a massive surveillance system for ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The $6 billion system, known as Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART), is designed to hold “personal and biometric data on over 270 million people, including 6.7 million iris scans and 1.1 billion face images.”

In a 2022 letter to Amazon, advocates argued that by “hosting DHSʼ HART database, AWS is directly facilitating the creation of an invasive biometrics database that will supercharge surveillance and deportation, risking human rights violations.” They urged Amazon to stop powering the HART database, which is still in development, but the company did not respond.

When Amazon employees urged then-CEO Jeff Bezos to terminate its relationship with ICE in 2018, Bezos defended the practice. “There aren’t other countries where everybody is trying to get in,” Bezos told WIRED. “I’d let them in if it were me. I like ‘em, I want all of them in. But this is a great country and it does need to be defended.”

On its corporate webpage, Amazon says it “support[s] our refugee and humanitarian-based immigrant population because we recognize the challenges they face in the U.S.” This is the same population being targeted in Minneapolis.

In November 2025, Amazon announced it was investing $50 billion to build out its cloud and AI services for the federal government. ICE and related agencies are in a position to provide Amazon with a return on its investment. Trump’s megabill, enacted last year, “allocated more than $170 billion over four years for border and interior enforcement.”

Amazon, which did not respond to a request for comment, is one of several consumer-facing brands with deep financial connections to ICE.

Citizens Bank

Since Trump returned to the White House for a second term, the population of migrants held by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has exploded — from below 40,000 in January 2025 to over 73,000 today. This has created a massive demand for private prison companies, including GEO Group and CoreCivic, to build new facilities.

Numerous financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, SunTrust, BNP Paribas, and Fifth Third Bancorp, pledged in 2019 to stop working with the private prison industry. (Bank of America and SunTrust have since “softened their policy statements to allow financing again for detention companies in some circumstances.”)

But Citizens Financial Group, which operates Citizens Bank, has continued to provide financing for private prison construction. In July 2025, Citizens provided a $450 million revolving credit line to GEO Group. Earlier, in March 2025, Citizens underwrote $500 million in bonds for CoreCivic.

On its website, Citizens says it is “committed to strengthening communities“ and works “to advance social equity.” The company did not respond to a request for comment.

AT&T

In September 2024, AT&T inked a 10-year, $147 million contract with ICE’s parent agency, DHS, to “provide mission-critical communications services.” The agreement provides ICE and other DHS subdivisions with “end-to-end voice priority over the AT&T commercial wireless network.” In August, the Trump administration awarded AT&T an $11 million no-bid contract to provide ICE with “data analytics and support services.”

AT&T pitched FirstNet, its specialized network for first responders, to the federal government, touting its ability to use “photographs, real-time audio/video feeds, and databases from other state, local, or Federal agencies… to aid in the identification… of undocumented immigrants.”

AT&T’s Human Rights Policy, last updated in August 2025, says the company seeks “to ensure that we are not complicit in human rights abuses.” It also stresses that “all people, regardless of status or circumstance, deserve the dignity and freedom of human rights protections.”

Last November, activists in Chicago accused AT&T of “lin[ing] its pockets with public dollars” from ICE, “whose agents are masked, unidentifiable, and operating without warrants as they terrorize members of the public.”

AT&T did not respond to a request for comment.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D_Jp!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74a02b0a-4386-43e4-9515-924ad9338051_1024x793.jpeg",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:30.450605

The US president told the Wall Street Journal in a short interview that immigration enforcement officers would leave the Minneapolis area “at some point”.

The publication said Trump did not directly answer when asked twice whether the officer who shot Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, had done the right thing. Pressed further, he said: “We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.”

It said Trump criticised Pretti for carrying a gun during protest activity, quoting the president as saying: “I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it. But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”

Trump signalled a willingness to eventually withdraw immigration enforcement officials from the Minneapolis area, saying: “At some point we will leave. We’ve done, they’ve done a phenomenal job.”

A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after Pretti’s fatal shooting – a sign that the Trump administration’s accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.

The Republican chair of the House homeland security committee, Andrew Garbarino, has sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection and US Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe”, according to the Associated Press.

Other congressional Republicans have pressed for more information, including the Texas representative Michael McCaul and the senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflects a party struggling with how to respond to federal agents’ killing of Pretti.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) almost immediately alleged Pretti had “violently resisted” officers, saying they fired “defensive shots”. Video evidence contradicts that account. Trump also shared an image of the pistol allegedly found on Pretti in a Truth Social post, writing: “This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!) and ready to go.”

Pretti was reportedly legally permitted to carry a gun. Widely circulated video of his shooting death does not appear to depict him holding a gun; it does show an officer reaching to Pretti’s lower back and stepping away with what appeared to be a pistol – and Pretti being subsequently shot to death.

The National Rifle Association, the nation’s largest pro-gun group, also responded after Bill Essayli – who was appointed by Trump to temporarily serve as a US attorney in California in 2025 – posted on social media: “If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you.”

The NRA posted: “This sentiment … is dangerous and wrong. Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former House Republican from Georgia, posted in support of law enforcement, but defended the right to legally carry firearms. “I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement. However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment,” Greene wrote. “Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.

She added: “I support American’s 1st and 4th amendment rights. There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing.”

Democrats have vowed to withhold further funding from DHS unless a bill soon to come before the Senate is amended to include reforms that would restrict federal agents’ actions in their deportation surge.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said Democrats would not provide the necessary votes if DHS funding remained in the measure. A spokesperson for the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said DHS and other government funds would be voted on as a single package. Without a compromise, the government faces a partial shutdown at the end of January.

The Connecticut Democratic senator Chris Murphy told CNN’s State of the Union that Democrats “can’t vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security … that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country, in violation of the law.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5e2893dd202a8bed3b5c19ad4d2407a53d5c391/295_0_4167_3333/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6608323097a495008f3614d03b0ef587",N,,2026-01-26 08:57:33.620952

The big picture: While administration officials stayed on message and backed the federal agents in Minnesota, the criticisms show Republican cracks over Trump's increasingly unpopular immigration agenda.

What they're saying: One of the most high profile warnings came from Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) who signaled to the administration — albeit gently — that federal agents should leave Minneapolis.

""If I were President Trump I would almost think about ... if the mayor and the governor are going to put our ICE officials in harms way and there's a chance of losing more innocent lives ... then maybe go to another city,"" he said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Comer predicted Minnesotans would ""rebel against their leadership"" while he still blamed state officials.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who is overseeing a precarious appropriations process as immigration enforcement surges in her state, said in a statement to Axios that the shooting ""needs to be thoroughly and transparently investigated to determine whether or not excessive force was used in a situation that may have been able to be diffused without violence.""

She added, ""I urge protestors to keep space between themselves and law enforcement and not to interfere with operations.""

Sen. Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) called the situation ""horrifying"" in a Sunday statement and called for a ""prioritized, transparent investigation."" He also said his support for funding ICE has not changed.

Zoom out: Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-N.Y.), head of the House Homeland Security Committee, on Saturday requested testimony from officials leading ICE, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

However, his letters did not directly mention Saturday's shooting.

Rep. Michael Baumgartner (R-Wash.) applauded the requests, saying he was ""disturbed"" by the video out of Minnesota and stressing the importance of transparency in immigration enforcement operations.

Yes, but: Many of the Republicans who spoke out, including Sens. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), are retiring or have frequently broken with Trump.

They implored federal agents to cooperate with local law enforcement and avoid a rush to judgment.

""The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,"" wrote Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.). ""The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.""

The other side: White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson praised the ""heroic"" immigration officers for capturing criminals ""despite violent resistance and dangerous, untrue smears against them.""

Catch up quick: After federal officials shot Minneapolis nurse Alex Pretti Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security claimed he had approached the officers with a gun and appeared to want to ""massacre law enforcement.""

Top officials were also quick to label Pretti a domestic terrorist.

However, footage from the scene shows Pretti filming the officers with a camera before he was sprayed with chemical agents and wrestled to the ground. Afterwards several shots ring out.

Local officials have said Pretti lawfully possessed his weapon.

Friction point: Democrats are already demanding Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment, and the handling of Pretti's death threatens the administration's credibility even among allies, Axios' Marc Caputo reports.

Notably, the incident put feds on a collision course with second amendment advocacy groups, typically friendlier to a gun-rights-focused GOP.

Prominent voices in the splintered MAGA media landscape and broader conservative media criticized administration officials' rhetoric after the shooting, on the concealed-carry issue and beyond.

Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.
Fear, trust and public safety Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.
A broader political test The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.
Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.","As federal immigration enforcement activity increases in Democratic-led states across the country, immigrant advocates and civil rights groups are warning that Virginia — which recently flipped full control of state government to Democrats — could be next.

Gov. Abigail Spanberger, sworn in earlier this month as Virginia’s 75th governor, has moved quickly to draw a line between state law enforcement and federal immigration enforcement, while acknowledging that much of the authority still rests outside her control.

Just hours after taking the oath of office on Jan. 17, Spanberger fulfilled a promise she made in an August interview with The Mercury, rescinding former Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 47.

The order had directed Virginia State Police and the Department of Corrections to enter into so-called 287(g) agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, effectively deputizing state officers to assist with federal immigration enforcement and encouraging local cooperation with ICE to identify and remove noncitizens accused or convicted of crimes.

Spanberger’s executive action marked a sharp policy reversal after years of Republican leadership in Richmond and came as immigration enforcement has intensified in blue states under President Donald Trump’s renewed push for large-scale deportations.

“My executive order, repealing Executive Order 47, was an important first step in ensuring that we are not moving or reallocating state and local resources away from the first-responder duties, whether it is investigating crimes or being ready to support a community in need,” Spanberger said last week.

She emphasized the prior order “had created some real challenges.”

“Ultimately, I am looking to every step forward that we can take as a commonwealth to ensure that our communities are safe and protected,” Spanberger continued, adding that confusion around law enforcement authority has fueled fear in immigrant communities.

“Frankly, the fear and concern that we’ve seen in other places where people without any sort of designation — unannounced, wearing masks — are taking people off the streets, the level of fear that that’s created and the level of distrust and confusion is certainly not contributing to any strengthening of our communities, let alone keeping our communities safer.”

On Friday, members of Virginia’s Service Employees International Union chapters gathered outside a U.S. federal courthouse in Richmond to protest ICE enforcement, underscoring growing opposition from labor and immigrant advocates.

About 50 people attended the demonstration, where speakers criticized federal detention practices and read aloud the names of individuals who have been killed during ICE operations over the past year.

“We’re seeing the ICE escalate everywhere from from Minneapolis all the way here to Richmond,” said Violeta Vega, an SEIU member serving as an emcee for the gathering.

State action, limited reach

While Spanberger’s order ends the requirement that state agencies enter into 287(g) agreements, it does not terminate existing contracts between ICE, state and local governments, regional jails or sheriffs’ offices. Nor does it prohibit new agreements at the local level.

All state and local agreements “remain in force until terminated” by one or both parties, a new Legal Aid Justice Center analysis found. There has been no evidence to date that any existing contracts between ICE and state or local law enforcement have been ended as a result of the governor’s action.

The report details how dozens of agencies across Virginia — including state agencies and regional jails — have contracted with ICE to perform duties that may exceed their authority or conflict with state law and the Virginia Constitution.

The analysis further found that at least 223 state and local personnel have been nominated to participate in 287(g) agreements, including two school resource officers and a behavioral health advocate. One facility — the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George County — receives more than half of its revenue from holding people for ICE.

“Those local law enforcement agencies with 287(g) agreements now have a massive financial incentive to abandon their mission to protect communities in favor of terrorizing immigrant populations,” said Alex Kornya, LAJC’s director of litigation.

“Contracts with ICE, often shrouded in secrecy, are not only a misuse of time and resources, but they also open these agencies up to significant liability, liability that Virginia taxpayers will ultimately pay.”

LAJC said many of the agreements were negotiated quietly, with agencies declining to provide information in response to public records requests — in some cases saying ICE instructed them not to respond.

According to ICE’s own website, there are currently at least 32 active 287(g) agreements in Virginia involving the state and local governments, and correctional facilities. Five are with state agencies, while the remainder involve local law enforcement.

ICE did not respond to a request for comment from The Mercury.

Fear, trust and public safety

Civil rights groups, including LAJC, say the impact of these agreements extends beyond immigration enforcement, undermining trust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement.

“Governor Spanberger’s action to rescind EO 47 on her first day was an important step, as these contracts do nothing to make people safer,” said Rohmah Javed, legal director of LAJC’s Immigrant Justice Program, adding that immigrant communities across the state are terrified.

“These agreements erode trust, making it much less likely immigrants will seek out needed services, report crimes witnessed or crimes they have experienced as victims, or participate in their communities,” Javed said. “But we need to see immediate action at both the state and local levels to officially end these abusive agreements.”

The ACLU of Virginia called the order a first step toward ensuring state law enforcement is not used for federal immigration enforcement, while cautioning that existing contracts and federal authority remain unchanged.

“Governor Spanberger’s executive order recognizes that blurring the line between Virginia law enforcement and federal immigration agents not only diverts Virginia resources away from public safety priorities, but erodes public trust by terrorizing communities and breaking apart families,” ACLU of Virginia Executive Director Mary Bauer said.

Republicans warn repeal of ICE order threatens public safety

Virginia GOP leaders, meanwhile, sharply criticized Spanberger’s decision, arguing that rescinding Youngkin’s order weakens cooperation with federal authorities and threatens public safety.

Youngkin himself told The Mercury in an interview earlier this month that rescinding his Executive Order 47 would be “a huge mistake,” calling it a necessary tool for combating violent crime and gang activity, particularly in Northern Virginia.

“That partnership has made Virginia safer. We arrested the number-three guy in MS-13; the number three guy in MS-13 was just living in Virginia that otherwise would have never been arrested,” Youngkin said.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, former Attorney General Jason Miyares called Spanberger’s move “a disaster for the public safety” of the commonwealth. “Mark my words, there will be Virginians who will be robbed, raped and murdered as a result of this anti public safety executive order. No one should be surprised.”

House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, also warned that ending mandated cooperation with ICE could lead to increased crime.

“Folks need to be able to walk their street at night without fear of being either shot or kidnapped or raped. It’s the wrong way to move with public safety in Virginia,” Kilgore said. “When Governor Youngkin had the agreement, we were able to catch all those MS-13 gang members up in Northern Virginia. If we’re not cooperating with ICE, folks are going to get harmed in Virginia.”

However, federal data show that immigrants without criminal records now make up the largest share of people held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, despite repeated assertions by some political leaders that enforcement is focused primarily on violent offenders.

According to ICE’s own figures, roughly 73% of those in detention as of late 2025 had no criminal conviction, and only a small fraction were held for violent offenses — many others had only minor or civil immigration offenses.

In Virginia, too, officials have not substantiated claims about the criminal histories of people rounded up by the state’s task force. Last summer, Youngkin claimed his administration had arrested more than 2,500 immigrants who were “violent criminals,” but Miyares at the time declined to provide evidence that those individuals were in fact violent offenders when pressed by The Mercury.

Local leaders respond

In Richmond, Mayor Danny Avula — the city’s first immigrant mayor — issued a statement addressing community concerns following reports of ICE activity in the region, including recent activity in Chesterfield County and Petersburg.

“I understand there is tremendous fear in the community right now,” Avula said. “Fear in completing everyday tasks, such as showing up for work, taking your children to school, or buying groceries, and I want you to know I hear you.”

Avula emphasized that Richmond does not coordinate with ICE on deportation activities and that the Richmond Police Department has not entered into a 287(g) agreement.

“Our officers are here to focus on their core mission: community policing, protecting all neighborhoods, and reducing crime,” Avula said, urging residents to call 911 if they need law enforcement assistance.

“I reject any approach that creates fear, confusion, or division,” he added. “Those tactics undermine public safety and erode trust, making our communities less safe, not more secure.”

Meanwhile, immigration enforcement concerns intensified last week after Hanover County officials confirmed receiving a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security outlining plans to purchase and operate an ICE processing facility in a warehouse on Lakeridge Parkway.

County officials said the project was not initiated by Hanover and that the county has 30 days to respond. The Board of Supervisors had not convened to discuss the proposal as of Thursday and is expected to address the matter at its Jan. 28 meeting.

Virginia currently has two major long-term ICE detention centers — the Farmville Detention Center and the Caroline Detention Facility — along with regional jails that hold detainees under contract, including the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail.

Advocacy groups say any expansion of processing or detention capacity could deepen fear in surrounding communities.

A broader political test

The debate over federal immigration enforcement underscores a broader challenge for Democratic governors in states where ICE activity remains governed largely by federal authority and locally negotiated contracts.

In Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz publicly condemned a federal immigration operation in Minneapolis that sparked widespread protest after a federal agent fatally shot a 37-year old woman through her car window earlier this month. Following the killing, Walz demanded that the state must play a role in the investigation of the incident.

Coverage of the fallout has highlighted the limited tools Democratic governors have to rein in enforcement carried out independently by ICE or through local arrangements.

Similar tensions have surfaced in Illinois and Massachusetts, where Democratic governors back sanctuary-style policies but continue to face criticism when ICE makes arrests in jails and courthouses governed by local practices rather than state law.

In Illinois, confusion over the state’s TRUST Act has left sheriffs and the governor caught between immigrant advocates and federal officials. In Massachusetts, renewed attention to ICE courthouse arrests has put Gov. Maura Healey under pressure to respond to enforcement decisions she does not control.

Against that backdrop, Spanberger has emphasized that the stakes in Virginia are about trust — particularly whether immigration enforcement policies discourage people from calling police when they need help.

“Ultimately, how we will determine how Virginia proceeds is that — and I say this as someone who grew up in a law enforcement family and began my career in law enforcement — the idea that any community member would be afraid of calling police in a time of need, if there’s an emergency in their home, is a tragedy in and of itself,” Spanberger said.

Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.","On January 12, 2026, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to address a deepening circuit split about the process for certifying collective class actions under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""ADEA"") and the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""). As a result, uncertainty persists for employers and employees alike, with federal courts adopting a range of standards.

Historical Class Certification Standard

Both Rule 23 class actions and FLSA section 216(b) collective actions allow employees to bring suit on behalf of others who are ""similarly situated."" Section 216(b) mandates employee-plaintiffs opt-in to the lawsuit, which requires courts to approve and oversee the circulation of class notice to potential plaintiffs. The same process applies to ADEA class actions. In Hoffman-La Roche, Inc. v. Sperling (1989), the U.S. Supreme Court authorized the sending of notice of a FLSA collective action to potential opt-in plaintiffs so long as that notice is neutral, timely and accurate. Following the Supreme Court's holding in Hoffman-La Roche, most federal courts adopted a plaintiff-friendly, two-step analysis articulated in Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. Under the Lusardi approach, plaintiffs who demonstrate that employees are ""similarly situated"" based on a ""modest factual showing"" achieve conditional certification.

Conditional certification permits district courts to oversee the circulation of notice to potential class action members. Courts then consider final certification or decertification at a later point in the case. Practically, this lenient standard has increased class sizes and created pressure for employers to settle early, before incurring the time and expense associated with the seemingly perfunctory ""conditional"" certification process and, thereafter, the final, evidence-based class certification decision.

Seventh Circuit's Approach

In August, the Seventh Circuit, in Richards v. Eli Lilly & Company, departed from the two-step Lusardi analysis. There, the Seventh Circuit held that district courts must consider evidence from both sides concerning whether workers are similarly situated enough to proceed together. Under the Seventh Circuit's approach in Richards, a plaintiff must first make a threshold showing that there is a material factual dispute as to whether the proposed collective is similarly situated. Thereafter, employer/defendants may submit rebuttal evidence. Once the court determines a material dispute exists, the decision to issue notice rests on its assessment of the factual dispute before it. Overall, this standard requires more evidence than Lusardi, which can reduce the pressure employers feel to settle that has traditionally accompanied conditional certification.

Fifth and Sixth Circuit Approach

Like the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits have moved away from the traditional Lusardi standard.

In the Fifth Circuit (Swales v. KLLM Transport Services LLC), plaintiffs must meet a more demanding one-step test, showing it is ""more likely than not"" that employees are similarly situated. When crafting this standard in Swales, the Fifth Circuit noted the more lenient Lusardi approach resulted in broad circulation of conditional class notice to plaintiffs who were not truly similarly situated. This was frequently used as leverage against employers to compel them to settle. Similar to the Seventh Circuit, the Fifth Circuit now requires lower courts to vet plaintiffs at the outset of litigation and consider all available evidence before authorizing class notices. This standard is far more favorable to employer/defendants.

In the Sixth Circuit (Clark v. A&L Homecare and Training Center, LLC), plaintiffs must demonstrate a ""strong likelihood"" that the proposed group is similarly situated. The Sixth Circuit rejected the ""more likely than not"" standard as too high of a bar for plaintiffs, but found the Lusardi approach too lenient. Thus, in the Sixth Circuit, a plaintiff must make a showing that goes beyond creating a genuine issue of fact, but it need not rise to the level of ""more likely than not"" or a ""preponderance"". Accordingly, the standard of proof in the Sixth Circuit falls between Lusardi and Swales.

The Supreme Court Denies Certiorari in Richards

In Richards, Eli Lilly submitted a petition for certiorari—which was joined by several amici—arguing that it was critical the Supreme Court resolve the growing circuit split in class certification standards. Last week, however, the Supreme Court denied certiorari. Richards will now head back to the district court, which will likely apply the new Seventh Circuit standard to determine class certification.

What Employers Need to Know

The Supreme Court's refusal to hear argument in Richards leaves a variance in class certification standards across jurisdictions. While most federal courts continue to apply the Lusardi approach—a relatively low bar for plaintiffs to obtain condition certification—recent decisions in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Circuits have created stricter, more employer-friendly standards. These varying criteria will almost certainly have the strategic effect of encouraging collective action plaintiffs to file suit—if jurisdictionally possible—in circuits other than the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh. Until the Supreme Court provides definitive guidance, employers must remain aware of the disparate standards and procedures that accompany collective action lawsuits across the country.

The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts.
Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.
Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms.","The federal killing of a U.S. citizen in Minneapolis this month, captured from multiple angles by witnesses recording on their cell phones, kicked off a dizzying day here and in Washington. Democratic politicians and ordinary Americans reacted with a mix of outrage and incredulousness, backfooting the Trump administration as the federal operation Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has called an “occupation” approached its third month.

By late Saturday, a Trump-appointed Minnesota federal judge had ordered the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said his party would block a must-pass government appropriations package — and partially shut down the government next week — if it contained additional funding for the Homeland Security Department.

As it did earlier this month after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed 37-year-old Minneapolis resident Renee Nicole Good, senior Trump administration officials worked swiftly on Saturday to blame the incident on the victim.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Alex Jeffrey Pretti a “domestic terrorist,” echoing language used by Vice President JD Vance to describe Good. Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said Pretti appeared eager to inflict “maximum damage” on the federal agents assembled near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street Saturday morning. Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s chief domestic policy advisor, called Pretti an “assassin.”

Videos taken at the scene — as well as what’s known about Pretti’s background — belie the Trump administration’s claims. Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a concealed carry permit and no criminal record, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara.

Moments before he was shot, Pretti could be seen on video with his phone — not a gun — recording federal officers, as has become standard practice among anti-ICE activists.

A cell phone video shows a gaggle of Border Patrol agents wrestling him to the ground and beating him; an agent removes Pretti’s holstered gun, and Pretti appears to pose no threat to the officers surrounding him. Moments later, about 10 shots ring out.

In a sworn affidavit filed Saturday evening, a physician who lives nearby said Pretti had no pulse when they arrived at the scene. The physician, whose name and identity were not made public, said agents did not appear to be rendering lifesaving aid and initially refused the physician’s offer to help. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.

Pretti’s name had emerged in media reports by early afternoon. It’s unclear whether federal, state or local officials attempted to notify his next of kin beforehand. Michael Pretti, his father, said he first learned of the shooting from an Associated Press reporter.

“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti told the AP, detailing a runaround with the Border Patrol, local police and area hospitals. He said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner eventually confirmed they had Alex Pretti’s body.

“We are heartbroken but also very angry,” Pretti’s parents said in a statement released later on Saturday that described Pretti as a “hero” who “wanted to make a difference in this world.”

“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said. “Please get the truth out about our son.”

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said DHS officials blocked their investigators from the crime scene even after they returned with a judicial warrant. The details of the warrant are unclear, as is the BCA’s recourse if Homeland Security continues to stymie its efforts. Federal officials said Saturday that Homeland Security — not the FBI or the Minnesota BCA — would lead the investigation.

The names of the agents involved in the shooting have not been released. Bovino told CNN on Sunday that he did not know whether more than one agent fired shots.

Minnesota officials questioned Homeland Security’s handling of the shooting’s aftermath and indicated they did not trust the department to conduct a fair investigation.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections unveiled a new website this weekend to combat “ongoing misinformation” from Homeland Security. In a lengthy statement on Saturday, the department called into question Bovino’s initial explanation for the operation that led to Pretti’s death. The statement said the individual named by Bovino as the target of the operation did not have a significant criminal history, as Bovino alleged, and was previously released from immigration custody in 2018 — during the first Trump administration.

A recent article by Stateline, which is a States Newsroom outlet like the Reformer, found that eyewitness testimony and other evidence often contradicts DHS’ initial description of incidents involving its agents.

On Sunday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he expects Homeland Security to heed Saturday’s court order to preserve evidence to support the state’s own investigation.

“We’ve had to threaten them with contempt a few times, but open defiance of court orders is not something that we’ve experienced,” Ellison told the Star Tribune.

Signs had emerged by Sunday that at least some elected Republicans and gun rights groups were uncomfortable with the official line that Pretti posed a clear and present danger before his death. Few elected Republicans wholeheartedly endorsed the administration’s narrative, and even some right-wing influencers who typically hew to the party line recoiled.

Republican Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who faces a primary challenge from his right this year, called Saturday’s shooting “incredibly disturbing.”

“The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake,” he said on Sunday. “There must be a full joint federal and state investigation.”

The Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus also issued a statement calling for an independent investigation.

“Every peaceable Minnesotan has the right to keep and bear arms — including while attending protests, acting as observers, or exercising their First Amendment rights. These rights do not disappear when someone is lawfully armed, and they must be respected and protected at all times,” the group said.

Kevin Stitt, the outgoing Republican governor of Oklahoma, hinted in a Sunday interview with CNN that the administration should rethink its immigration enforcement efforts.

“And so what’s the goal right now? Is it to deport every single non-U.S. citizen? I don’t think that’s what Americans want,” he said. “We have to stop politicizing this. We need real solutions on immigration reform.”

Dozens of Minnesota business leaders released an open letter that gently called for a change in approach by the federal government, risking the ire of Trump, who is known for his retribution against those who oppose him.

“With yesterday’s tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” the CEOs wrote.

Among them were top officers of Medtronic, 3M, Target and the sports franchises. This is notable because as the Reformer previously reported, the state’s biggest companies had been publicly silent until now. Business leaders, the chamber letter asserts, have been “working behind the scenes” since the federal siege began.

Some in the Trump administration may be looking for an escape hatch, even if on their terms. On Saturday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said Minnesota could end the federal law enforcement surge if it repealed pro-immigrant “sanctuary” policies and turned over its voter rolls to the federal government. (Minnesota is not a “sanctuary state”; an effort to pass a sanctuary law the last time Democrats controlled the Legislature went nowhere.)

That Bondi made such an offer at all is notable. But it’s unlikely to lead to a resolution. On Sunday, Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon brushed off the idea of providing state voter information to the federal government in a caustic statement.

“The answer to Attorney General Bondi’s request is no. Her letter is an outrageous attempt to coerce Minnesota into giving the federal government private data on millions of U.S. Citizens in violation of state and federal law,” Simon said.

False claims of voter fraud have become a staple of the Trumpist political movement. A group of right-wing activists led by Mike Lindell — the pillow mogul currently running for governor as a Republican — claimed widespread voter fraud after the 2020 election. But as part of the state’s usual election auditing process, a random group of precincts in every congressional district were chosen for review, totaling roughly 440,000 votes after the 2020 election, spanning more than 200 precincts. The hand tallies were virtually identical to the machine tallies.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NN260124_0763-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 06:58:07.846046

The surge of federal force to Minneapolis is testing long-held understandings of constitutional rights and the restraint, humanity and accountability owed to the governed by those who govern them in a democratic society.

By insisting that details of two killings that millions of Americans saw on cellphone videos did not take place, senior administration officials are fracturing reality and implying that their brazen power can be wielded with impunity.

And by prejudging and distorting the tragedy in its immediate aftermath, the officials have prejudiced an investigation they will conduct into one of the gravest events that can happen in a republic: government law enforcement killing a citizen.

A moment of national reckoning is building over the principles embedded in America’s moral and legal foundations — which will be extolled this year in celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.

Alex Pretti’s shooting also has more prosaic political implications. It’s the latest incident that raises questions over whether Trump, with his diminished approval ratings on most issues, has lost the public only a year into his second term. The administration’s unrepentant response is also another sign that it may be prepared to defy political fallout — even in a midterm election year — in its race to irrevocably change the US and the world.

Every sign Sunday was that the White House will not back down. But CNN reported on disquiet among Department of Homeland Security officials at the aggressive and polarizing approach of Secretary Kristi Noem. The former South Dakota governor could be vulnerable should Trump seek a new course.

Saturday’s tragedy also presented Democrats with a new dilemma on balancing fierce demands from base voters to try to thwart Trump’s strongman rule while having only limited power in Washington. The party hopes to keep attention on the president’s biggest current liability — his denial of an affordability crisis hampering working families.

In the past, Democrats have stumbled when Trump has lashed them as weak on crime and immigration and hostile to law enforcement. But the political heat is so intense that some Democratic senators are vowing to block a DHS funding bill, which could spark a partial government shutdown at the week’s end.

A tragedy that went national in a moment

The death of Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse and US citizen, on Saturday quickly flashed up in horrific, graphic detail on millions of cellphones. Once again, less than three weeks after the shooting death of Renee Good, outside federal forces gunned down a Minnesotan and deepened a national political and societal crisis.

Trump’s second term has been exhausting as the rush of events and recrimination shreds perspective about any single shock. While it’s difficult to assess the lasting significance of events in real time, there’s a growing sense that Minnesota could represent a definitional moment.

“What we’re seeing on TV, it’s causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,” Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “Americans don’t like what they’re seeing right now.”

The administration complains that Democratic local officials are not cooperating with 3,000 federal agents sent to Minnesota ostensibly to deport undocumented migrants with criminal records. It says that protesters who document agents’ activity are endangering them and breaking the law. Officials’ claims that “agitators” have joined protests may also contain some truth.

Trump on Sunday issued a series of demands on Minnesota officials and put the blame for the deaths of Pretti and Good not on aggressive federal agents, but rather on Democrats. He wrote on Truth Social the party was “putting Illegal Alien Criminals over Taxpaying, Law-Abiding Citizens, and they have created dangerous circumstances for EVERYONE involved. Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos.”

White House officials correctly state that one reason Trump was elected for a second term in 2024 was that Americans despaired at former President Joe Biden’s failure to secure the southern border. Some Republicans regard rhetoric from Democratic leaders such as Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey as inflammatory, playing to a liberal gallery and sure to spike dangerous tensions.

But there’s no evidence voters signed up for groups of armed and masked agents roaming city streets in SUVs or for sudden escalations that have left two citizens dead. Or that they think the constitutional right to protest should be abridged by an administration that seems to have chosen a Democratic state for a power play.

Americans have also not signed off on the apparent new erosions of Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search as directed in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo last week. Federal agents who have refused local law enforcement access to the scenes of shootings and administration officials who have shut down independent investigations of the deaths are also raising questions about legal safeguards over state power.

One critical political question in the coming days will be whether even those Americans who backed Trump’s hardline promises on border security will reject his imposition of ruthless federal power in deportations. It is possible that shocking incidents like Saturday’s — or the heartrending photos of the detention of a 5-year-old preschooler in Minnesota last week — will further erode his political foundation.

“President Trump closed the border, promised to get violent criminals out of our country,” Stitt told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”

“I think everybody agrees with that,” Stitt went on. “But now Americans are asking themselves, ‘What is the endgame? What is the solution?’ We believe in federalism and state rights. And nobody likes feds coming into their state.”

‘A wake-up call’

This specter of federal power descending from out of state — in a way that seems antithetical to America’s republican DNA — is concentrating many minds and raising the possibility that Minnesota’s plight could become a galvanizing force nationally.

A sense of a coming national moment of decision was reinforced by detailed written statements by two Democratic former presidents. In a statement Sunday, Bill Clinton said, “Over the course of a lifetime, we face only a few moments where the decision we make and the actions we take shape our history for years to come. This is one of them.” The 42nd president added: “It’s up to all of us who believe in the promise of American democracy to stand up, speak out and show that our nation still belongs to We the People.”

Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote Sunday that the killing of Pretti is “a heartbreaking tragedy. It should also be a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault.”

Trump’s base — which rallied to his tough immigration rhetoric in 2016 — would argue that lax border enforcement also infringed those values.

But the crackdown has become about more than immigration. Like the Pentagon’s killings of alleged drug traffickers in the Pacific and Caribbean and Trump’s bid to extort Greenland from Denmark, it’s a manifestation of a White House that increasingly embraces rogue tactics and spurns due process in the interest of demonstrating its own power.

Administration reaction to Pretti’s killing recalled the character assassination, victim-blaming and distortions of the aftermath of Good’s death. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a “would be assassin” on X. Border Patrol official Greg Bovino said the deceased man showed up to “massacre” federal agents. And Noem suggested that federal agents fired defensively at Pretti while fearing for their lives because he was armed.

In a charged political moment, it is nevertheless objectively true that these depictions are not supported on cellphone footage seen by millions of Americans. These instant artifacts of a new age when everything unfolds on social videos suggest federal agents escalated the situation with Pretti, who was filming their activity; forced him to the ground; and then fired multiple shots at him at point-blank range, apparently after he was disarmed.

On Sunday, officials continued to try to deny the visual record. “The victims are the Border Patrol agents,” Bovino told CNN’s Bash. He added, “The suspect put himself in that situation,” using a questionable description of Pretti, who did not appear to commit any crime.

Noem said, “We can’t have individuals that are impeding law enforcement operations and then showing up with guns and weapons and no ID and confronting law enforcement.” FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that “you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions.”

There is no evidence so far that Pretti, who had a permit to carry the gun and was not shown on any video brandishing a weapon, was doing anything other than exercising his First and Second Amendment rights.

In emotive confrontations between law enforcement and citizens, there’s always the possibility that not every angle or dimension is captured on camera. This is why investigations are so important in killings involving agents and officers. But Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Sunday that federal officials denied access to the scene of the Pretti’s killing to the state investigative agency that probes law enforcement shootings.

Top officials including Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche promised an investigation. But it’s set to be conducted by the DHS with the help of the FBI. So, as in the case of Good’s death, the government officials who have already prejudged the killings and denied visual evidence will oversee the findings. There can be little public confidence that they will not be politically tainted.

‘Not what’s happening’

Outsiders cannot say what was in the mind of the officers involved with Pretti. But the impunity immediately offered to those who killed Good seems unlikely to have introduced any sense of restraint among their colleagues. Logic suggests the administration’s direct support for these aggressive ICE and Border Patrol tactics only makes future tragedies more likely.

The open denial of events that millions of Americans can see unfold on video, meanwhile, seems to go beyond normal hardball politics. It’s beginning to look like a president who believes he enjoys unchecked power wanting to demonstrate he can reinvent the reality of a nation he leads.

“It should freak the American public out that the Trump administration lies this easily, will lie to your face, when you can see the evidence for yourself,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on “State of the Union.” “The fact of the matter is, Minneapolis is fundamentally less safe because ICE and CBP are there.”

Murphy also argued that the violent confrontations between Minnesotans and federal officers were a feature rather than an unwanted byproduct of Trump’s policies. “They are there to cause a conflict. They are there to create mayhem. And it isn’t going to be just isolated to Minneapolis,” he said.

The question now is whether Trump’s political underpinnings will break before his method of framing alternate narratives — with the help of a compliant conservative media machine.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2257495092.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-26 11:00:39.526231

A House resolution to launch impeachment proceedings against Noem has the support of more than 100 Democrats, but few Senate Democrats have so far weighed in.

“Kristi Noem has been an abject failure leading the Department of Homeland Security for the last year — and the abuses of power we’re seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Rosen said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Rosen said Noem’s conduct is “deeply shameful” and she “must be impeached and removed from office immediately.”

Impeachment proceedings are unlikely in the GOP-controlled Congress, but mounting Democratic outrage over the violence in the streets of Minneapolis is certain to disrupt Senate Republican leaders’ hopes this week to quickly approve a wide-ranging spending bill and avoid a partial government shutdown on Jan. 30.

And while some moderate Democrats have been wary over the last year of criticizing the Trump administration on border and immigration issues, the fatal shootings in Minneapolis of Alex Pretti on Saturday and Renee Good on Jan. 7 have transformed the debate, even among moderates like Rosen.

Noem defends fatal shooting

The senator’s call for impeachment followed Noem’s quick defense, without a full investigation, of the fatal shooting of Pretti by a Border Patrol agent. Videos of the scene reviewed by The Associated Press appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration that the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon, but he appears to be seen with only a phone in his hand in the videos.

During the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and opened fire with several shots, including into his back. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon.

Noem said Pretti showed up to “impede a law enforcement operation.”

“This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement,” Noem said Sunday.

In her call for Noem’s impeachment, Rosen cited other issues beyond the current ICE operations. She said Noem has also “violated the public trust by wasting millions in taxpayer dollars” on self promotion and cited reports that the Coast Guard purchased her two luxury jets worth $172 million.

Senate anger over ICE violence

Rosen’s statement follows that of Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who is one of the more left-leaning members of the Senate Democratic caucus. Markey said last week that Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against Noem, “who is right now actually orchestrating on the streets of our country this almost vigilantism on the part of ICE agents terrorizing cities all across the country.”

And while other senators stopped short of calling for Noem’s impeachment, several moderate Democrats who joined Rosen in voting to reopen the government last year said they would vote against Homeland Security funding this week even if it meant a government shutdown.

Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that DHS is “brutalizing U.S. citizens and law-abiding immigrants.” Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said that “we are not living in normal times.”

As administration officials immediately defended the shooting, several Republicans have called for a thorough investigation, including Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.

House Democrats increasingly back Noem’s impeachment

Calls for Noem’s impeachment also grew louder in the House as the Democratic caucus had a phone call with Minnesota’s Gov. Tim Walz and the state’s Attorney General Keith Ellison, both former congressmen, according to a person familiar with the private call who requested anonymity to discuss it.

Most of the House Democratic lawmakers who spoke during the meeting called for Noem’s impeachment, said another person familiar with the call who insisted on anonymity to discuss it.

New York Rep. Laura Gillen, a Democrat who was one of only seven House Democrats who voted to fund the Homeland Security Department last week, said Sunday that “there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately.”

“She is not focused on safety or border security; she’s focused on chaos and self-promotion, undermining local law enforcement and stoking violence as a result,” Gillen said in a post on X.
